In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 1 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE 11 March 2020 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Executive summary 1. In December 2019, Cabinet agreed to release an issues paper seeking feedback on proposed new purchase price allocation rules (DEV-19-MIN-0336 refers). Cabinet delegated authority to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make final policy decisions, to allow for decisions to be made in time to include the forecast revenue in Budget 2020. This report summarises the outcomes of consultation and seeks your approval to the final policy design of the purchase price allocation rules, to be achieved through legislative reforms. The problem definition 2. The purchase price allocation proposals are intended to address a tax issue that arises where a buyer and seller of business assets use different values for the assets sold. The value allocated to assets can reduce the amount of income tax paid by the parties to a transaction and the amount of revenue collected by the Government. Allowing parties to adopt different allocations is a risk to the integrity of the tax base. 3. The issues paper was released in December 2019 and outlined details of proposed purchase price allocation rules (T2019/3469, IR2019/554 refers). Broadly speaking, it proposed that parties be required to agree on consistent values for assets sold, and if they did not agree, the vendor would determine the value. 4. To ensure parties to transactions adopt consistent values, and to minimise the tax revenue currently lost due to inconsistent values, new rules are proposed. The proposed rules 5. The crux of the core proposal was that: • The buyer and seller would be required to use the same values for the assets sold. • If the parties agree on the values for the assets sold, both would have to file their tax returns using that allocation. • If the parties disagree, then the seller would have the power to determine the value of the assets sold. • If the seller does not do this within a specified timeframe, the buyer gets to choose the values of the assets. Submissions on the issues paper 6. There were twelve submissions from stakeholders, most of which agreed that parties to a transaction adopting different values was problematic, and that they In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 2 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE should be required to adopt consistent values. However, all submitters were against the proposal that the seller would have the power to determine the values if the parties do not agree, as this would allow the seller to have an unfair advantage during negotiations. Officials’ response to submitters’ concerns is outlined further in the report and the appendix. Recommended response to submissions: changes to the proposal 7. In response to this feedback, we recommend retaining the core proposal but making some significant design modifications that would address the concerns raised by submitters. The modifications we recommend are: • A requirement that the seller must allocate use a minimum of the tax book value for all taxable assets when they are sold (in effect imposing a “floor” of tax book value for certain property). This would minimise the potential advantage to the seller that submitters were concerned about, by denying the seller additional deductions and providing some protection to the buyer. • To reduce compliance costs, the rules would only apply to broad asset categories rather than to each individual asset. • Changing the de minimis so that these rules only apply to sales with depreciable or deductible assets greater than $100,000, or where the total sale price is greater than $1 million. This will reduce compliance costs by ensuring that fewer sales come within the scope of the new rules. • To provide more time for taxpayers to prepare, the new rules would apply from the earlier of three months after the date of enactment or 1 July 2021. 8. Officials consider the revised proposals strike an appropriate balance between competing considerations: minimising administrative and compliance costs, not interfering with the dynamics of commercial transactions, and ensuring the Government receives an appropriate amount of tax revenue. Fiscal implications and next steps 9. The proposals will raise tax revenue by an estimated $154 million over the current forecast period. This will be included in BEFU 2020 forecasts and will increase gross operating spending in Budget 2020. Note that this is less than the $210 million for ecast in the Cabinet paper, because of further refinements to the assumptions underlying the calculations. 10. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, the proposed new rules will be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020— 21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill scheduled to be introduced in April 2020. The Supplementary Order Paper would be released at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage in time for submissions to be made on the proposed rules. This will provide us with another opportunity to make further refinements to the rules if necessary. Recommended action 11.

This report seeks your approval to final policy design decisions of purchase price allocation rules and summarises stakeholder feedback and officials’ response. Background 13. In December 2019, Cabinet agreed to release an issues paper which sought feedback on proposed purchase price allocation rules (DEV-19-MIN-0336 refers). The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue were delegated the authority to make policy decisions to furtherance of the proposed changes. 14. When a bundle of assets with different tax treatments is sold (a ‘mixed supply’), the parties are required to allocate the global price between the various assets to determine their tax position. We refer to the parties as the vendor and the purchaser. The allocation determines the vendor’s tax liability from the sale, and the purchaser’s cost base for calculating depreciation and any taxable gains when it, in turn, sells the property. The most common mixed supplies are sales of commercial property and going concern businesses (not including share sales). 15. While many vendors and purchasers agree an allocation, many do not, as the parties have divergent incentives in minimising their tax liabilities. Investigations into large commercial property transactions have revealed that some vendors and purchasers have been making substantially different allocations between depreciable property, revenue account assets, and capital account assets, resulting in an overall reduction in tax paid. Anecdotal evidence points to similar inconsistencies in sales of going concern businesses. 16. It is generally accepted among the tax advisory community as well as officials that consistency of allocations is a desirable outcome, at least in large transactions. Officials have undertaken targeted consultation with a number of stakeholders on this issue over several years, and recently consulted on policy proposals via an officials’ issues paper. Problem definition 17. The current law requires parties to allocate market values to the assets. However, market value can be a range of possible values, and there is generally no legal requirement for the vendor and purchaser to use the same market values for tax purposes. This provides scope for both the vendor and purchaser to make allocations that are quite different, while justifying their values as being tethered to commercial prices. The ability for vendors and purchasers to adopt different allocations of a global price to different assets is undesirable because parties should adopt the same allocation for tax purposes (the Commissioner should not have to accept alternative facts), and not doing so constitutes a revenue integrity risk. 18. Given the current tax rules in this area, the incentive is for the vendor to allocate as little value as possible to depreciable property (such as building fit-out), and as much value as possible to non-taxable property (such as land). This helps the vendor minimise any repayment of the benefit of depreciation deductions (which is required when depreciable property is sold for more than its tax book value). The purchaser, however, is incentivised to maximise the value of any depreciable property and minimise the amount allocated to non-taxable property purchased, to maximise its depreciation deductions going forward. 19. It is resource intensive for Inland Revenue to investigate inconsistent allocations. Moreover, investigations can only deal with whether each party’s allocation reflects market values — since market value is a range, they cannot enforce consistency. Discrepancies identified in a sample of investigations into large commercial property In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 6 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE transactions amount to around $133 million. Some of these cases have been resolved, while others remain in dispute or cannot be dealt with due to resource constraints. Under current law, many of these discrepancies will be impossible to eliminate. Example A Co. has agreed to sell its assets to B Co. The assets include land and buildings (all non-depreciable), and fit- out and other depreciable property. The total purchase price is $90 million. A Co. will only be taxable on the portion of the sale price attributable to depreciable property (up to the original cost of the property), and not the portion attributable to the land and buildings. A Co. believes the appropriate allocation of the price is: Allocation A Co’s Cost A Co’s Profit A Co’s Tax Land and buildings $30m $20m $10m 0 (as a capital gain) Depreciable property $60m $60m 0 0 In contrast, B Co. believes $20 million more should be allocated to depreciable property, and $20 million less to land and buildings. That is, the land and buildings would be $10 million and the depreciable property $80 million. This would increase B Co’s tax deductions. If they both adopt their separate allocations, A Co. pays no tax and B Co. gets additional depreciation deductions of up to $20m (a tax benefit of $5.6m given a company tax rate of 28%) over time. Policy objective 20. The objective of the proposed reforms is to achieve a consistent allocation between both the vendor and the purchaser that reflects market values. Achieving this objective will improve revenue integrity, because parties will not be able to reduce their individual tax liabilities by allocating different values to the various assets in the transaction. 21. Vendors and purchasers will always take different views of the value of an asset; commercially, a vendor will not sell an item unless it thinks the item is worth less than the purchaser is willing to pay for it, and the purchaser will not buy the item unless it thinks the opposite. But the item is sold and bought for a single price, and that price is deemed to be the value of the item for both parties. Officials see no reason to disregard this principle where more than one asset is sold at a time. It is als o clear that the value ascribed to an asset should fall within the range of values the wider market would ascribe to it. 22. Officials recognise that the proposed new purchase price allocation rules may be seen as a burden to transacting parties. We believe that the proposals (along with the design modifications we are recommending in response to submissions received) strike the right balance between achieving better revenue integrity while also minimising any additional compliance/administration costs and interference in commercial dynamics. In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 7 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE Proposals 23. The core proposal we consulted on was that for transactions that involve mixed supplies: 1 • In all cases, the vendor and purchaser would be required to use the same allocation of the total purchase price to different types of property. • If the parties agree on an allocation, both would have to file their tax returns using that allocation. • If the parties do not agree on an allocation, then the purchaser would have to use the vendor’s allocation when filing its tax return, provided the vendor files its allocation with both Inland Revenue and the purchaser within a specified timeframe. • If the vendor does not file its allocation within the specified timeframe, the purchaser would be required to file its allocation with Inland Revenue and the vendor. Both parties would then be required to follow the purchaser’s allocation in their tax returns. • The parties would not be able to dispute an agreed allocation, or allocations filed in accordance with the above process. The Commissioner would be able to dispute an allocation only if it does not reflect market values. • A purchaser would not be entitled to a deduction for property acquired in a mixed supply until it has received or made an allocation pursuant to these requirements. 24. We recommend retaining the core proposal, but making some design modifications in response to stakeholder feedback. Stakeholder feedback 25. We received twelve submissions on the issues paper. These submissions were from Business NZ, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC, Bell Gully, the New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh, nsaTax, Chapman Tripp, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) and EY. 26. Almost all submissions on the issues paper supported the proposition that parties to a mixed supply should adopt the same price allocation. Several advisors noted that they always advise their clients to agree an allocation, as it is considered best practice from a tax perspective. 27. A few submitters disagreed with the central premise that parties should always be required to agree on the value ascribed to an asset, as parties could legitimately take different views of its value. 28. Nearly all submitters objected to the proposals set out in the issues paper for legislative reform. Many felt that legislative measures were unnecessary or overly burdensome, and that the policy objectives could instead be achieved operationally through better enforcement of the existing law and the publication of additional guidance for businesses on price allocations. 1 This is where a transaction involves a mixture of revenue account property (such as trading stock), depreciable property (such as plant or machinery), and capital account property (such as land or goodwill). In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 8 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE Vendor allocation provides vendor an unfair advantage 29. Of particular concern to all submitters was the proposal to allow the vendor to determine the allocation in the event the parties could not agree, because this would give too much power to the vendor and thus disturb commercial dynamics. For example, vendors might force purchasers to accept unreasonable allocations. Some were concerned about how the rules would work in the context of auctions and tenders, where the price might be agreed without prior negotiation between the parties. 30. Submitters did not explain how it is that the existing provisions dealing with trading stock, which also require the purchaser to follow the vendor’s allocation, are not already causing difficulties. Alternative approach suggested: Commissioner’s allocation 31. Three submitters proposed that the Commissioner should be responsible for determining the allocation where parties cannot agree. If the Commissioner does not determine an allocation, then the inconsistency should stand. Five submitters were in favour of some version of the alternative approach proposed in the issues paper, that depreciable property should be treated as sold for tax book value if the parties do not agree an allocation. Some suggested that this kind of approach also apply to other forms of revenue account property. One submitter suggested the purchaser would be a more appropriate person to make a non-agreed allocation. Other concerns 32. Five submitters suggested that the proposals be limited to transactions involving commercial property, since these are the transactions that in practice seem to be most problematic. 33. Six submitters felt that the parties should be able to make allocations at an asset category level, rather than being required to make the allocation at a more granular, detailed level. The more detailed an allocation, the greater the compliance burden on taxpayers. 34. Eight submitters felt that the proposed de minimis ($50,000 of depreciable property) was too low, and suggested various alternative figures, ranging up to a $5 million transaction value. Two submitters suggested an additional de minimis for depreciable assets worth less than $10,000, under which the parties could allocate tax book value and be immune to challenge by the Commissioner. This was suggested to reduce compliance costs and provider greater certainty to taxpayers. 35. A more detailed summary of submissions received, and officials’ responses to them, is provided in the appendix. Recommended response to stakeholder feedback 36. Officials recommend that the core proposal proceeds (refer to paragraph 24 above), with some design modifications to address many of the practical concerns expressed by submitters. Vendor allocation should not affect commercial dynamics 37. The most significant submission regarding the design of the proposal that officials disagree with is that the power to ensure the parties adopt consistent allocations should not be given to the vendor. In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 9 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE 38. Officials do not agree that giving this power to the vendor will be problematic from a commercial perspective, especially with the design modifications we recommend be made in response to submissions. 39. An allocation will generally be agreed as part of the negotiation process. Even if the purchaser thinks the vendor’s proposed allocation is unfavourable to it, the variance will often not be material to the price. If it is, the purchaser can factor that into its offer. This is not different from any other commercial issue in a sale and purchase negotiation. 40. If the purchaser does not turn its mind to the allocation before agreeing a price, that suggests that the allocation is not a material issue for it. 41. In auction or tender situations (usually relating to commercial property), vendors will be incentivised to provide information that will ensure the highest bid. If purchase price allocation is important, advance guidance as to the allocation to commercial fit-out should be able to be provided. 42. Our proposal to adopt the preference of a number of submitters to require a vendor to allocate at least tax book value to depreciable property (and possibly other taxable assets) will provide significant protection for purchasers against unreasonably low vendor allocations. This will reduce some of the advantage the vendor might have in being able to make an allocation should the parties be unable to agree on one during or after negotiations. 43. The existing provisions requiring purchasers to adopt vendor allocations to trading stock do not seem to be causing any problems. In addition, there are existing provisions (for example, those that relate to non-depreciable improvements to land) that require assets to be transferred at the vendor’s tax book value. Anecdotal evidence from the private sector and Inland Revenue officials indicates that these provisions have not been problematic, and have successfully been applied in practice. Commissioner allocation a viable alternative but not recommended 44. Officials agree that requiring parties to file their inconsistent allocations, and then giving the Commissioner the power to choose between them, is possible in principle. However, it raises a number of concerns. • It would place a burden on the Commissioner which she is not resourced to undertake. Choosing between rival valuations would either have to be done on an arbitrary basis or would require the acquisition of skilled resource. • It would be less effective than vendor allocation in achieving consistency, since consistency would require intervention by the Commissioner on a timely basis. • It would lead to more uncertainty than vendor allocation, since the time period the Commissioner would have within which to make an allocation would necessarily be a longer one than the vendor would have. • It would be more likely to lead to disputes with the Commissioner, which can be expensive and time consuming. Disputes in this area are particularly difficult, because a decision in favour of one party usually has a negative effect on the other. For example, if a purchaser successfully challenges an allocation to depreciable property as being too low, consistency requires that the vendor adjusts its return also, generally with the result that more tax is payable by it. For this reason, it would be necessary to develop a process whereby both parties are engaged in any dispute, and information provided by one of them can be shared with the other. Current dispute rules would In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 10 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE need to be modified, which would involve cost and further uncertainty regarding the operation of those rules. Scope should not be limited to commercial property 45. Officials do not agree that the proposals should be limited to commercial property at this stage. Issues have arisen in the past in relation to other forms of depreciable property, and financial arrangements, which would continue to be unresolved if the proposal were limited as submitters suggest. Recommended design modifications 46. Officials believe that the following design modifications substantially address the concerns submitters had with allowing the vendor to make an allocation where the parties do not agree, without weakening the effectiveness of the proposals. Minimum of tax book value for vendor allocation 47. To address concerns raised by submitters regarding the vendor having an unfair advantage, we recommend adding in a new requirement where the parties have failed to come to an agreement and the vendor files an allocation. 48. Where the vendor makes an allocation, it will be required to make an allocation reflecting market value of the assets sold, subject to a requirement to allocate at least tax book value to depreciable property and financial arrangements, and possibly other categories of revenue account or amortisable assets. Significant modifications to the de minimis 49. The proposals include a de minimis, below which the new purchase price allocation rules would not apply. In the issues paper, we proposed that the de minimis would apply where the total amount allocated to deductible or depreciable items by the purchaser was less than $50,000. 50. In response to submissions that the de minimis should be based on a higher value, or based on the total value of the transaction, we recommend making significant modifications to the de minimis (although these modifications are not to the level requested by all submitters). 51. We recommend that taxpayers be able to satisfy the de minimis (so that the new rules do not apply) if: • The total transaction value (including assumed liabilities) is less than $1 million; or • The total amount the purchaser has allocated to deductible or depreciable items is less than $100,000. 52. In addition, we recommend another de minimis that applies to disputes, which would prevent the Commissioner challenging allocations made to certain low value depreciable property. This de minimis would apply where individual assets are valued at less than $10,000, the amount allocated is a value between the vendor’s tax book value and original cost, and (if there are multiple identical assets) the total value of the assets is no more than $1 million. In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 11 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE Allowing allocations to be made at a less granular/detailed level 53. In response to submissions, we recommend significantly reducing the level of detail required for an allocation. Instead of having to allocate amounts at an individual asset level, we recommend amending the proposals so that allocations can be made at a more global, asset category level. 54. This means an allocation would have to identify the amount allocated to trading stock, buildings, other depreciable property, and financial arrangements (there may be other less common categories of assets also requiring separate identification). Parties would be free to make a more detailed allocation if they wished to do so, but would not be required to. Delaying the effective date of the new rules 55. In response to submissions, we recommend the new purchase price allocation rules apply to transactions pursuant to binding agreements entered into more than three months after the rules are enacted. Provided the legislation containing these reforms is enacted by 31 March 2021 (which is what we are expecting), these proposals should apply from around 1 July 2020. This slightly deferred application date will provide businesses and advisors with more time to familiarise themselves with the new rules, and make changes to standard forms and practices as required. Risks 56. As suggested by submitters, there is a risk that the legislative reforms proposed might disrupt commercial negotiations more than officials anticipate. It is not certain how vendors and purchasers will behave in the face of stricter tax rules around purchase price allocation (though it should be noted that the proposal is already law in relation to trading stock sold in a sale of a business). Officials expect that the design modifications, such as the new tax book value floor and the more generous de minimis, that we are recommending be made in response to submissions should significantly reduce this risk. Officials recommend the rules be reviewed in 2024 to assess whether they have achieved the objective without having a disproportionate effect on market behaviour. Financial implications 57. The proposed purchase price allocation rules are estimated to increase tax revenue by $154 million over the current forecast period. Tax revenue will increase in the outyears and is expected to increase tax revenue by $100 million per annum once it is in full effect (expected in 2028/29). The fiscal impact can be shown in the table below, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $m – increase/(decrease) Minister for Revenue Vote Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - - 23.000 58.000 73.000 Total operating - - 23.000 58.000 73.000 58. The fiscal estimate is based on administrative data showing allocation discrepancies that were identified during investigations over recent years and applying assumptions to the rate of annual turnover of commercial property and other In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 12 of 12 IN CONFIDENCE tangible depreciable property. No account was taken of the effect of the proposals on depreciable intangible property or financial arrangements. 59. If the proposal is agreed to before Budget moratorium begins (30 March), the fiscal impact above will be included in BEFU 2020 and can be used to increase gross spending at Budget 2020. Administrative implications 60. Even with legislative rules to require consistency of allocations, the Commissioner will still need to be prepared to challenge an allocation if it does not reflect relative market values. This is already the case under the status quo, but will become more important if revenue loss is to be minimised. 61. Where the parties have not agreed an allocation, the vendor will be required to make its own allocation and notify both the purchaser and the Commissioner of it. This will give the Commissioner an opportunity to dispute the allocation if she wishes to. 62. The suggested de minimis is intended to exclude transactions in which any revenue at stake would be too small for the Commissioner to pursue. However, it will still be necessary for the Commissioner to monitor compliance with the new rules. Legislative mechanism and application date 63. Officials recommend that the amendments proposed in this report be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill by way of a Supplementary Order Paper. We also recommend that the amendments, if adopted, take effect from the earlier of three months from the date of enactment of the Bill or 1 July 2020. Next steps 64. If you agree to the recommended proposals before 30 March 2020, the forecasted revenue increase will be included in Budget 2020. 65. The proposals could be introduced by way of a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill. We expect to report to Ministers with a draft Cabinet paper in May. In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 1 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix – Analysis of submissions 66. An issues paper setting out the proposals was published in December 2019. Submissions on the paper were received from Business NZ, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC, Bell Gully, the New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh, nsaTax, Chapman Tripp, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) and EY. 67. Below is a summary of the main submission points (some are italicised), and officials’ responses to them. No need for legislative reform 68. The revenue at stake does not justify the intrusive nature of the reform. Officials do not consider the proposals to be intrusive. They apply a similar rule to depreciable property and financial arrangements as currently applies to trading stock. The proposed rules have been designed to be as unintrusive as possible, while achieving the objective of preventing an unjustifiable loss of revenue. An allocation has to be made for tax purposes in any event. The only issue with the proposals is whether it is unduly burdensome to legislate rules requiring the parties to adopt consistent allocations, rather than leaving it to them to arrive at their allocations independently. Officials do not believe that it is, especially if the allocation is to broad asset classes, not individual items, and has a sensible de minimis. 69. Issues can be dealt with by better enforcement of the law. The revenue loss caused by inconsistent allocations cannot be dealt with solely by better enforcement of the existing law. Experience over decades has shown difficulties in obtaining adequately robust valuation advice to challenge even larger inconsistencies. In smaller cases, the cost and effort of obtaining valuations and challenging allocations makes it uneconomic and well beyond the resources available to the Department. Officials note that a statement has already been published stating that allocation discrepancies will increase the risk of scrutiny. Anecdotally, this has not had an effect in significant parts of the market. More importantly, without legislative change, the Department is not able to require consistency — market value is a range, and so long as there is no consistency requirement, allocations can differ and still be entirely within the law. 70. Market values are inherently uncertain and within a range, not a single figure. Perceptions of value always differ – an item will only be sold if the buyer is prepared to pay more for it than it is worth to the seller. Nevertheless, in a single asset transaction, there is only one price. Achieving the same “one price” outcome in a mixed transaction is precisely the reason why this reform is required — if parties are allowed to allocate a global price using their own perceptions of value, the tax system will suffer a loss which cannot be justified. Level of allocation too detailed 71. In larger transactions, it may take an unduly long time for parties to agree on an allocation to all assets sold, such that otherwise efficient transactions might not take place. Officials accept that allocation of the purchase price down to the level of individual assets may be unduly time consuming in some cases. Officials are of the view that this would rarely be a problem in practice, as parties would develop business practices to deal with it. However, in response to submissions, we propose that it would be acceptable for the parties to reach agreement at the level of asset In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 2 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE categories — trading stock, depreciable property, financial arrangements, and so on. Proposal favours the vendor 72. Giving the vendor the power to determine the allocation if there is no agreement will unduly favour vendors. Officials do not agree that giving the power to make the allocation to the vendor if there is no agreement is problematic. If the purchaser seeks an agreed allocation before committing to the transaction, it will be in the vendor’s interest to propose an allocation, to maximise its after-tax return. If the vendor does not provide an allocation, the purchaser can either discount its price for uncertainty, or refuse to go ahead with the transaction. Once the purchaser knows what the proposed allocation is, it can adjust its price accordingly, if the allocation is not what it was expecting. If the purchaser does not seek an agreed allocation before committing to the transaction, it is true that it has missed the opportunity to take the allocation into account in setting the price. Once the reform is in place, officials believe this is unlikely to happen in transactions of any size, as the purchaser will be properly advised, and purchase price allocation will be just one of many matters that advisors will ensure are dealt with in the process of negotiation. Even if it does happen, officials have modified the proposal so that in cases where there is no agreement, the vendor must allocate such amount to taxable assets as ensures that it does not make a loss on their sale. For example, depreciable assets bought for $100 and with a tax depreciated value of $30 must be treated as sold for at least $30. This is typically the treatment vendors already adopt. Vendors will also remain subject to the possibility of the Commissioner challenging an unreasonable allocation. Limit reform to commercial property 73. Several submitters suggested that limiting the reform to commercial property would be comparatively simple to implement and avoid a wide range of issues which would otherwise arise. Officials observe that significant discrepancies have also arisen in business sale transactions, and there does not seem to be any basis for drawing the proposed distinction. Use vendor’s tax book value as default allocation for depreciable property 74. Several submitters supported allocating the vendor’s tax book value to depreciable property in cases of no agreement, rather than allowing the vendor to determine the tax book value. This was an option on which officials sought feedback in the issues paper. The benefit of it is that it would put a limit on the extent to which the vendor could undervalue depreciable property. 75. On reflection, officials agree with these submitters that a tax book floor option should be adopted. This would mean that a vendor would have to allocate a minimum of tax book value to depreciable property, but could allocate more if it considered the value to be higher. Of course, it would not normally be incentivised to do so. 76. For practicality reasons, vendors usually use tax book value to make a market value-based allocation to depreciable property. It is a readily available value, and means there is no depreciation clawback (though there is no loss on disposal either). However, if the market value is clearly different from the tax book value, the Commissioner must reserve the right to challenge the allocation. Officials note that where the value of the depreciable property is relatively low, the Commissioner is very unlikely to challenge an allocation of tax book value. In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 3 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE Agreement with proposals where parties have agreed an allocation 77. Submitters generally agreed with the proposal that where parties have agreed to an allocation, that allocation must be used by the parties when they file their returns. This support is welcome. Rules create a bias in favour of revenue account vendors and purchasers 78. Officials proposed that the rules would not apply to transactions involving revenue account vendors or purchasers, since these parties are indifferent to the allocation of the purchase price. 79. CTG submitted that this would add additional uncertainty and complexity to the rules as well as creating a bias towards these purchasers in a competitive bid process. 80. Officials agree that drawing the proposed distinction would create complexity and uncertainty. A party to a transaction will not know for certain whether its counterparty is transacting on revenue account. Although there is no benefit to applying the proposed rules to revenue account parties per se (because they are indifferent to the allocation): • There also seems to be no harm in doing so. • Doing so would avoid the need to make a distinction. 81. Officials do not agree that the rules would necessarily create a bias towards revenue account purchasers in a competitive bid process. For example, such purchasers are already at a disadvantage compared to a capital account purchaser, since they are taxable on all profits from sale of the transacted property. Proposal advantages foreign bidders 82. Foreign bidders will often acquire New Zealand assets through a New Zealand branch or subsidiary, in which case the proposed rules will determine their New Zealand tax treatment, just as they will for a New Zealand-owned acquirer. In a minority of cases, the cost of the assets may also be deductible or depreciable to a purchaser in another country. Some submitters argued that if the purchaser were entitled to a greater cost base in that country, then it would enjoy a tax benefit over other purchasers. 83. Officials do not think this submission is an obstacle to the proposal. The New Zealand tax system does not have any objective of trying to equalise the treatment of New Zealand and foreign purchasers in such a case, and it would be futile to attempt to do so. The proposal will lead to difficulties in auctions and tenders 84. Some submitters said that the proposal would make it difficult for purchasers to know their tax position when bidding in auctions or tenders. 85. Vendors in a mixed supply who are selling by way of auction or tender will have an interest in providing as much information to bidders regarding the allocation as possible, where the allocation has a material impact on the price. It is difficult to predict exactly how this will be achieved, but a number of mechanisms can be envisaged, and this does not seem to be an obstacle to the reform. Officials note the statement on page five of the Corporate Taxpayers Group submission that in commercial property auctions issues can be managed to ensure fair outcomes. Taxpayer allocations should only be challenged where there is clear evidence they are not at market value In Confidence IR2020/094; T2020 /351: Purchase price allocation: Consultation and recommendations for legislative reform Page 4 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE 86. Given her limited resources, the Commissioner does not challenge transactions that are within an arm’s length range. Absent clear evidence that an allocation is outside that range, it will not be challenged. If an allocation has been based on the application of an acceptable market value method, there is no basis for the Commissioner refusing to accept it — the legislation is not prescriptive about how market value should be determined. If the Commissioner forms the view that an allocation is outside a market value range, there is no case for an additional requirement that the reason for the allocation is fraud, sham or avoidance. De minimis 87. The issues paper proposed that the consistency requirement would not apply where the purchaser allocated less than $50,000 to deductible or depreciable items. Submitters generally said this was too low, and suggested de minimises ranging from $100,000 of depreciable/deductible assets to a $5 million total purchase price (suggested by a number of submitters). 88. Submitters also suggested that if the de minimis is based on the value of depreciable property, buildings should be excluded, since they depreciate at a rate of zero per cent. Officials agree that this would be the only logical approach. 89. Officials consider that the de minimis should be set at a total purchase price of $1 million or a total allocation to depreciable or deductible assets of $100,000, excluding buildings. Officials also recommend a de minimis for low-value depreciable assets. This de minimis would apply where individual assets are valued at less than $10,000, the amount allocated is a value between the vendor’s tax book value and original cost, and (if there are multiple identical assets) the total value of the assets is no more than $1 million. In these cases, the Commissioner would have no right to challenge the allocation.

Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 1 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Supplementary Analysis Report (SAR), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. T he purpose of this report is to explain the policy rationale and development behind the “purchase price allocation” proposal contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, as a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was not required for the proposal. It is a modified version of the approach set out in an officials’ issues paper – Purchase price allocation – which was released for public consultation in December 2019 with Cabinet’s approval. T he issues paper functioned as an interim RIA when it was considered by Cabinet and a final RIA was not required as policy decisions were made by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue under delegated authority from Cabinet. Therefore, this SAR has been produced to improve transparency and understanding of the policy as the amendments go through the legislative process. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis A limitation on the analysis is the absence of precedent for the proposed approach in foreign jurisdictions. However, t here is one instance of the approach in current New Zealand statute, and it appears to have worked without problem for many decades. Officials are confident that the approach will achieve the desired outcome, acknowledging that aside from the aforementioned instance, it is untried and therefore less certain.

Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 2 To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Purchase Price Allocation Supplementary Analysis Report prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Supplementary Analysis Report meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of this draft have been incorporated into the final version. Although this SAR will not be presented to Cabinet it has still been reviewed consistent with the quality assurance framework. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? When business assets are bought or sold, they may be subject to different tax treatments. Some assets, such as land or goodwill 1 , are generally held on capital account and are not taxable or deductible. Other assets, such as trading stock 2 and financial arrangements 3 , are held on revenue account and are both taxable and immediately deductible. Still other assets – capital assets that are expected to decline in value over time (‘depreciable property’) – are only deductible over a number of years, in line with their estimated useful lives (if the asset is sold for more than its depreciated value, the excess deductions are clawed back as taxable income). Parties to a sale of two or more assets with different tax treatments (a ‘mixed supply’) are required to allocate the total sale/purchase price between the various assets for tax purposes. The allocation determines the vendor’s tax liability from the sale, and the purchaser’s cost base for claiming deductions in the future. To correctly account for the business going forward, the owner must maintain a schedule for any depreciable assets – which have different depreciation rates – and a register of all the other assets, some of which may be bought or sold separately. The policy problem is that currently, vendors and purchasers are able to adopt different price allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities, resulting in an overall loss to the revenue base. Moreover, in a small number of cases, parties have been found to adopt different allocations in their tax returns despite having agreed an allocation during the sale process. The problem stems from the existing legal framework governing purchase price allocation. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, parties are generally required to ascribe market values to the assets transferred. But market value is a range rather than a single value and the parties are not required to use the same market values, other than for trading stock (the specific instance alluded to earlier where a rule akin to the proposed approach – discussed in the next section – is already used). There is also some doubt about how the law applies to a purchaser of depreciable property. Consequently, the vendor can allocate lower amounts to depreciable property and financial arrangements, which are taxable, and higher amounts to non-taxable capital assets, to reduce its tax liability, while the purchaser can allocate higher amounts to depreciable property and financial arrangements in order to maximise its deductions over time. Since the law does not require consistency, it is difficult for the Commissioner to challenge different allocations that are both based on market values, despite the result being a loss to the tax base. Investigations undertaken by Inland Revenue into a number of large commercial property transactions have revealed discrepancies between vendor and purchaser allocations resulting in overall revenue losses in the millions of dollars. Given the cost and uncertainty of disputes, these losses are often unable to be eliminated. If the status quo continues, such outcomes are likely to recur. 1 Any excess of the total sale price above the aggregate value of all the assets being sold, attributable to the established reputation of the business. 2 Items bought and sold regularly in the course of a business, such as books in a bookstore. 3 Arrangements under which a person receives money in exchange for providing money at a future time, such as loans. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 4 Officials do not consider these discrepancies to be justifiable. In a normal commercial transaction, the vendor and purchaser will take different views of the value of an asset. The vendor will not sell the asset unless it thinks the asset is worth less than the purchaser is willing to pay for it, and the purchaser will not buy the asset unless it thinks the opposite. But the asset is sold and bought for a single price, and that price is the amount taken into account in the tax returns for both parties. There is no obvious reason to depart from this “single price” principle where multiple assets are sold together. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The purchase price allocation amendments affect vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies – particularly those that do not agree an allocation under current law. Compliant parties to a sale are generally not opposed to alignment between sale and purchase prices but often do not support structured rules that increase compliance costs. 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? The policy objective is to prevent revenue loss arising in mixed supplies – i.e. promote “revenue integrity” – while keeping any additional compliance and administration costs and disruption to natural commercial dynamics as small as possible. Since the only way to prevent revenue loss is for the vendor and purchaser to use the same purchase price allocation, the objective of revenue integrity can also be represented as “consistency”. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? • Option 1 – Status quo • Option 2 – Party allocation (vendor first) • Option 3 – Commissioner allocation • Option 4 – Operational approach Options 2 and 3 are the main legislative approaches considered by officials, and relate to how an allocation is made if the vendor and purchaser do not reach an agreement between themselves. Officials have always considered that if the parties agree an allocation, they should not be able to adopt separate, more favourable allocations in their tax returns. Officials have also been of the view that the allocation should always be based on relative market values (market values proportionate to the total purchase price) – in line with the current law – and that the Commissioner should be able to challenge an allocation that she considers is not so based. Other elements that did not differ between options 2 and 3 during policy development were: • Granularity of allocation: parties should not be required to agree an allocation to every individual asset, but rather asset categories with unique tax treatments – e.g. depreciable property, buildings, land, revenue account property etc. While this may leave some scope for arbitrage between different write- down rates for depreciable property, for example, the compliance cost of working out and agreeing a value for every single asset might be unrealistic for many taxpayers. • Notification of allocation: parties should be required to notify the Commissioner if they have not agreed an allocation. • De minimis: transactions falling below certain value thresholds should not be subject to the consistency requirement for purchase price allocation, as the scope for tax manipulation is not great enough to present a material risk to the revenue base. The thresholds should be a total purchase price of $1 million, or an allocation to taxable property by the purchaser of $100,000. Option 4 is the operational approach generally favoured by stakeholders. The criteria against which the options were assessed are: - Compliance costs: compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised. - Administration costs: administration costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised. - Neutrality: the tax rules should not distort economic outcomes by incentivising business behaviours that do not make commercial sense, and are only adopted for tax reasons. They should not advantage one party over another. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 6 Option 1 – Status quo Vendors and purchasers can continue either to agree an allocation or to make their own separate allocations. The Commissioner can challenge allocations that she considers are not at market, but cannot require parties to adopt the same allocation. Revenue would continue to be lost where vendors and purchasers adopt separate allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities. Pros Parties would not have to change their behaviour, therefore compliance costs would be low. Cons There would likely be an ongoing substantial loss of revenue, meaning the objective of revenue integrity/consistency would not be achieved. Inland Revenue would continue to incur the administration costs associated with identifying inconsistent allocations through audit, and attempting to resolve inconsistencies without a legal basis to require resolution. Moreover, the status quo is not economically neutral, because parties adopting different allocations are relying on an effective subsidy from the revenue base to support their commercial transaction, when the transaction should stand on its own. Option 2 – Party allocation (vendor first) If the vendor and purchaser do not agree an allocation, they must step through a short sequence of rules that allow one of the parties to determine the allocation. For two months after transfer of the property, the vendor is required to determine the allocation, and must notify the purchaser and the Commissioner of it. However, the vendor cannot allocate amounts to taxable property that result in an additional loss on the sale of that property (other than for part year depreciation). 4 If the vendor fails to notify an allocation within the two-month window, the purchaser must determine the allocation, and notify the vendor and Commissioner of it. Whether the vendor or the purchaser determines the allocation, both parties must follow it in their tax returns. The allocation must be at market, and the Commissioner can challenge the allocation if she considers that it is not. If neither party notifies an allocation, the vendor is treated as disposing of the assets for market value, and the purchaser is treated as acquiring the assets for nil consideration. The effect of this is that the purchaser is unable to claim any deductions in relation to the property until it has made an allocation. This incentivises the purchaser to make and notify an allocation, which is key to achieving consistency. 4 The vendor will not be able to satisfy this rule if the total purchase price is lower than the vendor’s aggregate carrying cost of the taxable property . In this case, therefore, the minimum allocation to taxable property will be its carrying value reduced (pro rata) in proportion to the difference between the aggregate carrying cost of the taxable property and the purchase price. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 7 Pros This option achieves the objective of revenue integrity/consistency by driving parties towards using a single allocation. It has low administration costs, as it is the parties who must allocate, not the Commissioner. Importantly, the parties will have much better knowledge of the transaction and the assets in it than the Commissioner, and are therefore better placed to make the allocation. Cons This option appears less neutral between the vendor and purchaser, as it allows the vendor to determine the allocation in the first instance. This may be perceived as unfair by some purchasers, or may be an additional source of tension in the negotiations, which could mean increased compliance costs. However, as the purchaser will be aware of the rule when negotiating the sale, an unfavourable or undisclosed vendor allocation could be answered by a reduced purchase price. Moreover, the vendor is constrained by not being able to allocate amounts to taxable property that would result in an additional loss. Option 3 – Commissioner allocation If the vendor and purchaser do not agree an allocation, they must request an allocation from the Commissioner. The Commissioner may choose the vendor’s allocation, the purchaser’s allocation, or any other allocation within a market value range. Both parties must then follow that allocation in their tax returns. The Commissioner’s allocation cannot be challenged. The Commissioner may or may not decide to seek an external valuation to determine the allocation. Pros This option ensures revenue integrity/consistency by driving parties towards using a single allocation. It has low compliance costs, because if the parties cannot agree, it is the Commissioner who determines the allocation. The uncertainty of what the Commissioner will decide to allocate also provides a strong incentive for both parties to reach an agreement between themselves. Since neither party is given the opportunity to allocate before the other, this option is relatively neutral in its impact on the commercial dynamic. Cons The administration costs of this option could be high. The Commissioner has to dedicate resources to making an allocation every time parties fail to agree one. To avoid costly disputes, the Commissioner’s allocation has to be unchallengeable, but this is likely to be seen as unfair by aggrieved parties – particularly if the Commissioner’s position is not supported by an independent valuation. This might lead to attempts to chall enge an allocation regardless of any legal provisions, for example through judicial review. Option 4 – Operational approach The vendor and purchaser can continue either to agree an allocation or to make their own separate allocations. In the latter case, the parties are required to notify the Commissioner that they have not agreed, and to provide both the Commissioner and the other party with Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 8 copies of their respective allocations. Penalties will apply to parties who are found not to have complied with this requirement. If the Commissioner takes issue with one or both of the parties’ allocations, she can enter into a dispute with both parties simultaneously, leveraging the associated costs as an incentive for the parties to agree an allocation. The Commissioner will issue clear guidance to the effect that vendors and purchasers should agree a purchase price allocation or risk a dispute with the Commissioner. She will also clarify the existing legislative provisions governing allocations. There will be no other changes to the legislation. Pros This approach may be seen as more subtle and targeted at the concern area – a relatively small number of large transactions where there is deliberate and substantial tax planning. It may seem fairer to vendors and purchasers than enforced legislative rules, and more neutral on transactions. Cons The Commissioner cannot require the desired outcome of consistency, because there is no legal basis for her to do so. Parties may be deterred by the costs of dispute, but they may not, and then an operational approach is ineffective at resolving the revenue risk. The Commissioner has failed to achieve consistency in a number of real disputes, and it is unlikely that this would change simply through administrative guidance. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 2. Officials consider that it is the best option on balance, for the reasons outlined below. Legal foundation Option 2 provides a strong legal requirement for consistency, which does not currently exist. This enables the Commissioner to mandate consistency, not merely expect it. While the operational approach (option 4) may be seen as less intrusive, it is also likely not to lead to the desired outcome in some cases. Expertise Where the parties do not agree an allocation, it is better to keep the responsibility to allocate with the parties rather than transfer it to the Commissioner, because the parties are directly engaged in the transaction and have a much better understanding of the assets being sold, and their value. The Commissioner is detached from the transaction, has no particular valuation expertise, and is largely indifferent to what allocation is chosen provided it is a single allocation and is tethered to market values. An allocation determined by the Commissioner will be seen as at least as arbitrary – if not more arbitrary – than an allocation chosen by the vendor or the purchaser, and to avoid the possibility of costly disputes that would ultimately have to be funded by the Government, the Commissioner’s Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 9 determination has to be unchallengeable. Stakeholder feedback has indicated that this would not be popular. Neutrality The main criticism of the proposed approach is that it favours the vendor, since, if the parties do not agree an allocation before filing their returns, the vendor is given the power to determine it first. Thus, the vendor is not incentivised to agree an allocation, and the rules disrupt the neutrality of the commercial dynamic. However, officials consider that this concern is overstated for the reasons outlined below. In the first place, if the allocation is important to the purchaser, the purchaser can insist on agreeing the allocation with the vendor as a condition of the deal. If the vendor is not prepared to agree the allocation, the purchaser may either refuse to go ahead with the transaction, or lower its price. These strategies operate as a counterbala nce to the vendor’s perceived advantage. Even if the vendor gets the opportunity to determine the allocation, it is constrained by not being able to allocate amounts to taxable property that result in an additional loss. This means that the purchaser’s cost basis for claiming deductions in the future cannot be lower than the vendor’s basis would have been had the transaction not occurred. It also means that if the vendor considers the value of taxable property to be lower than its current carrying value, it is incentivised to agree an allocation with the purchaser to avoid paying more tax on the transaction than it thinks is appropriate. Thus, the ability for the vendor to determine the allocation is only advantageous if it thinks the taxable property is worth more than its carrying value. Probabilistically, it seems reasonable to assume this might only be the case half of the time. Finally, the Commissioner can challenge an allocation that she considers is not based on market values. If the amounts allocated by the vendor to taxable property are unjustifiably low (even taking into account the aforementioned constraint), and the transaction is sufficiently large, the Commissioner may intervene and substitute an allocation that is more favourable to the purchaser. Awareness of the rules Another related concern with the proposed approach is that parties may not turn their minds to the tax implications of the transaction until after the sale and purchase is completed, and then the vendor has the power to allocate. This may occur in multiple bid scenarios, or where parties are distressed. If parties neglect to consider tax until filing their returns, then the result will be either that the purchaser must settle for the vendor’s market values or the vendor for the purchaser’s, if more than two months have elapsed since the property was transferred. However, officials consider that this is unlikely to occur if the parties are well advised and the rules are signalled so that taxpayers and advisors are aware of them. Officials anticipate that taxpayers will adapt sale and purchase practices to ensure there is sufficient time for an allocation to be agreed before the transaction is completed. Moreover, for the reasons given in the previous section, officials do not think purchasers will be significantly disadvantaged by a vendor-determined allocation.

Other parties Total Monetised Benefit Estimated $154 million over forecast period Non-monetised benefits Medium Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 11 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Some sale and purchase transactions may take longer as a result of a single allocation having to be used. This may place more pressure on some purchasers in multi-bid deals where there is competition with foreign purchasers that are not subject to the consistency rule. Officials note, however, that purchasers from different jurisdictions may be on an unequal footing already for a variety of reasons that are unrelated to purchase price allocation. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Officials engaged in targeted consultation with the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG), Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and Russell McVeagh, and an official’s issues paper – Purchase price allocation – was released for public consultation in December 2019. Submissions on the issues paper were received from the above stakeholders as well as Business NZ, Bell Gully, the New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax, Chapman Tripp, and EY. Almost all stakeholders support the proposition that parties to a mixed supply should adopt the same purchase price allocation. A number of advisors have noted that they always advise their clients to agree an alloc ation, as it is considered best practice from a tax perspective. However, clients do not always follow this advice. A few stakeholders disagree with the central premise that parties should always be required to agree on the value ascribed to an asset, as parties could legitimately take different views of its value (officials acknowledge this reality but do not think it is a valid reason to treat the asset as being sold for two different values for tax purposes). Nearly all stakeholders disagreed with the proposals set out in the issues paper for legislative reform. Many felt that legislative measures were unnecessary or overly burdensome, and that the policy objectives could instead be achieved operationally through better enforcement of the existing law and the publication of additional guidance for businesses on price allocations. The strongest concern expressed by most stakeholders was that the approach set out in the issues paper gave too much power to the vendor, by allowing the vendor to determine the allocation if the parties could not reach agreement. Stakeholders were not convinced that the purchaser would always have the negotiating power to insist that the vendor agree an allocation with it, or that the parties would always turn their minds to tax during the negotiation, and once the transaction was completed, the purchaser would have no recourse. In response to these concerns, officials made a significant modification to the proposal: the vendor cannot allocate amounts to taxable property (depreciable property, revenue Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 12 account property, financial arrangements) that result in an additional loss on that property. Therefore, the vendor cannot, for example, allocate to an item of depreciable property an amount that is less than its adjusted tax value. This constraint protects the purchaser from an unreasonably low vendor allocation that may not be challenged by the Commissioner. It also means that the purchaser cannot end up with a lower cost basis for deductions than the vendor would have had if the transaction had not occurred. This enhances the neutrality of the rules. The modification went some way to allaying stakeholder concerns, but stakeholders are still in disagreement with the proposals. The majority are of the view that legislation is unnecessary, and thus would not agree with the amendments in any form. Officials explored the possibility of an operational solution early on, but determined that it would not be effective, as ultimately the Commissioner would have no legal basis on which to require the desired outcome of revenue integrity/consistency. Parties might choose to agree an allocation, but that is the case under the status quo, and the lack of an obligation for them to do so is the problem perpetuating the loss of revenue. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 13 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The new rules will be legislated via the Taxation (Annual Rates 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, and will apply to agreements for the disposal and acquisition of property entered into on or after 1 April 2021. In conjunction with the enactment of the legislation, Inland Revenue will publish guidance on the new rules so that taxpayers and advisors are aware of them and have time to prepare. Officials note that the basic requirement for parties to make a purchase price allocation is not new, so a long lead-in period is not necessary. For vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies that agree an allocation, nothing will be different, other than that they will now be obliged under income tax law to follow the agreed allocation in their tax returns (which happens in almost all cases in any event). For parties that do not agree an allocation before filing their returns, but determine that the transaction falls below at least one of the two de minimis thresholds – a $1 million transaction value or a $100,000 allocation to taxable property by the purchaser – nothing will be different. Officials envisage that these thresholds will exclude many rental property sales (as residential buildings cannot be depreciated by the purchaser and are therefore not counted towards the taxable property threshold), as well as some small business sales. Where parties do not agree an allocation and both de minimis thresholds are exceeded, whichever party unilaterally allocates under the new rules will have to notify both the other party and the Commissioner of its allocation. This will tell the other party what values it must use to complete its tax return, and will give the Commissioner visibility of the allocation, so that she is in a position to ensure the other party follows it, and to challenge it if necessary. The notification procedures are set out in section 14 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Compliance with the new rules will be monitored through routine audit and through evaluation of any allocations notified to the Commissioner by the parties. Overall, implementation risks are low, provided the rules are well-signalled, as they are intended to be. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 14 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Officials will engage with the tax advisory community and Inland Revenue investigators again when the rules are in force to seek feedback on how the rules are working for vendors and purchasers. Officials considered requiring all vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies to notify the Commissioner of their allocation, regardless of whether they agreed the allocation or not, however this would increase compliance costs for taxpayers and officials expect the monitoring methods outlined above to be sufficient. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community, and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if needed.
NEW LEGISLATION > ACT ARTICLES Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 Issued: 23 March 2020 Public 2020 No 5 The new legislation contains measures aimed at modernising and improving the settings for the administration of social policy by Inland Revenue as part of the Government’s programme of transforming the tax system. This includes measures to simplify and modernise the administration of the KiwiSaver and student loan schemes. The other major aspect of the new Act is to extend the refundability of research and development tax credits, to support Government objectives relating to increasing business expenditure on research and development.

employer contributions Sections 4, 71, 73, 74, 76, 78, 95B, 95C, 95D, 96, 98, 98A, 99, 101, 101AA, and 221B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 The KiwiSaver Act 2006 has been amended to allow Inland Revenue to pay employer contributions to a member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider based on employment income information, in advance of the employer paying the contribution to Inland Revenue. Background Inland Revenue on-pays employee contributions to a member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable after receiving payday employment income information that an employee contribution amount has been deducted from the member’s salary and wages. As employment income information is due to Inland Revenue prior to the due date for payment of these deductions, employee contribution can be on-paid to scheme providers sooner than they otherwise would be. However, the law previously provided no comparable arrangement for employer contributions. Instead, when Inland Revenue received employment income information relating to an employer contribution, the employer contribution was not on-paid to the KiwiSaver scheme provider until the contribution amount had been paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. This made it difficult for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver account with the contributions listed on their payslips. It also meant employer contributions were not invested by scheme providers as soon as employee contributions were. Key features The amendments allow Inland Revenue to pay KiwiSaver employer contributions to scheme providers before the contribution has been received by Inland Revenue. Employer contributions will be paid to providers as soon as is practicable after employment income information is filed with Inland Revenue indicating that an employer contribution has been made for a pay period. Along with other KiwiSaver amendments in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020, the change will improve the administrative efficiency of Page 7 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 KiwiSaver as it facilitates the earlier transfer of employer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers. This results in a member’s employer contribution being invested by their scheme provider sooner. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis All section references are to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments to Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account Rules (Part 3, subpart 2) Under section 72, Inland Revenue is required to establish a memorandum account. This is called the “Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account”. All contributions made under the Act must be paid into this account in the first instance. The Act contains a provision which allows Inland Revenue to pay employee contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme provider based on employment income information, before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. Section 73(3) provides that after being paid into the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account, these contributions must be paid out of the Holding Account to a KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable. In addition to the existing power to on-pay employee contributions, amendments to subsections 73(1) and (2) now allow Inland Revenue to on-pay employer contributions to scheme providers under section 73(3). The amended section 73(1) provides that before on-paying the contribution amount to the scheme provider, Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the contribution has actually been deducted from salary and wage or, for employer contributions, that the employer can make the contribution at the time it is reported in employment income information. However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, Inland Revenue can assume that this is the case if an amount has been reported on employment income information. The entitlement for Inland Revenue to make this assumption about employee contributions was previously included in Page 8 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 section 73(6), but has been moved to new section 221B and extended to cover employer contributions. Amended section 73(1) also clarifies that section 73 only applies to employee and employer contributions on-paid to a KiwiSaver scheme provider by Inland Revenue, before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. Employee and employer contributions that are not on-paid to a scheme provider before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue, are treated as being held on trust by Inland Revenue under section 74. In addition, contributions received by Inland Revenue that are not employee or employer contributions will also continue to be subject to section 74 (for example, a contribution by a non-employer to a member’s KiwiSaver account via a payment to Inland Revenue). The Act contains a provision that prevents an employee being disadvantaged by their employer failing to make payments to Inland Revenue – previously this provision only applied to employee deductions. Amendments to section 78 extend this power to unpaid employer contributions, meaning Inland Revenue will be required to pay an unpaid employee deduction or employer contribution from a Crown Bank Account into the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account if the employer had not paid the contribution amount by its due date. Section 76 has been repealed. This section allowed Inland Revenue to delay on-payment of an employer contribution until a member’s next employee contribution was on-paid to their KiwiSaver scheme provider. As the amendments allow employee and employer contributions to be on-paid to a KiwiSaver scheme provider at the same time, this provision is no longer necessary. Cross referencing and nomenclature amendments have been made to sections 71 and 74(3). Amendments to employer contribution rules (part 3, subpart 3) Sections 98 and 99 have been repealed. These sections set out how part payments of employer contributions to Inland Revenue were treated. Part payment rules are no longer necessary as employer contributions will now always be able to be on-paid in full to a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Instead, new section 95B specifies when an employer contribution shown on employment income information is deemed to be received by Inland Revenue, in instances where the contribution is not paid to Inland Revenue by or before its due date. This provision is consistent with the existing rule for employee contributions in section 69. Page 9 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The amendments to section 73, which require the on-payment of employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable after they are paid into the Inland Revenue Holding Account, are subject to the new sections 95C and 95D. Where an employer fails to provide information required by Inland Revenue about an employer contribution reported in employment income information, new section 95C allows Inland Revenue to wait to on-pay the contribution until the member it should be attributed to can be established. New section 95D provides that such a contribution is not deemed to be received by Inland Revenue until the date the person to whom it is attributable is established. These provisions are consistent with the existing rules for employee contributions in sections 70 and 71. New section 101(1B) specifies that where an employee opts-out after an employer contribution has already been on-paid to a scheme provider the amount must be refunded to Inland Revenue. While new section 101AA provides where this amount has been paid out of a Crown Bank Account and the amount has not subsequently been received from the employer, the employer contribution must be refunded to a Crown Bank Account. This ensures that an employer is not refunded an amount they have not paid. The amendments to the opt-out refund rules only have limited application, in circumstances when the late opt-out rules have been applied. This is because employee and employer contributions made by new KiwiSaver members are generally held by Inland Revenue for the duration of the standard opt-out period. The opt-out period ends 55 days after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, while the holding period for initial KiwiSaver contributions is 62 days. A similar amendment to the one which applies to the opt-out refund rules has not been made for refunds resulting from a person being invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver. Existing section 59D(4) already allows refunds of contribution amounts (without reference to the specific contribution type) to the Crown, where appropriate, in invalid enrolment situations. Cross-referencing and nomenclature amendments have also been made to sections 93(5), 96 and 98A. Page 10 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Other KiwiSaver administrative refinements Sections 4, 18, 22, 23, 34, 38, 39, 48, 51, 56, 57, 59B, 59C, 59D, 63B, 64, 69, 75, 81, 85, 88, 93, 103, 104, 105, 107, 108, 112B, 226 and schedule 1, clause 8 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 A number of technical amendments have been made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. These seek to enhance Inland Revenue’s administration of KiwiSaver, to ensure members receive the correct contribution amounts and facilitate the faster transfer of contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers. Key features  Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period (during which individuals who are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver are provisionally allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme) and initial holding period from three months to two months.  Aligning the date KiwiSaver contributions are treated as received by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday.  Reducing the maximum period within which a scheme provider has to send information and funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes from 35 days to 10 working days.  Allowing members to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue, in addition to through their employer.  Removal of requirements to report employer name and address details to Inland Revenue in certain circumstances.  Minor amendments to reporting address requirements for new members.  Requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with information about an employee’s KiwiSaver salary and wages.  Removing the three months grace period for members who have been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence. Page 11 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The amendments allowing a member to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue will apply from 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council. All other amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis All section references are to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 unless otherwise stated. Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period and initial holding period (sections 4, 18, 48, 51, 57, 59B, 64, 75, 81, 88, 104, 108, 112B and 226) Amendments to section 51(4)(a) and (b) reduce the duration of the provisional period from three months to two months. Section 75 has also been amended so the initial holding period for new member’s contributions has been reduced from three months to two months as well. Where an individual has been automatically enrolled, opted-in via their employer or is no longer eligible to be a member of their existing KiwiSaver scheme, they will be provisionally allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme under section 50. If an individual does not make an active choice to join another KiwiSaver scheme before the provisional period ends, they are treated as having accepted the offer of membership to the scheme they were provisionally allocated to. A member’s initial contributions are held by Inland Revenue for the duration of the provisional period, before being on-paid to the member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider (that is, because the provisional period was previously set at three months, the initial holding period was also three months long). As the amendments will result in them receiving a member’s initial contributions earlier, KiwiSaver scheme providers will be aware they have been allocated a default member sooner and will be able to engage with the member about their investment options earlier. It will also mean a member’s initial contributions will be invested by their scheme provider sooner. Members will still be able to transfer to a different scheme after the provisional period ends if they wish to do so. As a result of reducing the initial holding period, an amendment has also been made to section 81(1) so that in addition to being required to refund overpaid contributions to Inland Page 12 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Revenue, a scheme provider will also be required to refund contributions to Inland Revenue when a member opts out. This provision will apply where the KiwiSaver late opt-out rules have been used, which can be up to three months after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver (previously such a rule was not necessary as the late opt-out period ended at the same time as the holding period). A similar amendment has been made to the employer contribution specific refund rules and is discussed in the section of this Tax Information Bulletin entitled “on-payment of KiwiSaver employer contributions”. Where section 4(3) of the Act earlier defined “3 months” to mean 92 days, section 4(3) has now been repealed and references in the Act to “3 months” have now been replaced with “92 days”. Instead of being expressed as “2 months”, section 51(4) now refers to “62 days”. Consequential amendments to sections 48(1)(d), 56(4) and 226(1B) and (1C) have also been made to align with the reduced provisional and holding periods. Aligning the date KiwiSaver contributions are received with member’s payday (sections 4, 69, 78, 85 and schedule 1, clause 8 and new sections 95B and 221B) Previously employee contributions were treated as received by Inland Revenue on the 15th day of the month they were deducted from the member’s salary or wages. Sections 69(2), 78(b), 85(1) and schedule 1, clause 8 contained a 15th of the month timing rule for employee contributions. These provisions are relevant for determining when unpaid employee contributions are treated as received, when employee contributions are treated as received for the purpose of calculating interest and when employee contributions are treated as received for the purpose of the KiwiSaver first home withdrawals rules. Previously section 85(3) provided that employer contributions were treated as received on the first of the month that Inland Revenue received payment for the contribution. The reason employer contributions were treated as received on a different date from employee contributions was due to an inability to on-pay employer contributions to a scheme provider until the contribution amount had been paid to Inland Revenue. If interest was calculated from the 15th of the month and there was a delay in the employer contribution amount being paid to Inland Revenue, then Inland Revenue risked having to pay interest on those contributions for an extended period. However, the on-payment of employer contributions amendments included in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act Page 13 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 2020 means it is no longer necessary to treat employee and employer contributions differently for timing purposes. These timing rules for employee and employer contributions reflected the fact that Inland Revenue previously did not have sufficient information to determine the date of an employee’s payday. However, the rules were unsatisfactory as, amongst other things, they resulted in the under and over-payment of interest on employee contributions and underpayment of interest on employer contributions. As part of changes to employment income information requirements, which came into effect from 1 April 2019, employers are now required to report the date of their employee’s payday to Inland Revenue. To reflect this, sections 69, 78 and 85 have been amended so that employee contributions can be treated as received by Inland Revenue on the date of the member’s payday as reported by the employer. Similarly, the amended section 85 and new section 95B(2) (which relates to the date employer contributions are treated as received for the on-payment of employer contributions amendments above) specify that employer contributions are also treated as received on the date of the member’s payday. All the amendments include a carve out stating that where an employer has not provided information to Inland Revenue about an employee’s payday, both employee and employer contributions are treated as received on the 15th of the month that the employee contribution was deducted/employer contribution relates to. This covers situations in which Inland Revenue has granted an employer a variation for employment income information requirements which results in them not being required to report the date of their employee’s payday. Sections 69 and 85 provide that Inland Revenue needs to be satisfied that an employee contribution had actually been deducted from salary and wages for these sections to apply. Amended section 85 and new section 95B, introduce a similar rule for employer contributions. The amendments require Inland Revenue to be satisfied that the employer can make the contribution at the time it is reported in the employment income information for these sections to apply. The new section 221B entitles Inland Revenue to assume that these requirements are met where an amount is included in employment information (unless there is evidence to the contrary). An amendment has also been made to section 4 to clarify that “payday” has the same meaning as it does in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Page 14 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Transfer of member’s information and funds to a new scheme provider (sections 56 and 57) Section 56(4) specifies the maximum transfer period KiwiSaver scheme providers have to send a member’s funds and relevant information to a new scheme after receiving notice from a member that they have opted to transfer schemes. This section has been amended to reduce this transfer period from 35 days to 10 working days. The section would continue to permit the transfer timeframe being exceeded, where this is agreed to between the old and new KiwiSaver schemes. KiwiSaver default providers’ instruments of appointment currently already require them to complete transfers within 10 working days of receiving notice that the member has transferred schemes. Therefore, the amendment results in the transfer time being aligned across all KiwiSaver scheme providers. A consequential amendment has also been made to section 57(5). Changing employee contribution rates (sections 38, 39 and 64) Section 64(2) has been amended so employees have the option of changing their KiwiSaver contribution rate by contacting Inland Revenue or their KiwiSaver scheme provider, in addition to their employer. This will reduce compliance costs for members who may be more likely to engage with Inland Revenue or their KiwiSaver scheme provider in the first instance about contribution rate changes. New section 64(2B)–(2D) outlines information a member or their scheme provider needs provide to Inland Revenue where a contribution rate change is made, and what information Inland Revenue would be required to subsequently provide a member’s employer(s) to ensure the contribution rate change is given effect to. Changes to employer name and address reporting requirements (sections 38, 39. 103, 105, and 107) Amendments have been made to requirements in the Act to report employer name and address details, to address issues arising where this information is incorrectly reported to the Inland Revenue. This commonly occurs where an employer’s trading name and address are different than their registered name and address. Page 15 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Reporting requirements where member enrolled directly with scheme provider Section 38 sets out what information a KiwiSaver scheme provider must report to Inland Revenue, when a person has enrolled in KiwiSaver directly with the provider. The requirement in section 38(2), for a scheme provider to report employer name and address details to Inland Revenue has been repealed. Instead, Inland Revenue will notify all active employers it has on record for the employee that the employee has enrolled in KiwiSaver. Consequential amendments have also been made to section 39(1). Reporting requirements where member applies for a savings suspension The general requirement in section 103(2)(c) for an employee who applies for a savings suspension to provide Inland Revenue with the names and addresses of the employers they wish the savings suspension to apply to, has been repealed. Instead this information would now only be required under section 103(2)(c) when requested by Inland Revenue. Amendments have also been made to sections 105(2) and 107(a), so that Inland Revenue would only be required to notify an employer that a savings suspension had been granted in respect of one of their employees, where it has requested the member provide employer name and address details. The intended operation of these amendments is member’s applying for a savings suspension via their myIR account would be able to select from a list of their employers, which they want the savings suspension to apply to (that is, in this situation Inland Revenue would be treated as requiring employer name and address details). For members applying for a savings suspension through other channels, the member would be sent a letter advising that they had been granted a savings suspension, which they could show to employers of their choice. Aligning employee address requirements in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 with the Tax Administration Act 1994 (sections 22, 23 and 34) Under schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, an employer must provide a new employee’s contact address to Inland Revenue “as required” (that is, when such information is requested by Inland Revenue). However, under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 employers were always required to provide an employee’s contact address to Inland Revenue for new KiwiSaver enrolments. Page 16 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 This created an inconsistency between the requirements of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006, in that even where Inland Revenue did not require a new employee’s contact address under the Tax Administration Act 1994, the employer would still be required to provide this information if the employee had also been enrolled in KiwiSaver. Sections 22, 23 and 23 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 have now been amended to clarify that an employer is only required to provide the contact address of an employee who has been enrolled in KiwiSaver if it is required by Inland Revenue. KiwiSaver income information (new section 63B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) As part of the KiwiSaver on-boarding process, employers are required to provide Inland Revenue with certain information about new enrolments to the scheme. To improve Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution amounts, new section 63B requires employers to report information to Inland Revenue on the amount of salary and wages a KiwiSaver deduction is made from for an employee, if there is a difference between amounts that an employer must treat as gross earnings for the purpose of calculating PAYE tax obligations and amounts they must treat as salary and wages for the purpose of calculating KiwiSaver contributions. If there is a difference between amounts that an employer must treat as gross earnings (for calculating PAYE deductions) and amounts they must treat as salary and wages (for calculating KiwiSaver contributions), then the employer must report the latter. As there are some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE that are exempt for KiwiSaver purposes, collecting this information will help Inland Revenue ensure that KiwiSaver contributions are being paid at the correct rate. Some examples of amounts included in gross income for PAYE that are not included within the definition of salary and wages for KiwiSaver are the value of accommodation, a benefit from an employee share scheme or a redundancy payment. Employers need not provide this information every payday. Instead, the employer is required to report to Inland Revenue about new employees or existing employees joining KiwiSaver for the first time. Page 17 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Consequential amendments have also been made to schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These clarify that the new reporting requirements fall within the ambit of what is considered employment information under that Act. KiwiSaver invalid enrolment residence grace period (sections 59, 59C, and 59D) Section 59A provides that when an individual does not meet the KiwiSaver residence requirement, the invalid enrolment rules will apply. However, under section 59B the member was treated as meeting the KiwiSaver residence requirement for the first three months after the invalid enrolment was discovered. Section 59C then provided if the person became someone who meets the residence requirement within this three-month period, the enrolment would be retrospectively validated and their KiwiSaver account would remain open. In practice, the three-month residence grace period did not operate as intended, as non- residents who have been invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver typically do not intend to become a resident in the short-term (for example, individuals on temporary work visas). In recognition of this, new section 59B(2)(ab) has been inserted. This section will mean where an individual has been invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver on the basis of not meeting the residence requirement, they will cease to be a member as soon as their scheme provider discovers, or is notified about, the invalid enrolment. Amendments to section 59C(1) clarify that where a person who did not meet the residence requirement was invalidly enrolled, this enrolment could not be retrospectively validated. Amendments to section 59D(1) confirm that the refund process set out under this section for contributions that a person had made while invalidly enrolled apply if an individual’s account is closed on the basis of them not meeting the residence criteria when enrolled. The effect of the amendment is to remove the three-month residence grace period and means the member’s account will be closed immediately. The individual will then be able to open a new KiwiSaver account if they later become a resident. Page 18 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Withdrawal in cases of life-shortening congenital conditions Sections 101C, 228, 243 and schedule 1, clauses 12B and 13 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; section MK 2 and schedule 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 A new KiwiSaver withdrawal category has been introduced to allow members with life- shortening conditions to withdraw their savings before reaching the age of 65 in order to provide for themselves in retirement. Background The reason for this new category of withdrawal is to recognise that people with life- shortening congenital conditions may not live until the New Zealand superannuation qualification age (currently 65) – the age at which they would ordinarily be eligible to access their retirement savings. While there is an existing withdrawal category for KiwiSaver members who are seriously ill, this does not assist those with life-shortening congenital conditions. This is because the serious illness withdrawal category is only available where the member is totally and permanently unable to engage in work for which they are suited, or else has a condition which poses a serious and imminent risk of death. Key features A further ground for the early withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds has been added to schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. KiwiSaver members with life-shortening congenital conditions are now able to withdraw their KiwiSaver funds before they reach the general withdrawal age of 65. Under the new withdrawal category life-shortening congenital conditions named in regulations would automatically qualify for withdrawal. An alternative process is also available to people that have a life-shortening congenital condition that is not named in the regulations to apply to their KiwiSaver provider for a withdrawal. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2020. Page 19 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Detailed analysis New clause 12B of schedule 1of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 introduces a new withdrawal category which allows members with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their savings early in order to provide for themselves in their retirement. The newly enacted clause 12B(1) of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides two avenues for members with a life-shortening congenital condition to withdraw their KiwiSaver funds. These are where the member has:  a life shortening congenital condition which has been identified by regulation (a condition which has identified in this way is referred to as a “listed condition”); 1 or  a congenital condition which is likely to reduce their life expectancy below the New Zealand superannuation qualification age for the member or for persons in general (this is referred to as a “non-listed condition”). A KiwiSaver member with either of the above categories of congenital condition which has existed from the date of their birth may apply under clause 13 to the manager or supervisor of their KiwiSaver scheme for a withdrawal. The amount of the withdrawal may be up to the value of their accumulation in the fund. An applicant with either a listed or non-listed condition must supply a medical certificate which verifies the member suffers from the condition. A medical certificate presented by an applicant with a non-listed condition must additionally verify that the condition the member suffers from is a life-shortening congenital condition for the member or for persons in general with the condition. A withdrawal application must also include a statutory declaration completed by the member, acknowledging that they understand the consequences of withdrawing their savings. 1 New section 228(1)(mb) inserts a regulation making power into the KiwiSaver Act 2006, to allow for a listed condition to be specified in regulations. Page 20 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 New sections 101C(cb) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and MK 2(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide that a member who has made a life-shortening congenital condition withdrawal will no longer be eligible for compulsory employer contributions or the annual Government contribution. This is consistent with how KiwiSaver members are treated when withdrawing for the purpose of retirement (that is, entitlement to compulsory employer contributions and the Government contribution generally cease when a member reaches the age of 65). Consequential amendments have also been made to the complying fund rules in schedule 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007, to ensure a life-shortening congenital condition withdrawal is also a grounds for early withdrawal under these rules. Transitional period for KiwiSaver scheme providers New section 243 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 grants transitional relief to KiwiSaver scheme providers who are non-compliant with product disclosure statement requirements or other requirements to file information on a relevant disclose register under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, as result of the introduction of the new early withdrawal ground. This period of transitional relief comes to an end before 31 January 2021. Page 21 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Limiting ability to reopen any repayment obligation relating to years prior to 1 April 2013 Clauses 21–27 of Part 5 of schedule 6 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Limiting the situations where either the Commissioner or the borrower can reopen a borrower’s repayment obligation for tax years prior to 1 April 2013. Background Inland Revenue was required to maintain the student loan rules back to 1992 when the scheme was introduced in case either the Commissioner or the borrower seeks to review a borrower’s repayment obligation. Retaining rules back to 1992 has increased the complexity of the scheme over time as changes have been made to the scheme in 21 of the last 26 years. Compliance costs for borrowers are high, as understanding changes to their loan balance is difficult due to historical rules applying for prior years. Administration costs for Inland Revenue are also high, as are the costs of building the rules back to 1992 into new systems and processes, with little benefit. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, it is proposed that a simplified set of rules will apply for the period from 1992 to 1 April 2013. This will reduce compliance costs for borrowers, the administration costs for Inland Revenue, and the time and cost of implementing changes to the student loan scheme. The 1 April 2013 date was chosen as nearly all adjustments to borrowers’ repayment obligations have occurred within this timeframe and the rules applying from that date onwards are largely the same as applies today. Key features Schedule 6 of the Act is amended by introducing a new Part 5. This Part sets out the proposed new rules for tax years prior to 1 April 2013. For the purposes of clauses 23–27 of this Part, references to “Act” refer to either the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 or the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, whichever is appropriate. Page 22 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 A new definition of closed-off tax years applies to tax years from 1992 up to 1 April 2013. During this period both the Commissioner and the borrower are precluded from reopening any repayment obligation except where the borrower:  becomes overseas or New Zealand-based;  has committed fraud; or  has not filed information (for example, an unfiled return) to the Commissioner when required to do so under the Act and it is cost effective for the Commissioner to reopen the repayment obligation. A savings provision enables the Commissioner to correct the position of any borrower who might be unduly disadvantaged by these proposals. Where a borrower considers that they are worse off, they can apply to the Commissioner and if the Commissioner agrees then their repayment obligation will be corrected. Residency changes If a change in a borrower’s residence status is identified after 1 April 2020 and the change relates to a closed-o ff tax year, a simplified set of rules will apply. Loan interest would be calculated on the borrower’s loan balance from the date the borrower went overseas, or loan interest would cease to apply from date they returned to New Zealand. Where a borrower goes from New Zealand-based to overseas-based during the closed-off period, no overseas-based borrower repayment obligation for the period will be imposed. Where a borrower goes from overseas-based to New Zealand-based during the period, overseas-based repayments would not be collected. Any payments already collected would go against the loan balance. However, changes to a borrower’s repayment obligations due to residency changes will apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. Page 23 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 1 Bob went overseas in April 2008 but did not advise Inland Revenue. Since 2008, Bob has been treated as a New Zealand-based borrower (so was not charged loan interest). Bob has not met his repayment obligations since 2008. In April 2021, Bob returns to New Zealand and Inland Revenue identifies that Bob has been overseas since April 2008. Bob’s obligations for the 2008–13 tax years can be reopened only to the extent that Bob must pay loan interest from April 2008. His repayment obligations for the 2008–13 tax years cannot otherwise be assessed or reassessed. Bob’s obligations for the 2014–21 tax years can be reopened in full (because those tax years are not closed off). For the period from 1 April 2013 until he returned to New Zealand, Bob may be liable to an overseas- based borrowers’ repayment obligation and loan interest. From 1 April 2013 onwards, associated late payment interest charges can apply. Example 2 Ngaire went overseas in April 2000 and advised Inland Revenue of her departure. Ngaire returned to New Zealand in July 2008 but did not advise Inland Revenue. Since April 2000, Ngaire has been treated as an overseas-based borrower (so was charged loan interest and assessed with an overseas-based repayment obligation). Ngaire has not met her repayment obligations since March 2000. In April 2021, Inland Revenue identifies that Ngaire returned to New Zealand in July 2008. Ngaire’s obligations for the 2008–21 tax years can be reopened. For the period from July 2008 to 31 March 2013, the loan interest charge, and any overseas-based borrower repayment obligations, can be reversed but no New Zealand-based repayment obligation can be assessed in its place. For the 2013–14 tax year and later tax years, Ngaire can be assessed with a New Zealand-based borrowers’ repayment obligation (because those tax years are not closed off). From 1 April 2013 onwards, associated late payment interest charges can apply. Example 3 Pip went overseas to work as a volunteer for a recognised charity in April 2008 and returned in April 2010. Pip could have applied to be treated as if still physically in New Zealand during the period of absence but did not. Pip’s obligations for the 2008–09 to 2009–10 tax years can be reopened if she makes an application. For the period of absence, the loan interest charge, and any overseas-based borrower repayment obligations, can be reversed but no New Zealand-based repayment obligation can be assessed in its place. Page 24 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Fraud or unfiled returns or information Where fraud is involved, or the borrower has failed to provide a return or information to the Commissioner, the borrower’s repayment obligation may be reopened during the closed-off period. In these situations, a simplified calculation would be used to calculate the borrower’s repayment obligation, namely, 10 percent of the difference between the income of the borrower that should have been used to calculate the repayment obligation and the income that was used less any unused repayment threshold. Other rules that applied in that year would be disregarded. A one-off penalty may also apply to penalise the non-compliant action. Late payment interest will not be imposed for the closed-off period. However, late payment interest may apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. Example 4 Chris fraudulently failed to declare a large source of income for the 2008–09 tax year. This has implications for both income tax and student loan obligations. The 4-year (statute bar) period for making changes to an income tax obligation after a return is filed does not apply where fraud is involved. Therefore, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue amends Chris’s income tax liability for the 2008–09 year and the student loan repayment obligation for that year is also amended. The reopened student loan repayment obligation is the difference between the previous income amount and the new income amount, less any unused repayment threshold, multiplied by the repayment percentage (which was 10% up to 1 April 2013). Chris could be considered for a shortfall or criminal penalty for not filing or for the fraudulent activity. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 25 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Replacing the underestimation penalty with shortfall penalty Sections 4, 146(3)(a)(ii), and 161A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Replacing the student loan underestimation penalty with a shortfall penalty to align it with the penalty imposed for underestimation of provisional tax for tax purposes. Background Borrowers who earn income other than salary and wages and whose end-of-year repayment obligation on this income is more than $1,000, are required to make interim repayments in the following year. A borrower can base these interim repayments on either the previous year’s assessed amount plus an uplift percentage or an estimate of the expected end-of-year repayment obligation. To ensure borrowers who choose the estimate option make an accurate estimate of their interim repayment obligations, a penalty is imposed on those who significantly underestimate their interim repayments. To provide consistency of penalties between underestimations of loan repayments and the underestimations of provisional tax, it is proposed that the current underestimation penalty be replaced with a shortfall penalty. Key features Sections 4, 161A, and 146(3)(a)(ii) are amended to reflect the repeal of the underestimation penalty. The current shortfall penalties that apply to other tax positions, actions, or omissions also include not making an accurate estimate of their interim repayment obligations. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 26 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Repayment obligations limited to consolidated loan balance Sections 191(1) and (3A) and 194(2) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Enabling repayment obligations to continue until the consolidated loan balance (including unpaid amounts and interest) is repaid. Background The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 defines the term “loan balance” as including core borrowing, loan interest charged and the administration fee, but not including unpaid amounts (which are defaults and late payment interest). The Act also defines the “consolidated loan balance”, which includes the loan balance and unpaid amounts. The Act previously limited a borrower’s repayment obligation to their loan balance, rather than their consolidated loan balance, meaning deductions from salary and wages could only occur until the loan balance has been repaid. This prevents salary and wage deductions from being made to repay unpaid amounts. The Act replaces “loan balance” with “consolidated loan balance” for the purpose of this limitation. The amendment will allow salary and wage deductions to continue until the consolidated loan balance is fully repaid. Example 5 Ben goes overseas with a loan balance of $7,000. Based on this loan balance he is required to make repayments of $1,000 per year but does not make any repayments while overseas. He then returns to New Zealand after 5 years overseas with a “loan balance” of $2,000 and unpaid assessments of $5,000. 2 2 For simplicity, the example ignores interest and the annual administration fee. Page 27 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Ben begins working in New Zealand, and his employer deducts loan repayments each payday until Ben’s $2,000 “loan balance” is repaid. At this point, Inland Revenue would be required to instruct the employer to stop making student loan deductions. Inland Revenue will seek repayment of the unpaid $5,000. If Ben does not repay, Inland Revenue would need to use other tools to get him to repay their loan. Key features Section 191(1) and (3A) is amended by referring to consolidated loan balance instead of loan balance. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 28 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Requirement to deduct repayments from schedular, election day, and casual agricultural income Sections 115, 118, 123, and 124 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 Repealing the legislation requiring loan repayment deductions to be made from schedular, election day, and casual agricultural payments at source. Background Changes enacted as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 require student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election day, and casual agricultural income each pay day, with effect from 1 April 2020. These changes were introduced to benefit borrowers in reducing their loan balance and reducing compliance costs by making repayment deductions during the year. However, although consultation undertaken before enactment raised no compliance cost issues for employers, further consultation undertaken as part of implementing these changes has identified significant compliance costs for employers in implementing these changes. Therefore, the changes have been repealed with effect from 1 April 2020. Key features Sections 115, 118, 123, and 124 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 are repealed. Application date This amendment applies from 31 March 2020. Page 29 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Commissioner may notify employers when loan balance close to zero Section 62A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Enabling Inland Revenue to notify employers of a borrower’s remaining loan balance when the borrower’s loan is close to being fully repaid. Background Currently, employers make salary and wage deductions from their employee’s wages at the rate of 12 cents in the dollar for every dollar over the repayment threshold. This continues until the loan is repaid. Inland Revenue contacts employers after loans is repaid to instruct them to cease making student loan deductions. However, as employers make deductions at a constant rate, employers often deduct more than the remaining loan balance. These overpayments often require contact between Inland Revenue and the borrower to resolve. This amendment is possible now because since 1 April 2019, employers have been required to provide information on employees’ income and deductions each payday giving Inland Revenue more timely and accurate information regarding an employee’s earnings. Key features A new section 62A is inserted into the Act. The section provides that Inland Revenue will notify 1 or more of the borrower’s employers of the borrower’s loan balance when the loan is close to being fully repaid. Where possible, Inland Revenue will also give the borrower a copy of the notification provided to the employer(s). Employers will need to reduce the amount of the final deductions so that the amount of the repayment is equal to the remaining loan balance, which will reduce the likelihood of overpayments being made. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 30 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Reducing annual net income threshold from $1,500 to $500 Section 72 of Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Background The Act contains a concession where a borrower with less than $1,500 of non-salary and wage income is not required to make loan repayments on this income. This threshold reflects the compliance costs associated with the requirements to file a return and/or notify Inland Revenue of any adjustments to income for student loan purposes. From the 2018–19 tax year, most salary and wage earners will have their tax automatically assessed. Therefore, as the compliance costs associated with complying with the filing requirements have been reduced, the threshold level has also been reduced from $1,500 to $500. Key features Section 72 of the Act is amended by replacing the references to $1,500 with $500 in both places where they occur. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 31 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Replace repayment holiday with temporary repayment suspension Sections 106, 107, 107B, 108, 108A, 110, 115, and 182A of Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Replacing the term “Student Loan Repayment Holiday” with “Student Loan Temporary Repayment Suspension”. The repayment holiday reduces a borrower’s overseas-based repayment obligation to zero. Renaming the repayment holiday will send a better signal to borrowers that their repayment obligations are only on hold. In practice, there will be no change to the effect of the policy on borrowers. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 32 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Date repayment deductions deemed to be made Section 195(3) and (3A) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Changing the date that student loan repayment deductions are deemed to be made from the 15th of the month to the employee’s payday. Background Currently deductions are deemed to be made on one fixed date, the 15th of the month. This is because until 1 April 2019 Inland Revenue did not receive payday information for all employees and determining employees’ paydays would impose compliance costs on employers. The introduction of payday filing now enables Inland Revenue to deem deductions to be made on the employee’s payday. This should not have adverse implications for borrowers. Key features Section 195(3) and (3A) are replaced with a new subsection (3) which makes it clear that salary or wage deductions are credited on the day on which the deduction is made. All other payments (other than salary or wages) are credited on the date on which the payment is received by the Commissioner. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 33 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Notification of income by overseas-based borrowers applying to be treated as New Zealand- based Sections 74(2) and 114(3) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Clarifying that a borrower can notify the Commissioner of their adjusted net income at the time they apply for treatment as being physically in New Zealand or a later date. Background Borrowers can apply to be treated as being physically in New Zealand if the principal reason for not being in New Zealand is included within a list of categories in the Act, for example, as part of their New Zealand employment the borrower is posted overseas. If granted, borrowers’ repayment obligations are income contingent and the loan is interest free for the relevant period. Borrowers can apply for this treatment before, during or after being absent from New Zealand. As a condition of some of the listed reasons, borrowers must notify the Commissioner of their adjusted net income. However currently, it is unclear whether those borrowers who apply for this treatment after their absence must make a separate extension of time application, or whether they may notify the Commissioner of their income information at the time of application. Key features Sections 74(2) and 114(3) are amended to enable the borrower to advise the Commissioner of their income at the same time as they apply to be treated as a New Zealand-based borrower. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 34 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Interest for New Zealand-Based borrowers Clause 29 of Part 5 of Schedule 6 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Removing the requirement to impose interest and then write it off for New Zealand-based borrowers, for reassessments prior to 1 April 2020. Background In the past Inland Revenue’s system limitations meant that the only way to impose interest on overseas-based borrowers was to impose interest on all borrowers and then to immediately write it off for New Zealand-based borrowers. This has caused confusion and concern to borrowers. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme means that those systems limitations no longer exist going forward. However, if changes that apply to periods before 1 April 2020 are made to a borrower’s loan balance after 1 April 2020, the legislation technically requires interest to be imposed and written off for New Zealand-based borrowers. Key features A new clause 29 has been inserted into part 5 of Schedule 6 to provide that loan interest does not need to be charged for changes to a New Zealand-based borrower’s loan balance from 1 April 2012 onwards. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 35 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Aligning the write-off rules Sections 144, 146A, 161A, 189(1), 195(3), and 197(2) of Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Amending the Act to enable the Commissioner to write off amounts of $20 or less. Background Currently, the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to refrain from collecting tax of amounts not more than $20. In the Act the Commissioner may write off amounts less than $20. The amendment aligns these by changing the wording in the Student Loan Scheme Act to align with the Tax Administration Act 1994. This would provide consistency of treatment between small amounts of income tax and student loan obligation. This should not have a significant impact as it will adjust the threshold for a small balance write-off by one cent. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 36 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Early assessments of student loan adjusted net income Section 191(2) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Allowing valid returns filed before the end of the tax year to be finalised and the borrower’s repayment obligation to be calculated. Background Currently, the Act requires that a borrower’s end-of-year repayment obligation on their adjusted net income cannot exceed their loan balance on the last day of the tax year. In some cases, a borrower may file a return before the end of the tax year (for example, if they go overseas) and this requirement would delay Inland Revenue being able to complete this assessment until the end of the year. The amendment provides that where a return is filed earlier than the last day of the tax year, the assessment could be completed, and the borrower’s repayment obligation should not exceed their loan balance on the date the return is filed. If the borrower earns further income in the year, for example returns to New Zealand unexpectedly, their repayment obligation can be amended, and a further assessment issued. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Page 37 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Payment ordering rules Section 194(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Allocating payments against the oldest unpaid period, and within each period against interest first, then the principal. Background Currently, the Act requires that payments be offset first against interest on the loan, then against the principal, for non-salary and wage payments, where the borrower does not specify a treatment. Payments are generally allocated against the oldest unpaid assessment, and then against interest before principal within each period. This treatment is generally advantageous to borrowers as it will minimise any interest they are charged. The amendment reflects the period-based allocation of payments within the new system. Key features Section 194(1) is replaced to reflect the period-based allocation of payments. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. Page 38 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Loans resulting from identity theft Section 146C and clause 28 of Part 5 of Schedule 6 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Enabling Inland Revenue to write off loans taken out before 2000, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the borrower did not take out the loan, and the correct borrower cannot be identified. Background Inland Revenue manages loans that were taken out by borrowers before 2000. However, it does not have the legislative authority to write off loans where the borrower has been able to prove that they did not take out the loan and the correct borrower cannot be identified. Loans taken out from 2000 onwards are administered by MSD who do have the power to reverse loans if they cannot locate the correct borrower. Key features A new clause 28, is inserted in Part 5 of schedule 6 of the Act to allow Inland Revenue to write off loans that were transferred before 1 April 2000 where the Commissioner is satisfied that the person who has been allocated the loan did not take it out, and the correct borrower cannot be identified. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. Page 39 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Overseas-based borrowers with serious illness or disabilities Section 25(2) and 26, 27, 176, and clause 11(1) of schedule 1 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Background On application, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may treat overseas-based borrowers who are unable to meet their repayment obligation as a result of a serious illness or disability as being physically in New Zealand. Key features The change provides a new circumstance for when a borrower can be treated as being physically in New Zealand. This means they could be eligible for an interest-free loan and have repayment obligations based on their income. Borrowers with a serious illness who are unable to meet their overseas-based repayment obligations will be able to be treated as physically in New Zealand for the purposes of determining whether they are New Zealand-based or overseas-based. The amendment will require the borrower to provide evidence of their medical and financial position as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue requires. Unlike for hardship relief, the borrower would not necessarily need to supply evidence annually. Instead they would need to do so as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue reasonably requires. The borrower will be required to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of their annual adjusted net income. This is required of all borrowers who have repayment obligations based on their income. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis The treatment will be available to borrowers who have an injury, illness, or disability that results in them being unable to engage in paid work, other than work for which the person is Page 40 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 paid a token payment or a very low wage, or where that injury, illness or disability poses a serious and imminent risk of death. The proposed amendment will not change borrowers’ abilities to receive hardship relief. Example 6 Ben lives overseas and was seriously injured in a football game. After the accident Ben had to quit his job and he is now financially unable to meet his overseas-based repayment obligation. Ben is now working at his local community gardens, as part of the country’s welfare programme. As part of this welfare programme, Ben receives a payment for his work that is below the country’s ordinary minimum wage. He is eligible to apply to be treated as a New Zealand-based borrower, meaning he would have an interest free loan and repayment obligations based on his income. Page 41 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Student Loan Scheme (Details of Borrower’s Contact Person) Amendment Regulations 2020 These regulations were made under section 215(d) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. They amend regulation 3 of the Student Loan Scheme (Details of Borrower’s Contact Person) Regulations 2012 Background Under the Student Loan Scheme (Details of Borrower’s Contact Person) Regulations 2012, borrowers are required to provide the date of birth and IRD number of their alternative contact person when they apply for their student loan. However, at that time, no equivalent regulations were passed for when borrowers apply for a repayment holiday. The Student Loan Scheme (Details of Borrower’s Contact Person) Amendment Regulations 2020 align the information required about a borrower’s contact person when they apply for a student loan or a repayment holiday. Key features These regulations require that borrowers provide the date of birth and IRD number of their alternative contact person when they:  apply for a student loan repayment holiday;  update their contact person’s details; or  nominate a new contact person. Application date These regulations came into force on 1 April 2020. Page 42 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Refunding R&D tax credits Sections LA 5(4B), (5B), (5C), (5D), LZ 14, and YA 1 (definitions of approved research provider, eligible research and development expenditure, ESCT, FBT, levy body researcher, PAYE, and refundability cap) of the Income Tax Act 2007 These changes affect the amount of R&D tax credits that can be refunded to a person. They replace the existing $255,000 refundability cap, corporate eligibility criteria, and R&D wage intensity test with new broader refundability rules. Background Refundability is intended to ensure that all claimants doing R&D can benefit from their R&D tax credits soon after the year their R&D takes place in. Without refundability, some claimants may not be able to benefit from their credits until a much later date (if at all, depending on the circumstances of each claimant). Refundable credits enable claimants in a tax loss position, or with insufficient income tax liability to use all of their R&D tax credits in the relevant income year, to benefit from their R&D tax credits sooner. In year 1 (the 2019–20 income year), limited refundability rules were introduced to enable some firms to access refundable credits. These rules were taken from the existing R&D tax loss cash-out regime, because tight timeframes meant there was not enough time to develop broader refundability rules. The Government committed to reviewing the refundability rules so that broader refundability would be available from year 2 of the credit (the 2020–21 income year). Note that this section of the Tax Information Bulletin also incorporates changes enacted by the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 (COVID- 19 Tax Act), which amended R&D rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. Key features  The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 (the KSSLRM Act) introduces new broader refundability rules.  The application date of these new rules was brought forward to the 2019–20 income year by the COVID-19 Tax Act. They were originally intended to apply from the 2020– 21 income year, which is the second year of the R&D tax credit scheme. Page 43 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  Under the broader refundability rules, eligible claimants can now receive refunds of their R&D tax credits up to a new refundability cap. The new rules also remove the previous corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria. This means a business with surplus R&D tax credits only needs to satisfy the usual R&D tax credit eligibility criteria to be eligible for refundability – no special refundability eligibility criteria (aside from the new cap) apply.  The new refundability cap is based on the amount of labour-related taxes (PAYE, fringe benefit tax (FBT), and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)) paid by a claimant in the relevant income year. Grouping rules apply to allow certain companies to allocate their labour-related taxes to other companies they control, or that sit within the same wholly-owned group.  The cap does not restrict refunds for eligible expenditure on approved research providers or to levy body researchers (industry organisations to which a levy is payable under New Zealand statute, such as the Commodity Levies Act 1990).  Any non-refundable R&D tax credits may still be carried forward to the next income year provided the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met.  The KSSLRM Act introduced a transitional provision that would have allowed claimants to include certain taxes paid in year 1 in their year 2 refundability cap. This transitional provision has been removed by the COVID-19 Tax Act, because this Act enables claimants to access the broader refundability rules in year 1.  While the new broader refundability rules will apply from the first year of the tax credit by default, claimants who would prefer to apply the limited refundability rules can choose to apply these instead of the broader refundability rules. This needs to be signalled when a claimant is filing its R&D tax credit claim with Inland Revenue. Table 1 illustrates the key differences between the limited refundability rules with the new broader refundability rules. Page 44 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Table 1: Key differences between the limited refundability rules and the new broader refundability rules Limited refundability rules New broader refundability rules Eligibility criteria Must satisfy the corporate eligibility criteria (section MX 2) – this includes a requirement that claimants must be companies, cannot be listed, and cannot be considered a tax resident of another jurisdiction under a double tax agreement. No corporate eligibility criteria. Must satisfy the wage intensity criteria (section MX 3) – this requires twenty percent of a firm’s labour costs to be on R&D labour. No wage intensity criteria. Exempt income exclusion Must not derive exempt income or be associated with a person who derives exempt income (unless the exempt income is from intercompany or foreign dividends under sections CW 9 or 10). No exempt income exclusion for refundability (but new exempt income exclusion applies in the R&D Tax Incentive general eligibility criteria from the 2020-21 income year – refer to page 54 of this TIB). Cap $255,000. The total labour-related taxes (PAYE, FBT, and ESCT) paid by the claimant (exceptions and grouping rules apply). Availability In the 2019-20 income year only (if a claimant opts to apply these instead of the new broader refundability rules – otherwise, the broader refundability rules apply by default). From the 2019-20 income year onwards (these rules now apply by default to any eligible claimants). Detailed analysis No separate eligibility rules for refundable R&D tax credits (sections LA 5(4B) and LY 3, and subpart MX) Under the new broader refundability rules, businesses do not need to satisfy the corporate eligibility or wage intensity requirements (these had to be satisfied under the previous limited refundability rules). This means that provided a business is eligible for the R&D tax credit, and is either in a tax loss position or has insufficient income tax payable to fully utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the relevant income year, the business may access refundable R&D tax credits up to its refundability cap. Page 45 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 New refundability cap (sections LA 5(4B), (5B), (5C), and section YA 1) The new refundability cap replaces the previous $255,000 cap (which applies under the limited refundability rules). Under the new cap, a business that is unable to offset all of its R&D tax credits against its income tax liability may receive refundable R&D tax credits equal to or less than the amount of labour-related taxes (PAYE, FBT, and ESCT) they have paid for the relevant income year. That is, the maximum amount of refundable R&D tax credits the business can claim in an income year is the lesser of:  the amount of labour-related taxes paid by the business for the relevant income year; or  the amount of R&D tax credits claimed by the business. Example 7: Full refund of credits under the refundability cap In the year ended 31 March 2021, EmmaCorp has eligible R&D expenditure of $1 million, so it is eligible for $150,000 of R&D tax credits. The company has 12 employees and pays a total of $200,000 in labour related taxes (this amount is EmmaCorp's refundability cap). EmmaCorp has no income tax to pay in the 2020–21 income year. Because its R&D tax credits ($150,000) are less than its refundability cap ($200,000) for the year, EmmaCorp can receive a refund of all its R&D tax credits. Variation of facts: Partial refund of credits under the refundability cap If EmmaCorp had only 6 employees and paid a total of $100,000 in labour-related taxes for the year, it would have a refundability cap of $100,000. Only $100,000 of its R&D tax credits would be refundable. EmmaCorp meets the shareholder continuity requirements, so the remaining $50,000 of R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the 2021–22 income year. Levy body researchers and expenditure on approved research providers The new cap does not apply to refundable R&D tax credits paid to levy body researchers or derived from eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Page 46 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 8: Credits paid to levy bodies are fully refundable Levy Body A (LBA) is an industry organisation to which levies are payable under the Commodity Levies Act 1990. LBA incurred $1,000,000 of eligible R&D expenditure in the year ended 31 March 2021. It has no income tax liability and pays $50,000 of labour-related taxes for the year. LBA receives a full refund of its $150,000 R&D tax credits, because the new refundability cap does not apply to levy body researchers. Levy Body A – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure $1,000,000 x 15% R&D tax credits claimed $150,000 Income tax liability $0 R&D tax credits refunded $150,000 Example 11 illustrates how the new broader refundability rules apply to eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Cap can include taxes paid by other companies The refundability cap has grouping rules, which allow certain companies to allocate labour- related taxes they have paid to other companies they control or that sit within the same wholly owned group. The formula for calculating the refundability cap is: Own tax + other wholly owned tax + other controller tax − double-dip allocation Page 47 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Term Definition Own tax The labour-related taxes paid by a claimant for the relevant tax year. Other wholly owner tax The total labour-related taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a member of the claimant’s wholly owned group for the relevant tax year. Other controller tax The total labour-related taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a company that controls the claimant for the relevant tax year. Double dip allocation Any amounts included in the claimant’s refundability cap that have already been included in the refundability cap of another person (see explanation and example 10 below). Example 9 illustrates how the grouping rules apply. Example 9: Grouping rules Misto Labs is an R&D-intensive firm eligible for $400,000 of R&D tax credits in the 2021-22 income year. It is in a tax loss position, so does not have any income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. Its refundability cap is made up of the following amounts: Misto's refundability cap for the 2021-22 income year Formula component Amount Explanation Own tax $75,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Misto this year. Other wholly owned tax $100,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Zeus Industries this year. Zeus is a company in the same wholly-owned group as Misto. Zeus has $200,000 of its own labour- related taxes but allocates $100,000 to Misto. Other controller tax $100,000 Total PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by ZigCo this year. ZigCo controls Misto (it holds 65% of the shares in Misto). Page 48 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Double-dip allocation ($0) No amounts allocated to Misto by Zeus or ZigCo have been used by, or allocated to, other businesses for the purposes of calculating a refundability cap. Misto's total cap $275,000 Since Misto has a refundability cap of $275,000, it can obtain an R&D tax credit refund for $275,000 of its credits. Its remaining $125,000 of R&D tax credits are non-refundable in the 2021-22 income year. Misto can carry these non-refundable credits forward to the 2022-23 income year provided it satisfies the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity requirements. The “double-dip allocation” part of the formula strips out any amounts allocated to a claimant that have already been allocated to another person. This prevents the same taxes going towards more than one claimant’s labour-related tax-based cap. It is important that any given amount of labour-related taxes is only allocated to one claimant. Example 10: Grouping rules with double-dip allocation Same facts as example 9, except ZigCo claims $100,000 of R&D tax credits, half of which it offsets against its income tax payable. As with the previous example, ZigCo has paid $100,000 of PAYE, ESCT and FBT for the year. ZigCo indicates in its supplementary return that it has a refundability cap of $50,000, and so receives an R&D tax credit refund of its remaining $50,000 of credits. Despite this, ZigCo informs Misto that it will allocate $100,000 of labour-related taxes to Misto. Because ZigCo has already used $50,000 of its own labour-related taxes for its refundability cap, the double- dip allocation rules apply. Misto's refundability cap for the 2021-22 income year (fact variation) Formula component Amount Explanation Own tax $75,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Misto this year. Other wholly owned tax $100,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Zeus Industries this year. Zeus is a company in the same wholly-owned group as Misto. Zeus has $200,000 of its own labour- Page 49 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 related taxes but allocates $100,000 to Misto. Other controller tax $100,000 Total PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by ZigCo this year. ZigCo controls Misto (it holds 65% of the shares in Misto). Double-dip allocation ($ 50 ,000) ZigCo has allocated $100,000 to Misto, of which it has already used $50,000 for its own refundability cap. The same amount of tax can only go towards one person’s refundability cap, so the $50,000 already used by ZigCo must not be included in Misto’s cap. Misto's total cap $225,000 The $50,000 “double-dip allocation” is subtracted from the other amounts included in Misto's refundability cap, because this amount has already been included in ZigCo's cap. After deducting the double-dip allocation amount, Misto's refundability cap is $225,000. Ordering rules for R&D tax credits (sections LA 5(4B) and LA 6(2)) Amended section LA 5(4B) retains a reference to section LA 6(2), which relates to the treatment of refundable tax credits. Any R&D tax credits claimed by a person must first be used to satisfy their income tax liability, if any, for the income year to which the credits relate (note that non-refundable R&D tax credits are applied to satisfy income tax liability before refundable R&D tax credits). Once a person has used their credits to satisfy their income tax liability for that year, different rules apply depending on whether any remaining R&D tax credits are refundable or non- refundable. Page 50 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Table 2: Rules for the treatment of remaining R&D tax credits Non-refundable credits Refundable tax credits Any remaining non-refundable tax credits can only be offset against income tax liabilities in the current year and must then be carried forward. Before any remaining refundable R&D tax credits can be refunded, the credits must first be applied to any other liabilities in this order:  an income tax liability for the current year;  an income tax liability for a previous year;  an income tax liability for a future tax year;  a current provisional tax liability for a future tax year; and  a different tax period or type (as requested by the claimant, or as applied by Inland Revenue if the claimant has any other tax outstanding). Example 11 illustrates the application of the ordering rules. Example 11: Refundable credits from approved research provider expenditure and application of ordering rules In the year ended 31 March 2021, Kimmie’s Lab Ltd (KLL) incurred $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure. Of the $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure, $30,000 was incurred on eligible R&D activities performed by an approved research provider. KLL had $2,000 of income tax payable for the year and did not pay any labour-related taxes. KLL is eligible for $7,500 of R&D tax credits:  $4,500 of refundable R&D tax credits ($30,000 of approved research provider expenditure × 15%); and  $3,000 of non-refundable R&D tax credits ($20,000 of other eligible R&D expenditure). Before receiving an R&D tax credit refund, KLL’s R&D tax credits must first be offset against its income tax liability for the year. KLL offsets $2,000 of its non-refundable R&D credits against its income tax liability of $2,000. KLL receives an R&D tax credit refund of $4,500 for the income year. Its $1,000 of surplus non-refundable R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the 2021–22 income year provided KLL satisfies the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity requirements. Page 51 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Kimmie’s Lab Ltd – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure on ARP $30,000 Other eligible R&D expenditure $20,000 Total eligible R&D expenditure $50,000 Eligible R&D expenditure not on ARP $20,000 x 15% Non-refundable R&D tax credits $3,000 Income tax liability $2,000 Less non-refundable R&D tax credits ($3,000) Non-refundable R&D tax credits carried forward to 2021–22 ($1,000) Eligible R&D expenditure on ARP $30,000 x 15% Refundable R&D tax credits $4,500 The limited refundability rules (sections LA 5(5D) and LZ 14) Section LZ 14 provides the limited refundability rules (which were previously in LA 5(4B)), which businesses can choose to apply instead of the broader refundability rules, if this is their preference and they are eligible under the limited refundability rules. Under the limited refundability rules, a business may receive R&D tax credit refunds provided it is a company and:  is in a tax loss position, or has insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year;  satisfies the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria in sections MX 2 and MX 3; Page 52 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  does not derive exempt income, and is not associated with a person who derives exempt income;  is not a listed company, and is not associated with a listed company; and  does not have an outstanding tax liability. Only the first $255,000 of the business’s R&D tax credits is refundable, which is equivalent to $1.7 million of eligible R&D expenditure. Any remaining R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the 2020–21 income year if the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. Choosing between the year 1 and year 2 refundability rules Businesses may choose to use the limited refundability rules (new section LZ 14) or the broader refundability rules (section LA 5) in the 2019–20 income year, but they cannot use both. Only the broader refundability rules are available from the 2020–21 income year. Example 12: Applying the broader refundability rules Moppy’s Chicken Factory (“Moppy”) has brought forward tax losses from the 2018–19 income year to the 2019–20 income year. It claims R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year but does not have enough income tax to pay to use all of its credits. Moppy determines that it will be able to receive more refundable R&D tax credits if it applies the broader refundability rules, because it has $500,000 of surplus R&D tax credits and has paid $500,000 of PAYE in the 2019–20 income year (so its refundability cap is $500,000). Moppy files its income tax and R&D supplementary returns soon after 31 March 2020. It advises Inland Revenue that it would like to apply the broader refundability rules. Inland Revenue processes Moppy’s claim and refunds Moppy $500,000 of R&D tax credits. Page 53 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Foreign tertiary education organisations and Callaghan innovation not eligible for R&D tax credits Section LY 3(2)(d)(iii) and (iv) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Foreign tertiary education organisations and Callaghan Innovation are excluded from the tax credit, as are their associates and any entities they control. These exclusions apply from the 2019–20 income year. Background The R&D tax credit regime is intended to encourage business R&D. Consequently, tertiary education organisations (as well as their associates, and any entities they control), are excluded from the regime. The amendment clarifies that overseas tertiary education organisations come within the scope of the exclusion. Callaghan Innovation is a Government agency and is helping Inland Revenue administer the R&D tax credit. For the avoidance of doubt, this amendment ensures that Callaghan Innovation, entities it controls, and any of its associates cannot claim the R&D tax credit. Key features Section LY 3(2)(d) is amended to exclude:  foreign tertiary education organisations – section LY 3(2)(d)(iii); and  Callaghan Innovation – section LY 3(2)(d)(iv). These exclusions apply from the 2019–20 income year, so that they can be incorporated into the processing and administration of year 1 claims. Page 54 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Certain tax-exempt entities not eligible for R&D tax credits Sections LY 3(2)(f), LY 8, and YA 1 (definitions of exempt income and levy body researcher) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Entities which receive exempt income under sections CW 38, CW 39, CW 40, CW 41, CW 42 and/or CW 55BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 are ineligible for the R&D tax credit from the 2020–21 income year. This exclusion does not apply to industry levy bodies. Background The aim of this exclusion is to prevent entities which already derive substantial benefits from the tax system, in the form of deriving mostly tax-exempt income, from accessing further benefits via the tax credit. Charities, which come within the tax-exempt entity exclusion, do not pay income tax, and receive additional Government support in the form of GST concessions, exemption from FBT, and the donor tax credit regime. Note that this section of the TIB includes amendments made by the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020. Key features From the 2020–21 income year (“year 2”), entities which receive exempt income under these sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 are excluded from the R&D tax credit:  section CW 38 (public authorities);  section CW 39 (local authorities);  section CW 40 (local and regional promotion bodies);  sections CW 41 and CW 42 (charities); and  section CW 55BA (tertiary education institutions and their subsidiaries). Page 55 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 These excluded entities may be eligible in the 2019–20 income year. Therefore, any tax credits received by these entities for the 2019–20 income year that have not been offset against income tax payable, or refunded, for the 2019–20 income year are extinguished from the 2020–21 income year. Example 13: Charity’s year 1 credits extinguished In the year ended 31 March 2020, Charity X claims $100,000 of R&D tax credits. As Charity X does not pay income tax, it has no income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. It does not pay any labour-related taxes, so is unable to receive any R&D tax credit refunds. Charity X has a standard 31 March balance date. Its $100,000 of R&D tax credits from year 1 cannot be refunded in year 1, and also cannot be brought forward to year 2. They are extinguished from 1 April 2020. Charity X also ceases to be eligible for the R&D tax credit from this date. Some entities which receive tax-exempt income under these sections in subpart CW may not wholly sit outside the tax system and may perform business R&D. To allow these entities to cl aim (such as through an R&D performing taxpaying subsidiary), this exclusion does not include broader association rules. Entities associated with tax-exempt entities affected by this exclusion may still claim the credit, if they otherwise satisfy the credit’s eligibility criteria. Levy body researchers (defined in section YA 1 as industry organisations to which levies are payable under an Act) are not affected by this exclusion, so may be eligible even if they receive exempt income under any of the above sections. R&D performed by levy bodies is typically funded by businesses in the relevant industry for these businesses’ benefit, so levy body R&D is fundamentally business R&D. This exclusion does not include broader association rules in relation to entities excluded for deriving these kinds of tax-exempt income. A subsidiary taxpaying business is not ineligible for the credit merely because it is owned by an entity which derives excluded tax-exempt income. This means that an excluded entity which undertakes eligible R&D may set up a non-tax-exempt subsidiary to claim the credit. Example 14: Subsidiary not ineligible merely because parent derives exempt income Charitech is a charity which performs R&D to support its charitable work. It performs R&D on adapting traditional plant medicines so that they can be used alongside modern medicine to achieve better health outcomes. Charitech would like to claim the R&D tax credit for its R&D in the 2020–21 income year, but because it derives exempt income it is ineligible to claim the credit in its own right. Page 56 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Charitech establishes a subsidiary company and shifts its R&D activities, so that the activities are performed by the subsidiary instead. The subsidiary does not derive any exempt income, so is not excluded from the credit through the exempt income exclusion. Assuming the subsidiary satisfies the other R&D tax credit eligibility criteria, it will be able to claim the credit, even though its parent organisation receives exempt income. Page 57 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Allocating credits to joint venture members Section LY 1(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment changes the joint venture credit allocation rules, so that R&D tax credits must be allocated to a member of an R&D performing joint venture based on their interest in the joint venture. Background The joint venture allocation rules in section LY 1(4) previously required R&D tax credits to be allocated in accordance with a claimant’s interest in the income of an R&D performing joint venture. The rules now allocate credits in accordance with the claimant’s interest in the joint venture, without reference to income. This ensures the provision operates as intended for joint ventures regardless of whether they derive income. Key features Section LY 1(4) is amended to remove references to income. The onus is on joint venture members to use an appropriate methodology to determine their interests in the joint venture for the relevant income year. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Page 58 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Internal software development changes Section YA 1 (definition of internal software development expenditure) of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment broadens the definition of internal software development expenditure subject to the $25 million cap, so that it includes all software development expenditure that is not external software development or software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration. Background The policy intent is for software development expenditure to come within the $25 million cap if it is not software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration (which is completely excluded) or external software development (which is not limited by a special expenditure cap). Before this amendment, it was unclear whether the $25 million cap covered all internal software development expenditure. This amendment resolves this ambiguity by clearly bringing all expenditure on software development within the $25 million cap, unless the expenditure is on external software development or internal software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration. Key features The definition of “internal software development expenditure” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to ensure the $25 million cap applies to all activities that normally considered internal software development (such as operational internal software development). The expanded definition covers any software development expenditure that is not:  software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration of a person’s business or their associate’s business (this comes within the existing definition of “ineligible internal software development” in section YA 1); or  external software development expenditure. Page 59 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Detailed analysis A $25 million expenditure cap applies to all internal software development. This means that a person can only claim $25 million of expenditure on this kind of software development in their income year, regardless of how much they have actually spent. The cap applies to any software developed for internal purposes unrelated to administration. This includes such purposes as manufacturing, testing, quality control, or enhancing non- digital services to customers. Example 15: Software developed for non-administrative internal purposes Eugene works for a manufacturing company developing shatter-resistant glass for car windscreens. He develops software that can track stresses on the glass during impact testing in very fine detail, increasing the quality of the testing process. This satisfies the definition of internal software development expenditure, as the software being developed is solely for internal use in improving the quality of the testing process. As it is unrelated to back office administrative purposes, the expenditure Eugene's business incurred to develop the software is eligible - however, it is subject to the $25 million cap. Software that enhances non-digital services to customers A service is a non-digital service if the main reason why the person’s customers use it is to obtain the service, not to use the software (even though that service may be enabled, supported, or facilitated by the software). This type of expenditure comes within the $25 million cap, as it is considered expenditure on internal software development. Example 16: Software that enhances non-digital services to customers Mohammed runs a courier business and develops software that enables his customers to pinpoint the exact location and condition of their packages. This satisfies the definition of internal software development expenditure, because Mohammed's customers are using his services to receive the goods he delivers, not to use the software Mohammed has developed. Page 60 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The expenditure Mohammed's business incurred to develop the software is subject to the $25 million cap. Association rules apply to limit the amount claimable by associated persons The $25 million cap groups a person’s expenditure with internal software development already claimed by the person’s associates. The rationale behind applying the cap to associated persons is to prevent the cap from being circumvented by the person splitting their expenditure across associates to effectively exceed the cap. For partnerships and look-through companies, the cap is applied at the partnership or look- through company level (rather than the partner or individual owner level). Example 17: Associated persons with internal software development expenditure SL Ltd incurs $20 million of internal software development expenditure and XW Ltd incurs $11.5 million. SL Ltd and XW Ltd are wholly owned by NB Ltd. As XW Ltd and SL Ltd are associated persons for tax purposes, their combined claim may not exceed $25 million. This means that $6.5 million of their combined expenditure (which totals $31.5 million) is not eligible because it exceeds the internal software development cap. Page 61 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 General approval of supporting activities Schedule 21, part B, clause 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Businesses in the general approval regime must obtain approval of their supporting activities for these activities to be eligible for the tax credit. Background Various amendments were made to the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill in response to submissions made to the Bill at the Select Committee stage. This included an amendment to the scope of general approval. In the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced, general approval only applied to core activities. At the Select Committee stage, the Bill was amended following submissions requesting general approval be extended to cover supporting activities as well. This was to provide businesses with added certainty that their R&D would be eligible for the credit. A clause equivalent to schedule 21, part A, clause 24 should have been added into schedule 21, part B at the time these other changes were made – this was the policy intent. This amendment adds new clause 12 into schedule 21, part B, to ensure the legislation is consistent with the policy intent. This new clause clarifies that supporting activities are ineligible if they have not been approved. This amendment applies from year 2 of the R&D tax credit regime (the 2020–21 income year), so that it can be incorporated into the administration of the tax credit once in-year approval is rolled out in year 2. Key features This amendment adds clause 12 to schedule 21, part B of the Income Tax Act 2007, which lists activities that are excluded from the definition of supporting R&D activity. This clause provides that an activity is not eligible as a supporting activity if it has not been approved under the general approval regime (if the general approval regime applies to the person cl aiming the activity). Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. Page 62 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 General approval binds the Commissioner Section 68CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 When an R&D activity is approved under the general approval regime, that approval is binding on the Commissioner. Background The general approval regime is intended to provide customers with certainty that their R&D activities will be eligible for the credit during (or soon after) the income year in which those activities take place. Prior to this amendment, general approval was not binding on the Commissioner. This meant she could change her view as to whether an activity was a core or supporting activity, even if she had approved the activity as part of the general approval process. The policy intent has always been for general approval to be binding on the Commissioner. To that end, once granted, approval by the Commissioner is binding provided all the conditions of the general approval legislation are met. Key features This amendment makes general approval (both for the pilot and for the full scheme) binding on the Commissioner, provided a claimant fulfils the requirements set out in section 68CB. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year for the pilot and the 2020–21 income year for the full general approval scheme. Page 63 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Criteria and methodologies approval mandatory for significant performers Section 68CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Criteria and methodologies approval (“CAM”) is mandatory for a person who opts into the significant performer regime from the 2020–21 income year. Background From the 2020–21 income year, all businesses seeking to receive R&D tax credits are required to obtain general approval or, if they qualify, opt into the significant performer regime. A business can be eligible for the significant performer regime if it reasonably expects to have more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year. The significant performer regime is intended to provide large R&D performers with an alternative to the general approval regime, because the compliance and administrative costs associated with obtaining general approval for large amounts of R&D activities may outweigh the benefit of the R&D tax credit for these businesses. Businesses who spend significant amounts on R&D will still want certainty regarding their R&D tax credit claims. This led to the creation of the CAM regime, which was (prior to this enactment) optional for businesses in the significant performer regime. This amendment makes the CAM regime mandatory, which should:  Provide businesses who opt out of general approval (which is mandatory for businesses that are not in the significant performer regime) with more comfort regarding the eligibility of their activities and expenditure.  Reduce the cost of obtaining R&D certificates (which businesses in the significant performer regime are required to obtain). This is because providing R&D certificates to businesses with CAMs requires significantly less work for R&D certifiers. This should reduce compliance costs for these claimants.  Ensure businesses engage with officials regarding their R&D tax credit claims earlier in the claims process. This should reduce the need for later scrutiny and reduce the likelihood of claims being reassessed (and penalties and interest later being imposed). Page 64 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features A person who opts into the significant performer regime must now obtain criteria and methodologies approval for their R&D activity and expenditure. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. Page 65 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Timeframe for completing disputes process Sections 108(1E) and 113E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This amendment allows the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards if the person has initiated the disputes process through issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) within four months of filing their income tax return or a year after their income tax return due date. Background A person can only file a NOPA to increase their R&D tax credit claim once for each R&D tax credit claim they make. Prior to this amendment, the legislation required the disputes process to be completed within a year of a person’s income tax return due date if the person sought to increase their R&D tax credit claim. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is that a person must initiate the disputes process within a year of their income tax return due date. These rules regarding initiating disputes are aimed at preventing the retrospective reclassification of expenditure. The retrospective reclassification of expenditure includes where R&D activities or expenditure are identified after the end of an income year. If a person receives R&D tax credits for R&D they were unaware of at the time the R&D activities took place, the R&D tax credit regime has not provided any incentive to the person to undertake additional R&D. The retrospective reclassification of expenditure has been problematic in other jurisdictions. The amendment will require a person to initiate the disputes process by filing a NOPA within a year of their income tax return due date but does not require the disputes process to be completed within this time frame. This time limit is intended to provide a person with enough time to prepare the required information to file a NOPA while nevertheless discouraging the retrospective reclassification of expenditure. Key features The amendments to sections 108(1E) and 113E allow the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards, if the person has initiated the disputes process through issuing a NOPA before the earlier of:  four months of filing their income tax return; or  a year after their income tax return due date. Page 66 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Provided the NOPA has been filed within these timeframes, there is no specific deadline by which the disputes process must be completed. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year, so that the policy intent is met for the administration of year 1 claims. Page 67 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Approved research providers must perform core R&D activities Section 124ZH of the Tax Administration Act 1994 To become an approved research provider, a person must be able to perform core R&D activities. Background Businesses can access various concessions through approved research providers:  A person needs to incur at least $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure in an income year to claim the R&D tax credit. However, amounts under $50,000 may be eligible where the person uses an approved research provider to perform the R&D on their behalf.  Eligible amounts spent on approved research providers may be refunded in full, if the person has surplus R&D tax credits (for example, if they are in a tax loss position or do not have enough income tax to pay to offset all their R&D tax credits against). The policy intent is for an organisation to only be eligible to become an approved research provider if they can perform core R&D activities. These are activities that involve attempting to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Previously, the legislation only required that an approved research provider be able to perform core or supporting activities for their clients. This meant an entity could become an approved research provider, even if it was only able to perform supporting R&D activities (which do not need to involve the resolution of any scientific or technological uncertainty, in and of themselves, to be eligible). This amendment changes the requirements to become an approved research provider, so that a person must be able to perform core R&D activities to become an approved research provider. Key features The requirements for approving a person’s application to become an approved research provider are amended to specify that, in addition to the other existing requirements, a person must be able to perform core R&D activities. Page 68 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year, so that it can be incorporated into the processing and administration of year 1 claims. Page 69 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Declining R&D certifier applications Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment clarifies the circumstances in which a person’s accepted R&D certifier application must be declined, by explicitly providing that the Commissioner must decline a person’s application where approving the person as an accepted R&D certifier would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Background Accepted R&D certifiers are able to provide R&D certificates to claimants in the significant performer regime. From the 2020–21 income year, all claimants will be required to either obtain activity approval under the general approval regime or opt into the significant performer regime. Significant performers must provide R&D certificates to the Commissioner with their R&D supplementary returns. The amendment provides the Commissioner with another ground for declining a person’s application to be an accepted R&D certifier. The amendment is consistent with the policy intent, which is that the Commissioner should be able to decline a person’s application where their status as an accepted R&D certifier would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. It is arguable that the Commissioner already has this ability because of section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the avoidance of doubt, however, this amendment clarifies that the Commissioner must decline a person’s application in these circumstances. Key features Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended so that the Commissioner must decline a person’s application to become an accepted R&D certifier, where approving the person’s application would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. Page 70 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Revoking R&D certifier status Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment extends the circumstances in which the Commissioner must revoke a person’s accepted R&D certifier status. The amendment requires the Commissioner to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier where the accepted R&D certifier has provided an R&D certificate to another person in the last 2 years who has entered into a tax avoidance arrangement for R&D tax credits, or where allowing the accepted R&D certifier to retain their R&D certifier status would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Background Claimants in the significant performer regime must obtain an R&D certificate from an accepted R&D certifier. The amendment to section 124ZI is consistent with the policy intent, which is not reflected in full by this provision as currently enacted. It provides the Commissioner with additional grounds to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier. Revoking approvals with adverse effect on tax system integrity As with the other remedial amendment to section 124ZI regarding declining a person’s application to be an accepted R&D certifier, the policy intent is that a person would have their approval revoked if their retaining it would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. It is arguable that even without this amendment, the Commissioner already has this ability because of section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the avoidance of doubt, however, this amendment clarifies that the Commissioner must revoke a person’s accepted R&D certifier status in these circumstances. Providing certificates to participants of tax avoidance arrangements The legislation already allows the Commissioner to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier if they have provided an R&D certificate in the last 2 years to a person who received shortfall penalties arising from tax evasion and taking an abusive tax position (this is through the references in section 124ZI(7)(b) to sections 141D and 141E). Tax avoidance may not always involve taking an abusive tax position, however, so this amendment makes it so that providing an R&D certificate to a person who enters into a tax avoidance arrangement is another ground on which the Commissioner must revoke a person’s approval. Page 71 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended so that in addition to the grounds under which the Commissioner could previously revoke a person’s approval, the Commissioner must also revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier where:  allowing the person to retain their approval would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system; or  the person has provided an R&D certificate to another person, and that other person has entered into a tax avoidance arrangement for R&D tax credits within the last two years. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. Page 72 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Challenging the Commissioner’s decisions Section 138E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment prevents a person from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made for the pilot approval scheme and exceeding the $120 million cap. Background Pilot approval scheme A pilot approval regime is in place in year 1 of the R&D tax credit scheme (the 2019–20 income year). The pilot is aimed at enabling the Commissioner to test and refine the in-year approval regimes before they are rolled out more broadly in year 2 (the 2020–21 income year). To take part in the pilot, both the Commissioner and a person must agree that the person will take part in the pilot. The person is required to submit an approval application by a prescribed date, which the Commissioner will then approve or decline. There is a legislative requirement that the Commissioner notify the person of her intent to decline their application before declining it. This is to provide the person with an opportunity to provide additional information in support of their application where appropriate. This amendment stops taxpayers from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made for the pilot approval scheme, other than through judicial review. This is through adding sections 68CB and 68CC to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from the 2019–20 income year. Exceeding the $120 million cap There is a cap of $120 million on the amount of eligible R&D expenditure for which a person can claim R&D tax credits. This equates to a cap of $18 million R&D tax credits. A person can apply to exceed the $120 million cap by applying for an approved R&D cap. The Commissioner can approve an application for an approved R&D cap if the Commissioner:  is satisfied the relevant R&D activities give rise to substantial net benefit for New Zealand; and  has consulted with the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Page 73 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The amendment stops taxpayers from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions regarding approved R&D caps. This is through adding section 68CD to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from the 2019–20 income year. No right to challenge in other parts of R&D tax credit regime Section 138E already prevents a person from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made about:  approved research providers (sections 124ZH and 138E(1)(e)(iv));  R&D certificates and certifiers (sections 124ZI and 138E(1)(e)(iv));  general approval from the 2020–21 income year (sections 68CB and 138(1)(e)(iv)); and  the significant performer regime from the 2020–21 income year (sections 68CC and 138E(1)(e)(iv)). Adding sections 68CB, 68CC and 68CD to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from the 2019–20 income year is consistent with the approach taken in the rest of the regime regarding decisions made by the Commissioner. It is also consistent with the policy intent, which is for decisions made by the Commissioner regarding the R&D tax credit to be final and not subject to challenge other than through judicial review. Key features Decisions made by the Commissioner on the these matters cannot be challenged: participation in the pilot approval scheme (sections 68CB and 68CC); applications to exceed the $120 million cap on eligible expenditure (section 68CD). Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Page 74 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Amendment to part-year override of section LY 3(2)(b) Section LZ 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 This amendment corrects a drafting error. It is intended to ensure that section LZ 13 operates as intended. Section LZ 13 relates to claimants with late balance dates who receive Callaghan Innovation Growth Grants in the 2020–21 income year. It enables these claimants to be eligible for the R&D tax credit for the part of that year, after 31 March 2021, for which they do not receive Growth Grant payments. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 income year. Page 75 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Overseas donee status Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 These charities have been granted donee status from the 2019–20 and later income years:  Little Brothers and Sisters International;  Partners Relief & Development – New Zealand;  Project Moroto; and  UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated. The Act also makes changes to other existing charities listed on schedule 32:  “Hope Street Charitable Trust” replaces “Orphans Refugees and Aid (ORA International) of NZ Charitable Trust” with effect from 15 June 2019.  “Onesight New Zealand” is removed with effect from 30 May 2019. Background New Zealand-based charities that apply some or all of their funds for overseas purposes and want donors to receive tax benefits in connection with any donations received, must be named as a donee organisation on the list of recipient of charitable or other public benefit gifts in the Income Tax Act 2007. Donee status entitles individual donors to a tax credit of 331/3 percent of the amount donated to these organisations, up to the level of their taxable income. Companies and Māori Authorities are eligible for a deduction for monetary donations up to the level of their net income. Application dates The new insertions apply from the 2019–20 and later income years. The other changes to the schedule apply from the dates specified above. Page 76 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Refunding overpaid PIE tax Sections BC 7, CX 56, HM 6, HM 36B, LA 6, LS 2, YA 1 “PIE schedular income”, “residual income tax", “schedular income” of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections 22C and 22D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 A number of amendments have been made to introduce a year end square up process for tax on individuals’ multi-rate portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, such as KiwiSaver schemes. This process uses individuals’ correct prescribed investor rate (PIR) to determine whether the right amount of tax has been paid on this income during the tax year. Individuals’ multi-rate PIE income is taxed separately as PIE schedular income at the PIR. An adjustment is made to the amount of the person’s income tax liability at year end for over- or under- payments of tax by the PIE during the tax year. This adjustment or PIE square-up will happen alongside the year-end process for income tax. Any refund due or tax payable resulting from over- or underpayment of tax on PIE income during the tax year is added to the investor’s end of year tax position and is either refunded, payable or reduces the person’s tax payable or reduces a person’s tax refund. Other miscellaneous amendments have also been made to ensure the new PIE rules are integrated smoothly into the tax system. All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Background The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles where investors combine resources to make different types of passive investments, for example a managed fund and KiwiSaver. A multi-rate PIE attributes income, losses and tax credits to investors. The tax rate applied to these types of PIEs varies from investor to investor and may vary from year to year for individual investors, depending on their income in the two previous tax years. The PIE pays tax on the PIE income of each investor based on the rate notified by their investor. If an investor does not notify a rate, the default rate of 28% applies. Previously individuals’ income from multi-rate PIE investment was generally excluded income, unless the investor had underpaid tax on their PIE income because they notified their PIE provider with a rate that is too low. Where PIE tax has been underpaid (when the investor has notified a rate that is too low), the investor had to include their PIE income in their income tax return and it was taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate, which may be up to 33%, whereas the top PIR is 28%. The Page 77 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 investor has a tax credit in the year-end income tax calculation for tax already paid on PIE income during the tax year. When the correct PIR was used or where a too high rate had been used, income from a multi-rate PIE remained excluded income and did not flow through to the investor’s individual income tax return and assessment. This meant that where an individual has overpaid tax on multi-rate PIE income (for example, because the investor has notified a rate that is too high or has defaulted onto the highest PIR of 28%) the PIE investor could not get the overpaid amount refunded. The amendments ensure that individuals’ PIE income from multi-rate PIEs is taxed at individuals’ correct PIR with an adjustment to their terminal tax at year end for over- or under- payments of tax made during the tax year. Key features The changes to the PIE rules will mean that all natural person individuals with income from multi-rate PIEs will have an end of year square up of this income using their correct PIR. An adjustment to their terminal tax for the tax year is made for over- or under- payments of tax on that PIE income during the tax year. The key changes are as follows.  Income of natural persons from multi-rate PIEs is no longer excluded income, but PIE schedular income. The tax rates applicable to this type of income, the prescribed investor rates under Schedule 6, clause 1, remain unchanged.  Inland Revenue will add individuals’ income from a multi-rate PIE, which is added to the list of “reportable income”, to individuals’ pre-populated accounts alongside the other income information for the tax year.  Inland Revenue will calculate the tax liability on attributed multi-rate PIE income using individuals’ correct PIRs based on the income information Inland Revenue holds and will make adjustments to account for any over- or underpayments that may have occurred in relation to the tax paid on that income by the PIE during the tax year.  Inland Revenue will calculate any adjustment resulting in a refund or tax to pay in relation to PIE schedular income without the individual needing to do anything. Refunds will be paid out or will reduce their terminal tax payable without individuals having to request them and tax payable will be added to individuals’ income tax liability for the tax year. Page 78 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The changes apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis PIE schedular income The new rules apply to income derived by a natural person investor in a multi-rate PIE. This income is now schedular income under section BC 7. An amount of attributed multi-rate PIE income that a natural person who is an investor in a multi-rate PIE derives under section CP 1 (Attributed income of investors in multi-rate PIEs) to which the prescribed rates of tax set out in Schedule 6, clause 1 (Prescribed rates: PIE investments and retirement scheme contributions) apply is “PIE schedular income” (section HM 36B(6) and the definition of “PIE schedular income” in section YA 1). Calculation of PIE schedular income tax liability and adjustment The income tax liability on PIE schedular income is calculated under section HM 36B. This calculation determines whether an adjustment needs to be made by comparing the tax paid by the PIE, with the tax liability when using the correct PIR based on the income information Inland Revenue holds about an individual. The calculation also considers the tax already paid on the attributed income by the PIE as a tax credit and any credits used by the PIE to satisfy the investor’s income tax liability, such as foreign tax credits and imputation credits. This is to ensure that these tax credits are not double counted or taken away through the adjustment calculation. Multi-rate PIE income from individuals who have advised a notified investor rate that is lower than their prescribed investor rate will no longer be subject to the individual’s marginal tax rate, but will be taxed at the investor’s PIR (capped at 28%). Any amount of tax that has been under-paid (section HM 36B(4) Positive adjustment) is included in the investor’s schedular income tax liability for the tax year and modifies the investor’s income tax liability for the tax year (section BC 7). The amount of an adjustment under section HM 36B is not included in residual income tax, for a person and for a tax year, so that the residual income tax and provisional tax are not affected by the new PIE rules (see paragraph (f) in the definition of “residual income tax” in section YA 1). Any tax that has been overpaid (section HM 36B(5) Negative adjustment) is first applied to reduce the investor’s terminal tax payable (their tax bill) for the tax year. Any remaining Page 79 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 amount is refundable under sections RB 4, RM 2 to 8, and RM 10 (which relate to refunds and their use). Year-end process Calculating PIE schedular income adjustments for natural person investors under section HM 36B is done as part of individuals’ year-end income tax process. However, the new PIE rules will not alter individuals’ year-end information and filing obligations. The income from a multi-rate PIE attributed to an individual has been added to the list of “reportable income” in section 22D(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The information on PIE income attributed to an individual investor for a tax year is provided to Inland Revenue by the multi-rate PIE and will then be included in individuals’ pre-populated accounts. Inland Revenue will calculate any adjustment to the person’s terminal tax for an amount of PIE schedular income derived for a tax year without the individual needing to do anything. Refunds will be paid out or will reduce their terminal tax payable without individuals having to request them and tax payable will be added to individuals’ income tax liability for the tax year. A “qualifying individual” under section 22D is an individual who only earns reportable income for an income year and has no other income information that must be provided to Inland Revenue. “Qualifying individuals” will continue to be generally not required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue and in most cases their tax position, including their PIE schedular income tax, will be squared up automatically, without them having to do anything. Inl and Revenue will pay out refunds of overpaid tax on multi-rate PIE income without the individual having to provide information or confirm the tax position that Inland Revenue has calculated, unless the person is required to provide information or confirm for other reasons. An individual who earns both “reportable” and “other income” continues to be required to provide relevant information on the other income they earn and finalise their tax position themselves. They must ensure that the information included in their pre-populated account is correct and complete before they confirm their end of year assessment. If the individual wishes to file their return shortly after the end of the tax year, and before Inland Revenue will have received all reportable income information from the relevant third parties, including PIE schedular income information from a multi-rate PIE, they must ensure that they include this information in their tax return. It follows then that it may be easier for these individuals to wait until Inland Revenue has complete “reportable income” information before filing their return. Page 80 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Widening the Commissioner’s power to put investors on the correct prescribed investor rate Sections HM 60B and HM 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment widens the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s ability to provide a tax rate (prescribed investor rate) to a multi-rate portfolio investment entity (PIE) that it must apply to the investor’s attributed PIE income. Background The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles, including KiwiSaver schemes. A person investing in a multi-rate PIE is required to notify their PIE with a tax rate for the tax year, the notified investor rate. An investor’s correct PIE tax rate for a tax year is their prescribed investor rate (PIR), which approximates their marginal tax rate (capped at 28%) and is based on the lower of income in one of the previous two tax years. The multi-rate PIE pays tax on income attributed to individual investors based on the notified investor rate. Where the investor has not notified the PIE of a tax rate, the top 28% PIE tax rate applies by default. Changes made to Inland Revenue’s systems and processes as part of its Business Transformation programme mean that from 1 April 2019 Inland Revenue is now able to better identify instances where an investor’s PIE income is being taxed at an incorrect rate. Before the amendments, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue had an ability under section HM 60 to provide a PIE with a tax rate for an investor. However, this was limited to situations where the investor had provided the PIE with a notified investor rate and the Commissioner considered this notified rate not appropriate. It did not cover situations where the investor had not notified a rate and defaulted onto the top PIE tax rate of 28%. Key features New section HM 60B allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide multi-rate PIEs with their investors’ PIRs for the tax year where:  Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the investor’s PIR applicable for the tax year and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers the notified investor rate is inconsistent with the investor’s correct PIR  the investor has not notified their multi-rate PIE with a tax rate. Page 81 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The PIE must apply the rate provided by the Commissioner to the investor’s attributed PIE income as soon as reasonably practicable after having been notified of the rate by the Commissioner. The primary responsibility for determining an investor’s correct tax rate and notifying it to the PIE to ensure their PIE income is being taxed correctly remain with the investor. The investor therefore has the ability to subsequently notify their PIE with a different rate which the PIE then has to apply. Amendments to section HM 60 clarify that the “notified investor rate” refers to the rate given by the investor to the PIE. Application date The changes apply from 1 April 2020.

This review identified several areas in the current law that were unclear and did not appropriately reflect either the policy intent or how the Commissioner applies the law. These amendments to the trust rules address those concerns. The proposed amendments are:  remedial in nature; and  clarify the trust rules so that they work as intended, as described in IS 18/01. Background The amendments to the trust rules arise from an administrative review of the taxation of trusts. This review identified several areas in the current law that were unclear and did not appropriately reflect either the policy intent or how the Commissioner applies the law, as set out in IS 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01). Many submissions were received in the process of developing IS 18/01, and were considered in formulating the amendments discussed in this Tax Information Bulletin item. Key features The amendments in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters Act 2020 are consistent with the Commissioner’s application of law and with the policy intent. Page 83 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application dates The application date for each amendment is set out in each of the following items relating to the taxation of trusts. Page 84 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Clarifying the relationship between section BB 2 and BF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Section BB2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment provides consistency in terminology used in both of sections BB 2 and BF 1 of the ITA 2007. Key Features The core provisions of the ITA (the core provisions) impose:  income tax on taxable income, withholding taxes on some classes of income and other forms of tax (termed ancillary tax); and  provide the method for calculating a person’s income tax liability links to parts of the Act that set out detailed mechanisms for calculating withholding tax and ancillary taxes. The amendment ensures that the wording in section BB 2(5) refers to both income tax and ancillary tax, to provide consistency in terminology between sections BB 2(5) and BF 1 (ITA 2007). Application date The amendment applies from 23 March 2020. Page 85 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Residence of co–trustees treated as a notional single person Sections HC 2(2), (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background In the ITA 2007, the term trustee is defined to include all co-trustees for the time being. Under section HC 2 of the ITA 2007, co-trustees are treated as a notional single person for satisfying the income tax obligations for trustee income of that trust. Prior to the amendments to HC 2, which relate to the tax residence of co-trustees, the Commissioner considered that co-trustees of a trust were resident in New Zealand if at least one of those co-trustees was a New Zealand resident in their personal capacity. 3 This view is consistent with the long-standing policy intent. The amendments address questions raised in submissions about residence for co-trustees circumstances during the review of the taxation of trusts. The amendments give taxpayers greater certainty, and are consistent with the policy intent. The amendments to section HC 2 confirm the Commissioner’s view on how the ITA 2007 applies to determine the tax residence of co-trustees in IS 18/01. Residence is an important factor for compliance with taxation obligations in New Zealand because:  the trustee of the trust is the person responsible for calculating and satisfying the income tax liability;  residence of the trustee is relevant for determining if certain tax credits can be used in satisfying the income tax liability of the trustee; 3 Interpretation statement 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01) and Interpretation statement 16/03: Tax residence (IS 16/03). Page 86 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  payers of passive income need to know the residence status of an investor to determine the correct tax rate (for example, is the passive income subject to resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax); and  the residence of the trustee is more certain when considering the application of a double tax agreement to trustee income derived by co-trustees. If a trust has a sole trustee, the residence of the trustee is determined under the residence rules in section YD 4, determining residence based on their personal capacity. 4 Having determined tax residence on this basis, the sole trustee has always been required to satisfy their tax obligations, in their trustee capacity separate from their personal capacity. Prior to these amendments to section HC 2, In IS 16/03 and IS 18/01, 5 the Commissioner co nsidered that, for a trustee comprising of co-trustees, the trustee is resident in New Zealand if any one of the co-trustees is resident in New Zealand. This single notional person is also the person who:  derives the trustee income of the trust; and  satisfies all income tax obligations for that trustee income. Because a trustee is responsible for calculating the income tax liability for trustee income, it is necessary for the trustee to know their tax residence status to correctly apply:  the global /gross approach in the core provisions of the ITA 07 for calculating taxable income relating to trustee income of the trust. The global/gross approach taxes income sourced from New Zealand and the world-wide income derived by a New Zealand resident;  the rules in section HC 25 and HC 26 relating to foreign-sourced income derived by a trustee. These rules both require knowledge of the residence of the trustee; and the settlor of the trust; and 4 Interpretation statement 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01) and Interpretation statement 16/03: Tax residence (IS 16/03). 5 Interpretation statement 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01) and Interpretation statement 16/03: Tax residence (IS 16/03). Page 87 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  the rules relating to tax rates for a trustee that are applied by payers of passive income and PIE entities. The amendments to section HC 2 clarify the treatment of co-trustees in relation to residence, consistent with how the Commissioner applies the law and the policy intent. Key Features The amendments to section HC 2 clarify that at any point in time, or for a period, the trustee (as a notional single person) is a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes if at least one of the co-trustees is resident in New Zealand at that time or for that period. Correspondingly, the trustee (as a notional single person) is a non-resident only if all the co- trustees are non-resident at that time or for that period. The amendments also clarify that the residence of co-trustees of a trust is determined (for the purpose of:  calculating the trust’s taxable income for an income year;  providing a joint return of income for the trust for each income year;  self–assessing the trust’s taxable income and income tax liability for each income year;  determining the availability of foreign tax credits for foreign-sourced trustee income;  satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income of the trust for each income year;  satisfying withholding tax obligations for passive income distributed from the trust fund;  complying with obligations for notifying tax rates to payers of passive income and under the PIE rules, in both cases relating to investments owned by the trustee; and  satisfying the trustee’s obligations as an agent under section HC 32 for a distribution of beneficiary income and a taxable distribution. However, the amendments do not apply to a trustee comprised of co-trustees if that trustee has elected, under section HC 33 (the section HC 33 election), to pay New Zealand tax on the world-wide trustee income. A key effect of the section HC 33 election is that a trustee must determine their income tax obligations on the basis that the trustee and the settlor of the trust are resident in New Zealand (irrespective of the residence of the trustee). This obligation ensures that: Page 88 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  foreign sourced income derived by the trustee is taxable in New Zealand; and  passive income derived from New Zealand is subject to resident withholding tax. Application date The amendments apply for income years beginning on or after 23 March 2020. Detailed analysis The amendment to section HC 2(2) clarifies that treating a trustee comprising of co-trustees must meet all income tax obligations imposed under section BB 2 as a notional single person. Previously, this subsection only referred to the calculation of taxable income and satisfaction of the income tax liability for trustee income. New section HC 2(3) clarifies that, if a section HC 33 election is not made to pay New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income, the single notional person (a trustee comprising of co-trustees) is a New Zealand resident if any one of the co-trustees is resident in New Zealand in their own capacity. Correspondingly, if none of the co-trustees are resident in New Zealand in their own capacity, then the single notional person trustee is not resident in New Zealand. Section HC 2, as amended, clarifies and provides consistency of treatment across several rules that require a trustee, as a notional single person, to comply with tax obligations imposed under the ITA 007, including:  calculating and satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income. This includes the income tax liability arising following a section HC 33 election;  access to certain tax credits such as the foreign income tax credit; and  notifying banks and PIEs of the correct tax rate for passive income (that is, non- resident withholding tax rate or resident rate). Page 89 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 In addition, under section HC 32 the trustee must also satisfy the income tax obligations for beneficiary income unless the Commissioner agrees that the beneficiary can assume that obligation. 6 6 Section HD 4(2)(b) ITA 2007. Page 90 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Corpus of a trust Sections HC 4(1), (1B), YA 1 “transfer of value” of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to section HC 4 clarify the value of a settlement of property made on trust. Under general trust law, a settlement of property is treated as a single trust and the value of that property constitutes the corpus of that trust. Section HC 3 of the ITA 2007 modifies this general law to allow multiple settlements of property made to a trustee of a trust to be treated as being made on a single trust for income tax purposes. The amendments ensure that if multiple settlements are treated as being made on one trust, the value of the corpus of that trust is the aggregate value of those settlements. In addition, an unintended change in the rewrite of this provision relating to a transfer of value arising from a forgiveness of debt is corrected. The Income Tax Act 2004 included certain forgiveness of debt within the meaning of a disposition of property (which was included in the meaning of a settlement of property). This unintended change is corrected by amending the definition of “transfer of value” to include a “disposition of property”, as defined in the ITA 07. This ensures that the meaning of transfer of value is consistent with corresponding rules in the Income Tax Act 2004. Background Under trust law, each settlement creates a separate trust. For income tax purposes, this is modified to permit trustees to elect to treat multiple property settlements on the terms of a trust deed as being additions to corpus of the same trust (section HC 3 of the ITA). The aggregate value of multiple property settlements for such a corpus was not clearly identified in the law before this amendment. Key features The value of corpus for a single property settlement continues to be defined as equal to the market value at the time of the settlement. New section HC 4(1B)) clarifies that, when a trustee treats multiple property settlements as being on one trust, the total value of corpus is the aggregate value of each property settlement, with that value being determined at the time of settlement. This amendment:  is consistent with commercial practice; and Page 91 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  ensures that the ordering rules for distributions (section HC 16 of the ITA) are applied in a manner consistent with that practice. In the Income Tax Act 2004, a settlement and a distribution include a forgiveness of a loan, because they are included in the definition of “disposition of property” in the Income Tax Act 2004. The rationalisation of these various rules during the rewrite may have obscured this outcome. The amendment to the definition of transfer of value (section YA 1) in new paragraph (cb) clarifies that a forgiveness of a loan continues to be treated as a disposition of property for both a settlement on a trust and a distribution from the trust. Application date The amendments to section HC 4 and the definition of “transfer of value” in section YA 1 apply from 23 March 2020. Page 92 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Certain settlements excluded from trustee income Section HC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment to section HC 7 clarifies that certain settlements on a trust which are excluded from corpus and instead taxed to the trustee as trustee income, will not be included in trustee income if the settlement is distributed as beneficiary income. Background The proposed amendment is a response to a submission made during the administrative review of trust taxation that section HC 7 contained an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of this provision. Section HC 7 is intended to ensure that certain settlements excluded from corpus are taxed in the year of the settlement, to prevent a deferral of tax on undistributed income by resettling amounts on a sub-trust. Under the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004, such a settlement could be taxed to either the trustee as trustee income or the beneficiary if distributed as beneficiary income. The rewritten provision did not give this outcome and is now corrected by this amendment. Key features Excluding certain property settlements from corpus under section HC 7(3) is to mitigate against a deferral of tax in situations where those settlements would, if they were distributed, be taxable to a New Zealand resident beneficiary. The proposed amendment clarifies that when a settlement is excluded from corpus it is included in trustee income for the income year in which the settlement occurred unless the income is distributed in the same income year to a beneficiary, either as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. The proposed amendment applies to the following types of resettlements:  A re-settlement by a trustee on a sub-trust that could otherwise have been distributed as income that would be taxable to a New Zealand resident beneficiary.  A settlement that is an allowable deduction for the settlor (for example, an employer’s contribution to a trust that provides non-retirement benefits for employees). Page 93 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  A settlement that would otherwise be income of the settlor and assessable for income tax in New Zealand. Application date Th e amendment applies from 1 April 2008, and validates tax positions taken on t his basis, and is consistent with commercial practice. Page 94 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Election to pay tax on worldwide trustee income Sections CX 56(1C), HC 25()(c)(ii), HC 26(1)(ab), HC 33, HM 55D(9), HM 56, RF 2(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 113F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendments to section HC 33 and, consequentially, other related provisions clarify:  the circumstances in which a person (either the trustee, settlor or beneficiary of that trust) may elect to pay tax on worldwide trustee income (a section HC 33 election);  the basis for calculating and satisfying that tax obligation; and  the consequences for distributions from trustee income derived before, on and after this election. In general, a section HC 33 election has effect from the date selected by that person (the effective date of the election). The effective date of the election may be retrospective, but:  this is limited to a maximum of 4 years before the year in which the election is made; and  is conditional on the income tax obligations being satisfied for the trustee income derived from the effective date of the election. The amendments are intended to allow a future distribution of worldwide trustee income from income derived after the effective date of the election to be made from a complying trust (that is, the distribution is exempt income). A section HC 33 election does not change the tax treatment of distributions made before 23 March 2020. Background In recent years, several situations were identified, including:  a settlor of a foreign trust had migrated to New Zealand without an understanding of the effect that migration might have on future distributions from the trust; or  a complying trust that ceased to have a settlor resident in New Zealand while deriving foreign-sourced income. Page 95 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 For these situations, it was identified that a previous amendment to the definition of complying trust could be read, in some circumstances, as permitting some taxpayers to revisit past tax positions to gain complying trust status on a retrospective basis. However, that previous amendment did not clarify:  whether, despite not being liable for tax on worldwide trustee income, a “late election” could be made to pay tax on such trustee income; and  how distributions from trustee income derived before and after such a late election would be treated. As a result of this uncertainty, amendments have been made to the election rules in section HC 33. These amendments are consistent with the policy intent of both:  the previous amendment to the definition of complying trust relating to the ability to pay tax on past year’s world-wide trustee income; and  allowing a trustee to make tax free distributions from past year’s trustee income only if that trustee income has been fully subject to New Zealand tax at the trustee rate. Key features The amendments clarify:  the circumstances in which a section HC 33 election may be made for a trust to pay tax on worldwide trustee income;  the effect of that election on passive income rules, such as the non-resident withholding tax and the notified investor rate for PIEs; and  the tax consequences for distributions from tax-paid worldwide trustee income before and after a section HC 33 election. For a section HC 33 election, other than one to which section HC 33(1B) applies, the effective date of the election is, at the option of person making the election, either:  the date of the election;  the beginning of the income year in which the election is made; or  beginning of any of the four years preceding the income year in which the election is made. Page 96 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 A deemed election to which section HC 33(1B) applies, also now extends to a registered foreign trust which is also a complying trust but is not required to file an annual return of income (for example, a charitable trust described in section HC 13). From the effective date of the election, the taxable income and income tax liability for the trustee must be calculated on the basis that both the trustee and settlor of the trust are a New Zealand resident. This has a consequential effect on the non-resident withholding tax rules and the notified PIE investor rate rules for trusts that have a non-resident trustee. Section 113F of the TAA authorises the Commissioner to make an amended assessment to a trustee’s return of income for any year as a result of a section HC 33 election being made having a retrospective effective date. Penalties and interest will not apply to such an assessment unless the trustee had adopted, for that year, either:  an unacceptable tax position; or  an abusive tax position; or  a tax position for which the trustee is liable for a shortfall penalty for evasion or similar action. The notification rules in subpart 2D of the TAA provide the framework for making a section HC 33 election. However, the election referred to in section HC 33(1B) has its own notification rule. Application date The amendments apply from 23 March 2020. Detailed analysis Categories of election There are three separate categories of a section HC 33 election. These are set out in the amended section HC 33(3), and are summarised as follows:  an election made by giving notice to the Commissioner within the election expiry period described in section HC 30 (section HC 33(3)(a)). This election may be made by any of the trustee, settlor or a beneficiary of that trust; Page 97 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  any other election made by giving notice to the Commissioner along with the date from which the election is to apply (section HC 33(3)(b). This election may be made by any of the trustee, settlor or a beneficiary of that trust; and  a notice given in either a return of income or the annual return required under section 59D of the TAA (section HC 33(3)(c)). This election is made by the person liable to file the return of income or the return under section 59D of the TAA. Giving notice to the Commissioner Section 14C in Subpart 2D of the TAA sets out how notice of the election is to be given to the Commissioner. Notifying the Commissioner through a MyIR account would meet the requirements of this provision. Effective date of election HC 33(3)(a) – election to which section HC 30 applies For an election to which section HC 33(3)(a) applies, the date of the election is the effective date. The effective date is important for applying the rules in section HC 30(3) in relation to a distribution. The amendments to section HC 33 do not change the effect of these rules. HC 33(3)(b) – at choice of electing person For an election to which section HC 33(3)(b) applies, the effective date is at the choice of the taxpayer either:  the date of the election; or  the beginning of the income year in which the election is made; or  the beginning of any one of the four income years preceding the year of election. This clarification is intended to reduce compliance and administration costs for trusts when considering the tax effects on future distributions from trustee income derived in past years when the trust is not a complying trust. Page 98 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 HC 33(3)(c) – deemed election For the election to which section HC 33(3)(c) applies, the effective date of the election is from the beginning of the year in which the trust ceased to be a complying trust (that is, it is not liable for New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income). This notice is made when filing a return of income or, for a registered foreign trust, in the annual return required under section 59D of the TAA. This deemed election continues to be effective until a year in which the trustee either:  does not meet their tax obligations for worldwide trustee income; or  does not comply with the notice requirements set out in section HC 33(1B)(1)(c). Amended assessments New section HC 33(4) applies if a section HC 33 election is made. The person making the election is required to provide the Commissioner with all relevant information to allow the Commissioner to make an amended assessment under section 113F of the TAA. New section HC 33(6) also provides that an amended assessment for a prior year that gives rise to an increased income tax liability on the worldwide trustee income will not be subject to penalties and interest unless the original tax positions taken were either:  an unacceptable tax position;  an abusive tax position; or  a tax position that causes the trustee to be liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar action. Section HC 33 election, income tax obligations, passive income, and PIE entities Calculation of trustee’s income tax liability on worldwide trustee income From the effective date of the election:  the trustee must calculate their taxable income and income tax liability for trustee income for each income year; Page 99 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  this obligation must be satisfied on the basis that both the settlor and the trustee of the trust are resident in New Zealand (sections HC 33(1C) and (2)); and  a trust having a non-resident trustee who relies on a double taxation agreement to relieve the trustee from New Zealand tax will not satisfy this obligation. If this obligation is not satisfied, the trust cannot be a complying trust. This election and consequent obligations ensures that New Zealand tax is payable at trustee rate on the worldwide trustee income from the effective date of the election and that foreign tax credits are allowed for tax paid on foreign-sourced income. Passive income derived by a non-resident trustee The amendment to section RF 2 clarifies that, passive income derived from New Zealand by a non-resident trustee is no longer liable for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). This is consistent with:  the trustee’s obligation to calculate the trust’s income tax liability for world-wide trustee income on the basis both the settlor and the trustee are New Zealand resident; and  consistent with the policy that tax on New Zealand sourced income should not be limited to the NRWT rate. As a result of this amendment, a trustee should notify a payer of passive income of the correct tax rate that should be applied in calculating resident withholding tax for future payments of passive income derived from New Zealand by the trustee. Trust investments in a PIE entity The amendments to section HC 55D and HC 56 of the ITA 07 clarify that, following a section HC 33 election:  a non-resident trustee is no longer eligible for the notified foreign investor rate; and  the determination of the prescribed investor rate excludes the effect of amendment assessments for past years. Page 100 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 However, the transitional rule in section HC 55 ensures that the loss of eligibility for the notified foreign investor rate during an income year does not affect the PIE entity’s obligations to calculate tax on the trustee’s PIE income until the next income year Distributions made before 23 March 2020 – no change Section HC 33(5)(a)) ensures that a distribution from trustee income before 23 March 2020:  is treated as either beneficiary income or as a distribution from either a foreign, complying, or non-complying trust, determined at the time of that distribution; and  ignores the effects on the status of a trust resulting from a section HC 33 election made on or after 23 March 2020. Distribution made on or after the effective date of election The ordering of distributions from tax-paid trustee income is subject to the ordering rules in section HC 16 (the ordering rules). These rules treat a distribution from trustee income as being made on a first-in-first-out basis (FIFO basis) for all periods. Under the FIFO basis for ordering distributions from trustee income, the tax treatment of the distribution is determined by the status of the trust for the period in which the trustee income was derived (that is, either as a foreign trust, or as a non-complying trust or a complying trust). If a section HC 33 election has been made, the status of a trust for a distribution made on or after 23 March 2020 from trustee income is determined from the interaction of the ordering rules with:  section HC 30 of the ITA 07 (no change in effect); or  new section HC 33(5) of the ITA 07 (which applies to distribution made on or after 23 March 2020). If a section HC 33 election has not been made, the status of a trust for a distribution from trustee income is determined from the ordering rules. As no amendments affect this outcome, the tax obligations for a distribution continue to be determined from the interaction of:  the ordering rules; and Page 101 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  the definitions of complying trust, foreign trust, or non-complying trust; and  the definitions of distribution, beneficiary income and taxable distribution. Election to which section HC 33(3)(a) applies For an election to which section HC 30(2) applies (that is, it is made within the election expiry period described in section HC 30), there is no change to the tax effects for a distribution made from trustee income derived before, on or after the effective date of the election. These tax effects are set out in section HC 30(3) of the ITA 07. Under this provision, the tax effects are determined from how the ordering rules for a distribution from trustee income interact with the date of the election and the definitions of complying trust, foreign trust and non-complying trust. Election to which section HC 33(3)(b) and (c) applies New section HC 33(5) provides the tax consequences for a section HC 33 election other than one to which section HC 30 applies. This new section ensures that, for a foreign trust of which at least one settlor has become a New Zealand resident:  a section HC 33 election is effective if it is made after the election expiry period described in section HC 30 has ended; and  these effects override the application of section HC 30(4) for periods from the effective date of the election. Under section HC 33(5), the tax effects for a distribution from such a trust made on or after 23 March 2020 are determined from how the ordering rules interact with the effective date of the election and the definitions of complying trust, foreign trust and non-complying trust. The tax effects on a distribution are illustrated in the following examples: Example 18: Inbound migrating settlor A settlor of a foreign trust has migrated to New Zealand and became a New Zealand resident on 30 September 2013 (after ceasing to be a transitional resident). All beneficiaries of the trust also migrate to New Zealand and become New Zealand residents from the same date. The trustee is not resident in New Zealand. This trust has both New Zealand sourced income and foreign sourced income and the trust has existed since 2008. No section HC 33 election is made by 30 September 2014, and the trustee was Page 102 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 not aware they were required to pay tax on its foreign sourced income but has paid tax on all New Zealand sourced income . The balance date of the trust is 31 March. A distribution (not being beneficiary income) of $1M was made on 30 June 2016 to New Zealand resident beneficiaries. No New Zealand tax was paid on this distribution by the trustee or the beneficiaries. The trustee wishes to make a distribution on 30 June 2020 and has learned that amendments have been made to the trust rules that affect the taxation of distributions. As a result of this enquiry, the trustee learns that a retrospective section HC 33 election may be made to pay tax on world-wide trustee income. The trustee makes a section HC 33 election on 5 April 2020, to apply from the beginning of 1 April 2016. This is the beginning of the fourth income year prior to the income year beginning 1 April 2020. Tax effect on distribution made on 30 June 2016 Because the distribution on 30 June 2016 is made before 23 March 2020, it is necessary to determine under the ordering rules, the extent to which the distribution is made from trustee income or capital gains derived by the trustee: • on or before 30 September 2014; or • after 30 September 2014. This analysis reveals that the distribution of $1M comprised: • $400,000 from trustee income derived before 30 September 2014 (a taxable distribution from a foreign trust); • $250,000 from trustee income derived after 30 September 2014 (a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust); • $300,000 from a capital gain derived before 30 September 2014 (a distribution of a capital gain from a foreign trust); and • $50,000 from a capital gain derived after 30 September 2014 (a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust). In summary, this distribution is treated as follows • $400,000 – as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust; and • $300,000 – as a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust; and • $300,000 – as a distribution of a capital gain from a foreign trust. For the taxable distribution of $400,000, the beneficiary is liable for tax at the beneficiary’s marginal rate for the year ending 31 March 2017, along with any penalty and interest assessed for the late payment of that tax. For the taxable distribution of $300,000, the beneficiary is liable for tax at the 45% rate imposed on a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, along with any penalty and Page 103 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 interest assessed for the late payment of that tax. No tax is payable on the distribution of the capital gain from a foreign trust. The amendments to the trust rules do not affect this outcome. Proposed distribution on 30 June 2020 However, because the trustee has made a section HC 33 election with effect from 1 April 2016 the proposed distribution can be treated as a distribution from a complying trust to the extent the distribution is from income derived on or after 1 April 2016. However, this is dependent on the trustee satisfying the tax obligations on the worldwide trustee income of the trust before the date of the distribution at 30 June 2020. The proposed distribution is $1.5 million and the analysis of the source of that distribution shows that: • $450,000 is to be made from trustee income derived after 30 September 2014 but before 1 April 2016 (taxable distribution from a non-complying trust); • $1.05 million is to be made from trustee income derived on or after 1 April 2016 (distribution from a complying trust). As a result of the analysis, and assuming the trustee has satisfied the tax obligations arising from the section HC 33 election for period from 1 April 2016, the trust is a complying trust in relation to a distribution of income from this period. This means that the trustee is liable to pay tax at 45% on the taxable distribution of $450,000 (distributed from trustee income derived before 1 April 2016) but the distribution of $1.05 million is exempt income of the beneficiary. This treatment in section HC 33(5)(b) for trustee income derived after 30 September 2014 overrides the effect of section HC 30(4) for those periods. These amendments also apply to the case of multiple non-resident settlors if only one of those settlors becomes a New Zealand resident. This is because the settlor regime taxes worldwide trustee income if at least one of those settlors is resident in New Zealand (HC 25). Outbound migrating sole settlor A sole settlor of a trust has migrated from New Zealand and ceases to be a New Zealand resident at 1 April 2016. The trustee of this trust is a non-resident and all beneficiaries are New Zealand resident individuals. From 1 April 2016, the trust continues to derive foreign sourced income and interest income from New Zealand. Under the settlor regime, the foreign sourced income is no longer liable for New Zealand tax (section HC 25 applies), and the interest income is liable only for non-resident withholding tax as a final tax. Consequently, the trustee is no longer liable for tax on worldwide trustee income and the trust becomes a non-complying trust in relation to any distribution made from trustee income derived Page 104 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 after the date the settlor ceases being a New Zealand resident. It is proposed to make a distribution of $650,000 to the beneficiaries on 1 October 2020. As the trustee’s annual returns of income for the 2016–17 to 2018–2019 tax years did not include the foreign sourced income, the trust cannot be a complying trust for distributions of trustee income derived during those periods. However, the trustee includes the foreign sourced income in the 2019–20 return of income, ticks the return to indicate complying trust status and satisfies the New Zealand tax obligations on the world-wide trustee income for that tax year on 30 July 2020. Analysis of the ordering rules shows that the proposed distribution of $650,000 will be sourced from trustee income as follows: • $200,000 from trustee income derived prior to 31 March 2016 (from a complying trust); • $120,000 from trustee income derived from 1 April 2016 until 31 March 2017 (from a non- complying trust); • $200,000 from trustee income derived from 1 April 2017 until 31 March 2019 (from a non- complying trust. • $130,000 from trustee income derived during the 2019–20 income year (from a complying trust). The distribution therefore comprises of: • a distribution of exempt income of $330,000 (distributions from income derived while the trust is a complying trust; and • a taxable distribution of $320,000 from a non-complying trust, liable for tax at the rate of 45%. However, the trustee could also make a section HC 33 election (HC 33(3)(b) refers) prior to the proposed distribution on 1 October 2020. This would supplant but the deemed election in the return of income for the year ending 31 March 2020 and this would not affect complying trust status for this year. If this election had been made with effect from 1 April 2016, and provided the tax obligations for all prior periods are satisfied prior to 1 October 2020, the trust will be a complying trust in relation to the entire distribution which would be treated as exempt income of the beneficiary. Page 105 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Definition of complying trust Sections HC 10(1)(ab) of the Income Tax Act 2007 The proposed amendment to section HC 10(1)(ab) clarifies the point in time from when a trust may be treated as a complying trust if:  an election has been made, under section HC 33 of the ITA 07 (section HC 33 election) to pay New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income; and  the trustee satisfies the New Zealand tax obligations for that trustee income. This amendment provides consistency with the amendments to section HC 33, which allow such an election, including a section HC 33 election that has retrospective effect for up to 4 years before the year in which the election is made. Background The policy intent is that, in relation to a distribution from a trust, a complying trust is one that has paid New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income (tax-paid trustee income) and so is able to make a distribution (other than beneficiary income) that is not taxed to the beneficiary. The amendments to section HC 10 are consistent with the amendments to section HC 33 of the ITA 07. Those amendments clarify the extent to which any trust that is not a complying trust may make a section HC 33 election to pay tax on its worldwide trustee income to gain complying trust status for distributions made after 23 March 2020 from tax-paid trustee income. The ordering rules in section HC 16 of the ITA 07 determine whether a distribution has been made from tax-paid trustee income. Key features A section HC 33 election to pay tax on worldwide trustee income is intended to alter the tax effects on a future distribution from a trust which has not always had a New Zealand resident settlor over the life of the trust. For example: Page 106 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  a trust, for which the settlor has migrated from New Zealand and is no longer resident in New Zealand; or  a trust for which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand and become a New Zealand resident (whether or not an election is made by the election expiry date referred to in section HC 30). New section HC 10(1)(ab) clarifies that that such a trust can gain or retain complying trust status in relation to a distribution by making section HC 33 election as follows. A trust for which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand is a complying trust in relation to a future distribution of trustee income:  the section HC 33 election is made within the election expiry period referred to in section HC 30;  the trustee satisfies all New Zealand tax obligations for worldwide trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of the distribution; and  the distribution is made from trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of distribution. Any other trust that has not always had a New Zealand settlor may gain complying trust status for a future distribution of trustee income if:  the section HC 33 election is made before the distribution is made;  the trustee satisfies all New Zealand tax obligations for worldwide trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of the distribution; and  the distribution is made from trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of distribution. A trustee that obtains relief from New Zealand tax on New Zealand–sourced income under a double tax agreement (treaty relief) after the effective date of an election would result in:  the trustee not satisfying the obligation to tax on worldwide trustee income from the effective date of the election on the basis both the trustee and settlor of the trust are resident in New Zealand (sections HC 33(1C); and  such a trust not meeting the definition of a complying trust in section HC 10 for a distribution from a period in which the trustee had obtained such treaty relief. Page 107 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The amendments to section HC 10 apply for an election made on or after 23 March 2020. Detailed analysis New Zealand resident settlor of a complying trust becomes non- resident New section HC 10(1)(ab) applies to a trust that ceases to have a New Zealand resident settlor (other than death of a natural person settlor) for which a section HC 33 election is made, either as:  an election to pay tax on worldwide trustee income as described in section HC 33(3)(b); or  a deemed election because the trustee continues to self-assess worldwide trustee income at the trustee rate, as described in section HC 33(3)(c); and  for both cases, the tax obligations for trustee income are satisfied for all periods from the date the election applies from. The ability to make a retrospective election under section HC 33(3)(b) for a trustee that has not paid tax on worldwide trustee income after the trust ceases to have a New Zealand resident settlor:  allows the trustee to correct past tax positions for up to 4 years before the year in which the election is made;  ensures that a future distribution of trustee income (not being beneficiary income) from trustee income derived during the period after the effective date of the election is treated as a distribution from a complying trust. The amendments ensure that a trust that ceases to have a New Zealand resident settlor may continue to be treated seamlessly as a complying trust in relation to a distribution of income from periods for which the trust is a complying trust. Page 108 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Settlor of a foreign trust becomes a New Zealand resident and no section HC 33 election within election expiry period Section HC 30(4) applies to a trust of which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand and no section HC 33 election was made within the election expiry period. The consequence of not making this election is that such a foreign trust is a non-complying trust in relation a distribution from trustee income derived after that election expiry date. Several situations have been identified of a settlor of a foreign trust migrating to New Zealand and not understanding the effect the migration might have on future distributions from the trust. Before the amendments to section HC 33 and HC 10, it was unclear:  whether this non-complying status could be remedied by a “late election”;  how distributions from trustee income derived before and after such a late election could be treated. These issues are addressed in the amendments in section HC 33 (see earlier in this TIB item) relating to the ability to make a “late election”, and the effect for distributions from tax-paid trustee income derived in periods after such an election. Section HC 10(1)(ab) complements those amendments to section HC 33 by clarifying that a complying trust in relation to a distribution includes a trust which has either:  ceased to have complying trust status because the trustee is no longer liable for New Zealand tax at the trustee rate on worldwide trustee income; or  a settlor has migrated to New Zealand and no election to pay tax on worldwide trustee income was made within the election expiry date. These amendments do not apply to a trust with a New Zealand resident settlor that is a non- complying trust because the trustee has not satisfied their New Zealand tax obligations on world-wide trustee income. This non-complying status subject to the time bar in section 108 of the TAA, is able to be remedied by satisfying those past tax obligations including relevant penalties and interest before a distribution is made. If these past tax obligations are able to be satisfied for all prior periods the trust is a non-complying trust, complying trust status is restored for all those periods. Page 109 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Settlor of a foreign trust migrates to New Zealand and section HC 33 election made New section HC 10(1)(ab)(i) applies to a trust of which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand and makes a section HC 33 election within the election expiry period. This period is either:  for a settlor that is not a transitional resident, the 12-month period from the day on which the settlor becomes a New Zealand resident; or  for a settlor that stops being a transitional resident , the 12-month period from the day the transitional resident status ceases. Section HC 10(1)(ab) clarifies that the meaning of complying trust includes such a trust. The amendment arises from a technical submission on this point made during the Commissioner’s review of the taxation of trusts. This amendment does not give rise to any change in commercial practice or the Commissioner’s practice. Example 19: Inbound migrating settlor A settlor of a foreign trust has migrated to New Zealand and became a New Zealand resident on 30 June 2017 (after ceasing to be a transitional resident). This trust has both New Zealand sourced income and foreign sourced income and the trust has existed since 2008. No section HC 33 election is made by 30 June 2018 and the trustee was not aware they were required to pay tax on its foreign sourced income. The balance date of the trust is 31 March. Consequently, this trust is a non-complying trust for a distribution (other than a distribution of beneficiary income) made after 30 June 2018 which is made from trustee income derived after 30 June 2018. Such distributions to are taxed at 45%, applying the source and residence principles set out in the core provisions. However, the amendments to section HC 33 and HC 10(1)(ab) permits a retrospective election may be made after 23 March 2020. The trustee makes this election on 1 June 2020, with an effective date of 30 June 2018. The trustee files a corrected return of income for the 2018–19 year and pays the correct amount of tax assessed for that year and for the 2019–20 and later income, the trustee satisfies tax obligations on worldwide trustee income of that trust. Because of that election and satisfaction of the relevant tax obligations for the 2018–19 income year, a distribution after 23 March 2020 from trustee income derived after 30 June 2018 is treated as being made from a complying trust. This treatment is set out in section HC 33(5)(b), and is intended to override the effect of section HC 30(4). Page 110 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 These amendments also apply to the case of multiple non-resident settlors if only one of those settlors becomes a New Zealand resident. This is because the settlor regime taxes worldwide trustee income if at least one of those settlors is resident in New Zealand (section HC 25). Outbound migrating sole settlor A sole settlor of a trust has migrated from New Zealand and ceases to be a New Zealand resident at 1 April 2018. The trustee of this trust is a non-resident From 1 April 2018, the trust continues to derive foreign sourced income and interest income from New Zealand. Under the settlor regime, the foreign sourced income is no longer liable for New Zealand tax (section HC 25 applies), and the interest income is liable only for non-resident withholding tax as a final tax. Consequently, the trustee is no longer liable for tax on worldwide trustee income and the trust becomes a non-complying trust in relation to any distribution made from trustee income derived after the date the settlor ceases being a New Zealand resident. However: • If the trustee had continued to pay tax on world-wide trustee income at the trustee rate (full New Zealand tax) and indicated in the trust’s annual return of income (by marking the relevant check box) that the trust is a complying trust, the trust’s complying trust status is maintained from the date of migration on a seamless basis. This is provided for in section HC 33(1B) HC 33(3)(c) and HC 10(1)(ab) of the ITA 07. • Alternatively, an election can be made under section HC 33(3)b) to pay full New Zealand tax on trustee income derived on or after the date of migration. This election can be retrospective within the time limit set out in section HC 33(b)(ii) and (iii). For both elections referred to above, the complying trust status is also conditional on: • the election having been made before a distribution (not being beneficiary income) from trustee income derived after the effective date of the election; and • the tax obligations on the worldwide trustee income are satisfied for periods after the effective date of the election. In addition, for both cases if a section HC 33 election is not made with effect from the date of the migration, the trust will be a non-complying trust in relation to a distribution (other than beneficiary income) of trustee income derived after the date of migration. For multiple settlors, this above example applies only if no settlor remains resident in New Zealand. If a settlor remains resident in New Zealand, then worldwide trustee income remains liable for tax at the trustee rate. If the trustee is a non-resident, then this resident settlor must satisfy the tax obligations on worldwide trustee income (section HC 29 refers). If these obligations are not satisfied the trust becomes a non-complying trust in relation to a distribution from the periods for which the tax obligations on worldwide trustee income are not satisfied. Page 111 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Transfer of value for deferral or non-exercise of right to demand payment Section HC 31B and section YA 1 “financial assistance” of the Income Tax Act 2007 New section HC 31B addresses questions raised during an administrative review of the taxation of trusts relating to the valuation of financial assistance provided if there is:  an obligation to repay interest or principal on demand; and  the right to demand repayment is not exercised or is deferred. Background The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified that it was very difficult to value a settlement or a distribution relating to financial assistance provided by one person to another subject to an on-demand condition for principal and interest. In particular, the concerns raised related to:  section HC 27(2)(b) that makes a person a settlor if such financial assistance is provided to the trust; and  section HC 14 which defines a distribution as a transfer of value, which would include the value of the interest forgone on such financial assistance. The administrative review also concluded that to reduce administration and compliance costs in valuing such financial assistance, the legislation should provide a method to calculate this value. Key features The amendment addresses this issue by inserting a formula in new section HC 31B that applies when:  financial assistance is given on an on-demand basis for either principal or interest or both; and Page 112 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  not demanding the interest or principal gives rise to a transfer of value that comes within the meaning of distribution in section HC 14 or would make a person a settlor of a trust by virtue of section HC27(2)(b). The formula calculates the value of the distribution or the settlement for any period as the amount of interest that would be foregone if the demand had instead been exercised. The value is calculated as the difference between:  the interest that would be payable on the principal at market rate or the prescribed rate (at the choice of the taxpayer) for that period; and  the amount of interest accrued for that period on the principal amount owing. This includes an amount that would have accrued for that period if that amount had been included in a taxable distribution. The proposed formula is like the calculation of the value of a fringe benefit for on-demand shareholder current accounts and ensures that administration and compliance costs can be minimised when valuing such financial assistance. The definition of financial assistance formerly located in section HC 36(5) is relocated to section YA 1 and applies for the purpose of the trust rules. This amendment clarifies the meaning of financial assistance, consistent with the Commissioner’s view, as set out in IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts. Application date New section HC 31B applies to determine the value of financial assistance that would give rise to a distribution or a settlement on a trust on or after 23 March 2020, including financial assistance that exists before 23 March 2020. Page 113 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Meaning of settlor and settlement Sections FC 2(4), HC 27 and HC 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to section HC 27 and HC 28 clarify certain circumstances in which a person may become a settlor of a trust. These issues were identified in the administrative review of the taxation of trusts as:  a potential for overreach in relation to indirect settlements;  when a controlled foreign company (CFC) settles an amount (or has settled) an amount on a trust; and  the interaction of section HC 27(6) with section HC 27(2) and (4). The amendment to section FC 2(4) clarifies that the rules taxing holding gains for property before it is gifted do not apply to determine whether a transfer of value is made to a trust as a settlement on the trust. Background The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified some uncertainty in applying the rules defining a person as a settlor in relation to:  a potential for overreach in relation to indirect settlements (section HC 27(4));  when a person having a control interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company (CFC) will become a settlor of trust for which the CFC settles an amount (or has settled) an amount on a trust (section HC 38(3), (4));  the overriding effect of section HC 27(6) with section HC 27(2) and (4) to exclude a beneficiary from being a settlor for amounts owed to the beneficiary on an on- demand basis; and  the application of the rules in subpart FC when a gift is made to a trust as a settlement. Page 114 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features Potential for overreach in relation to indirect settlements The amendment to section HC 27(4) clarifies that person may make an indirect transfer of value to a trust through one or more transactions. As set out in IS 18/01at paragraphs 2.60 to s.65, this rule is likely to be applied where:  a person (person A) controls or influences the actions of another person (person B) for that transaction; and  a result of that transaction is that a transfer of value is indirectly made to a trust. Trust settled by a CFC The amendments to section HC 28(3) and (4) clarify the time at which a person having a control interest of 10% or more in the CFC will be a settlor of that trust. For the person to be a settlor of that trust, the investor must have a 10% or more control interest in the CFC at the time the CFC settles an amount on that trust. Relationship of sections HC 27(4) and (6) The amendment to section HC 27(6) to cross-refer to section HC 27(2), clarifies that the exclusion under section HC 27(6) also applies in determining whether an indirect settlement has occurred. Interface of the meaning of a settlement with the subpart FC rules An amendment is made to section FC 2(4) to ensures that the value of a settlement on a trust is unaffected by the rules in subpart FC. The rules in subpart FC treat a gift as a purchase and acquisition transaction to ensure that holding gains derived by the donor , including those made on revenue property, cannot be avoided by the making of a gift. If this treatment were applied within the trust rules there could be no transfer of value from the gift. The amendment ensures that whether a gift is a transfer of value for the trust rules is not affected by the valuation and transaction rules in subpart FC. Page 115 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application dates The amendment to section FC 2 applies from 18 March 2019, consistent with an earlier amendment that ensures that distributions as a transfer of value are unaffected by the rules in subpart FC. The amendments to sections HC 27 and HC 28 apply from 23 March 2020. Page 116 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Foreign-source income derived by a trustee Sections HC 25 and HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified that it was unclear how the rules relating to the taxation of foreign-sourced income derived by a trustee should be treated in the event either:  no natural person settlor of the trust remained alive or the settlor had ceased to exist (for example, a corporate settlor); or  a section HC 33 election has been made. Key features Testamentary or inter-vivos trust with resident settlor and a non- resident trustee The amendment to section HC 25 applies to a trust that has a corporate settlor that continues to exist after the natural person settlor of that trust has died. If that corporate settlor ceases to exist, and no settlor remains, the residence of the settlor will be determined by the residence of that corporate settlor when it ceased to exist. Trust with non-resident settlor and resident trustee The amendments to section HC 26 clarify that:  The exempt income treatment for foreign-sourced income derived by the resident trustee does not apply for a distribution of minor beneficiary income which is taxed at 33% to the trustee as trustee income; and  The exempt income treatment for foreign-sourced income does not apply if the trust has made a section HC 33 election. This is consistent with the trustee’s obligation to calculate their income tax liability on the basis the settlor and trustee of the trust are both resident in New Zealand. Page 117 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The amendments apply from 23 March 2020. Page 118 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Distributions Sections HC 14, HC 15, HC 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments address some minor issues identified during the administrative review of the taxation of trusts. The amendments are consistent with the Commissioner’s view set out in IS 18/01. Background The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified some minor interpretive uncertainty issues relating to:  the payment of interest on amounts owed by a trustee to a beneficiary;  identifying the source of capital gains and capital losses;  the ordering of distributions; and  the anti-avoidance rule relating to the ordering rules for distributions. Key features Distributions and payments of interest The amendment to section HC 14 clarifies that an amount of interest paid to a beneficiary under the terms of a loan is not a distribution (that is, it is not included in beneficiary income). However, if the amount of interest exceeds the amount determined under the terms of the loan agreement, the excess amount of interest is treated as a distribution. Source of capital gains and capital losses The amendments in sections HC 15(5C) and (5D) clarify how the source rules apply to a capital gain or capital loss that is taken into account as part of a taxable distribution. The source of the capital gain or loss is determined using the source rules in section YD 4. Page 119 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Ordering of distributions The amendment to section HC 16(2) clarifies the relative order for a distribution that is beneficiary income. This addresses a tension identified in the administrative review of the taxation of trusts. The anti-avoidance rule and the ordering rules for distributions Section HC 16(5) of the ITA prevents trustees using the ordering rule to manipulate the nature of a distribution for New Zealand tax purposes to stream income and capital to different classes of beneficiary (for example, resident and non-resident beneficiaries). The rule ignores the tax effect of an earlier distribution in determining whether a subsequent distribution would be treated as either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. The amendments confirm that this rule does not apply to a genuine transaction that results in a distribution of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution not being placed beyond the control of the trustee. This ensures that the rule does not apply to the commercial practice of trustees crediting a distribution to a beneficiary’s current account. Application dates The amendments to section HC 15 apply from 23 March 2020. The amendments to section HC 16 apply for income years beginning after 23 March 2020. Page 120 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Definitions Sections HC 36, YA 1, ,“disposition of property”, “financial assistance” “transfer of value”, “transfer of company value”, “trust rules” and YD 3BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 A few definitions are amended consequential to amendments to the substantive trust rules. Key features The definition of financial assistance is relocated to section YA from section HC 36 and applies for the purpose of the trust rules and not just for section HC 36. The definition of transfer of value is clarified by:  removing the elements that relate to dividends from companies (this now termed transfer of company value”;  ensuring that a transfer of value includes an amount whether or not convertible into money, which is consistent with the Commissioner’s view in IS 18/01; and  correcting an unintended change arising in the rewrite of the trust rules to ensure that the definition of a disposition of property is within the meaning of transfer of value. This ensures that forgiveness of a loan is treated in the same manner as under the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. The definition of trust rules is amended to include rules that apply only for trusts, consistent with their treatment under the Income Tax Act 2004, and now includes the new definition of resident of a trustee that has co-trustees (section YD 3BA) Application dates The amendments to the definitions apply from 23 March 2020 with the exception of the amendment to the trust rules relating to section BD 1(4)(c), which applies from 1 April 2008. Page 121 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Māori authority distributions Sections LO 2 and OK 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments clarify:  the calculation of the tax credit for a Māori authority distribution; and  correct unintended changes to the Māori authority credit account rules arising in the rewrite of these provisions. Background The amendments to section LO 2 and OK 19 correct an unintended legislative change in the rewrite of each of the provision. Key features The amendment to section LO 2 corrects the meaning of the parameter “person’s distributions” for the formula in section LO 2(2). This amendment:  ensures that the pro-rating of Māori authority tax credits is made by reference to all distributions made to beneficiaries; and  validates tax positions taken based on the pre-rewrite legislation from all distributions made from 1 April 2008. The amendment to section OK 19 restores the law to give the same outcome as the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004. This amendment restores the correct policy outcome. The rule now ensures that a Māori Authority Tax Credit (MATC) may only be retrospectively attached to a distribution from a Māori authority if the Commissioner has made an assessment under the transfer pricing rules to change the effect of a past transaction. Application dates The amendments to sections LO 2 and OK 19 apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year.

Page 123 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Eliminating the requirement to estimate at the final instalment date for provisional tax Sections 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This amendment removes the requirement for taxpayers to switch to the estimate method at the final instalment of provisional tax when they believe their residual income tax for the year will be less than the standard instalments and retain the interest concession contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as long as their residual income tax is $60,000 or more. Taxpayers will continue to be able to pay what they consider is the amount remaining at the final instalment date without changing from the standard “uplift” method. This will reduce compliance costs to the taxpayer. Taxpayers who do estimate at any time during the income year will be subject to the standard use of money interest (UOMI) rules in section 120KB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and will potentially be subject to UOMI from the date of their first provisional tax instalment. In practical terms, this does not affect any taxpayers as they will continue to do what they always have, however, the method in which they do that will alter. Furthermore, the compliance costs of having to make an estimate will be removed. Background The interest concession rules are contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These rules essentially allow those taxpayers who use the standard method and make the required payments to have no exposure to UOMI until the day after the final provisional tax instalment is due for the year. This rule also applies to taxpayers who make the first two instalments using the standard method and make their final instalment under the estimation method. This rule was included in the final amending act due to a number of submissions made at the finance and expenditure committee which stated that if a person anticipated that their residual income tax (RIT) for the year in question was less than their uplifted provisional tax amount there was no legal ability for them to make a payment less than the standard instalment amount. Page 124 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 This was notwithstanding the UOMI calculation would have calculated UOMI correctly and no late payment penalty would have been charged. Example 20 Cookie Monsters Limited (Cookie) is a provisional taxpayer on a 31 March balance date who uses the standard uplift method. For the 2020–21 income year their standard instalments are based on 105% of their CY 7 -1 RIT which was $200,000. This gives them 3 instalments of $70,000. They pay both the first and second instalments on time on that basis but by the time the third instalment is due Cookie has calculated that due to the ongoing pressure from anti-obesity campaigns the market for their high sugar and fat content signature biscuit, “The Clogger”, has dramatically reduced. Cookie’s estimate of their 2020–21 RIT is $63,000 for the year. Cookie decides to estimate their final instalment of provisional tax and make no payment. Cookie will still be able to use the interest concession rules even though they estimated at their final instalment date. UOMI will apply from the date of the final instalment where its tax liability is more than payments made. This creates a compliance cost on taxpayers who then must switch provisional tax methods at their final instalment date and file an estimate. It also potentially exposes them to penalties for lack of reasonable care in making a reasonable estimate. Key features These changes allow provisional taxpayers who estimate RIT of greater than $60,000 to use the standard method to pay provisional tax to pay an amount lower than the standard method obligation on the final instalment date without having to switch to the estimation method. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. 7 CY=Current year. Page 125 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Detailed analysis The amendment allows taxpayers who make provisional tax payments under the standard method to vary their final instalment payment from the standard instalment to whatever they consider is owing at that date without having to switch provisional tax methods as long as their RIT is above $60,000. Taxpayers who have an RIT of less than $60,000 will be better off using the safe harbour provisions in section 120KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994. As UOMI will apply to any shortfall from the final instalment date taxpayers are always incentivised to pay their “actual” liability at that date. Given the final instalment is some time after their balance date, taxpayers should be able to reasonably accurately approximate the final amount payable. The ability to use the estimation method is removed from the interest concession rules in section 120KBB. If a taxpayer estimates at any point during the year, they will be under the estimation method for the entire year and potentially subject to UOMI from the date of the first instalment. Practically, this will make no difference to taxpayers as they will continue to do the same as they always have but the compliance cost of switching provisional tax methods will be removed. Example 21 Grover Grapes Limited (Grape) is a provisional taxpayer on a 30 June balance date who uses the standard uplift method. For the 2020–21 income year their standard instalments are based on 110% of their CY 8 -2 RIT which was $140,000. This gives them 3 instalments of $51,333. It pays both the first and second instalments on time on that basis. However, by the time the third instalment is due Grape has calculated that due to the grape season being adversely affected by the great grape infection of 2020 it’s income will be well down on the standard uplift amount. Grape believes they will only have RIT of $76,000 for the year. 8 CY = Current year. Page 126 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Grape realises this about 3 weeks before the payment of their third instalment and decides to immediately file an estimate of the lower amount with Inland Revenue. By filing an estimate before the third instalment date Grape as thrown itself out of the standard method and will not be able to use the interest concession rules in section 120KBB. It will be subject to use of money interest from the first instalment date under section KB. Grape may also be subject to shortfall penalties if it did not take reasonable care in making its estimate for the year. Page 127 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Clarifying the “lesser of” calculation of interest for standard “uplift” taxpayers Section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment clarifies the legislation to reflect the application of the “lesser of” calculation for standard “uplift” taxpayers to ensure this aligns with the way in which UOMI is calculated in Inland Revenue’s technology platforms. 9 Background For taxpayers who qualify to be able to use the interest concession rules contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, UOMI is calculated on a different basis than for other taxpayers. Generally, a taxpayer will be exposed to UOMI on the difference between their actual liability for the year divided by the number of instalments and what they paid. For example, a taxpayer who has residual income tax 10 (RIT) of $90,000 and has paid nothing will be charged interest on $30,000 at each instalment date (that is, $90,000 ÷ 3). The interest concession rules operate differently and calculate UOMI (and late payment penalties) based on a “lesser of” rule contained in section 120KBB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This calculates UOMI on the difference between the lesser of the amount of the standard method instalment and the actual liability, divided by the number of instalments. For example, if a taxpayer has an actual RIT of $40,000 at each instalment and their standard uplift instalments were $30,000 at each instalment date. UOMI for interest concession taxpayers will be charged on the $30,000 amounts less the amount paid at each instalment date (except for the final instalment which will have UOMI charged on the outstanding balance of RIT less payments made to date). 9 Inland Revenue’s technology platforms are FIRST (Future Inland Revenue Systems and Technology), the heritage platform, and START (Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology), the new platform. 10 Residual Income Tax is the amount of tax liability after tax credits such as PAYE and RWT have been deducted. Page 128 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features The amendment aligns the application of the “lesser of” calculation of UOMI for standard “uplift” taxpayers with the way that Inland Revenue’s technology platforms have been calculating UOMI for those taxpayers. The amendment provides that less UOMI is calculated than under the previous legislation. Application date The amendment applies from the 2018–19 income year as the amendment aligns the legislation with the treatment within Inland Revenue’s systems. Detailed analysis The standard “uplift” provisional tax method allows taxpayers to base their provisional tax instalments for the year on 105% of the prior year’s (CY 11 -1) RIT or 110% of the year previous to the prior year (CY-2) dependent on when they have filed their CY-1 tax return. Up until the taxpayer files their CY-1 return a taxpayer will use 110% of the CY-2 RIT (initial uplift). When they file their CY-1 return and 105% of that RIT (the final uplift) is more than the initial uplift the system leaves the previous instalments at the initial uplift. The reason for this is that at that time the taxpayer made that payment, the only information they had to base the payment on was the initial uplift. However, if the taxpayer files their CY-1 return and the final uplift is less than the initial uplift the system overwrites the initial uplift amount and replaces it with the lower final uplift amount. This is on the basis that once the taxpayer has filed their CY-1 return there is no ability to use the initial uplift and the final uplift effectively replaces that. Logically these two rules make sense. If the initial uplift is lower than the final uplift, it should be used as it would be unfair to require a taxpayer to make a payment based on figures they had not yet calculated. Alternatively, if the final uplift is lower than the initial uplift that 11 CY = Current year. Page 129 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 should replace the initial uplift as, firstly, the taxpayer would have used that amount if they had known it at the time and, secondly, once that final uplift is known the initial uplift technically is no longer available. This rule will apply to instalments prior to the date the taxpayer files their CY-1 return (that is, the return with the final uplift). Prior to the introduction of the interest concession rules this rule generally only mattered for the calculation of late payment penalties. Since the interest concession rule was introduced, this distinction is more important as it affects the calculation of UOMI. As the lower of the two amounts is taken into account this treatment is taxpayer friendly, however, the distinction does matter when taxpayers transfer funds from a tax pool as they want to ensure they are making the correct transfer to avoid the payment of UOMI. Inland Revenue’s legal team determined that the legislation was not clear on this rule. The amendment will clarifies the legislation to ensure that the lowest amount of the initial or final uplift is used for the purposes of calculating UOMI and late payment penalties for instalments made prior to the date the taxpayer files the CY-1 tax return. This rule does not change the obligation to pay either the initial or final uplift amounts in that if the taxpayer’s final uplift is less than their initial uplift they were still required to pay the initial uplift amount notwithstanding UOMI may not be charged on that basis. This will be important in determining if a taxpayer is an interest concession taxpayer if they are subsequently subject to a reassessment. Both the FIRST and START systems apply this rule and thus the amendment does not affect taxpayers, but rather aligns the legislation with the system and policy intent. Page 130 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 22 Brock Burgers Corporation Limited (Brock) is a fast food chain that specialises in plant-based burgers. It has three subsidiary companies Brock Burgers (Auckland) Limited (BBA), Brock Burgers (Wellington) Limited (BBW) and Brock Burgers (Stewart Island) Limited (BBS). Because of the seasonal demand for plant-based burgers Hadleigh, the owner of Brock, decides that the standard uplift is a perfect method for the group as it removes the risk of exposure to UOMI until the Group has a good understanding of the tax liability for a particular year. Brock also uses a tax pool to pay its provisional tax for the year. It files its 2019–20 income tax returns between the first and second instalment dates. For the 2020–21 income years Brock’s standard uplift calculation for the companies in the group is as follows: Table 3 110% uplift RIT amount A 105% uplift RIT amount B First instalment amount Second instalment amount 12 Brock $21,000,000 $15,000,000 $7,000,000 $3,000,000 13 BBA $12,000,000 $10,500,000 $4,000,000 $3,000,000 14 BBW $24,000,000 $27,300,000 $8,000,000 $10,200,000 15 BBS $4,200,000 $1,800,000 $1,400,000 ($200,000) 16 Total $20,400,000 $16,000,000 The group pays the first two instalments into the pool as calculated above (including obtaining a repayment for the $200,000 for BBS from the pool) but at the third instalment realises that the RIT for the entities is very different from the uplifted amounts. For example, BBA has had a standout year following a celebrity endorsement from a Hollywood star visiting Auckland for filming. BBS, however, has not fared as well as a competing company has captured the burger market in Stewart 12 Once the taxpayer files their prior year tax return the 110% uplift calculation is no longer available to them. 13 Calculated as ($15,000,000 × 2/3) − $7,000,000 = $3,000,000. 14 Calculated as ($10,500,000 × 2/3) − $4,000,000 = $3,000,000. 15 Calculated as ($27,300,000 × 2/3) − $8,000,000 = $10,200,000. 16 Calculated as (1,800,000 × 2/3) − $1,400,000 = ($200,000) BBS gets this amount refunded from the tax pool. Page 131 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Island with their Venison Game Burgers. The expected RIT for each of the companies for the 2020– 21 income year and what Brock intends to pay for the third instalment to minimise any UOMI is as follows: Table 4 2020-21 expected RIT C 2020-21 instalments to date Third instalment Brock $20,000,000 $10,000,000 $10,000,000 BBA $35,000,000 $7,000,000 $28,000,000 BBW $27,300,000 $18,200,000 $9,100,000 BBS NIL $1,200,000 ($1,240,000) Total $82,300,000 $36,400,000 $45,900,000 Once the Brock group has completed it’s 2020–21 tax returns it proved their forecasting team was worth their weight in gold as the actual RIT for the year ended up being identical to the expected RIT for the year with the exception of BBW which only had actual RIT of $27,000,000 due to the cancellation of a vegan lifestyle conference in Wellington which reduced sales. Brock then calculates the transfers required from the tax pool. Hadleigh is keen to ensure that each company pays what they need to at each instalment to ensure that no UOMI or late payment penalties are incurred. This will mean determining the lesser of the RIT or the instalment amount (being the lower of the 105% uplift or 110% uplift amounts) and the balance of tax owing on the third. Hadleigh determines the amounts to transfer from the pool at the first two instalments as follows (the lowest being the shaded amount): Table 5 110% instament amount A 105% instalment amount B RIT instalment amount (C/3) Lowest Brock $7,000,000 $5,000,000 $6,666,667 105% BBA $4,000,000 $3,500,000 $15,000,000 105% Page 132 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 BBW $8,000,000 $9,100,000 $9,000,000 105%/RIT 17 BBS $1,400,000 $600,000 NIL RIT The transfers required are as follows: Table 6 First instalment Second instalment Third instalment Total Brock $5,000,000 $5,000,000 $10,000,000 $20,000,000 BBA $3,500,000 $3,500,000 $28,000,000 $35,000,000 BBW $8,000,000 $9,000,000 18 $10,000,000 $27,000,000 BBS NIL NIL NIL NIL Total $16,500,000 $17,600,000 $47,900,000 $82,000,000 Brock arranges the transfers on that basis and sells the remaining $300,000 overpayment to other taxpayers within the tax pool. All of the companies in the Brock Group can use the interest concession rules in section 120KBB as all the members of the Group are using the standard uplift method, none have filed a provisional tax estimate, and none of the anti-avoidance provisions apply. This is notwithstanding the Brock Group has only transferred the minimum amounts required to ensure that no UOMI is incurred. However, if any of the Brock companies later receives a reassessment, UOMI could apply to the increased amount. For example, say BBS receives a reassessment two years later and some expenses claimed by BBS were capital in nature and it’s RIT instalment amounts should have been $625,000 it is potentially subject to UOMI on $600,000 per instalment (being the 105% uplift instalment amount) as it did not make any payments for the year. If Hadleigh had made the uplift payments required, no UOMI would apply to the reassessment until the final instalment. Note for 17 The lesser of instalment amount and RIT for the first instalment will be the 105% uplift but for the second instalment because BBW had filed its 2019–20 tax return prior to the second instalment the lesser amount for that instalment will be the RIT. 18 Because BBW had filed its 2019–20 tax return prior to the second instalment the 110% uplift amount is no longer available. If BBW had not filed until after the second instalment it would have still had the lesser of the two amounts available. However, its RIT is less than the 105% uplift amount which is the lowest amount. Page 133 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 completeness that this later reassessment of BBS does not mean the interest concession rules are no longer applicable for the other group companies. Page 134 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Clarifying the application of late payment penalties applicable from the final provisional tax instalment date Section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An inadvertent legislative change meant that late payment penalties were applied to a taxpayer’s total provisional tax liability for the year rather than an instalment amount on the final instalment date. This amendment aligns the legislation with administrative practice and with policy intention. As such, it will have no effect on taxpayers. Key features This change aligns the legislation with Inland Revenue’s systems to ensure that late payment penalties are only calculated on an instalment amount at the date of the final instalment of provisional tax for the year rather than on the total outstanding tax liability at that date. UOMI will continue to accrue on the total tax liability outstanding. This change aligns the legislation with the policy intent and the system configuration of Inland Revenue’s technology platforms. Application date The amendment applies from the 2017–18 income year to provide certainty to taxpayers. Detailed analysis The interest concession rules are contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, these rules essentially allow those taxpayers who use the standard method and make the required payments to have no exposure to UOMI until the day after the final provisional tax instalment is due for the year. When the interest concession rules were introduced it was seen as desirable to align the basis for the calculation of UOMI and late payment penalties. This was done in the legislation and for the instalments, other than the final one. This is working as intended as both UOMI and late payment penalties are calculated using the lower of the standard instalment (105% of CY-1 or 110% of CY-2) or one third of their current year RIT. Page 135 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 However, on the final instalment the legislation required the same formula to be used to calculate UOMI and the late payment penalty amount. 19 For the calculation of UOMI all of the taxpayer’s remaining tax liability is deemed to be due at the date of the third instalment as UOMI applies to that amount from the day after that date. However, for late payment penalties this basis is inappropriate as charging a taxpayer for their entire RIT at that final instalment date is particularly unfair where they do not necessarily know the exact amount due. The basis for the penalty should be the lower of the instalment amount or one third of the taxpayer’s RIT. Previously, legislation did not support this. Late payment penalties should only apply to an instalment amount rather than the total tax liability at that point although UOMI should apply on the full shortfall. Inland Revenue’s systems were not configured to reflect the legislation but to reflect the policy intent to charge a penalty based on the lower of the instalment amount or one third of the taxpayers RIT – the same basis as the other instalments. The amendment aligns the legislation with the system in this case and changes the legal basis for the calculation of the penalty on the final instalment to be the lower of the standard instalment due or one third of the taxpayer’s RIT. In addition, the definition of RIT for the purposes of calculating UOMI is clarified to ensure it more clearly refers to the taxpayer’s current year RIT. Example 23 Fowls by Fowler Limited (FbF) runs a free-range chicken egg producing farm where consumers can follow the hens on live social media to ensure the eggs they purchase are produced by chickens living the high life in large fields and luxury egg laying suites. Josh the owner, and chicken fanatic, manages the provisional tax payments for the company. Because of the fluctuation in demand for eggs Josh uses the standard uplift method to pay provisional tax as, in the past, he has incurred UOMI costs for unexpected income received during the year. He calculates the standard uplift amount for the 2020–21 income year as being $210,000 and makes three payments of $70,000 to Inland Revenue on the required due dates. 19 Note that for the final instalment taxpayers cannot use 110% of the year previous to the prior year as they must have filed their prior year return before the date of this payment. Page 136 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The 2020–21 year has been particularly good for FbF due to the introduction of their online serial featuring “Henny” one of the chickens on the farm who has taken a shine to the toys placed around the farm to keep the chickens busy. Sales of special “Henny Eggs” have skyrocketed. It turns out that the provisional tax payments made by FbF were insufficient and FbF should have made three instalments of $100,000. The following table sets out on what amount UOMI and LPPs would apply to FbF before and after the amendment. Instalment UOMI before UOMI after LPPs before 20 LPPs after 21 First Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Same as UOMI before Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Second Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Same as UOMI before Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Third/final Subject to UOMI on $90,000 being the actual liability ($300,000) less payments made ($210,000) Same as UOMI before Subject to LPP on $90,000 being the actual liability ($300,000) less payments made ($210,000) Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time 20 Practically no one has been charged an LPP based on this calculation as Inland Revenue systems have been correctly calculating LPPs based on the policy intent. 21 Note Inland Revenue’s computer systems have always been calculating in this manner it is only the legislation that has been amended. Page 137 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Removing the ability for taxpayers to choose the provisional tax instalment to which a particular payment is applied Sections 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 previously contained a provision that permitted a taxpayer to direct the application of a provisional tax payment made to a particular instalment. Prior to the introduction of the interest concession rules in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the removal of incremental penalties from income tax it was always beneficial for taxpayers to apply payments to the oldest debt first. Since the introduction of the interest concession rules and removal of incremental penalties this is no longer true. A taxpayer could inappropriately apply the payment to more recent debt in order to avoid late payment penalties. Removing the ability of taxpayers to choose the particular instalment to allocate a provisional tax payment eliminates this issue. This section also clarifies that the Commissioner is required to allocate the particular payment to the oldest debt first. Inland Revenue’s systems do not allow the allocation of a payment to particular payment dates when there is debt on a prior provisional tax date. This amendment does not impact most taxpayers but will prohibit non-compliant taxpayers from reducing their exposure to late payment penalties. Key features The ability for taxpayers to allocate their provisional tax payment to particular instalments has been removed and the Commissioner is required to allocate payments to the oldest outstanding provisional tax instalment. Page 138 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The amendment applies from the 2018–19 income year for integrity reasons. In the unlikely event of a taxpayer having previously requested and obtained a payment direction a savings provision preserves this treatment. 22 Detailed analysis The payment allocation rules for provisional tax payments are contained in section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These provide that if a taxpayer makes a provisional tax payment and does not specify which instalment it should be directed to, the Commissioner must apply the payment where she thinks the taxpayer would have applied it. 23 Or, if the taxpayer does specify which instalment, the Commissioner must apply the payment to that particular instalment. 24 Prior to the inclusion of the interest concession rules and removal of incremental late payment penalties 25 from income tax it was always beneficial to apply payments to the oldest debt first as this would reduce the taxpayer’s liability to both incremental penalties and UOMI. Since the interest concession rules were introduced it can be more advantageous for taxpayers to allocate their payments to specific provisional tax instalments to reduce their liability to late payment penalties on later instalments. 22 This is an unlikely event as the FIRST system does not support this type of payment allocation. 23 Section 120L(2)(b). 24 Section 120L(2)(a). 25 Incremental late payment penalties applied at 1% for each month the debt was outstanding. These were removed from income tax from 1 April 2018. Thus, the only late payment penalties that apply to income tax are the initial penalty of 1% the day after the due date and 4% seven days after the due date. Page 139 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 24 Grouchy Limited (Grouchy) is owned by Oscar and is a provisional taxpayer for the 2020–21 year. Its instalments are $25,000 at each provisional tax instalment. Oscar is a bit cash strapped and fails to pay the first instalment of provisional tax for Grouchy. Grouchy is charged a late payment penalty on the $25,000 debt of $1,250 as well as UOMI for that debt. At the second instalment date Grouchy has a spare $25,000 and decides to make a payment as provisional tax. Prior to the removal of incremental penalties and the interest concession rules it would be more beneficial for Oscar to allocate that payment of $25,000 to the first instalment of provisional tax to reduce both incremental penalties and UOMI on that outstanding debt. Subsequent to the changes Oscar now considers it more advantageous to allocate that payment to the second instalment. This will avoid any late payment penalties or UOMI arising on that payment. Given that there are no further late payment penalties on the debt from the first instalment and only UOMI is accruing on that, he will be $1,250 better off by allocating the payment to the second instalment. This example is not appropriate. It gives a benefit to taxpayers who have outstanding debt. In addition, both the FIRST system and the configuration of the START system cannot allocate payments in this manner. The amendment removes the ability for taxpayers to request which provisional instalment their payment is allocated to. This removes the ability for non-compliant taxpayers to reduce their exposure to late payment penalties and UOMI. A provision has also been added to the legislation to require the Commissioner to apply payments to the oldest unpaid instalment first. Page 140 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Clarifying the way in which provisional tax is truncated to whole dollars Section 120KF of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background It is Inland Revenue’s operational practice to truncate provisional tax amounts to whole numbers and its technology platforms have been designed in keeping with that practice. However, Inland Revenue’s legal team concluded that the way in which its technology platforms truncates instalments to whole numbers was not consistent with the legislation. Inland Revenue’s systems have been configured to apply these rules on truncated whole dollars and will not prevent taxpayers receiving a concession when partial dollars are truncated. The amendment confirms that configuration. In practical terms, this amendment will not affect any taxpayers. Key features The amendment confirms that where Inland Revenue systems truncate provisional tax amounts to whole numbers, payment of those whole dollar amounts rather than the amount including cents will be considered to meet the requirements to take advantage of concessionary regimes such as the safe harbour in section 120KE. Application date The amendment applies from the 2017–18 income year. Detailed analysis Truncating to whole dollars for any instalment is beneficial to taxpayers both through simplicity and marginally financially. However, it can have negative consequences when Page 141 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 assessing whether taxpayers meet certain requirements, such as the safe harbour 26 from UOMI. If cents are included and taxpayers pay the truncated whole dollar amount which the system has told them to pay, technically, they do not meet the requirements of the safe harbour. Inland Revenue’s legal team reviewed the legislation that deals with the calculation of provisional tax instalments and the application of UOMI to any shortfalls. One of their conclusions was that the legislation and the system did not align for the way in which amounts are truncated. When provisional tax instalments are calculated under the standard method the legislation requires the uplifted amount to be divided into three equal instalments. For simplicity to taxpayers the system ignores, or truncates, any cents in that calculation. Example 25 Assume that Grover Limited (Grover) is a provisional taxpayer who uses the standard uplift method. Their RIT for the 2020–21 income year was $124,567. This will make their standard method uplift amount for the following year $130,795.35. Grover’s three instalments will be calculated as follows: Instalment Calculation Amount of instalment Truncated amount 1 $130,795.35 ÷ 3 $43,598.45 $43,598 2 ($130,795.35 × (2 ÷ 3)) − $43,598.45 $43,598.45 $43,598 3 ($130,795.35 − $43,598.45 - $43,598.45) $43,598.45 $43,599 Total $130,795.35 $130,795 26 The safe harbour includes taxpayers with RIT of less than $60,000 who have made the required standard instalments. In this case UOMI will not start until the terminal tax date (usually 7 February the following year). Page 142 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 However, to determine whether a taxpayer has met the criteria for the interest concession rules, for example, technically the taxpayer should have paid the instalment outlined in the amount of instalment column in the table, which is $43,598.45. The system does not use this amount and assesses the ability to use concessions based on the truncated whole number. This is a taxpayer friendly treatment and is much simpler. The amendment aligns the legislation with the system to ensure that taxpayers are not prohibited from using a concession because they have not paid the cents for an instalment. Within Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, truncating now takes place at two points in calculating a taxpayer’s provisional tax instalments. In the majority of cases this process will give the same result as noted above. Diagrammatically the new truncation process can be illustrated as follows: Residual Income Tax (dollars and cents) Uplift (5% or 10%) Truncate to whole dollars Calculate instalment Truncate to whole dollars Instalment (whole dollars) Estimate provided by customer Example 26 Recalculating the example above, Grover’s RIT for the 2020–21 income year was $124,567. This will make their standard method uplift amount for the following year $130,795.35. Grover’s three instalments will be calculated as follows (highlighted in grey): 105% uplift $130,795.35 Truncate $130,795.00 Divided by three instalments $43,598.33 Truncate $43,598.00 First instalment $43,598.00 Second Instalment ($130,795.00 × (2/3) − ($43,598.00)) $43,598.66 Truncate $43,598.00 Page 143 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Third/Final Instalment ($130,795.00 − ($43,598.00 × 2)) $43,599.00 Page 144 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Non-standard provisional tax instalments Section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background An amendment was made to section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 when the interest concession rules in section 120KBB were inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure the definitions worked with the new rules. A taxpayer that has more or less than three instalments of provisional tax, was not correctly dealt with and this is corrected for clarity. Key features This amendment alters section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to account for taxpayers who have a non-standard number of instalments of provisional tax. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Detailed analysis When the interest concession rules were introduced in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 a late change was made to the legislation to deal with taxpayers who had more or less than three instalments of provisional tax. A number of references were correctly altered in the final Act to account for this change, however, one was missed. A definition in section 139B(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was not updated for the inclusion of these taxpayers and still referred to three instalments of provisional tax. This has not adversely affected any taxpayers as Inland Revenue has applied that section as it was intended. However, the amendment updates the definition to account for taxpayers who have more or less than three provisional tax instalments from the 2019–20 income year. Page 145 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Amend the date a goods and services tax credit becomes available for a taxpayer to use Section 173L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background This amendment moves the day a GST credit is available from the day after the return was filed, to the day the credit arises. As this amendment is minor and is taxpayer favourable this change has already been operationalised within Inland Revenues system and thus does not practically affect any taxpayers. Key features This amendment alters the date that a GST credit becomes available to a taxpayer when they file their GST return other than on the due date for the return. It moves the date the credit is available to be used from the day after the return is filed to the day the return is filed. Application date The amendment applies from the date the original change was made, for taxable periods on or after 1 April 2018, as practically this will have no impact on any taxpayer and it will protect those taxpayers who have already received credits at the earlier date. Detailed analysis The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 made a change to the day on which a GST refund was available to a taxpayer. This more closely aligned the availability of a GST refund to when the taxpayer filed the return in which the credit arose. Credits were available on:  the earlier of either the day after the taxpayer filed their return or the day after the GST period which the credit relates to if the taxpayer filed early, or Page 146 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  the day after the end of the GST period to which the refund relates if they filed on the due date, or  the day after they filed their return if they filed their return late. Having the credit available the day after it arises (that is, the day the return is processed, and the refund established) is problematic for administrative purposes. It is generally good practice to have the credit available on the same date that it arises within the system. As a consequence, the date in the legislation has been changed to the date the GST refund arises. As this change is taxpayer friendly and the issues that arose from treating the credit available the day after it was assessed were problematic this change has already been operationalised within Inland Revenues START environment. The legislative change has no practical effect on taxpayers. Page 147 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Clarification for taxpayers who pay provisional tax in one or two instalments Sections RC 13(3) and RC 14 (2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background Section RC 9(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies where a person is liable to pay provisional tax but has not provided a return in the preceding year and whose residual income tax (RIT) in the year before the preceding year is less than $2,500. Section RC 9(10) then states that sections RC 13(1)(b) or RC 14(1)(b) will apply so that provisional tax is payable in either two or one instalment(s), depending on when the prior year’s return is filed. There was an interpretation issue with sections RC 13(3) and RC 14(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 which reference section RC 9(9)(b) and (c). There was a missing link for these scenarios in sections RC 13(3) and RC 14(3) respectively. These sections referred only to “initial provisional taxpayers”, so taxpayers were not provided legislative guidance as to how many instalments to pay or how to apply sections RC 13 or RC 14 in other cases. Key features These changes remove the restriction to RC 9(9)(b) for sections RC 13(3) and RC 14(3) to more clearly provide legislative guidance for those taxpayers to whom section RC 9(4)(c) applies and how many provisional tax instalments they are required to make for a year. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. Detailed analysis The amendment removes reference to section RC 9(9)(b) from sections RC 13 and RC 14 which will now not restrict these to “initial provisional taxpayers”. Page 148 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Taxpayers’ and Inland Revenue’s administrative practice is to ignore the fact that section RC 9(9) only technically applies to initial provisional taxpayers and thus it is not expected this amendment will practically affect many taxpayers Although taxpayers to whom section RC 9(9)(b) does apply are only required to make one or two provisional tax instalments use-of-money interest will apply across three instalments rather than the number of instalments. However, the distinction is important when considering the application of late payment penalties and whether taxpayers have met conditions for interest concession rules, such as the safe harbour. Page 149 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Calculating standard provisional tax instalments for amalgamated and consolidated companies Section RC 29 and RC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background Sections RC 29 and RC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 outline how a new consolidated group or amalgamated company should calculate their standard method uplift amount of provisional tax. These sections previously only referred to the year preceding the current tax year. This wording did not correctly deal with the situation where those amalgamating or consolidating companies have not filed their prior year tax returns. Key features The changes clarify that, when calculating provisional tax instalments for an amalgamated company or a consolidated group, the taxpayer can use the prior year or the year proceeding the prior year (as applicable) to calculate their standard uplift instalments. Application date The amendments apply for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis The standard method uses either 105% of the preceding year current year-1 (CY-1) or 110% of the year prior to the preceding year (CY-2). Previously, both sections RC 29 and 33 only referred to the CY-1 calculation. The sections have been amended to refer to the CY-2 year where the entities forming the group or amalgamated company have yet to file their CY-1 tax return and can therefore only base their provisional tax on the CY-2 residual income tax. We understand taxpayers have practically been applying this rule so it should not have any practical effect on taxpayers. Page 150 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Ensuring the provisional tax rules apply appropriately to partners and members of unincorporated bodies Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background In determining whether a person has an initial provisional tax liability the definition of “taxable activity” is used to determine if someone has started a business. This definition refers to the definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 but currently excludes taxpayers who earn exempt supplies (that is, the initial provisional taxpayer rules apply to taxpayers who make exempt supplies). However, the definition excluded partners of partnerships and members of other unincorporated bodies as, for GST purposes, it is the partnership/unincorporated body which is carrying on the taxable activity. This appeared to be an omission which was not consistent with the framework of the provisional tax regime as these entities are look-through entities they are not themselves subject to provisional tax. Key features The definition of “taxable activity” in the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to provisional tax has been amended to include partners and members of unincorporated bodies within the definition of initial provisional taxpayer. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis The amendment modifies the definition of “taxable activity” within section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that partners and members of unincorporated bodies are not excluded from the definition of an initial provisional taxpayer. Page 151 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Ensuring the early payment discount applies as intended Section RC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background “Small business persons” are entitled to an early-payment discount of income tax. The purpose of that discount is to encourage the payment of income tax in the income year before the income year in which the small-business person is required to pay provisional tax. Inland Revenue’s legal team identified an issue with the legislation and the application of the early payment discount to taxpayers who meet the criteria. Inland Revenue’s systems have been applying the law as it should apply, however, to improve certainty for taxpayers the legislation has been aligned with this practice. Key features Section RC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to ensure that the early payment discount applies as intended by changing the wording “not liable to pay provisional tax” to “liable to pay provisional tax under section RC 3(1)(a) but not obligated to make any payments under section RC 3(3)”. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. Page 152 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Clarify the definition of provisional tax Section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background Formerly, the wording of section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 referred only to “provisional tax” which is not defined. This section has been amended to include both provisional tax and any late payment penalties on that provisional tax. Key features Section 120L of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to ensure that the term “provisional tax” includes any late payment penalties. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. Page 153 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Align the treatment of overpaid tax by a company using the accounting income method (AIM) with tax paid on behalf of aim shareholders Section RC 35B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background There are two ways in which an AIM company can transfer overpaid tax to its shareholders. The first is where the company creates a provision for shareholder employees’ salary and pays tax on that on behalf of the shareholders to enable the company to take a tax deduction for the provision. In this situation the company acts as an “agent” for the shareholder employee and the tax is “transferred” as a tax credit reducing the shareholder employee’s residual tax liability. The second situation is where the company overpays tax most likely because shareholder remuneration is not deducted by the company until the end of the year in which case the overpayment transfers at the shareholder’s provisional tax dates. Key features This amendment standardised the treatment of overpayments by an AIM company so that in both situations the transfer will reduce the residual income tax of the shareholder employee (subject to the safeguards that already exist to reduce the ability to game the rules). Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Page 154 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Inclusion of a tolerance for provisional tax instalments Section 120KF of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a safe harbour provision from the application of use-of-money interest (UOMI) to some provisional taxpayers. The safe harbour applies where a taxpayer has residual income tax that is less than $60,000, they have used the standard uplift provisional tax calculation method, and they paid all their instalments as required. The result of this concession is that no UOMI is charged on any unpaid tax until the taxpayer’s terminal tax date (which is generally February of the year after the income year where the liability arises). If the safe harbour does not apply, then UOMI would generally apply from the date of their final instalment of provisional tax for the income year in question. This is generally nine months earlier than the terminal tax date. Thus, the safe harbour provides a significant concession to those who fit the criteria. Some issues have arisen, the result of which is that a small underpayment is providing an adverse result to taxpayers that is disproportionate to the error being made. In one case a taxpayer who accidently underpaid their instalments by 30 cents resulted in a UOMI bill of $2,400 because of the loss of the protection of the safe harbour. Key features This amendment adds a tolerance in the legislation to deal with these issues. This tolerance allows taxpayers to retain the benefits of the safe harbour even though they underpaid by a small amount. The amount of the tolerance is $20 per instalment which aligns to the amount of the small balance write-off amount (for tax other than auto-calculation assessments). This will ensure that a person who underpays by small amounts will not be disproportionately penalised for that omission. Page 155 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The amendment applies for the 2017–18 and later income years and retrospectively addresses the existing cases where taxpayers have been disadvantaged. Detailed analysis This amendment adds a tolerance to provisional tax payments which are slightly short paid. For payments made that are within $20 or less of the instalment amount the taxpayer will be deemed to have paid the instalment amount for the purposes of determining if the taxpayer has met the requirement of paying their instalments in full and on time to use the safe harbour concession. This change only allows a tolerance for the amount paid and not the date of the payment. Taxpayers who pay late will continue to fall out of the safe harbour. Example 27 Phyllis’ Bakers Limited (PBL) is a small bakery business based in Papakura. Phyllis is the owner of PBL and while she is a fantastic baker her accounting and tax skills are less so. She has We Get It Right Accountants Limited (WGRA) to do the accounting and tax work for her successful business. PBL is a provisional taxpayer with a 31 March balance date and for the 2019–20 income year is required to pay three instalments of $10,000 to Inland Revenue. Phyllis asks WGRA to make the required payments as and when they come due. WGRA makes the first instalment on 28 August 2019 for $10,000. But then for the second instalment on the 15th of January 2020 PBL is also required to pay a supplier an amount of $9,999.70. Due to a clerical mix up at WGRA the numbers for provisional tax and the payment to the supplier were transposed incorrectly. PGL only pays $9,999.70. On the third instalment date WGRA does pay the correct instalment of $10,000. When they get to the end of the year the residual income tax for PBL is $57,000. WGRA tells Phyllis that she will have to pay $27,000.30 27 on the 7th of Feb and no UOMI will be charged because she is in the safe harbour as her residual income tax for the year is less than $60,000. Unfortunately, one of the requirements to use the safe harbour concession is that payments are made full and on time. Because PBL paid their second instalment 30 cent less than the required 27 RIT – payments to date = $57,000 − ($10,000 + $9,999.70 + $10,000). Page 156 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 instalment they will be charged UOMI from the third provisional tax instalment date. This equates to $1,678.25. However, because the payment made was made within $20 or less of the actual instalment amount the tolerance will ensure that PBL is deemed to have made the instalment in full and therefore they will meet the safe harbour requirements, no UOMI will be charged and WGRA does not have to have a courageous conversation with Phyllis explaining why she ended up with a large interest bill. Page 157 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Amend the definition of “start tax type” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include Release 4 tax types Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background Release 4 of Business Transformation will migrate more tax types onto Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, START. Section 183C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 deals with rules around the cancellation of interest. These rules are specific to the START platform only and as taxes migrate to that platform the rules for cancellation of interest change over what was done in the old technology platform, FIRST. It was necessary to include those tax types that are being migrated to START as part of Release 4 in the definition of “START tax type” so that the cancellation of interest rules are applied correctly. Key features These tax types are now included in the definition of START tax types in the Tax Administration Act 1994:  PAYE deductions;  child support deductions made by an employer;  student loan deductions made by an employer;  KiwiSaver deductions made by an employer;  compulsory employer KiwiSaver contributions; and  specified superannuation contribution tax (SSCWT or ESCT or both). Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. Page 158 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Adding START tax types to section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background As part of Release 4 of Business Transformation, new tax types are being introduced into START. With the inclusion of the new tax types Inland Revenue is able to direct credit refunds through section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, some of the tax types included in Release 4 did not fall within the definition of tax in section 184A(5). Key features The following tax types are now included in the definition of tax in section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994:  reserve schemes (income equalisation schemes and environmental restoration account schemes); and  unclaimed monies for the purpose of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Page 159 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Self-correcting certain errors in subsequent returns Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to resolve ambiguities that were identified following changes made in 2019 to the rules that allow taxpayers to self-correct certain errors in returns for income tax, GST and FBT. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains rules which recognise the compliance and administration costs associated with making amendments to returns and assessments which contain errors. These rules allow errors which do not breach certain prescribed thresholds to be corrected in the next return due, following discovery of the error. These rules are contained in section 113A and apply in respect of errors that relate to returns for income tax, FBT, and GST. These rules were amended in 2019 as part of a suite of changes made to modernise core components of the Act by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. Following enactment of the changes, several ambiguities within the application of the new thresholds were identified. The amendments made by the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 are intended to resolve these ambiguities to make the application of the thresholds clearer. Key features The key features of the amendments:  confirm that the $10,000 limit in the materiality threshold test refers to the tax discrepancy caused by all of the errors in a return and not the amount of the individual errors themselves;  ensure that there is no confusion between the application of the thresholds in section 113A of the Act and other provisions within the Inland Revenue Acts and associated regulations which allow for the self-correction of errors in relation to other tax types; and Page 160 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  clarify that multiple errors that do not exceed the materiality threshold can be corrected, provided the total discrepancy caused by the errors do not exceed the threshold. Application date These amendments apply from 23 March 2020, the date of enactment. Detailed analysis Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows taxpayers to correct certain errors contained in returns for income tax, FBT, and GST, provided the total tax discrepancy of the errors do not breach prescribed thresholds. Subsection (2) provides that the rules contained in section 113A which enable taxpayers to self-correct errors within the prescribed thresholds do not apply to ancillary taxes (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) other than fringe benefit tax. The amendment is intended to resolve a possible conflict between the rules in section 113A and rules which provide for the self-correction of errors for other ancillary taxes. 28 The prescribed thresholds in section 113A are contained in subsections (3) and (4). The $1,000 threshold is provided for in subsection (3). This allows errors which, for a single return, result in a total tax discrepancy of $1,000 or less, to be corrected in the next return due following discovery of the errors. Subsections (3B) and (4) contain the rules for the correcting errors which are, in relation to the taxpayer, not considered to be material errors. Errors which are not material can be corrected in the next return due following discovery of the errors. Subsection (4) provides the requirements for determining whether errors are material. Errors are not material for these purposes where the total tax discrepancy of all of the errors in a single return do not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of the person’s: 28 For example, for errors relating to employment-related taxes such as PAYE, see the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 and for errors relating to RWT and NRWT, see sections RA 11 and RA 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Page 161 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  annual gross income, 29 for errors relating to income tax and FBT; and  output tax, for errors relating to GST. The following examples demonstrate how the rules are intended to apply. Example 28: Application of the $1,000 threshold for an income tax return Michael’s Fun Sails Ltd (MFS) is a company specialising in the development of cutting-edge and quirky boating apparatus. The in-house accountant determines that depreciation has been overclaimed on an industrial sewing machine. This error was included in the income tax return for the 2019–20 income year. The overclaimed depreciation amounted to $2,500. MFS is a close company which means the overclaimed depreciation represents a total tax discrepancy in the 2019–20 income tax return of $700 (that is, $2,500 x 28 percent). As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error is not more than $1,000, the error can be corrected in the next income tax return which is due following discovery of the error. Example 29: Application of the $1,000 threshold for a GST return Josh’s Flowers Ltd is a close company which is operated by Josh, the company’s sole shareholder and employee. The company is registered for GST and files its returns on a six-monthly basis. When reviewing the company’s accounts for the last six-monthly period, Josh identifies one month’s worth of taxable supplies had not been recorded in the GST return due to a glitch with his accounting package. The amount of missing supplies was $1,800. The total tax discrepancy in the return owing to the omitted taxable supplies is $270 (that is, $1,800 x 15 percent). As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error is not more than $1,000, the error can be corrected in the next GST return which is due following discovery of the error. 29 “annual gross income” is defined in section BC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and applies for these purposes. This refers to a person’s total assessable income which is allocated to their corresponding income year. Page 162 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 30: Application of the $1,000 threshold for an FBT return Claire’s Clown Cars Ltd (CCC) is in the business of leasing cars to circuses across New Zealand. CCC has a mixture of special vehicles which are used in circus performances as well as a fleet of ordinary vehicles. CCC allows its employees to use vehicles for private purposes and is accordingly registered for FBT. CCC’s accountant Patt Milkinton identifies an error in an FBT return which was filed two quarters ago. The error resulted in FBT not being paid on the value of fringe benefits provided to one of CCC’s employees, who had one of CCC’s ordinary vehicles for 15 days during the relevant quarter. The vehicle had a tax book value (including GST) of $15,000. The accountant notes that the amount of FBT that was not paid to Inland Revenue as a result of the error, and thus the total tax discrepancy caused by the error was $140.16. As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error is not more than $1,000, the error can be corrected in the next FBT return due following discovery of the error. Example 31: Application of the $1,000 threshold with multiple errors in the same return When conducting a routine review of the GST returns for Bary’s Brownies and Liqourice Rolls Ltd the company’s bookkeeper Phil identifies that both the output tax and input tax deductions recorded in the company’s GST return for the taxable period ending 31 March 2020 were both understated. Phil determines that the output tax was understated by $2,000 and the input tax deductions were understated by $1,500. The total tax discrepancy caused by these two errors is $500 (that is, $2,000 of output tax minus the $1,500 of input tax deductions). As the total tax discrepancy caused by the errors is not more than $1,000, both errors can be corrected in the next GST return due following discovery of the errors. Example 32: Application of the materiality threshold for an income tax return The accountant at JASE Co Ltd, a close company, identifies an error with the depreciation calculations which resulted in an understatement of the company’s profit for the income year ending 31 March 2020. The error resulted in depreciation being overclaimed of $20,000. This represents a tax discrepancy of $5,200 (that is, $20,000 x 28 percent). The annual gross income as stated in JASE Co Ltd’s accounts for the 2019–20 income year is $300,000. Two percent of this is $6,000. Page 163 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error does not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of JASE Co Ltd’s annual gross income, the error can be corrected in the next income tax return due following discovery of the error. Example 33: Application of the materiality threshold for a GST return Laura’s Library of Books Ltd (LLB) is a company that comprises of a chain of bookstores specialising in contemporary fiction. Laura has 30 stores across New Zealand. After reconciling information provided by all of the stores to the head office in Wellington, the bookkeeper Matt realises that the Pahiatua store’s sales are missing from the GST return for the taxable period up to 31 March 2018 which has resulted in the incorrect amount of output tax being paid to Inland Revenue. The total omitted sales were $10,000. This represents a total tax discrepancy of $1,500 (that is,, $10,000 x 15 percent). The output tax that was paid to Inland Revenue for the period was $75,000 and two percent of the output tax for the period is $1,500. As the total tax discrepancy that was caused by the error does not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of LLB’s output tax for the period, the error can be corrected in the next GST return due following discovery of the error. Example 34: Application of the materiality threshold for an FBT return Ben and Ben’s Running Emporium Ltd (B&BRE) stocks rare and specialist running equipment. B&BRE also manufacture and sell high-end running gear to both New Zealand and international consumers. On occasion, some of the product B&BRE manufacture is sold to employees at a discount. Consequently B&BRE is registered for FBT and files returns on a quarterly basis. Thomas, the accountant for B&BRE realises that for the quarter ending 30 June 2020 an error was made in determining the amount of FBT it was liable for. The total taxable benefits B&BRE provided during the quarter was $14,000 to 28 of the store’s sales staff. B&BRE use the standard rate to determine the amount of fringe benefit tax payable and therefore the correct amount of fringe benefit tax payable for the quarter was $8,721.09. The amount shown on the return sent to Inland Revenue for the quarter however showed total taxable benefits of $10,000, with an amount to pay in FBT of $6,229.35. Page 164 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The total tax discrepancy caused by the error in the return is $2,491.74 (that is, the difference between the FBT that was originally declared as being payable and the correct amount of FBT that is payable). B&BRE’s annual gross income for the most recently completed income year was $150,000 and two percent of this is $2,500. As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error does not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of B&BRE’s annual gross income, the error can be corrected in the next FBT return due following discovery of the error. Example 35: Application of the materiality threshold with multiple errors in the same return Marley’s Poodle Grooming Services Limited (MPGC) files GST returns on a two-monthly basis. It operates poodle grooming services through multiple stores located all across New Zealand. Linda, the accountant, identifies multiple errors in the company’s GST return for the period ending 31 May 2020. The output tax as stated in the original return was $100,000. The errors resulted in output tax being understated by $4,000 and input tax deductions being understated by $2,000. The total tax discrepancy caused by the errors is $2,000 (that is, $4,000 of output tax minus $2,000 of input tax deductions). As the total tax discrepancy of the errors do not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of MPGS’s output tax for the return, the errors can both be corrected in the next return due following discovery of the errors. Minor amendments have been made to subsection (5) to reflect the fact that taxpayers do not make assessments for fringe benefit tax. The purpose of subsection (5) remains the same, which is to provide that a person cannot apply the materiality threshold if their main purpose for doing so is to delay the payment of tax. This is intended to ensure that the purpose of these rules is targeted at providing a mechanism to resolve genuine errors which are identified after returns have been submitted to Inland Revenue. Page 165 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Amendments relating to the binding rulings regime Sections 91EI, 9ESB, and 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several minor amendments have been made to the binding rulings regime in Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure the rules operate as intended. Background The provisions that enable the binding rulings regime are contained in Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The purpose of the binding rulings regime is to provide taxpayers with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws and help them meet their obligations under those laws by enabling the Commissioner to issue rulings that will bind the Commissioner on the application of those laws. Several changes have been made to the scope of the binding rulings regime in recent years, including through the introduction of a new type of binding ruling – short-process rulings – and extending the scope of the binding rulings regime to enable the Commissioner to issue binding rulings for a broader range of matters, including those that do not require an “arrangement”. The amendments made by the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 ensure that the recent changes work as intended. Key features The key features of the amendments:  Provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to withdraw short- process rulings. This is based on existing provisions which enable the Commissioner to withdraw other forms of binding rulings; and  Enable a person who has a binding ruling that has been withdrawn to continue to rely on that binding ruling where the ruling was for a matter not involving an arrangement. Page 166 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application dates The amendment that enables the Commissioner to withdraw short-process rulings applies from 23 March 2020 (the date of enactment), and an application provision has been included to ensure that there is no ambiguity as to whether the Commissioner can withdraw short- process rulings that have been issued before 23 March 2020 but prior to the passing of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. The amendments that allow for continued reliance on withdrawn binding rulings apply from 18 March 2019. This is the date from which the Commissioner has been able to issue binding rulings in respect of certain matters not involving arrangements. Detailed analysis Ability to withdraw short-process rulings New section 91ESB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the Commissioner with the ability to withdraw short-process rulings. It might be appropriate in the circumstances for the Commissioner to withdraw a short-process ruling where there is a change in the interpretation of the law by either the courts or the Commissioner, or where the relevant ruling needs to be replaced with a variation. For the Commissioner to withdraw a short-process ruling, the Commissioner must issue a notice informing the person to whom the ruling applies that the ruling is to be withdrawn. The Commissioner will do this by issuing a notice of withdrawal. The notice of withdrawal will also specify the date that the withdrawal takes effect, and this date cannot be earlier than the date on which the person could reasonably be expected to receive the notice of withdrawal. Where a short-process ruling for a person has been withdrawn, there are two circumstances in which the person can continue to rely on that ruling. These are where:  The ruling relates to a matter involving an arrangement. In these circumstances, if the person has already entered into the arrangement before the ruling was withdrawn, the person can continue to rely on the ruling for the period specified in the ruling. If, however, the arrangement had not been entered into before the date the ruling was withdrawn, the ruling no longer applies. This is provided for in section 91ESB(3) of the Act. Page 167 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  The ruling relates to a matter not involving an arrangement, for example where the ruling relates to a person’s status. 30 In these circumstances, if the ruling is withdrawn, the person can continue to rely on the ruling for the period specified in the ruling. This is provided for in section 91ESB(4) of the Act. Date withdrawal takes effect where ruling was for a matter not involving an arrangement Since March 2019 the Commissioner has been able to issue binding rulings for a broader range of matters which do not require the existence of an arrangement. Section 91CB of the Act enables the Commissioner to issue binding rulings on:  a person’s status (for example, whether they are a resident or a non-resident for tax purposes in New Zealand);  whether an item of property meets the definition of “trading stock” or “revenue account property” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and  whether an amount derived by a person is income under certain provisions in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to land transactions. The Commissioner can issue private and product rulings in relation to these matters. It was therefore appropriate that amendments be made to the provisions that enable the Commissioner to withdraw private rulings (section 91EI of the Act) and product rulings (section 91FJ of the Act) to ensure that where a ruling has been issued on such matters, the dates from which the ruling no longer applies is clear. The amendments provide that if a private ruling or a product ruling has been issued for such a matter as described above, and that ruling is subsequently withdrawn, the person to whom the ruling applies can continue to rely on the ruling for the period or tax year specified in the ruling. 30 For a list of matters that the Commissioner is able to issue certain binding rulings in relation to that do not require an arrangement, see section 91CB of the Act. Page 168 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Process for removing a person from the list of tax agents and disallowing status as a nominated person or representative Section 124G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Minor amendments have been made to the provision of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remove a person from the list of tax agents, or disallow their status as a representative or a nominated person. The amendment ensures the process operates as intended. Background A broader range of third parties and intermediaries who act on behalf of others have been recognised in the Tax Administration Act 1994 since March 2019, following amendments made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. In addition to consolidating the provisions relating to third parties and intermediaries into new Part 7B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, 2 new types of third parties and intermediaries were added. This includes “nominated persons” and “representatives”. These are explained in further detail in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 4 at pages 67 to 70. Following enactment of the changes it was identified that the statutory rules which outline the process the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must follow to remove a person’s status as a tax agent (or disallow a person’s status as a nominated person or a representative) contained ambiguities as to the timing of certain actions that the Commissioner was required to take. These rules have therefore been amended to ensure the process the Commissioner must follow in the circumstances are clear. Key features The key features of the amendments:  Provide that before the Commissioner removes a person from the list of tax agents or disallow a person’s status as a representative or a nominated person, the Commissioner must issue a notice to the person informing them of the Page 169 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Commissioner’s intent to remove them. An exception to this general requirement has been retained where the Commissioner considers it necessary in the circumstances to protect the integrity of the tax system; and  Make it clear that the Commissioner is not required to disclose information that could, under other enactments, be withheld. Application date The amendments apply from 23 March 2020, the date of enactment. Detailed analysis The process that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must generally follow when taking an action to remove a person from the list of tax agents or disallow a person’s status as a nominated person or a representative is as follows:  The Commissioner must first issue a notice to the person informing the person that the Commissioner intends to remove them from the list of tax agents or disallow the person’s status as a nominated person or a representative.  The Commissioner must then consider any arguments against the exercise of the discretion that are provided within 30 days from the date of the notice. A later period may be set by the Commissioner if appropriate in the circumstances.  After having considered the arguments, the Commissioner will either be satisfied that the person can remain on the list of tax agents or have their status as a nominated person or a representative retained; or the Commissioner will issue a subsequent notice to the person informing them that they have been removed from the list of tax agents or had their status as a nominated person or a representative disallowed. The effective date of the removal or disallowance, as applicable, will be specified within this subsequent notice. The Commissioner is not required to follow this process if the Commissioner considers it necessary in the circumstances to protect the integrity of the tax system. If this is the case, the Commissioner will issue a notice to the person informing them that they have been removed from the list of tax agents or had their status as a nominated person or Page 170 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 representative disallowed, and the effective date of the removal will be the date the Commissioner issues the notice informing the person that this action has been taken. An amendment was also made to make it clear that where the Commissioner is going to exercise the discretion to remove a person from the list of tax agents, or disallow a person’s status as a nominated person or a representative, that the Commissioner is not required to divulge information that could be withheld under other enactments, such as the Official Information Act 1982 for example. The Commissioner will, where practicable, notify the person of the reason or reasons for the exercise of the discretion (or proposed exercise of the discretion). Page 171 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Employee share schemes – definition of market value Sections CE 7CB, CW 26DB, YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 New sections CE 7CB and CW 26DB and amended section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) expand the definition of ‘market value’ for the purposes of the employee share scheme (ESS) and exempt ESS rules to include a 5-day ‘volume weighted average price’ or an equivalent, and other methods accepted by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This makes it easier for companies offering ESSs to value their shares, reducing compliance costs and improving accuracy of valuations. Background For the purposes of valuing listed shares, ‘market value’ is currently defined in section YA 1 of the ITA as the ‘middle market quotation’. This is the average of the best buying and selling prices quoted by market makers, taken at the close of the market each day. Obtaining this middle market quotation is reported to be difficult in practice, and a much more common and practical measure is a ‘volume weighted average price’. This is the total value of the shares traded divided by the number of shares traded over a particular time period. In her operational statement CS 17/01, the Commissioner accepts a 5-day volume weighted average price (amongst other methods) for valuing shares obtained under an ESS. 31 Expanding the definition of ‘market value’ for the purposes of the ESS rules to include these methods makes it easier for companies to value their shares, and reduces compliance costs. Key features New section CE 7CB provides that ‘market value’, for an employee share scheme: 31 It is intended that a refreshed Commissioner Statement will be released soon. Page 172 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  has the same meaning as in section YA 1 (Definitions), definition of market value, paragraphs (a) and (b); and  includes, for a share or option quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange, at the time, an amount equal to the five-day volume weighted average price or any other method that is accepted by the Commissioner or is comparable to the five-day volume weighted average price, for such shares or options. New section CW 26DB provides the same as above, but for the exempt ESS rules. The definition of ‘market value’ in section YA 1 is amended to link to the new sections above. Application dates Section CE 7CB applies from 29 September 2018 – the date the reforms to the general ESS rules came into effect. Section CW 26DB applies from 29 March 2018 – the date the reforms to the exempt ESS rules came into effect. The amendments to section YA 1 have the same application dates as the sections they link to – the application dates for sections CE 7CB and CW 26DB respectively. Page 173 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Exempt employee share schemes – takeovers and similar reorganisations Section CW 26C(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Amended section CW 26C(7) adds an exception to the ‘period of restriction’ in the exempt ESS rules for takeovers and similar reorganisations. Background In order for an ESS to qualify as exempt, the terms of the scheme must provide that shares are held by the employee for a period of time – generally three years – before they are disposed of. This is to ensure the scheme achieves the objective of aligning employee and employer incentives, and also to prevent employers from granting employees shares which the employee can sell immediately to realise an untaxed cash benefit (when remuneration in cash would have been taxed). Exempt ESS trust deeds and similar constituting documents often provide for the sale of scheme shares pursuant to takeovers and other corporate reorganisations. If a takeover occurs, which can include the shares of minority shareholders being compulsorily acquired, this could breach the period of restriction requirement and mean the scheme fails to meet the statutory criteria; the shares may then become taxable. This is despite these events being outside the control of the employee. Adding to section CW 26C(7) an exception for transfers of shares to or by an employee before the end of the restricted period in the case of takeovers and similar reorganisations ensures that companies and participating employees are not penalised for selling their shares before expiry of the three-year period due to such uncontrollable events. The scheme will remain exempt. Key features Sections CW 26C(7)(a) and (b), after the words ‘disposed of’, incorporate the words ‘other than as part of a takeover or similar share reorganisation’. Page 174 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date Amended section CW 26C(7) applies from 29 March 2018, the date the new exempt ESS rules came into effect. Page 175 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Employee share schemes – flexibility to allow employees to keep shares if they leave employment Section CW 26C(8) and (8B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 New section CW 26C(8) allows for alternative approaches where the period of restriction ends because the employee leaves the company voluntarily. The employee may either have the choice to keep their ESS shares, or be required to return them to the company for the lesser of cost 32 or market value. 33 This update to the legislation allows alignment of the treatment of these so-called ‘bad leavers’ under the New Zealand exempt scheme rules with their treatment under the Australian exempt scheme rules, which will make it easier for trans- Tasman companies to offer the same scheme in both countries. Background Prior to this amendment, upon expiry of the ‘period of restriction’ in section CW 26C(7), ‘good leavers’ – employees whose employment ends due to their death, accident, sickness, redundancy, or retirement at normal retiring age – or their estate, could choose whether to keep their shares in the company or have them acquired for the lesser of cost or market value (under section CW 26C(9)). But ‘bad leavers’ – employees who leave for other reasons (for example, going to work for a competitor) – had to have their shares acquired for the lesser of cost or market value. There was no flexibility for the company to allow bad leavers to keep their shares. One objective of the 2018 amendments to the ESS rules was to allow trans-Tasman companies to offer Australian exempt schemes to their New Zealand employees. However, Australian exempt schemes may require that bad leavers have the choice to keep their 32 The cost of the shares to the employee. 33 The market value of the shares on the date the period of restriction ends. Page 176 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 shares. This was in conflict with New Zealand’s rule for bad leavers, making it difficult for trans-Tasman companies to offer the same scheme in both countries. While Australian schemes could be amended for New Zealand employees, so as to comply with the New Zealand rules, this carried compliance costs and meant New Zealand employees could end up with a commercially less favourable exempt ESS than their Australian counterparts. Aligning New Zealand’s exempt scheme rules with Australia’s rules by allowing companies to choose whether bad leavers can keep their shares should make it significantly easier for trans-Tasman companies to offer their schemes in both countries. Key features New section CW 26C(8) provides two options for employers to choose from when designing the terms of an ESS arrangement with respect to the end of the ‘period of restriction’ for a bad leaver. First option (subsection CW 26C(8)) When the period of restriction ends, the shares are transferred to the employee if they have not already been transferred, or – if the employee chooses – the shares are acquired from the employee or trustee for the lesser of cost and market value. Second option (subsection CW 26C(8B)) When the period of restriction ends: If the employee is currently employed, the shares are transferred to the employee if they have not already been transferred, or – if the employee chooses – the shares are acquired from the employee or trustee for the lesser of cost and market value. If the employee is not currently employed, the shares are acquired from the employee or trustee for the lesser of cost and market value. This second option simply replicates the current law, so there is no need for schemes that are currently exempt to change. Page 177 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date New section CW 26C(8), and subsection (8B), apply from 29 March 2018, the date the current exempt ESS rules came into effect. Detailed analysis The first option is appropriate for employers that do not wish to make a distinction between the circumstances of an employee’s departure, and prefer to give all employees the choice between keeping their shares or having them acquired by the employer again. This option may make it easier for some Australian exempt schemes to be replicated in New Zealand. The second option is suitable for employers that do not want ‘bad leavers’ to have the choice to keep their shares. This arrangement replicates the law prior to this amendment. As part of the amendment, all instances of the word ‘purchased’ have been replaced with ‘acquired’. The reason for this change in terms is that the word ‘purchase’ implies an amount of consideration, whereas in some cases the employer may have granted the employee the shares for free, so ‘purchasing’ them back from the employee for the lesser of cost and market value will result in a purchase for nil consideration, which as a matter of strict interpretation might not be possible. The word ‘acquired’ is less problematic as it clearly covers both possibilities. Page 178 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Ring-fencing of residential property deductions Sections EL 3, EL 4, EL 5, EL 7, EL 8, EL 15, EL 16, and EL 18 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Some remedial amendments have been made to the residential property deduction ring- fencing rules, to ensure they operate as intended. Background The new ring-fencing rules in subpart EL, which apply from the start of the 2019–20 income year, were introduced to limit deductions for residential property to income from the property. Before the introduction of these rules, loss-making investors could use the excess deductions from their rental properties to offset their income from other sources (such as salary and wages), thus reducing their income tax liability. A number of remedial amendments have been made to ensure the rules operate as intended. Key features The key remedial amendments ensure that:  The carry forward of amounts that remain ring-fenced after a taxable property sale, because they have been transferred from another property which was not taxed on sale.  It is clear that amounts of residential income can only be counted once in applying the ring-fencing rules.  The interposed entity rules operate as intended. Application date The amendments came into force on 1 April 2019 – the date the ring-fencing rules in subpart EL came into force. Page 179 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Detailed analysis Unused excess deductions not released on taxable sale of portfolio or property Sections EL 5 and EL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to ensure the carry forward of unused deductions that are not released on a taxable sale of a residential property or portfolio. If a property-by-property basis residential property is taxed on sale, or if all of the properties in a portfolio are sold and all sales were taxed, any excess deductions remaining (after use against the rental income and net land sale income) are released from the ring-fencing rules. This means those amounts can be used against income from other sources, such as salary and wages. However, if there has been an unused excess transferred to the property or portfolio from another property or portfolio that was not taxed (or not fully-taxed) on sale, the amount transferred is not released. These amendments ensure there is a mechanism for any unfenced amount remaining after a taxable sale to be treated as relating to (and transferred to) another property, consistent with the mechanism that does this for excess amounts remaining after non-taxed disposals. In making these amendments, the opportunity was also taken to incorporate what was section EL 8 (which dealt with the treatment of previously transferred amounts on a fully- taxed disposal) into sections EL 5 and EL 7, which deal with sales of portfolios and property- by-property basis residential properties, respectively. This amendment is a rationalisation of the provisions – it does not affect the way the rules operate. Operation of the interposed entity rules Sections EL 16 and EL 18, which may apply if residential property is held in a “residential land-rich entity”, have been amended to ensure they operate as intended. Section EL 16(2) suspends excess interest deductions related to investing in a land-rich entity. These are deductions that exceed the person’s share of the entity’s residential income, taking into account the level of capital used to acquire the residential property. Under the wording of these provisions as originally introduced, the suspended deductions would have been carried forward to a later income year in which the person derives Page 180 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 residential income or a distribution from the entity (to the extent such distribution relates to residential land). But the excess deductions would then not have been used against either of those types of income, but rather added to the person’s interest expenditure and used against the person’s share (effectively) of the “entity’s net residential income”. As originally introduce, section EL 16(2)(b)(i) and (ii) therefore did not bear any relation to the income the excess deductions could be used against. Section EL 16(2)(b) has been amended so the excess deductions are carried forward to a later income year in which the entity derives residential income. Paragraph (b)(i) and (ii) do not serve any purpose and should be removed. There was a related issue in section EL 18(a) which has also been fixed up. In the wording of that provision as originally introduced, the person’s residential income for the year would have been treated as their share of “net residential income”. That is fine when the only residential property the person has is held in the entity. But the person may also hold other residential property directly. If they do, they should not be able to use excess interest deductions related to the investment in the entity against that other residential income. As such, section EL 18(a) has been amended so that the person’s residential income for the income year from the property held in the entity is what is treated as their share of net residential income. Clarifying that amounts of residential income can only be counted once An amendment has been made to clarify that amounts of residential income from residential property outside the ring-fencing rules can only be counted once for the deduction allocation rules. This clarification is required because a taxpayer may apply the ring-fencing rules on a portfolio basis for some properties and on a property-by-property basis for another property, or they may have 2 or more properties on a property-by-property basis. In these situations, the deduction allocation rule is applied to each property (or a property and the portfolio) separately. In section EL3, paragraphs (a) to (c) of “residential income” are amounts from the particular property or portfolio, so cannot be counted when looking at another property or portfolio. Page 181 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 However, paragraph (d) includes amounts of income from property outside the rules. On the face of it, there was nothing to preclude a taxpayer counting such amounts more than once – for example, once in ascertaining their “residential income” for their portfolio, and once in ascertaining their “residential income” for a property-by-property basis property. This amendment clarifies that if an amount of residential income has been counted, it cannot be counted again for allocating deductions for another property. Clarifying that current year excess deductions can be transferred within a wholly-owned group An amendment has been made to clarify that current year excess deductions can be transferred within a wholly owned group under section EL 15. As originally introduced, the terminology in section EL 15 suggested that it was only excess deductions that had been carried forward from prior years that could be transferred within a wholly owned group. That was not intended, and the amendment ensures that current year excess deductions can also be transferred. Cross referencing errors corrected An amendment has been made to section EL 3, to correct a cross-referencing error in the definition of “residential land”. As the definition was originally worded, deductions for residential property in the ring-fencing rules could be used against income from the property (or portfolio) and against net rental income and net depreciation recovery income from residential property that is outside the rules because it is held on revenue account. This amendment ensures that deductions can also be able to be used against net sale income from such revenue account property. A cross-referencing error in the definition of “land sales provisions” in section EL 3 has also been corrected, to ensure that section CB 15 is included in that definition. Page 182 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Taxation of life insurance business – transitional relief Sections EY 30 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 65 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019– 20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 Changes have been made to section EY 30 in response to submissions on the bill regarding remedial changes to the life insurance transitional rules made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. The changes:  Replace the current description of the CPI period being, “consisting of the last four quarters preceding the year”, with a reference to the CPI percentage change movement to the annual rate specified in the formula in the life policy.  Revise the application section (section 65(4) of Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019) to ensure that life insurers wanting to use the amendment can do so. The changes respond to concerns raised by submitters that the legislative changes made by the earlier bill did not reflect life insurer practices regarding the calculation of CPI benefits, and that the savings provision that accompanied the legislative change was too limited in scope. Application date The amendments apply from 1 July 2010. Page 183 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Exemption for certain Government grants provided to social housing providers Section 5(6F) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 5(6F) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended to clarify that all types of payments by the Government to social housing providers under a tailored agreement to provide social housing are exempt from GST. Background Like other residential landlords, social housing providers are exempt from GST in respect of their supplies of accommodation in dwellings provided to their tenants. In 2015, a provision was added to the GST Act to ensure that payments made by the Government to social housing providers under reimbursement agreements and tailored agreements to provide social housing are treated as consideration for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. The tailored agreements that have subsequently been agreed include several types of payment; a rent subsidy, an operating supplement, and in limited cases, a capital grant. There was uncertainty as to whether or not all of these types of payment would qualify for the GST exemption in section 5(6F). This was because section 5(6F) originally required that the payment be for “the provision of accommodation in social housing.” It was unclear if this requirement would be met for the operating supplement and capital grant payments as these payments are only indirectly used to pay for the provision of accommodation. If the GST exemption was found to not apply to some types of payment, the Government would need to gross up these payments to social housing providers in order to subsidise the same amount of tenancies in social housing accommodation. The overall purpose of a tailored agreement is to provide social housing tenancies, so the intended policy is that all types of payments made under a tailored agreement should be deemed to be consideration for an exempt supply. The remedial change provides certainty and reduces compliance costs for social housing providers and the Government. Page 184 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features Section 5(6F) has been amended to remove the requirement that the payment must be for “the provision of accommodation in social housing”. This change clarifies that section 5(6F) applies to all types of payments made under either the reimbursement agreements or tailored agreements that are enabled by the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992. Section 5(6F) deems these payments to be consideration for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. This means that the social housing providers which receive these payments will not be liable to return GST output tax on any of the relevant payments. Currently, there are 3 types of relevant payment; a rent subsidy, an operating supplement and a capital grant. However, if, in future, other types of payment are developed and paid under the relevant agreements, section 5(6F) would also apply to those new types of payment. Application date The remedial amendment applies from 28 May 2015 which is the date that section 5(6F) first took effect. Page 185 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 GST deductions for capital raising costs of participatory securities Section 20H of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 20H of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended so that the rules for allowing GST deductions for capital raising costs also apply when funding is raised using participatory securities. Background Section 20H allows GST-registered businesses to recover GST on their costs of raising capital to fund a taxable activity. This provision originally only applied to capital raised through equity or debt securities. Like equity and debt securities, participatory securities can be issued by businesses to raise capital. A remedial amendment has been made so that section 20H also applies to participatory securities. Key features Section 20H(1)(d) has been amended to add references to “participatory securities”, so these rules apply to debt securities, equity securities, and participatory securities. This remedial amendment allows GST registered persons which principally make taxable supplies to claim back the GST on the funding support services that they acquire when using participatory securities to raise capital for their taxable activity. Application date The remedial amendment applies from 1 April 2017 which is the date that section 20H first took effect. Page 186 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 GST on low-value imported goods remedials Sections 8(4B)(bb), 10B(2)(b), 10C, 12(1B), 24(4)(g), 24(5D), 24BAB(2)(e), 24BAC, 60C(1)(ab), 60D(1)(ab), 77(3)(aa) and 85C of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; and section 143A(1)(g) and (h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Amendments have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to address technical issues with the new GST on low-value imported goods legislation (referred to here as “the distantly taxable goods rules”) to ensure that these rules and similar GST rules applying to supplies of remote services work as intended. All legislative references are to the GST Act unless stated otherwise. Background From 1 December 2019 GST applies to goods valued at or below $1,000 that are imported from non-resident suppliers by consumers in New Zealand. The new rules require non- resident suppliers, as well as operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to register and return GST on these supplies of “distantly taxable” goods if they exceed, or are expected to exceed, $60,000 in total over a 12-month period. Prior to these changes, GST was only collected on imported goods at the border by the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs). However, GST was not typically collected on imported goods below the customs de minimis of $60 of duty (this equated to a parcel with a value of $400 if GST was the only applicable duty). When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased goods from offshore suppliers, and online shopping did not exist. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported goods under the de minimis outweighed the benefits of taxation. The new rules are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and level the playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of low-value goods. Page 187 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features The following amendments have been made to the new distantly taxable goods rules and the remote services rules:  The reverse charge in section 8(4B) has been amended to prevent potential double taxation from occurring when a GST-registered business imports goods for a mix of taxable and non-taxable use and pays GST to either Customs or to the supplier of the goods.  The marketplace rules have been amended to ensure they do not apply when a New Zealand-resident supplies remote services through a marketplace operated by a New Zealand resident. The amendments ensure that the marketplace rules do not override existing agency rules that apply to these types of domestic arrangements.  The Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to provide that a recipient or a non-resident underlying supplier of distantly taxable goods commits a knowledge offence if they knowingly provide false, misleading or altered information which results in GST not being charged on a supply when it should have been.  Amendments have been made so that suppliers only need to take reasonable steps to ensure their GST registration number and information about whether GST was paid at the point of sale is made available to Customs when GST has been charged at the point of sale on all or some of the goods in the consignment.  The requirement for suppliers of distantly taxable goods to include the amount of GST on receipts provided to consumers has been removed. This means that if GST has been charged on all the goods included on the receipt, the receipt requirements can be met by simply including the total GST-inclusive price on the receipt and stating that this price includes GST.  An amendment to section 10B(2)(b) clarifies the wording of the provision. Page 188 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  An amendment to section 10C clarifies that the 75 percent test for an election to treat high-value goods 34 as distantly taxable goods is a self-assessed test.  An amendment to section 77(3) clarifies that, when doing a foreign exchange calculation to determine the New Zealand dollar amount of GST required to be returned to Inland Revenue, the currency conversion can be done on the date the supply was made.  Corrections have been made to cross-references in sections 12(1B), 24(4)(g), 24(5D) and 85C. Application dates The following amendments, which are either taxpayer-friendly in nature or mere clarifications of the policy intent, apply on and after 1 December 2019, the date that the distantly taxable goods rules came into force:  amendment to the reverse charge provision (section 8(4B)(bb));  amendments to the marketplace rules (sections 60C(1)(ab) and 60D(1)(ab));  amendment to the reasonable steps requirements for reporting GST information to Customs (section 24BAC);  amendment removing the requirement to state the amount of GST on a receipt (section 24BAB(2)(e));  clarification of wording of section 10B(2)(b); and  insertion of cross-reference in section 85C. Savings provisions apply to protect tax positions taken by registered persons between 1 December 2019 and 23 March 2020 if those tax positions are consistent with either the reverse charge provision in section 8(4B) or the marketplaces rules in sections 60C and 60D, as the law originally stood on 1 December 2019. However, it should be noted that the 34 Items valued above $1,000. Page 189 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 savings provision relating to the reverse charge amendment is optional for taxpayers to apply. This means that if a taxpayer returned GST in accordance with the previous version of section 8(4B) and wishes to claim a refund of this GST based on the amendment, they can do so. The following amendments apply on and after 23 March 2020, being the date the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 was enacted:  amendments to the knowledge offences in section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994;  amendment clarifying that the 75 percent test for an election to treat high-value items as distantly taxable goods is a self-assessed test (section 10C); and  amendments to cross-references in sections 12(1B), 24(4)(g), and 24(5D). The amendment to the currency conversion rules (new section 77(3)(aa)) applies on and after 1 October 2016, the date that the remote services rules came into force. Detailed analysis Amendment to reverse charge Except when a non-resident supplier has made a valid election to charge GST on business- to-business supplies below $1,000, GST does apply to distantly taxable goods supplied by non-residents to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. The rationale for this is that applying GST to business-to-business supplies is broadly revenue neutral, as GST-registered businesses purchasing goods and services will generally claim back any GST charged by the supplier as an input tax deduction. However, in some cases, a GST-registered person may purchase goods from a non-resident supplier for non-taxable use (for example, private use). Section 8(4B) was amended in 2019 to require a GST-registered New Zealand business to return GST under the reverse charge when they purchase distantly taxable goods from a non-resident supplier for partial private or exempt use. However, the scope of the reverse charge ended up being wider than was intended, creating the potential for double taxation to occur in the type of situation described in the example below. Page 190 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 36: Inappropriate application of reverse charge when goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply A Co, a GST-registered landscaping business, purchases landscaping and gardening equipment from B Co, a non-resident who is not registered for GST. The goods are already in New Zealand at the time of supply. A Co intends to use the goods for 20 percent private use and 80 percent taxable use. Under the previous version of section 8(4B) of the GST Act, A Co would be treated as making a supply to itself at the standard rate of 15 percent and would be entitled to an input tax deduction based on 80 percent of the purchase price. The issue is that B Co already paid GST to Customs on the importation of the goods into New Zealand and the price paid by A Co for the supply was marked up on account of this. This means that the private use of the goods by A Co has effectively been taxed twice. To rectify this, section 8(4B)(bb) has been inserted so that the reverse charge only applies to a supply of goods when:  the goods are imported by the recipient of the supply in a consignment with a total value of $1,000 or less; and  the recipient does not pay GST to Customs, or to the supplier of the goods. Example 37 : Remedial amendment to reverse charge rule Consider A Co and B Co in the example above and assume the same set of facts applies as before. As a consequence of the remedial amendment, A Co is not treated as making a supply to itself (because A Co did not import the goods into New Zealand as required by new paragraph (bb)). This means that A Co is not required to account for output tax under the reverse charge. Marketplace rules – interaction with existing agency rules Prior to the distantly taxable goods rules, the marketplace rules in sections 60C and 60D only applied to marketplaces for remotely-supplied services and digital products (remote services) operated by non-residents. As part of extending the marketplace rules to supplies of distantly taxable goods, the requirement that the operator of the marketplace is a non- resident was removed. This means that, since 1 December 2019, New Zealand-resident marketplace operators are liable to return GST on supplies of remote services and distantly taxable goods made through their platforms by non-residents to consumers in New Zealand. Page 191 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 An unintended consequence of this change was that the electronic marketplace rules also applied to arrangements that were purely domestic in nature and which were already covered by existing agency rules in the GST Act. Because there is only a very limited ability to opt out of the electronic marketplace rules, the effect was that the electronic marketplace rules trumped the existing agency rules as they applied to these domestic arrangements, which was not intended. To address this issue, new sections 60C(1)(ab) and 60D(1)(ab) require that if the marketplace is operated by a New Zealand resident, the underlying supplier must be a non-resident – otherwise the marketplace rules do not apply to a supply of goods or remote services. This means that if an underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident, they are liable to register and return GST – unless the underlying supplier and the New Zealand-resident marketplace operator have an arrangement whereby the marketplace operator makes the supply as an agent of the underlying supplier. Knowledge offence – providing incorrect or misleading information Section 143A(1)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended so a recipient of a supply of distantly taxable goods commits a knowledge offence if they deliberately provide altered, false or misleading information to avoid being charged GST. This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to $25,000 for a first-time offence or $50,000 for repeated offences. Example 38 : Consumer makes misrepresentations about GST registration status Luke purchases a number of distantly taxable goods online, including clothing, footwear, and nutritional supplements. Luke is not registered for GST. To avoid paying GST, Luke continually informs offshore suppliers he is GST registered and provides a false GST registration number. Luke has repeatedly committed a knowledge offence under section 143A(1)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and, if convicted more than once, could be liable for a fine of up to $50,000 on the second conviction and any subsequent convictions. If convicted just once, Luke could be liable for a fine of up to $25,000. New section 143A(1)(h) provides that an underlying supplier of distantly taxable goods or remote services through a marketplace commits a knowledge offence if it knowingly provides altered, false, or misleading information relating to the country or territory in which it is resident, resulting in GST not being returned on the supply by the marketplace operator when it should have been. Unlike paragraph (g), paragraph (h) does not require the incorrect Page 192 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 information to have been provided for the purpose of avoiding GST. This is because the underlying supplier’s intention may be difficult to establish in practice. Example 39 : Underlying supplier makes misrepresentations about residency Jave Dordan, a non-resident underlying supplier on the NZ Marketplace website, deliberately provides false information about himself (including using a VPN to fake a New Zealand IP address, providing a false mailing address in New Zealand and falsely stating that the goods are shipped from New Zealand) with the intention of misleading potential customers in New Zealand. The fact that NZ Marketplace will not charge GST on the supply as a result of Jave’s deception is not Jave’s primary objective in making the misrepresentations, but is merely a secondary benefit from Jave’s perspective. Section 143A(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not require that Jave’s purpose in providing the false information was to avoid GST. Therefore, it does not matter whether Jave had a purpose of avoiding GST—it only matters that he knowingly provided the incorrect information. Jave has committed a knowledge offence under section 143A(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Reasonable steps requirement – providing GST information to Customs An amendment to section 24BAC provides that a supplier of distantly taxable goods is required to take reasonable steps to ensure that certain GST information is provided to Customs if GST is charged on the supply under section 8(1) at a rate greater than zero percent. For the purpose of preventing double taxation, section 24BAC requires a supplier of distantly taxable goods to take reasonable steps to ensure that its GST registration number is included in the import documentation, along with an indication of whether GST was paid at the point of sale for each item being shipped. This requirement previously applied to all supplies of distantly taxable goods – including supplies that are generally excluded from the requirement to charge GST at the point of sale, such as supplies to GST-registered businesses. The amendment ensures that suppliers of distantly taxable goods are not required to report GST information to Customs in relation to consignments of goods that have not had GST charged at the point of sale at the standard rate of 15 percent. Given that GST will be Page 193 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 collected on these goods by Customs anyway, it is not necessary for the supplier to report its GST registration number to Customs in these cases. Removal of requirement to include amount of GST charged on receipt An amendment to section 24BAB(2)(e) has removed the requirement for suppliers of distantly taxable goods to include the amount of GST charged on receipts issued to consumers. For the purpose of preventing double taxation, section 24BAB requires a supplier of distantly taxable goods to issue a receipt if GST has been charged on a supply. This provides the consumer purchasing the goods with documentation that they can provide to Customs as evidence that GST was charged at the point of sale, so that Customs does not collect GST again when the goods are imported into New Zealand. This means that if GST has been charged on all the goods included on the receipt, the requirement in section 24BAB(2)(f) and (g) to indicate those items that had GST charged at the point of sale and those that did not can be met by simply including the total GST- inclusive price on the receipt and stating that this price includes GST. However, if GST was charged on only some of the goods supplied, this requirement is met by including the amount of GST for each of the goods. Clarification of wording – section 10B(2)(b) Section 10B(2) deals with the valuation of goods for the purposes of determining whether the goods are distantly taxable goods. The section sets out that the value of an item for these purposes will be the amount of consideration for the supply of the item, less the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c). Paragraph (b) as it was first enacted referred to “tax charged on the item under section 8”. Two separate technical issues with this wording were identified, as detailed below:  The wording of the paragraph presumed that the supplier knew whether tax was charged on the item under section 8. However, at the time of doing the calculation, the supplier probably would not know whether tax was charged on the item under section 8, as the sole purpose of performing the calculation was to work out whether GST applied. Page 194 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  The wording of paragraph (b) also did not work when a non-resident supplier (who had not made an election to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable goods) supplied goods to New Zealand consumers on delivered-duty-paid terms – meaning that the supplier charged the recipient an estimate of the customs charges (including any GST charged under section 12(1)) and paid these charges to Customs on the recipient’s behalf. In the second scenario described above, GST is charged under section 8(1) on items individually valued at $1,000 or less, but not on items valued above $1,000 unless the supplier has elected to treat high-value items as distantly taxable goods. Because the goods are supplied on delivered-duty-paid terms, the supplier will in all cases include an amount in the price to cover the amount of GST. However, when an item is valued over $1,000, the GST is not “tax charged on the item under section 8”, as it is tax charged under section 12(1). To address these technical issues, paragraph (b) has been amended so that it now refers to the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the supply of the item under section 8(1) if the supply was made by a resident and for the same consideration. Meaning of “tax chargeable on the supply of the item if the supply was made by a resident” Section 8(1) applies GST at the rate of 15% to supplies made in New Zealand by registered persons in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Section 8(2) treats all supplies by New Zealand residents as being made in New Zealand. The reference to “the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the supply of the item under section 8(1) if the supply was made by a resident” in section 10B(2)(b) therefore requires the supplier to do the following:  First, assume for the purpose of the calculation that GST is charged on the supply under section 8(1) (so the consideration for the supply includes a nominal amount of GST), regardless of whether GST is in fact charged on the supply.  Second, subtract from the consideration, the nominal amount of GST (calculated by multiplying the amount of consideration by 3/23). This gives the value of the item for the purpose of determining whether it is a distantly taxable good (and therefore whether GST is required to be charged on the supply of the item under section 8(1)). Page 195 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 75 percent test for election to charge GST on high-value goods Amendments have been made to section 10C to clarify that the 75 percent test that applies for determining a supplier’s eligibility to elect to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable goods is a self-assessed test. Under the test, a supplier may make the election if it considers that 75 percent or more of the total value of goods 35 it will supply in the 12-month period starting on the first day the election is intended to be effective for, will consist of items each having a value 36 of $1,000 or less. Suppliers making an election under this test are only required to notify the Commissioner of the election. The introductory words of section 10C(2) previously stated that the Commissioner may agree with an election made under subsection (1). However, as mentioned above, the 75 percent test is a self-assessment test and was never intended to require the Commissioner’s agreement or consent. Suppliers making an election under this test are only required to notify the Commissioner of the election. To clarify that the 75 percent test is a self-assessment test, the introductory words of section 10C(2) now provide that an electing supplier may make the election if the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) are met. Other minor wording amendments to subsections (1), (2) and (3) have been made in support of this change. Currency conversion on date of supply When remote services or distantly taxable goods supplied to New Zealand consumers are priced in a foreign currency, the supplier of those goods or services will need to convert the foreign currency price to New Zealand dollars to determine the amount of GST required to be returned to Inland Revenue. Section 77(3) provides non-resident suppliers with a range of currency conversion options for these purposes, including allowing the supplier to do the currency conversion on the last day of its taxable period or on the date the return was filed. 35 Excluding any alcohol or tobacco products. 36 Determined under section 10B(2). Page 196 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 New section 77(3)(aa) has been inserted to clarify that the currency conversion can be done on the date the supply was made. Corrections of cross-references The following amendments to cross-references have been made:  In section 12(1B), an incorrect cross-reference to paragraph (d) has been removed.  Previously omitted cross-references to section 9(3)(aa) have been inserted into section 85C.  In section 24(4)(g), a cross-reference to subsection (5BB) has been inserted.  In section 24(5D), an incorrect cross-reference to section 8(4) has been removed. The provision now explicitly provides that the supply is treated as being made in New Zealand when the supplier has incorrectly treated the supply as made in New Zealand and opted to provide a tax invoice to the GST-registered recipient (so that the recipient can make an input tax deduction for the incorrectly charged GST). Page 197 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Bright-line main home exclusion Sections CB 16A and FB 3A of the Income Tax Act 2007 The main home exclusion for the bright-line test requires that a person use the land as their main home for most of the time they own the land. The amendment aligns the period of ownership for the main home exclusion for the bright-line test with the period in the bright- line test itself. A further amendment clarifies when this period of ownership starts for land transferred on a settlement of relationship property as define in section FB 1B. Background The main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where land has been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the main home for the period. “Own” is defined in section YA 1 for land as having an estate or interest land. “Estate or interest” is defined as including all estates and interests in land whether legal or equitable. Under these definitions, a person will typically own land from the date a binding contract to purchase the land is formed until the date of registration of the transfer on sale. However, this period can be different from the period that is counted for the purpose of the bright-line test. Under section CB 6A(1), a person generally acquires land for the purposes of the bright-line test on the date the instrument to transfer the land to the person is registered. Th bright-line test period ends on the “bright-line date”, which is defined in section CB 6A (7) as the earliest of the date the person enters into an agreement for the disposal of the land, or the date on which the land is disposed of (including by way of gift, compulsory acquisition or mortgagee sale). Because the period that a person “owns” land for the purposes of the main home exclusion can be different from the period that the bright-line test applies for, it is possible that taxpayers may not be eligible for the main home exclusion because, although they have used land as their main home for most of the period the bright-line test applies to, they have not used it a their main home for most of the time they owned the land. The opposite could also occur. Page 198 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Section FB 3A applies where residential land that may be subject to the bright-line test is transferred on a settlement of relationship property. It clarifies that the transfer will be treated as occurring for an amount equal to the cost of the land to the transferor, and at the date the transferor acquired the land. Section FB 3A currently applies for the purposes of section CB 6A (the bright-line test) but not for the purposes of section CB 16A (the main home exclusion for the bright-line test). Key features The amendment clarifies that, for the purpose of the main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A, the period a person owns the land is the same as the period that the bright-line test applies for. It is consistent with the policy intent for the periods to be aligned. A further amendment clarifies that rules for residential land transferred on a settlement of relationship property in section FB 3A also apply for the purpose of the main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment. Page 199 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Consideration for grant of easement and other land rights Sections CC 1 and CC 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to sections CC 1 and CC 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) make two clarifications regarding the tax treatment of certain land use related payments. The first clarification is that a payment directly for the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right (defined as a leasehold estate or a licence to use land) is taxable. The second clarification ensures that a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement is not taxable, as has always been intended. Background Grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right Before this amendment, section CC 1B was drafted in such a way that it only taxed consideration for the “agreement” by a payee to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right (that is, an inducement type payment). Section CC 1B did not tax consideration that was directly for the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of the land right. From a policy perspective it was intended that such payments were taxed under section CC 1. However, the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Vector Limited \[2016\] NZCA 396 concluded that was not the case. These payments should be taxable, because they can be a substitute for what would otherwise be an ongoing series of rental payments, which would be taxable. The amendment clarifies that these payments are income for the recipient. One-off payment for grant of a permanent easement A leasehold estate is defined in section YA 1 of the Act as any estate or interest in land other than a freehold estate. An easement is an interest in land and, therefore, a leasehold estate as defined in the Act. Easements can be permanent or non-permanent. A permanent easement is substantively equivalent to a freehold estate because it lasts indefinitely. Consideration for the sale of freehold land is in most cases not taxable under New Zealand Page 200 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 income tax law. Therefore, it is appropriate that a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement is also not taxable. The Act contained an exception for such a payment in section CC 1(2C). However, the court in Vector found that a lump sum payment for the grant of an easement could not be taxable under section CC 1. This was because a one-off payment is a capital receipt and could not fall under ‘other revenues’ in section CC 1(2)(g), and none of the other amounts listed in section CC 1(2) was applicable. Therefore, a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement was not captured by section CC 1, and consequently section CC 1(2C), the specific exception for that type of amount, was redundant and could be repealed. The amendment to section CC 1B discussed in the previous section, if made by itself, would make consideration for the grant of all easements taxable. Therefore, section CC 1B is also amended to carve out one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement, consistent with the policy intent. Key features Section CC 1B has been amended to:  clarify that it includes as income consideration for ‘the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right’  clarify that a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement is not taxable. A land right is a leasehold estate or licence to use land. Section CC 1 has been amended to remove subsection (2C), which provided the exception for a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement, as the decision in Vector made it clear that such a payment was never taxable under section CC 1. Application date The repeal of section CC 1(2C) applies from 1 April 2015, the date section CC 1(2C) was introduced. The new subsection CC 1B(6), which replicates the wording of the repealed section CC 1(2C), also applies from 1 April 2015. The substantive clarification of section CC 1B is achieved through two amendments: Page 201 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  an amendment to the section as it existed from its introduction in 1 April 2013 up to 1 April 2015, when it was replaced (for reasons unrelated to the current amendment); and  an amendment to the section as it has existed from 1 April 2015. Both amendments are subject to a savings provision which means they do not apply to an amount for which the person relies on a tax position taken by the person in a return of income filed with the Commissioner, or on a binding ruling issued by the Commissioner:  in the period beginning with 1 April 2013 and ending before 23 August 2019; and  that is inconsistent with the amendment. The savings provisions in the amendments to section CC 1B protect tax positions taken before the Minister of Revenue made a public announcement of the amendments on 23 August 2019. Page 202 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Interest limitation remedials Sections FE 6, FE 16B, and GC 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Three changes have been made to the interest limitation rules which apply to cross-border related debt. These changes:  remove the inbound thin capitalisation de minimis when the group has related party debt from a non-resident;  exclude certain financial arrangements from being a non-debt liability in the thin capitalisation calculations where the funding is pro rata with a group member’s shareholding or by a group member with a substantial shareholding; and  ensure the optional credit rating method can be calculated based on secured debt. Key features Inbound thin capitalisation de minimis The term “adjust” in section FE 6(3)(ac) is zero when the de minimis does not apply. Section FE 6(3)(ac)(i) has been extended to cover entities that have related party debt from a non- resident so that the de minimis is not available in this situation. Non-debt liabilities – shareholder loans Section FE 16B calculates non-debt liabilities by prescribing which amounts can be subtracted from the group’s liabilities. This section has been extended to ensure financial arrangements provided by a member of the worldwide group are excluded from non-debt liabilities when the funds are pro-rata with a shareholding. Restricted transfer pricing – optional credit rating method The word “unsecured” has been removed from section GC 16(5) which will allow a taxpayer to calculate the optional credit rating method based on long-term senior debt that is not related party debt whether it is secured or unsecured. Page 203 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date These amendments apply from 1 July 2018 to align with the original changes introduced in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. Detailed analysis Inbound thin capitalisation de minimis The thin capitalisation rules contain a de minimis in section FE 6(3)(ac) of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that certain excess debt entities do not need to make adjustments upon breaching the thin capitalisation threshold. This applies when these entities have a group finance cost of up to $1 million and abates up to a group finance cost of $2 million. Changes in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 extended this de minimis from the outbound thin capitalisation rules to also apply to the inbound thin capitalisation rules provided the borrower does not have any owner-linked debt. However, owner-linked debt, which is described in section FE 18(3B) of the Income Tax Act 2007, exists only where the borrowing is, directly or indirectly, from an owner who is not a member of the group. It was always intended that the de minimis should not be available where there was borrowing from a non-resident member of the same group. This is because a group with related party lending that does not have to apply thin capitalisation could have very high levels of debt in New Zealand and derive a return on their total investment without making any taxable profits due to high interest deductions. This is not appropriate, even where the interest expense is less than $1 million or $2 million. Therefore, access to the de minimis has been restricted to also not be available when the borrower has related party debt from a non-resident that does not have a New Zealand branch. Non-debt liabilities – shareholder loans Section FE 16B(1)(b) and (c) exclude certain shares and shareholder loans from being non- debt liabilities for thin capitalisation purposes. The intention of these sections is to exclude shareholder funding that is not within the definition of total group debt in section FE 15 (and Page 204 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 is therefore not excluded from non-debt liabilities by section FE 16B(1)(a)) and is akin to group equity. The previous wording of section FE 16B(1)(b) applied only to certain financial arrangements entered into by a member of the group with a shareholder that was also a member of the group. This was narrower than the intended scope which was for certain financial arrangements entered into by a member of the group with a shareholder of the group.

This exception ensures the New Zealand branch of a non-resident company or New Zealand hybrid entity is allowed a deduction for a payment to the extent that:  the payment reimburses a control group member for third-party expenditure; and  the third-party expenditure is non-deductible (in New Zealand or in the foreign jurisdiction) because income of the branch or hybrid entity is not taxable in the foreign jurisdiction. All section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. Background The disregarded hybrid payment rule in section FH 5 seeks to deny a deduction in New Zealand for a payment by a New Zealand resident or New Zealand branch, or charged by a New Zealand branch, if the payment is disregarded by the payee jurisdiction due to the status of the payer. The rule, therefore, addresses a situation where a deduction-no inclusion outcome would otherwise arise. However, the original design of section FH 5(2) meant a New Zealand branch of a non- resident company or a New Zealand hybrid entity would be denied a deduction for a payment that reimbursed a member of the non-resident's control group for third-party expenditure, where the member of the non-resident's control group was not allowed a deduction in the relevant foreign jurisdiction for the third-party expenditure. A foreign jurisdiction, such as Australia, might deny a deduction for third-party expenditure in such a situation if the expenditure relates to the exempt income of a New Zealand branch (i.e. the activities of the payer). This would mean a deduction would be denied in respect of a payment that does not produce the net deduction-no inclusion hybrid outcome section FH 5 is targeted at; the group would not be allowed a deduction in either jurisdiction for legitimate third-party expenditure. The exception introduced in this amendment addresses this situation. Page 206 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 This outcome was also inconsistent with the treatment of third-party costs imposed on a New Zealand branch by way of a charge from the branch’s non-resident head office (rather than by a reimbursement payment to another member of the non-resident's control group). In this situation section FH 5(3) would apply and the New Zealand branch would be allowed a deduction for the third-party expenditure charge. Application date The amendments apply with retrospective effect for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, to align with the general application date of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Detailed analysis To address the issue, section FH 5(2)(c) and section FH 5B establish a new exception to the disregarded hybrid payment rule in section FH 5. An exception to section FH 5 has been introduced for situations where a payment from a New Zealand branch or hybrid entity to a non-resident group member reimburses the payee for third-party expenditure. A key element of the new exception to FH 5 is that no deduction for the third-party expenditure is allowed in the payee jurisdiction because some part of the payer’s income (the income earned through a New Zealand branch or hybrid entity) is not taxable in the payee jurisdiction. The exception is drafted with a focus on the supply of goods and services that match the payments producing the tax outcomes. Section FH 5B(2) sets out the requirements a supply of goods or services from the payee to the payer must meet for the exception to apply. These requirements are:  a supply of goods or services (referred to as the “prerequisite group supply”) is received and paid for by the payee, or a member of the payee’s control group who is also resident in the payee’s jurisdiction;  the prerequisite group supply is made by a third-party (i.e. a person who is not a member of a control group including the payee or payer);  the payment for the prerequisite group supply is non-deductible (nor is any equivalent tax relief available) in the payee jurisdiction on the basis that income of the payer is not taxable in the payee jurisdiction; and Page 207 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  the payment is not deductible (nor is any equivalent tax relief available) in any other country or territory. If a supply of goods or services meets these requirements it will be deemed to be a “payer supply” for the purpose of section FH 5B. Expenditure excluded – one payer supply and one prerequisite group supply Section FH 5B(3) sets out the amount of expenditure that is excluded from the scope of section FH 5 where the payee, or a member of the payee’s control group, has made a single payer supply to the payer (i.e. there are not multiple supplies made in or before that income year meeting the requirements of sub-section (2)), and this relates to a single prerequisite group supply. In this situation the amount of excluded expenditure will equate to the lessor of the consideration for the payer supply or the amount that is non-deductible to the payee for the prerequisite group supply. Expenditure excluded – multiple payer supplies and/or prerequisite group supplies Section FH 5B(4) allows for expenditure to be excluded from section FH 5 where there are multiple payer supplies and/or prerequisite group supplies (i.e. where consideration for a payer supply reimburses for multiple prerequisite group supplies or where consideration for multiple payer supplies reimburses for a single prerequisite group supply). To satisfy this sub-section, the excluded amount for a payer supply, when taken in conjunction with any excluded expenditure relating to other payer supplies, must meet the following requirements:  where a payer supply is linked to multiple prerequisite group supplies, the excluded amount must not exceed the consideration for the payer supply; and  the total excluded amount must not exceed the amount for the prerequisite group supply that is non-deductible to the payee. Sub-section (4) also contains an ordering rule, which sets out how payer supplies and prerequisite group supplies should be prioritised for the purpose of determining which amounts of expenditure can be excluded from section FH 5. Payer supplies and prerequisite group supplies will be prioritised based on the order which they are made, or for payer Page 208 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 supplies or prerequisite group supplies made at the same time, the order chosen by the payer. Design of the exception This amendment is intended to cover a broad range of intra-group payments for goods and services provided they have a connection to legitimate third-party expenditure. For instance, financing sourced from an external lender could count as a “prerequisite group supply” of services if that financing is advanced to the New Zealand branch of a non-resident company (that is, that it is a “prerequisite”) and the other conditions of this exception rule are met. Another example could be payments relating to goods sourced from an external supplier and sold in the New Zealand market. However, as outlined in the example below, a payment can only meet this exception to section FH 5 to the extent of the foreign non-deductibility. In a “mark-up” arrangement where the amount of the New Zealand branch intra-group payment exceeds the amount of external costs of the group which are being reimbursed, the “mark-up” component of the payment will be outside the scope of section FH 5B and will likely be a mismatch amount for which a deduction is denied under section FH 5. This aligns with the rule for branch charges in section FH 5(3). Where there are multiple payments and/or amounts of third-party expenditure, the amendment provides that an amount of non-deductible third-party expenditure can only be matched up to a payment it relates to once for the exception to apply. Page 209 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 40 Figure 1 XYZ Co, a resident of foreign jurisdiction A, operates a branch in New Zealand. XYZ Co is part of the same consolidated group as another company in jurisdiction A, ABC Co. ABC Co provides legal advice to XYZ Co. In the provision of this service ABC Co has to obtain specialist advice from a third-party law firm, which costs $2,000. XYZ Co is required to pay ABC Co $5,000 for this service. This represents the $2,000 worth of costs ABC Co incurred, plus an additional $3,000 arm’s length mark-up. XYZ Co on-charges the $5,000 to its New Zealand branch to pay. In jurisdiction A, transactions within a consolidated group are disregarded, meaning the amount paid by the New Zealand branch of XYZ Co to ABC Co will not be treated as income of ABC Co. ABC Co is not permitted a deduction for the third-party costs it incurred in the provision of the service to XYZ Co on the basis costs have been allocated to the New Zealand branch. (Income of XYZ Co earned through its New Zealand branch is not taxable in jurisdiction A because that jurisdiction’s tax law exempts income and expenditure of a resident company to the extent it is attributed to a foreign branch). The $2,000 cost component of the payment will satisfy the requirements of section FH 5B(2) and as it involves only one payer supply and one prerequisite group supply section FH 5B(3) would exclude it from the scope of section FH 5. However, the $3,000 profit component of the payment would not satisfy the requirements of section FH 5B and as such a deduction may be denied for this part of the payment under section FH 5.

Denying a deduction in this situation is not consistent with the policy intent of the rule which is to address deduction-no inclusion hybrid outcomes. The rule has now been amended for this situation. Payments subject to taxation in New Zealand are now removed from the scope of the rule under section FH 7(1)(d). Application date This amendment applies with retrospective effect for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, to align with the general application date of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Page 211 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Adjusting payment due dates for some tax credit recipients Section 142AC of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment allows Inland Revenue to adjust the terminal tax due dates for some tax credit recipients, if their assessment cannot be finalised within 30 days of their payment due date because Inland Revenue needs to finalise their partner’s or ex-partner’s assessment first, to determine entitlement to tax credits. Background Eligibility for Working for Families (WFF) requires an assessment of family income. This requires both partners to be assessed for income tax. This can result in a timing issue when one partner has an extension of time for their tax obligations. This means that some peoples’ income tax assessments are unable to be finalised by their tax due date, because they are dependent on another person’s income tax assessment being completed first. Those people affected are:  WFF recipients who had a partner at any time during the year; and  Those with potential entitlement to the independent earner tax credit (IETC) who were a partner of a WFF recipient at any time during the tax year. Under current rules, any tax payable of $100 or more is subject to penalties and interest from the original payment due date. Some recipients were therefore subject to penalties and interest from a date that is earlier than when the result of the assessment was known. Key features The amendment allows Inland Revenue to adjust the payment due date for tax credit recipients who meet the following criteria:  The person has an entitlement (or potential entitlement) to WFF or IETC;  The person has met their own filing obligation (if any); Page 212 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020  Their assessment could not be finalised because Inland Revenue needs to complete another person’s assessment first to determine their entitlement to tax credits;  The person’s assessment was finalised within 30 days of their terminal tax date, or after their terminal tax date; and  The person’s assessment is a debit. The adjustment to the terminal tax date for those who meet the criteria above provides a further 30 days to pay a debit amount from the date the assessment was completed before it will be subject to interest and penalties. Credit assessments retain the current due date. This means that any credit interest payable will continue to be calculated from the original date and ensures that no person will be worse off because of this change. The change in due date impacts any payment due for that person on the terminal tax date, that is WFF, income tax, and student loan. Application date The amendment applies to assessments for the 2019–20 tax year onward. Page 213 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Reinstatement of ability to reconcile Working for Families for MSD recipients Section MF 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment reinstates the ability for Inland Revenue to choose to complete an end-of year Working for Families (WFF) tax credits reconciliation for recipients who received all their payments from MSD. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 made significant changes to individual income tax provisions for the 2019 year onwards. As part of these changes the provision that allowed Inland Revenue to choose whether to not to complete a WFF reconciliation for a person who received all of their WFF payments from MSD was inadvertently not carried forward into the new provisions. Key features The amendment reinstates the ability for Inland Revenue to choose to complete an end-of- year WFF for recipients who received all their payments from MSD. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2019. Page 214 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Reciprocal exemption for income from inbound international air transportation Sections CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007, CW 45 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, CB 14 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976 As a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), New Zealand is obligated to reciprocally grant a full income tax exemption to non-resident aircraft operators. New Zealand gives effect to this obligation in section CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007, first introduced in 1985 as section 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976. Previously CW 56 only permitted an exemption to be granted for income from outbound air transport. The amendment ensures an exemption can also apply to inbound air transport. Background ICAO member jurisdictions are obligated to reciprocally grant an exemption from income tax to international aircraft operators “to the fullest possible extent”. Members are primarily required to give effect to this obligation by including a reciprocal exemption mechanism in their double tax agreements (DTAs). As a backup, members are also required to include a domestic legislation provision that enables reciprocal exemptions to be granted in the absence of a DTA. As an ICAO member, New Zealand introduced a domestic legislative provision to give effect to the backup exemption mechanism in 1985. The provision is currently located at section CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CW 56 is not an automatic exemption. Rather, to ensure reciprocity, the provision authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt income of a non-resident aircraft operator from New Zealand tax if the Commissioner is satisfied that in reciprocal circumstances the other jurisdiction will exempt the income of a New Zealand aircraft operator. The exemption is typically exercised by means of an exchange of letters, in which each side’s tax administration confirms that it will exempt the other side’s international airlines. The exemption mechanism only needs to be exercised on rare occasions, as most international air services to and from New Zealand are with jurisdictions with which New Zealand has a DTA. On the few occasions that it has been exercised, the Commissioner has granted full exemption (that is, for both inbound and outbound transportation). Page 215 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 However, section CW 56 only expressly referred to income that is attributable to “carriage outside New Zealand by an aircraft of cargo, mail or passengers emplaned or embarked on the aircraft at an airport in New Zealand” (outbound transportation). The provision was silent about income from the carriage of cargo, mail or passengers into New Zealand (inbound air transportation). Income derived by an international airline from inbound transportation has a New Zealand source under section YD 4(2) or (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the extent that it is attributable to business carried out in New Zealand or a contract made or performed in New Zealand. This means that at least some inbound air transportation is potentially taxable in New Zealand. Key features The amendment corrects a deficiency in section CW 56. As previously worded, the provision only permitted an exemption to be granted for income from outbound air transport when it should also apply to inbound air transport. To meet the ICAO obligation to grant an income tax exemption to the fullest possible extent, section CW 56 now expressly applies to inbound air transportation, to the extent there is reciprocity. Application dates The amendment applies retrospectively from 1 April 1984 for section 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the application date of the original legislation). The application date of the amendments to equivalent provisions in subsequent Acts (the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007) are the original date of enactment of each of those Acts. Retrospective application ensures that any full exemption previously granted by the Commissioner under any Act has been granted correctly. Page 216 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Individuals’ income tax remedials Sections 22H, 89C, 106, 120C, 141JA, and Schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that the individuals’ income tax changes that were made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 are aligned with the policy intent. The measures contained in that Act simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations and help them to use more appropriate rates of withholding during the year. All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Application date The amendments to sections 22H, 89C, 106, 120C, 141JA, and Schedule 8 apply retrospectively from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Finalising accounts (section 22H) Section 22H(2) has been amended to clarify that an individual can finalise their pre- populated account up to and including 7 July. A further clarification has been made in section 22H(4) to ensure that a taxpayer is allowed to finalise their account outside the due date, as this ability to late file had inadvertently been removed. Date interest starts (section 120C) The definition of “date interest starts” has been amended to ensure that an individual who is treated as a “qualifying individual” 37 for the purposes of the individuals’ income tax rules 37 Under the individuals’ income tax changes, a “qualifying individual” is an individual who only earns reportable income for an income year and has no other income information that must be provided to Page 217 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 receives the same treatment as an individual that meets the definition of “qualifying individual”. Notices of proposed adjustment required to be issued by Commissioner (section 89C) This amendment clarifies that the Commissioner is not required to issue a notice of proposed adjustment before finalising the account of a qualifying individual under section 22H. Appealing redundant provisions (sections 106(1C) and 141JA) Sections 106(1C) and 141JA have been repealed. Section 106(1C) is an unnecessary hangover from the previous regime of personal tax summaries. Existing provision 106(1A) is sufficient to give rise to a default assessment as intended, and therefore 106(1C) is unnecessary. Section 141JA deals with the application of penalties to non-filing taxpayers. This is redundant under the new individuals’ income tax regime as all taxpayers now have a square up at year end. Schedule 8 Schedule 8 now includes a rule, which applies retrospectively from 1 April 2019, to allow the Commissioner to write off small amounts of tax payable in certain circumstances. This change is necessary to support the operation of some of the other write off rules that were enacted as part of the individuals’ income tax changes. For example, one of the write off rules enacted as part of the individuals’ income tax changes ensures that an individual who derives income solely from an income tested benefit and has additional tax payable will have that tax payable written off (see schedule 8, part B clause 1). Inland Revenue (see section 22D(2)). If the Commissioner treats an individual as a “qualifying individual” and that individual then turns out to have other sources of income, that individual should be afforded the same benefits as a “qualifying individual”. Page 218 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The amendment made in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 prevents the individual from being excluded from the income-tested benefit write off by virtue of deriving a small amount of interest income from a bank account. Page 219 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Amendments to investment income withholding and reporting rules Sections RE 4, RE 10C, RF 2, RF 4, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 25B, 25E and 25MB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 These amendments clarify the application of the investment income withholding and reporting rules to custodial institutions. The amendments enable custodial institutions to access limited relaxations to the normal rules. Two remedial matters have also been addressed:Amenda clarification of the error correction rules; and  the inclusion of an additional foreign exchange rate for the calculation of resident withholding tax (RWT).  These amendments are available to all payers of investment income, including custodial institutions. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 made changes to improve the administration of investment income information. The changes aimed to enable the pre-population of tax returns and to ensure that taxpayers’ tax obligations and social policy entitlements are calculated more accurately during the year. Monthly reporting of investment income is compulsory from 1 April 2020. Custodial institutions hold investment assets and undertake various functions including settlement services and asset management. As an intermediary entity, the custodial institution is a conduit between an investment income payer (for example, a company paying a dividend) and the final or “end” investor. As a result of its intermediary function, there are circumstances in which a custodial institution may be best placed to undertake withholding and reporting. Clear rules are necessary to reduce compliance costs and provide for simpler administration of investment income for tax purposes. Page 220 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features  A definition of a “custodial institution” has been introduced for the purposes of the investment income withholding and reporting rules.  The obligation to withhold and report investment income will pass from the investment income payer to a custodial institution that pays to an “end investor”.  The investment income rules have been relaxed to allow a custodian who pays investment income to a non-resident custodial institution to: o withhold and report on an aggregate basis; and o treat the non-resident custodial institution as an end investor.  The investment income reporting rules have been relaxed to allow a custodial institution that undertakes reporting to provide the information set out in rows 9, 17 and 20 38 only if the information is held by the custodial institution. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis Where an investor invests directly with a payer of investment income, the payer is obliged to withhold tax and report the relevant information to Inland Revenue. Example 41 Gerda invests $5,000 in Jet Planes Incorporated (Jet), a publicly listed company on the NZ stock exchange. When Jet pays a dividend, it will withhold and report investment income to Inland Revenue in respect of Gerda. 38 See schedule 6 of the Tax Adminstration Act 1994. Page 221 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 One or more custodial institutions may sit between the investor and the payer. Where this is the case, it is desirable to confirm which entity in the investment chain will be obliged to withhold tax and report to Inland Revenue. The rules introduced by the new Act are intended to provide the broad framework for withholding and reporting purposes: an entity that meets the definition of “custodial institution”; and pays investment income to an “end investor” will have an obligation to withhold and report investment income. That institution may make arrangements to outsource or transfer its obligations (as described below). The rules that require a payer to withhold where an investor invests directly with the payer will remain unchanged. Likewise, the specific provisions that allow “nominees”, “trustees”, and “agents” to undertake withholding will continue to apply to those entities. Definitions of “custodial institution”, “end investor”, and “investment income” New sections RE 10C of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 25MB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 define key terms used in the withholding and reporting rules. Custodial institution A “custodial institution” is defined as:  an entity that holds financial assets as a bare trustee on account for another person; and  whose activities are supervised or regulated under prescribed New Zealand legislation. (This includes legislation that is substantially similar to the New Zealand legislation in other jurisdictions.) End investor An “end investor” is defined as an investor to whom a payment of investment income is made who is:  a direct investor who is the beneficial owner of the investment; or  a non-resident custodial institution. The definition of “end investor” also includes a trustee, PIE, or PIE proxy that is obliged to provide investment income information to the Commissioner. A trustee, PIE or PIE proxy is Page 222 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 subject to its own obligations under existing law (such as the reporting obligations a PIE will have under the PIE rules). It is not expected that a custodial institution withholds or reports on the beneficiaries of a trust or investors in a PIE. The purpose of defining an “end investor” is to capture who the end recipient of the income should be for New Zealand tax purposes, regardless of the entities it may have passed through before reaching the person who is ultimately entitled to the income. Where the income is finally received by an individual, the information is pre-populated and reflected in the taxpayer’s income profile for the tax year. In most cases a non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) liability will be a final tax. Most non- residents are not required to file a New Zealand tax return nor will they have an Inland Revenue income profile. As such, less detailed information is required by Inland Revenue where the ultimate investor is tax resident outside New Zealand. The inclusion of a “non-resident custodial institution” as an end investor ensures that withholding and reporting for New Zealand tax purposes occurs on or before the investment income leaves New Zealand. Treating a non-resident custodian as an end investor also reduces the compliance burden on the custodian undertaking the withholding and reporting. This treatment confirms that the final New Zealand custodian does not have to “look through” the non-resident custodian to identify the ultimate investors. It is expected that non-resident custodial institutions are subject to regulatory requirements and reporting obligations under the Common Reporting Standard or US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Investment income “Investment income” is defined as:  resident passive income; or  non-resident passive income subject to a withholding obligation and attributed income of investors in portfolio investment. Page 223 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Withholding obligations of custodial institutions Section RE 4 A custodial institution that pays or transfers an amount of investment income to an end investor has been added to the list of persons who have withholding obligations under section RE 4. Section RE 10C New section RE 10C sets out when a custodial institution will have an obligation to withhold tax. It also makes provision for the custodial institution to outsource or transfer that withholding obligation. The obligation will crystallise where the custodial institution that receives a payment of gross investment income pays or transfers the amount to an end investor. The obligation only applies to the extent that the correct amount of tax has not already been withheld. Section RE 10C overrides sections RE 7 and RE 8, which will still apply to amounts paid to trustees and nominees who do not meet the “custodial institution” definition. Example 42 Sarah is a New Zealand resident who makes investments via a managed fund. The managed fund invests into Savoury Mints Ltd (Savoury), a company listed on the New Zealand stock exchange, via a custodian and sub-custodian arrangement. The sub-custodian, custodian and managed fund each have RWT exempt status; 39 Sarah is the “end investor” and beneficial owner of the asset and does not have RWT exempt status. The managed fund is obliged to withhold RWT in respect of Sarah. 39 An entity that has RWT exempt status will not have RWT withheld from payments it rece ives. Sarah Fund (RWT exempt) Custodian (RWT exempt) Sub- custodian (RWT exempt) Savoury Mints Ltd Page 224 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Variation In this variation of the above scenario, the sub-custodian does not have RWT exempt status. Entities will determine whether they have to withhold RWT based on the RWT status of the entity receiving the payment. Savoury will withhold RWT in respect of the dividend and pay it to Inland Revenue. The sub- custodian will then pass the net dividend through the chain and the managed fund will pass this on to the end investor. The managed fund will have no obligation to withhold under RE 10C because the obligation exists only to the extent that RWT has not already been withheld. Agreement to transfer withholding obligations: outsourcing or passing the withholding obligation The purpose of sections RE 10C(4) and RE 10C(5) is to provide a custodial institution with the ability to outsource or transfer their withholding obligations. This allows custodial institutions to determine how the obligation will be performed; for example, they may make use of a shared services centre or a service provider. Under section RE 10C(4), a custodian that is required to withhold RWT may, before the date on which the payment is received by the institution, enter into an agreement with another person for that person to undertake the withholding obligation. The term “another person” is deliberately wide. This allows the custodian to outsource their withholding obligation to another entity that may not meet the stringent “custodial institution” definition (and hence be subject to the same level of regulatory oversight). In this circumstance, the legal liability for failure to withhold remains with the custodial institution. Section RE 10C(5) allows a custodian that is paying to an “end investor” to enter into an agreement with another custodial institution for that custodial institution to take on the withholding obligation. In this circumstance, the withholding obligation passes to that institution which agrees to undertake the obligation and the obligation on the first custodian is discharged. The transfer of liability reflects the fact that “custodial institutions” may step into each other’s shoes for the purposes of meeting the withholding obligation. Sarah Fund (RWT exempt) Custodian (RWT exempt) Sub- custodian Savoury Mints Ltd Page 225 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Withholding obligations of custodial institutions in respect of non-resident passive income Section RF 4 places withholding obligations on “agents and others” that receive a payment of non-resident passive income on behalf of another person, if some or all the amount of tax has not been withheld. This section has now been amended to include custodial institutions. Example 43 Ben, a US tax resident, is looking to invest some money into New Zealand equities. Ben invests $50,000 via a managed fund which invests into a diversified portfolio of New Zealand equities. The fund invests Ben’s money via a New Zealand custodian (NZ custodian). A portion of Ben’s $50,000 is invested into Kyle Raymond Industries (KRI), a company on the New Zealand stock exchange. When KRI pays a dividend, the gross income will pass in turn to the sub-custodian and NZ custodian, following their RWT exempt status. When New Zealand custodian pays the income to the managed fund, the nature of the income changes from resident to non-resident passive income: it is clear that the income has a New Zealand source and has been derived by a non-resident. At this point, as tax has not been withheld, the New Zealand custodian must deduct NRWT and pay the withheld tax to Inland Revenue. Agreement to transfer withholding obligations: outsourcing or passing the withholding obligation In line with the provisions for transferring an RWT obligation, section RF 4 has also been amended to allow a custodial institution that has an obligation to withhold NRWT to outsource or pass on that obligation. Where the obligation is outsourced, liability for any default remains with the institution. Where the obligation is passed by agreement to another custodian, the first institution discharges its liability for withholding.

A new provision has been added to allow a custodian that is undertaking withholding to supply aggregated information when an end investor is a non-resident custodial institution. Section 25MB(6)(a) allows for the specific information required in schedule 6 in respect of various types of income to be provided in aggregate form where the end investor is a non- resident custodial institution. The example below demonstrates aggregate reporting and tax withholding. Example 44 Australasian Custodial Services (ACS) is a foreign custodian that operates out of Australia and specialises in investing in Australasian companies for its clients. Fifty investors comprised of individuals from the United Kingdom, China and Italy (countries that have a double taxation treaty with New Zealand) have all invested via ACS into KRI. Another fifty individual investors from Hungary, Pakistan and Greece (countries which do not have a double taxation treaty with New Zealand) have also invested into ACS for the purposes of investing into KRI. ACS has advised New Zealand custodian of the withholding rates for each pool of investors (treaty rates and non-treaty rates). When KRI pays a dividend, NZ custodian will withhold NRWT on the proportion of income payable to each pool of investors in accordance with the rates advised by ACS. Reporting obligations of custodial institutions Under the Investment Act, the original payer of investment income could not pass the reporting obligation on to a custodian, although in practice, the custodial institution, not the original payer, has access to the individual investor’s details. In line with the rules for withholding tax, the reporting rules have been clarified. Kyle Raymond Industries NZ custodian Australasian Custodial Services D TA i nv e s t o rs Non DTA investors Page 227 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Section 25B New subsection 25B(4) clarifies that a custodial institution that pays on or transfers an amount of investment income to an end investor is treated as a payer. Section 25E Section 25E sets out who must provide investment income information to the Commissioner. A custodial institution that pays on or transfers an amount of investment income to an end investor is required to report investment income information. By their nature, custodial institutions can be both a payer (in that they pay on or transfer income) and a payee. New section 25E(3) recognises this dual role. This means that a payer is required to report in respect of the investment income they have paid to the custodian. It is noted that this reporting will be much more limited in nature. Ultimately the custodial institution who is paying the end investor will be reporting in respect of the beneficial owners of the investment. Example 45 Sarah, a New Zealand tax resident, invests $10,000 via a mutual fund (custodian) into Savoury. When Savoury pays a $500 dividend, it will be required to report investment income information to the Commissioner in respect of the custodian (the payee). When the custodian pays the dividend to Sarah, it will undertake reporting in respect of Sarah as the end investor. The example above demonstrates that, because a custodial institution has sight of the underlying investors, they are often best suited to undertake reporting. If the payer was required to report in respect of the end investors, it would need to look through the custodian or have the custodian provide them with this information. A transfer of this information poses both confidentiality concerns and an administrative burden. SarahCustodian Savoury Mints Ltd Page 228 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Section 25MB New section 25MB prescribes the way in which reporting on investment income will be undertaken by a custodian that pays an end investor. It is similar to the rules prescribed for the purposes of withholding RWT and NRWT. When section 25MB applies Section 25MB sets out when a custodial institution will have an obligation to report investment income and also makes provision for the custodial institution to transfer that withholding obligation. Section 25MB will apply to a custodial institution that:  receives a payment of investment income; and  pays or transfers the amount to an end investor. Unlike section RE 10C which sets out when a custodial institution will have a withholding obligation for RWT, there is no requirement in section 25MB for the custodian to be RWT exempt. This is because section 25MB applies to the reporting of investment income information generally (that is, it does not matter whether the custodial institution receives gross or net income). Providing investment income information Under new section 25MB(3), a custodial institution that pays an amount of investment income to an “end investor” (as defined) must provide the information required under section 25E to the Commissioner. Example 46 A large number of individual investors invest their money into a managed fund (custodian), who then invests their money into Savoury Mints. In total, these investors invest $1000,000 into Savoury Mints. Savoury Mints pays a dividend of $20,000 and will undertake a simple line of reporting in respect of the custodian in accordance with the requirements in table 1 of Schedule 6 of the Tax 1000 + individual investors Managed fundSavoury Mints Ltd Page 229 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Administration Act 1994. For illustrative purposes, an example including some of the fields that Savoury Mints would report is set out below: 40 Row Items 1 The name of the payer: Savoury Mints Ltd 2 The tax file number of the payer: 123456 3 The contact address of the payer: 1 Law Lane, Wellington NZ 4 The name of the investor: Managed fund 5 The tax file number of the investor, if held by the payer: 888888 6 The contact address of the investor: 4 Potato Terrace, Auckland, NZ 7 The date of birth of the investor, if held by the payer: N/A 8 The amount and type of income of the investor for the period: $20,000 dividend income By contrast, when custodian undertakes its reporting in respect of its investors, it will have multiple lines to report in respect of every individual investor. Agreement to transfer reporting obligations: outsourcing or passing the obligations As with the obligation to withhold RWT or NRWT, there may be some circumstances where the custodian makes other arrangements for reporting. As is the case with the withholding rules, where the obligation is outsourced to another person, the custodial institution remains liable in the event of a default. In contrast, where the custodial institution enters into an agreement with another custodial institution, the reporting obligation passes to that institution and the obligation on the custodian that is paying to the end investor to report is discharged. Limited information New section 25MB(6)(b) provides a reporting relaxation for custodial institutions in respect of lines 9 (in so far as it relates to approved issuer levy (AIL)), 17 and 20 of schedule 6 of the Tax 40 There are more reporting fi elds than this as required by schedule 6 but these have not been included here as this is for illustrative purposes only. Page 230 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Administration Act 1994. Custodial institutions are only required to provide this information to the extent that it is held by the institution. Lines 9, 17 and 20 are as follows: Row Items 9 The tax withheld on behalf of, or approved issuer levy paid in relation to, the investor for the period 17 The number of shares for which the dividend is declared, or in the case of a dividend that is a bonus issue, the number of shares included in the bonus issue 20 If the dividend is paid in Australian currency by an Australian ICA company, the exchange rate between the NZ dollar and the Australian dollar that was used to calculate the imputation ratio The purpose of these relaxations is to strike a balance between the information required by the Commissioner vis-à-vis the information that is available to custodians and costs that custodians may incur in obtaining this information. Remedial amendment A remedial amendment has been made to allow reporting and withholding using the foreign exchange rate on the transaction date. This amendment applies to both custodial institutions and other payers of investment income. Allowing reporting and withholding using the foreign exchange rate on the transaction date Section RE 4(7) provides the rules for converting an amount of foreign currency withheld for RWT to be paid to the Commissioner. An additional option has been added to the sub- section to allow RWT to be converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate on the date on which the payment of income is received by the investor. This amendment is intended to provide greater flexibility to the payers of investment income. It is expected that in most cases, using an exchange rate for the date on which the payment of the income is received will allow for the amount of investment income received by the investor and the amount of tax received by Inland Revenue to be more closely aligned. Page 231 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Example 47 Tūké Ares is a New Zealand tax resident whose marginal rate of tax is 33%. Tūké invests $1,000 via Squash Investments Ltd (Squash), a custodian operating out of New Zealand, into Oceanic Cotton Co (an ASX-listed company that is subject to the FIF exemption). Under the double tax agreement (DTA) that New Zealand has Australia, 15% withholding tax can be deducted from dividends paid. On 7 July Oceanic Cotton Co pays a dividend of $850 (net of foreign tax) in Australian dollars to Squash to be held on Tūké’s account. Squash then deducts another $180 for New Zealand tax due. As a result, Tūké has suffered 33% tax. Squash then uses the FX rate as at 7 July to advise Tūké of the net dividend he has received and pay him accordingly. The $670 net dividend in AUD works out to be $703.50 in NZD ($1 AUD is $1.05 NZD). Reporting using the exchange rate on the first working day of the month after the month in the day RWT was withheld Prior to this amendment, Squash was required to use the exchange rate on 1 August, when $1 AUD is $1.10 NZD. Using this method, the gross dividend reported to Inland Revenue is $1,100 and the net dividend is $737. These amounts are recorded in Tūké’s prepopulated account for the tax year. This means that, although Tūké has received a net dividend of $703.50 from his investment, he is liable for $737 for tax purposes. Reporting using the exchange rate on the date on which the income is received Using this method, when Squash used the FX rate on 7 July to advise Tūké of his dividend and make payment to him, the corresponding amount would also be reported to Inland Revenue and reflected in Tūké’s pre-populated account accordingly. Page 232 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Information sharing provision between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office to be replaced by sharing of information under an approved information sharing agreement Schedule 7, Part A, clause 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The legislative provision enabling Inland Revenue to share information with the Serious Fraud Office to assist the investigation of serious fraud, is repealed with effect from a date to be determined by Order in Council. The information sharing for serious fraud will now be allowed under the Serious Crime Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) under Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. Repealing the current legislative provisions ensures that there is no overlap between legislation and regulations. Background Currently, there is a legislative provision under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Schedule 7, Part A, clause 7) enabling the sharing of information between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office. The provision only enables sharing and use of the information for investigation or prosecution in relation to any suspected Inland Revenue offence. The Serious Crime AISA between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police has been extended to include information sharing with the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service. Under the AISA, the Serious Fraud Office will be able to request information from Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue will be able to proactively share information in relation to any suspected offences that fit the definition of serious crime, not limited to Inland Revenue offences. The current legislation governing the information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office will need to be repealed with effect from the same date the AISA applies from, to avoid any overlap and conflict between legislation and regulation. Page 233 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features Clause 7 of Part A of Schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act is repealed. Application date This legislative provision is repealed with effect from a future date to be determined by Order in Council. This date will align with the date the AISA comes into force. Page 234 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift Section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to confirm that gifts made by way of debt forgiveness are not eligible for donation tax credits or gift deductions. Background On 17 December 2019 the Court of Appeal found in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Roberts that donation tax credits and gift deductions were available for gifts made by way of debt forgiveness. This was contrary to the long-standing policy that donation tax credits and gift deductions were only available for gifts paid in cash or by payment methods such as credit cards, electronic bank transfer, or cheque. Key features New section LD 3(1)(c)(ii) confirms that a gift made by forgiving some or all of a debt does not meet the definition of a “charitable or other public benefit gift”. As such, debt forgiveness does not qualify for either donation tax credits or gift deductions. Instead donation tax credits and gift deductions are only available for gifts paid in cash or by payment methods such as credit cards, electronic bank transfer, or cheque. Savings provision The amendment to the definition of charitable or other public benefit gift applies from the 2008–09 income year onwards. However, a savings provision applies to preserve positions taken no later than 16 December 2019. Therefore, a person is entitled to rely on the previous law if they filed a return or applied for a donation tax credit on or before 16 December 2019. Application date The section applies for the 2008–09 and later income years. A savings provision applies to positions taken on or before 16 December 2019. Page 235 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Income attribution rule and foreign tax credits Sections GB 29 and LJ 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to sections GB 29 and LJ 2 ensure that under the income attribution rules, if an associated entity of a working person pays tax overseas, a foreign tax credit (FTC) is available to the working person for the foreign tax paid. Background The income attribution rules apply when an individual (“the working person”) earns income from providing their own services to a buyer (“personal services income”) through an interposed entity (“the associated entity”) 41 that has one main source of such income. These rules disregard the entity and tax the working person directly, at the end of the income year, to prevent tax on income from the individual’s personal services being paid at the lower company rate (currently 28%) instead of at the working person’s higher marginal rate of tax (currently 33%). Under the income attribution rules:  an amount attributed from the associated entity to the working person is income of the working person under section CE 8; and  the associated entity is allowed a deduction for the amount attributed to the working person under section DC 8 so that the personal services income derived by the entity is not subject to double taxation. Under the policy framework for the availability of FTCs, if the associated entity pays tax overseas, either the entity or the working person should be entitled to an FTC for the foreign tax paid. However, due to the mechanics of the income attribution rules prior to these amendments, this was not possible. This is because an FTC is calculated in relation to a segment of net income of the person who paid the foreign tax. Because the associated entity 41 ‘Working person’, ‘associated entity’ and ‘personal services’ income are technical terms used in the legislative provisions for the income attribution rules. They are replicated in this TIB for precision. Page 236 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 is required to attribute all its personal services income to the working person at the end of each year, the entity never had net income on which it could claim an FTC, even though it paid tax on the income. Key features The following amendments to sections GB 29 and LJ 2 operate together to allow an FTC to the working person for the tax paid by the entity:  New section GB 29(1B) clarifies that for the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of section GB 29(1), section DC 8 is ignored; and  New section LJ 2(8), (9) and (10) allows the working person an FTC for foreign income tax paid by the associated entity on an amount of attributed income. The amendments to section LJ 2 acknowledge that because the working person normally has control over the associated entity, they economically earn the income on which the foreign tax is paid, and so should enjoy the benefit of the FTC. Application date The amended sections GB 29 and LJ 2 apply for the 2008–09 and later income years. Page 237 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Income attribution rule and treatment of dividends Section GB 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment to section GB 27 ensures that under the income attribution rules, a dividend paid by a company that has been required to attribute income to an individual shareholder will be exempt. However, the exempt treatment applies only to the extent the dividend cannot be imputed and the company can show that the dividend has been paid out of income that has already been attributed to and taxed in the hands of the shareholder. Background The income attribution rules apply when an individual (“the working person”) earns income from providing their own services to a buyer (“personal services income”) through an interposed entity (“the associated entity”) 42 that has one main source of such income. The rules disregard the entity and tax the working person directly, at the end of the income year, to prevent tax on income from the individual’s personal services being paid at the lower company rate (currently 28%) instead of at the working person’s higher marginal rate of tax (currently 33%). The income attribution rules distinguish between two types of dividend paid by an associated entity to the working person:  a dividend paid during the income year in which the income was derived and is to be attributed, or before the end of six months after the end of that income year (“in-year dividend”); and  a dividend paid later than six months from the end of the income year in which the income was derived and attributed (“post-year dividend”). 42 “ Working person”, “associated entity”, and “personal services” income are technical terms used in the legislative provisions for the income attribution rules. They are replicated in this TIB for precision. Page 238 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 The distinction between the two types of dividend is intended to ensure that the working person is not subject to double taxation. This is achieved by:  excluding an in-year dividend from the associated entity’s calculation of the amount of income to attribute to the working person; and  treating as exempt income the amount of a dividend sourced from personal services income previously attributed to the working person (and taxed under the income attribution rules), but only to the extent the dividend is not fully imputed. However, the previous wording of section GB 27(4), which treats post-year dividends as exempt from tax, was not sufficiently clear that its application is limited to dividends paid out of income that has already been attributed. Key features Amended section GB 27(4) limits the exemption to post-year dividends. A requirement is included for the company to keep sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to verify the source of the dividend. Application dates The amended section GB 27 applies for the 2008–09 and later income years. However, there is a savings provision for tax positions taken between 1 April 2008 and the date on which the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced (27 June 2019) that relied on the previous law. The savings provision ensures those existing tax positions are not disturbed. Page 239 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Amendment Regulations 2020 Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 An Order in Council has been made to ensure that the Commissioner’s use of money interest paying rate cannot be set at a negative rate. The Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 outlines the methodology to be used when setting the use of money interest rates. This has been amended to specify that when setting the Commissioner’s paying rate, that it must be set at the higher of:  the 90-day bank bill rate minus 100 basis points; or  0%. In effect, this prevents it being set at a negative rate. Background The use of money interest (UOMI) rates are a cornerstone of the tax compliance system in New Zealand. UOMI interest is paid by the taxpayer where tax has been underpaid and by the Commissioner where tax has been overpaid. The rate of UOMI payable for overpaid tax is referred to as the Commissioner’s paying rate. The legislated twin objectives of the UOMI provisions are to:  fairly compensate the party (either the Crown or the taxpayer) that does not have the use of its money; and  encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The method used for setting the overpayment rate is outlined in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997. This method uses the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) 90-day bank bill rate minus 100 basis points (1%). When the UOMI rates were last set, at the start of July this year, the UOMI for the Commissioner’s paying rate was reduced to 0.81%, as the 90-day bank bill rate was 1.81%. However, since then, the RBNZ has decreased the Official Cash Rate (OCR) further to 1.00. This has caused the 90-day bank bill rate to drop to 1.27% for the month of January 2019. Page 240 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Key features The measure prevents the Commissioner’s use of money interest paying rate being set at a negative rate. Application date The Order in Council came into force on 9 April 2020. Page 241 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 Sections 184A and 184B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An Order in Council has been made to include refunds for excess payments of financial support and student loan deductions as tax types refundable by direct credit under section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The provisions in sections 184A and 184B require tax refunds to be paid via direct credit to a bank account nominated by the taxpayer and were introduced to benefit taxpayers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system and costs related to cheques. Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 mandates the direct credit of refunds for excess payments of financial support and student loan deductions. Financial support means child support and domestic maintenance as defined in the Child Support Act 1991. Student loan deductions are salary or wage deductions as defined in section 4(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Section 184A still allows the Commissioner to provide an exemption when direct crediting would cause undue hardship or is impracticable. Background Compulsory direct crediting for income tax and gaming machine duty was implemented when their administration was moved to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform (START), which modernises and improves information flows, and enables more online self-service and automated processes. The administration of financial support and student loan deductions are to be moved to START in the next phase of Inland Revenue’s business transformation project, planned for April 2020. Whilst the intent was that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would eventually be required to direct credit all refunds of excess tax paid, the progressive implementation for various tax types through Orders in Council was legislated for to allow Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to choose the optimal dates to implement direct crediting of refunds for each tax type. Page 242 of 247 Public 2020 No 5 | 23 Mar 2020 Application date The Order in Council came into force on 9 April 2020.

Background The Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities Act 2019 was enacted in September 2019. It established, from 1 October 2019, the Crown entity, Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities. This new entity took over many of the functions of the former Housing New Zealand Corporation, plus several additional functions. As a result of this development, a range of references in the Income Tax Act to Housing New Zealand Corporation have been updated to now instead refer to Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities.

NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 1 of 17 DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Issued: 10 March 2020 G31 This determination may be cited as Determination G31: NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 2 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) When to use this determination 1. This determination provides the method that must be used by a Farmer who enters into an NZX MKP Milk Price Futures Contract (MKP Futures Contract) to calculate the income derived and the expenditure incurred over the term of that contract. 2. This determination applies to a Farmer who: a. enters into a MKP Futures Contract for the sole purpose of Hedging the price received for all or part of their anticipated milk solids production; and b. does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements under the financial arrangements rules in the Act. 3. A Farmer to whom this determination applies must use this determination for MKP Futures Contracts they enter into on or after 1 April 2020. What is an MKP Futures Contract? 4. An MKP Futures Contract is a cash-settled futures contract traded on the NZX Derivatives Market. It is a financial arrangement under the Act. 5. The underlying asset of an MKP Futures Contract is the price for 6,000 kilograms of milk solids (one Lot) as set by reference to the Farmgate Milk Price. 6. A Farmer initiating a price hedge against all or part of their reasonably anticipated milk production for a Season will sell (short) one MKP Futures Contract for every 6,000 kilograms of anticipated milk solids (kg MS) that the Farmer wishes to hedge for that Season. 7. Each MKP Futures Contract is identified by a Contract Month, as specified in the Expiry Calendar. The month is September in the year of expiration. The contract may have a term of up to 5 years during which it may be traded before expiring. The Expiry Calendar identifies the significant dates corresponding to each Contract Month. For example, the Expiry Calendar for the September 2021 Contract Month, provides as follows: NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 3 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020  the first Trading Day was 17 September 2018  the Last Trading Day is 9 September 2021  the Expiry Date is 30 September 2021  the Settlement Day is 1 October 2021 8. A Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract by placing an order, through a Broker, to buy or sell a contract. The Farmer will be required to pay an Initial Margin, as collateral for their obligations under the contract. The Initial Margin will be periodically recalculated and will typically reduce over time. The Farmer will also generally pay a fee to the Broker, which is not part of the Initial Margin. 9. Due to the movement in the daily Closing Price over the term of an MKP Futures Contract, the parties to an MKP Futures Contract may be required to pay, or may receive, Variation Margin.  The NZX clearing house, CHO, at the close of each business day during the term of an MKP Futures Contract calculates the Daily Settlement Price for the contract.  CHO uses the Daily Settlement Price to calculate the daily Variation Margin for the contract. The Variation Margin is the difference between the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the day of calculation and the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the business day immediately prior to the day of calculation.  Upon the calculation of the Variation Margin, CHO attributes the daily profit and loss amounts, with any profit an amount payable by CHO to a Clearing Participant and with any loss an amount payable by a Clearing Participant to CHO.  The daily profit and loss amounts for all derivatives contracts in respect of which a Clearing Participant has an open position are netted between CHO and the Clearing Participant and a nett amount is settled between CHO and the Clearing Participant.  Due to the complex of interrelated contracts relevant to an MKP Futures Contract any daily profit is an amount payable to the Farmer by their Broker and any daily loss is an amount payable by the Farmer to their Broker. 10. Farmers do not have direct access to CHO. They are required to place their trades with an NZX approved participant – a Broker. Where the Broker is a Clearing Participant the Broker clears the trades with CHO otherwise the Broker uses a Clearing Participant to clear the trades. A Broker may charge a Farmer an amount additional to the amount of Initial Margin or Variation Margin calculated by CHO. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 4 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 11. The specific terms and administrative procedures that apply to and regulate MKP Futures Contracts are set out in the Contract Terms. 12. The rights and obligations relevant to an MKP Futures Contract are set out in a complex of interrelated contracts that create back-to back rights and obligations in relation to Initial Margin and Variation Margin such that a Farmer, as principal, has:  an obligation to pay Initial Margin at the commencement of an MKP Futures contract; and  an obligation to pay and the right to receive Variation Margin during the term of an MKP Futures Contract. Expected value approach 13. This determination applies an expected value approach to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract over the term of the contract. The income or expenditure over the term of an MKP Futures Contract is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component. 14. The expected component is calculated at the date the Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract and the amount is spread over the term of the contract. However, because the Trade Price will match the Forward Rate, and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount at Maturity, there will be no expected component to spread. 15. The Initial Margin and any changes in that Initial Margin are not recognised until the income year of Maturity under a base price adjustment calculation. 16. The unexpected component is updated at the end of each income year, other than the income year the base price adjustment is calculated, to reflect the profit or loss realised through payment of the Variation Margin. This change in the unexpected component, through the receipt or payment of Variation Margin since the previous income year is income or expenditure in the income year it is calculated. 17. The final unexpected component is recognised when a base price adjustment is required to be calculated on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract. 18. The base price adjustment is income for the Farmer if it is a positive amount and is expenditure for the Farmer if it is a negative amount. The amount is allocated to the Farmer’s income year in which the calculation is required to be made. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 5 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 2 Reference This determination is made under section 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 Scope 1. This determination applies to the tax treatment of an MKP Futures Contract that is entered into by a Farmer, on or after 1 April 2020, for the sole purpose of Hedging if the Farmer does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements under the financial arrangements rules in the Act. 2. Under section 90AC(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination is binding on a Farmer described in clause 3.1 who is subject to the financial arrangements rules in the Act and is required, under section EW 12 of the Act, to use a spreading method or is a cash basis person who has chosen, under section EW 61 of the Act, to apply a spreading method. This determination does not apply to a Farmer who is a cash basis person under section EW 13(3) of the Act unless they have elected to apply a spreading method under section EW 61 of the Act. 3. This determination applies only to a Farmer who is a person resident in New Zealand under section YD 2 or YD 3 of the Act. 4. This determination does not apply to an MKP Futures Contract that is part of a wider financial arrangement. 5. This determination applies only to an MKP Futures Contract if the period between the first Trading Day and the Last Trading Day for the contract is 5 years or less. 6. For the avoidance of doubt, this determination does not apply to any other derivative products trading on the NZX Derivatives Market or another market. In respect of the NZX dairy derivatives market as at the date of this determination, these other derivative contracts are entitled WMP Futures, WMP Options, SMP Futures, SMP Options, AMF Futures, BTR Futures and MKP Options. 4 Principle 1. An MKP Futures Contract is a financial arrangement under section EW 3(2) of the Act. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 6 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 2. This determination applies an expected value approach to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract. 3. Under this approach:  The gross income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract, over the term of the contract, is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component.  The amount of the expected component: o Is determined at the date a Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract and spread with an amount allocated to each income year over the term of the contract except for the income year in which the Farmer is required to calculate a base price adjustment. o Will, however, be zero. The Trade Price for the contract is the same as the Forward Rate for the contract, and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount over the term of the contract.  The unexpected component at the end of each income year is the total amount paid to, or received by, the Farmer as a Variation Margin for an MKP Futures Contract at the end of the last day of the current income year minus any amount paid or received in all previous income years.  The final unexpected component is the difference between the Trade Price of the MKP Futures Contract and the Final Farmgate Milk Price for the Farmgate Milk Price Season minus any Variation Margins paid or received and returned in all previous income years and is recognised by performing a base price adjustment, under section EW 31 of the Act, on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract or when a base price adjustment is otherwise required to be calculated under section EW 29 of the Act. If the result of the base price adjustment is: o Positive it is, under section EW 31(3) of the Act, income of the Farmer derived in the income year for which the calculation is made. o Negative it is, under section EW 31(4) of the Act, expenditure of the Farmer incurred in the income year for which the calculation is made. 5 Interpretation In this determination (and in the explanation to this determination) – Act means the Income Tax Act 2007.

Trade Price means the actual price (expressed in NZ dollars on a per Lot basis) at which an MKP Futures Contract is Traded in the Trading System. The Trade Price will be the Forward Rate prevailing at the time an MKP Futures Contract is entered into. Traded means any resulting transaction or a linked series of transactions where an order to buy (long) or sell (short) MKP Futures Contracts is matched in the Trading System with an order to sell (short) or buy (long) MKP Futures Contracts respectively. Trading Day means a business day on which an MKP Futures Contract may be Traded on the NZX Derivatives Market. Trading System means the systems, facilities and services provided by NZX for lodging quotations and orders for trading and reporting trades of MKP Futures Contracts.

The gross income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract over the term of the contract is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component. Determination of expected component 2. The amount of the expected component is determined and must be calculated as at the date in the income year a Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract. 3. The expected component is the difference between the Forward Rate and the Contract Rate. 4. There will be no expected component. The Trade Price and the Forward Rate are the same and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount at Maturity. Spreading of expected component 5. As there is no expected component under an MKP Futures Contract there will be no amount to spread in the income years during the term of the contract. Unexpected component 6. The payment or receipt of a Variation Margin by or to the Farmer is an unexpected component. The total Variation Margin, less any amount returned in previous income years, is required to be returned as income or allowed to be deducted as expenditure at the end of each income year, or other period that the Farmer is required to file an income tax return. 7. The final unexpected component is recognised by performing a base price adjustment, under section EW 31 of the Act, on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract or when a base price adjustment is otherwise required to be calculated under section EW 29 of the Act.  A positive base price adjustment is, under section EW 31(3) of the Act, income of the Farmer derived in the income year for which the calculation is made. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 11 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020  A negative base price adjustment is, under section EW 31(4) of the Act, expenditure of the Farmer incurred in the income year for which the calculation is made. 8. Where an MKP Futures Contract is held to the Expiry Day and settled on its Settlement Day, the unexpected component will be the difference between the Contract Rate and the Final Farmgate Milk Price, on a per Lot basis minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years.  Any difference between the Contract Rate and the Final Farmgate Milk Price will be the Settlement Amount.  The unexpected component will be the Settlement Amount minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years, on a per Lot basis. This will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation. 9. Where an MKP Futures Contract is Closed Out prior to the last Trading Day for the contract, the unexpected component will be the difference between the Contract Rate and the Closeout Price minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years, on a per Lot basis. This will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation.  Any difference between the Contract Rate and the Closeout Price will be the Settlement Amount.  The unexpected component will be Settlement Amount minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component and will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation. 10. The base price adjustment formula from section EW 31(5) of the Act is as follows: consideration − income + expenditure + amount remitted Where, for each MKP Futures Contract:  consideration includes: o the Closeout Price minus the Contract Rate multiplied by 6,000 kg MS; and o the total of all Initial Margin paid or received  income includes Variation Margin returned as an unexpected component in previous years  expenditure includes Variation Margin deducted as an expected component in previous years NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 12 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 7 Examples In the following examples:  a short contract refers to a futures contract under which the Settlement Amount received increases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price decreases, and decreases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price increases; and  a long contract refers to a futures contract under which the Settlement Amount received increases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price increases, and decreases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price decreases. A farmer wanting to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production would enter into a short contract. Example A: Entering into an MKP futures contract for hedging On 1 June 2020, a farmer enters into 10 MKP Futures Contracts (that is, contracts hedging the prices of 10 Lots), each with a Contract Month of September 2021. As the farmer wants to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production, they enter into short contracts at a Contract Rate of $7.00 (that is, contracts for 60,000 kilograms of milk solids (kg MS) at $7.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contracts are entered into, the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2021 Farmgate Milk Price Season is $6.75 per kg MS. The farmer must calculate the expected component for each contract at the date on which the contract is entered into. There is no difference between the prices because the Contract Rate (which is also known as the Trade Price) of $7.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price of the contracts. The expected component is therefore zero and there is nothing to spread over the term of the contract. At the end of the farmer’s 2020−21 income year, September 2021 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.45 and the farmer has paid a total Variation Margin of $2,700 per MKP Futures Contract. The farmer’s unexpected component is calculated as follows:  Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.45 × 6,000) = ($2,700)  Total unexpected component = -$2,700 × 10 = ($27,000) The farmer is allowed a deduction for income tax purposes of $27,000 in their 2020−21 income year. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 13 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 Example B: Settlement price lower than final farmgate milk price The same farmer in Example A holds the 10 short contracts until they mature in September 2021. The Final Farmgate Milk Price announced by Fonterra for the Farmgate Milk Price Season ending 31 May 2021 (falling in the 2021−22 income year) is $7.50 per kg MS. The farmer has incurred a total loss of $0.50 for each kilogram of milk solids for which the price is hedged under the 10 contracts. The total loss under the 10 contracts is $30,000:  Total gain/(loss) = (($7.00 - $7.50) × (10 × 6,000)) = ($30,000)  The financial loss incurred under the 10 contracts is offset by the $7.50 per kg MS paid to the farmer for the actual amount of milk solids supplied that is hedged by the 10 contracts.  The net effect of the contracts is that the farmer derives total revenue of $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kg MS supplied. The farmer can be confident, that on 1 June 2020 when the contracts were entered into the farming operation will earn exactly 1 $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kilograms of the farm’s milk production. The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each contract because the contracts have matured and have been settled. The base price adjustment corresponds to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to be returned for each contract.  Unexpected component per contract = (($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.50 × 6,000)) – (-$2,700) = ($300)  Total unexpected components = (-$300 × 10) = ($3,000) o ($27,000) of unexpected components relating to the Variation Margins on the 10 contracts were paid and returned in the 2020−2021 income year  Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted o BPA = -$30,000 – 0 + $27,000 + 0 = ($3,000)  As the base price adjustment for the 10 contracts is negative, this amount is expenditure and is allowed as a deduction allocated to the farmer’s 2021−22 tax year. 1 The average farmer in this situation supplying to Fonterra would earn exactly this amount but any individual farmer may earn slightly more or less depending on other factors such as when in the season the milk was supplied or whether they were supplying to another milk producer. For simplicity the examples ignore these factors. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 14 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 The farmer’s $30,000 loss on the 10 contracts is offset by the additional $30,000 of income that the farmer receives for supplying 60,000 of kg MS at the Final Farmgate Milk Price of $7.50 per kg MS. Example C: Multi-year contracts On 1 June 2020, a farmer enters into 10 MKP Futures Contracts (that is, contracts hedging the prices of 10 Lots), each with a Contract Month of September 2022. As the farmer wants to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production, they enter into short contracts at a Contract Rate of $7.00 (that is, contracts for 60,000 kilograms of milk solids (kg MS) at $7.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contract is entered into, the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2022 Farmgate Milk Price Season is $6.75 per kg MS. The farmer must calculate the expected component for each contract at the date on which the contract is entered into. There is no difference between the prices because the Contract Rate (which is also known as the Trade Price) of $7.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price of the contracts. The expected component is therefore zero and there is nothing to spread over the term of the contract. At the end of the farmer’s 2020−21 income year September 2022 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.45 and the farmer has paid a total Variation Margin of $2,700 per MKP Futures Contract. The farmer’s unexpected component for the year is calculated as follows:  Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.45 × 6,000) = ($2,700)  Total unexpected component = -$2,700 × 10 = ($27,000) The farmer is allowed a deduction for income tax purposes of $27,000 in their 2020−21 income year. At the end of the farmer’s 2021−22 income year, September 2022 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.30 and the farmer has paid a total net Variation Margin of $1,800 per MKP Futures Contract over the two income years (including the $2,700 paid in the 2020−21 income year). The farmer’s unexpected component is calculated as follows:  Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.30 × 6,000) = ($1,800)  Total net unexpected component = -$1,800 × 10 = ($18,000) NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 15 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 o Total unexpected component (Variation Margins) paid and returned in the 2020−2021 income year was ($27,000)  2021−22 tax effect of unexpected component = -$18,000 – (-$27,000) = $9,000 The farmer is required to return $9,000 of income in their 2021−22 income year. Example D: Held to maturity The farmer holds the 10 short contracts until they mature in September 2022. The Final Farmgate Milk Price announced by Fonterra for the Farmgate Milk Price Season ending 31 May 2022 (falling in the 2022−23 income year) is $7.35 per kg MS. The farmer has incurred a loss of $0.35 for each kilogram of milk solids for which the price is hedged under the 10 contracts. The total loss under the 10 contracts is $21,000:  Total gain/(loss) = (($7.00 - $7.35) × (10 × 6,000)) = ($21,000)  The financial loss incurred under the 10 contracts is offset by the $7.35 per kg MS paid to the farmer for the actual amount of milk solids supplied that is hedged by the 10 contracts.  The net effect of the contracts is that the farmer derives total revenue of $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kg MS supplied. The farmer could be confident, that on 1 June 2020 when the contracts were entered into, that the farming operation will earn exactly $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kilograms of the farm’s milk production. The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each contract because the contracts have matured and have been settled. The base price adjustment corresponds to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to have been returned for each contract in the previous two income years.  Unexpected component per contract = (($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.35 × 6,000)) - -$2,700 - $900 = ($300)  Total unexpected components = (-$300 × 10) = ($3,000)  Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted o BPA = -$21,000 – $9,000 + $27,000 + 0 = ($3,000)  As the base price adjustment is negative, this amount is expenditure and is allowed as a deduction allocated to the farmer’s 2022−23 tax year. NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 16 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 The farmer’s $21,000 total loss on the 10 contracts is offset by the additional $21,000 of income that the farmer receives for supplying 60,000 of kg MS at the Final Farmgate Milk Price of $7.35 per kg MS. Example E: Partial closeout On 1 October 2020 a farmer enters into 35 MKP Futures Contracts, each with a Contract Month of September 2021, at a Contract Rate of $7.25 per kg MS. On 5 January 2021, the farmer reduces the hedged position by 10 contracts because they expect that production will be lower than initially expected when the hedge contracts were made. The 10 contracts are Closed Out at a price of $7.20 resulting in a gain of $0.05 per kg MS hedged under the contracts.  The total gain from the 10 contracts Closed Out on 5 January 2021 is $3,000 o Total gain/(loss) = (($7.25 - $7.20) × (10 × 6,000)) = $3,000 The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each of the 10 contracts that have been Closed Out and settled early. The base price adjustment will correspond to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to be returned (which in this case is zero) for each contract.  Unexpected component = (($7.25 × 6,000) – ($7.20 × 6,000)) - $0 = $300 per contract  Total unexpected components = ($300 × 10) = $3,000  Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted o BPA = $3,000 – 0 + 0 + 0 = $3,000  As the base price adjustment is positive, this amount is financial arrangement income allocated to the farmer’s 2020−21 tax year. The farmer will calculate the expected component for their remaining 25 MKP Futures Contracts at the end of their 2020−21 year and the unexpected component and base price adjustment for their 2021−22 year. Example F: Long term hedge On 15 July 2021, a farmer enters into 20 short MKP Futures Contracts, each with a Contract Month of September 2024, at a Contract Rate of $8.00 per Lot (that is, 6,000 kg MS at $8.00 per kilogram). NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach Page 17 of 17 G31 | 10 March 2020 On the date on which the contracts are entered into, there is no Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2024 production season. Fonterra had published a Forecast Farmgate Milk Price of $7.75 per kg MS for the 2022−23 season only. The expected component for each contract is zero because the Trade Price of $8.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price. The farmer is required to calculate the unexpected component for each of the 2021−22 to 2023−24 years using the same method as example C. The final unexpected component will not be known until the contracts mature in 2024 or are Closed Out early when a base price adjustment must be performed. This determination is signed by me on the 10th day of March 2020. Chris Gillion Policy Lead, Policy and Strategy
1 Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue March 2020 Proposed amendments for Mycoplasma bovis The Government intends to introduce legislation to ensure that farmers whose herds were culled in response to the Mycoplasma eradication programme will not face an undue tax burden. The proposed changes will be included in a future tax bill and would apply from the 2018 income year, as culls began in late 2017. Background The Government intends to introduce legislation to ensure that farmers whose herds were culled in response to the Mycoplasma eradication programme will not face an undue tax burden. The proposed changes will be included in a future tax bill. As the proposed changes have not yet been through the Parliamentary process, they are subject to change. The information in this fact sheet is provided as an early indication to allow farmers and their agents to prepare. Summary of the proposed change • Farmers that have culled their breeding livestock (including growing replacements) because of Mycoplasma bovis, would be allowed to spread the additional income derived as a result of the cull of that stock over the following six years, provided those farmers have: – used, and continue to use, the national standard cost scheme or the self-assessed cost scheme for their breeding stock; and – substantially replaced that culled livestock within twelve months. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2018 income year as culls began in late 2017. 2 Additional information Example The breeding livestock (including growing replacements) were culled in the 2020 income year. Slaughterhouse proceeds for breeding livestock (including growing replacements) that were valued at cost $400,000 Add compensation top up to market value $500,000 Total disposal proceeds $900,000 Add any additional compensation for replacement cost exceeding disposal proceeds $100,000 $1,000,000 Deduct opening tax book value of breeding livestock valued at cost $340,000 Net extra income $660,000 $660,000 is spread equally over the 2021 income year and the following five years, that is, $110,000 each year. Income tax returns for 2019 Income tax returns for the 2019 income year are still expected to be filed by 31 March 2020. These returns may include compensation payments and slaughter receipts arising from culled livestock on which tax has either been paid or will soon be due. The Commissioner has a broad range of options available to provide assistance with the tax payable on this additional income, and invites tax agents of affected farmers to send details to mbovis@ird.govt.nz . Please provide the: • farmer’s name and IRD number; • agent’s contact details; • confirmation that livestock meeting the above criteria were culled and compensation from the Ministry of Primary Industries was received; and • the amount considered allowable to be spread over the next six years if legislation passes as proposed, that is, the market value received for culled breeding stock (slaughter proceeds plus compensation payments that bring the total received up to market value). Other income would not qualify for the spread and would be payable on the due date. Income equalisation scheme class of case For non-breeding livestock (that is, fattening stock) valued under the national standard cost scheme or self-assessed cost scheme, or for stock valued under the herd scheme, the normal tax rules would apply, and the proposed spreading rules would not apply. The income equalisation scheme should provide sufficient flexibility to manage any tax issues in such cases. To assist farmers wishing to use the income equalisation scheme, a class of case has been approved for those who were instructed by Biosecurity New Zealand to cull livestock because of Mycoplasma bovis. This allows for late deposits up to 30 April 2020 and for early refunds. 3 Questions and Answers What’s the issue? The Government and primary sector has decided to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand. This decision has meant some farmers’ herds have needed to be culled, leading to a sizeable unexpected income tax liability for those farmers who have been valuing their breeding stock at cost, which can impede the ability of those farmers to restock their herds. What’s being proposed? The additional income could be evenly spread over the six income years after the year of the cull: • if the culled livestock were substantially replaced within twelve months; and • to the extent the income was derived from the culling of breeding stock (including their growing replacements) that have been valued under either the national standard cost scheme or the self- assessed cost scheme. Why allow a spread? This is unexpected taxable income which farmers have received because of the cull. A core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 is that no person should be any better or worse off because of the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. A spread of the additional income will effectively negate that income as farmers with breeding livestock should, under the national standard cost or self-assessed cost schemes, have offsetting additional deductions over that period. Who will be eligible for the spread? Only farmers who have derived additional income as a result of the culling of their breeding stock that has been valued under either the national standard cost scheme or the self-assessed cost scheme, and who substantially replace that culled livestock within twelve months and continue to value that stock under the same valuation scheme. When will it apply from? As the first culls began in late 2017, the proposed amendment would apply retrospectively, from the 2017/18 income year. Will it be compulsory? No. Spreading the income will be optional. Those wishing to use the option should advise Inland Revenue. Will there be a fiscal cost? As the proposal just alters the timing of tax payments over the forecast period, it has minimal fiscal implications – an upfront fiscal cost of $1.5 million with a balancing fiscal gain over the following five years. What should affected farmers do in the meantime before legislation is passed? Affected farmers need to file their tax returns as normal but can seek an instalment arrangement with Inland Revenue. They, or their tax agents, should contact Inland Revenue to discuss the options. There will be a specific contact person and email box. 4 What about other farmers who have had their herds culled? Other farmers will be less affected and can use the existing income equalisation scheme to offset any additional income that arises from their herds being culled. For example, a beef fattening operation that uses the national standard cost scheme will under normal circumstances be regularly turning over a significant portion of its stock annually which will generate annual income. Any additional income, therefore, should not be sufficient to warrant spreading, and the income equalisation scheme can be used instead. The Commissioner has exercised her discretion to treat farmers who were instructed to cull livestock because of Mycoplasma bovis as a class of case for income equalisation scheme purposes. This gives assurance to farmers that late deposits up to 30 April 2020 and early refunds will be approved.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There is no direct evidence on hand to give an estimate about the extent to which non- deductible expenditure affects efficiency in the tax system. This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem or the potential benefits from introducing the preferred option. Officials were informed during consultation of anecdotal examples where current tax policy settings were acting as a barrier for businesses in respect of developing assets where uncertainty existed in respect of their completion or potential impairment and abandonment. Estimates on the impacts of the proposed option have been based on New Zealand 2018 gross fixed capital formation ($m) provisional statistics. The assessed impacts in the table in section 4.1 contain assumptions regarding taxpayer compliance and the composition of private sector asset creation in the 2018 statistics. Officials have a moderate level of confidence in the assumptions we have used but note the 2018 statistics are subject to volatility as a result of asset revaluations. Although the proposals in this RIA have been developed over several years the recent development of final proposal has been completed in a short timeframe which has limited officials’ ability to undertake a complete analysis of the final proposals including its final design. The time available has also prevented officials from fully testing the design of the preferred option with stakeholders.

This RIA considers two questions:  Do the current tax policy settings hinder businesses from committing resource to developing new assets in situations where the completion of that asset is uncertain, and  If the answer to the first question is yes, what is the best option for solving the problem. The first question is considered in this section, section 2, the second question is considered in section 3. Do current tax policy settings hinder businesses from committing resource to developing new assets in situations where the completion of that asset is uncertain? Business decision-making on the potential or practicality of developing new assets, business models or processes is vital to innovation and driving productivity improvements. The Government is concerned that current tax settings are acting as a barrier to business decision-making on these types of investment, specifically investments that decline in value. Under current law, expenditure (that is more than preliminary in nature) incurred to invest in a new asset, process, or business model (feasibility expenditure), and expenditure that is incurred to create a business asset that is subsequently abandoned, is generally not deductible. As a general principle, the economic value of business expenditure that does not provide an enduring benefit should either be immediately deductible, or, when it provides an enduring benefit, deductible over time if that benefit declines over time and has a finite lifetime. When the tax system does not provide for that treatment, an economic distortion is created. Overlaying this principle, New Zealand’s income tax framework draws a distinction between the treatment of economic income from capital and non-capital sources. The distinction is best described using the following metaphor of a fruit-bearing tree. New Zealand’s income tax is designed to tax the fruit from the tree. It does not necessarily tax the tree itself. The corollary of the example is that expenditure is deductible when it has a connection or relationship with producing taxable income (fruit) and is non-deductible when it relates to capital assets (the tree). Consistent with the general principle above, the system also allows depreciation deductions recognising the use of capital assets in producing taxable income. The income tax system’s distinction between income from capital and revenue can result in expenditure not being deductible. For example, feasibility expenditure or other expenditure that results in an economic cost to a taxpayer, but for which neither immediate deductions nor depreciation deductions are available (commonly referred to as “black hole” expenditure). Such examples can skew investment decisions. Feasibility expenditure is expenditure that is undertaken to determine the practicality of a new proposal. In some cases, the Income Tax Act 2007 will deny taxpayers an immediate deduction for such expenditure when it has a connection with an asset that has the potential to yield future economic benefits beyond the taxpayer’s immediate income year. In addition, because of the early-stage nature of feasibility expenditure uncertainty exists over the outcome and this can make it difficult for taxpayers to assess whether an asset indeed exists. Inland Revenue’s original interpretation statement 1 on feasibility expenditure allowed a Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 2 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 4 of 102 relatively wide scope for preliminary expenditure to be immediately deductible if there was no definitive commitment to proceeding with a project. Concerns that the Income Tax Act was skewing business decisions came to a head in 2016 as a result of obiter comments by the Supreme Court in Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2 (the Trustpowerdecision). The case itself was about resource costs, which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue maintained were not immediately deductible. The Supreme Court agreed with the Commissioner’s view but noted that the statutory test for deducting certain types of expenditure was narrower than Inland Revenue’s interpretation and taxpayer expectations at the time. Officials have been informed that an effect of the T rustpowerdecision is that less expenditure is immediately deductible for tax purposes than previously thought 3 which increases the likelihood that businesses will incur non-deductible expenditure when creating income producing depreciable assets. In 2017 Inland Revenue released an updated interpretation statement that applies the analysis from the Trustpowerdecision. 4 Inland Revenue has been anecdotally informed by stakeholders that the current state following the Trustpowerdecision is discouraging businesses from undertaking spending on new assets or processes that they otherwise would have undertaken in the absence of tax. Additionally, if a project or investment is unsuccessful or abandoned, the capitalised e xpenditure may not generate depreciation deductions over time. As such, businesses may be incentivised to complete projects that, but for the tax effect, would be abandoned. This behaviour affects economic efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates a simple project timeline and the tax treatment of the expenditure incurred in developing that project following the Trustpower decision and Inland Revenue’s 2017 interpretation statement: Figure 1: Tax treatment of feasibility expenditure 1 Interpretation Statement IS 08/02: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008) available at https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/e/e/ee3c54c3-4675-45d3-8fa4-2cea747ff52b/tib- vol20-no6.pdf 2 Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZSC 91. 3 This outcome is appropriate, however, for assets that are not expected to decline in value. 4 Interpretation Statement IS 17/01: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017) available at https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/3/e/3e0303d0-0b02-4f86-844a- 547a6179b661/tib-vol29-no3.pdf Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 3 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 5 of 102 2.2 Who is affected and how? The proposal in this RIA is directed at businesses, specifically in the following circumstances:  Businesses delaying or not undertaking feasibility studies that would otherwise occur if there is uncertainty over whether the expenditure would be deductible and the higher after-tax cost of an unsuccessful investment.  Businesses continuing with feasibility studies that would be uneconomic on a pre-tax basis to ensure they can claim deductions for expenditure already incurred. The Government is concerned that current tax settings are not providing the correct outcome for businesses in respect of expenditure on new assets and processes (that would, if completed, decline in value). The Government wants to remove these tax barriers to promote economically efficient business decisions. It is not intended that the reform would have effect on spending related to assets that are not expected to decline in value over time, such as land or shares, or other assets where the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for a specified treatment. Inland Revenue does not hold information to inform who is directly impacted by the current treatment of expenditure directed at creating new assets. We are, however, aware from tax practitioner comment following the Trustpowerdecision and the views of submitters about the initial problem definition and initial solutions, that there is an impact on small-to-medium sized firms and the large corporate sector. Not for profits, public sector entities and individuals are not considered be within the scope of those affected. Reform in this area of tax law has had long-standing support from the business community. The magnitude of the impact is also difficult to estimate as Inland Revenue does not directly capture data relating to the costs incurred by business when making investment decisions or when decisions are made that result in physical assets being abandoned. In assessing the revenue impact of the preferred option discussed in this RIA, Inland Revenue has used asset formulation statistics to get an understanding about how asset formulation changes from year to year. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 4 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 6 of 102 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? To date, the government has taken an incremental approach to other instances of non- deductible expenditure under New Zealand’s tax system in relation to:  Research and development;  Company administration costs;  Resource consents;  Software projects;  Patents; and  Plant variety rights. The options discussed in this impact statement are not intended to replace or otherwise alter the rules that are specific to the type of expenditure on the activities or transactions listed above. As such, it is not within the scope of this project to review or consolidate these previous responses. It is expected that any policy change would be directed at expenditure that is not the subject of these other rules in the Income Tax Act; as such, it is likely to act as a rule of last resort. The options in this RIA therefore consider expenditure that is not dealt with elsewhere in the Income Tax Act. The options are also not intended to alter the current non-deductibility for assets that are expected to appreciate in value such, as land or shares, as such assets are not expected to result in an economic loss. The Tax Working Group’s consideration of the treatment of expenditure on feasibility and expenditure on abandoned assets, as set out in its final report in February 2019 have also had a strong influence on the selection of the preferred option. 5 5 Future of Tax: Final Report Volume I – Recommendations, Thursday, 21 February 2019 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report-vol-i-html#section-3, recommendation 33 refers. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 5 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 7 of 102 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered:  Neutrality: the tax rules should not influence taxpayer decisions about incurring feasibility expenditure  Compliance and administration costs: the impacts on taxpayers complying with the tax rules and Inland Revenue’s administration of those rules, should be minimised as far as possible.  Integrity: Tax deductions should not be available for expenditure that when incurred is unlikely to give rise to taxable income now or in the future or for expenditure on assets that are not expected to decline in value over time. Option One: Status quo This would leave the deductibility of feasibility expenditure to be considered on a case-by- case basis with guidance from Inland Revenue’s 2017 interpretation statement following the Trustpowerdecision. Option Two: Spread the timing and recognition of feasibility expenditure over 5 years This option would allow taxpayers to deduct expenditure on developing new assets and incomplete assets over a defined period of 5 years. Alternative spreading periods have been considered such as 7 years. Officials initially considered 7 years was most appropriate for New Zealand, noting the absence of a comprehensive tax on the income from capital. A 5-year spread was chosen following detailed consideration of the treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure on incomplete assets by the Tax Working Group headed by Sir Michael Cullen. It is also noted that Australia has a comparable 5 year spreading rule to deal with expenditure incurred for similar purposes when developing new assets. 6 A period shorter than 5 years was considered to introduce a distortion to abandon incomplete assets earlier than would otherwise occur (in the absence of tax). 7 Officials plan to carry out an additional round of consultation with key stakeholders on the final design of this option including any resulting draft amendments. An outstanding matter for stakeholder comment is the test(s) that would need to be met to establish the point in time in which expenditure can be recognised for tax deductibility. Option Three: Generally accepted accounting practice (application of Financial Reporting Standards) This option would allow generally accepted accounting practice (with certain constraints) to determine the recognition and timing of deductions. 6 Inland Revenue notes that any comparison of this proposal with tax deductibility rules that apply in Australia should be considered in the context of differences between New Zealand’s and Australia’s treatment of income from capital. 7 Noting that a tension can exist for taxpayers who are required to comply with financial reporting standards. Assets expensed for tax purposes have a direct reflex in the taxpayer’s balance sheet and profit and loss statement. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 6 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 8 of 102 This would allow for:  a defined class of expenditure, known as “feasibility expenditure”, to be immediately tax deductible until an asset is recognised under generally accepted accounting practice; and  an immediate deduction if the project or proposal is abandoned and written off under generally accepted accounting practice. This option would also require support by new rules to deal with abandoned partially completed assets. The additional rule would be needed to remove distortions that would otherwise be created as depreciation deductions are available for completed assets only. Modifications to options 2 and 3 for compliance and tax base integrity reasons Options 2 and 3 have modifications that are not separate options in themselves but alter their application and effect to ensure the reform option is appropriately targeted and contains appropriate safeguards. Reinstatement of expenditure if abandoned or completed asset is subsequently recognised Under options 2 and 3, safeguards would be added to provide that deductions claimed for abandoned or impaired assets that are subsequently reinstated would be reversed in the year of reinstatement. Reinstatement would involve bringing back earlier tax deductions as an increase in revenue in the year of reinstatement and capitalizing those values in the cost of the asset (which would then be subject to tax depreciation). Safe harbour for low threshold expenditure Submitters on option 3 argued that a safe harbour was necessary to reduce compliance costs on small-to-medium sized taxpayers. This was largely due to the fact that such taxpayers were unlikely to be required to comply with New Zealand financial reporting standards. Similar compliance cost savings arguments apply to option 2 as there are costs attached with identifying and spreading expenditure under the option. It therefore makes sense for low levels of spending on investigating and/or developing a new asset, model or process to be immediately deductible. It has yet to be explored with stakeholders if expenditure covered by the safe harbour would have to be reinstated if it related to a completed asset that is expected to decline in value. 8 A threshold of $10,000 was suggested by stakeholders, and officials considered that it was an appropriate amount that targeted asset creation expenditure by small-to-medium sized businesses. The $10,000 threshold is similar to other compliance cost savings measures in the Income Tax Act that allow taxpayers to deduct low levels of expenditure, such as legal fees. 8 Ibid footnote 8. Officials note that taxpayers who are not required to comply with financial reporting standards do not always face a tension between accounting for tax and financial reporting when making decisions about whether to abandon an asset prior to completion. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 7 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 9 of 102 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The Government considers the status quo is inefficient. Current tax policy settings, based on comments from stakeholders and the conclusions reached by the Tax Working Group, act as a barrier to businesses committing to expenditure on developing assets when uncertainty exists as to whether that asset would be completed. In the absence of regulatory change, the current state requires taxpayers and Inland Revenue to take decisions regarding the deductibility of expenses and the recognition of assets through to disputes and the Courts. Regulatory intervention therefore seeks to remove, or substantially reduce, these interpretative transaction costs. The next question is, which option for reform is preferable. Option 3 was initially developed in response to stakeholder concerns following the Trustpowerdecision and was the subject of the government discussion document Black hole and feasibility expenditure. Option 3 proposed that financial reporting should be used by businesses to determine the deductibility of expenditure or if it should be capitalised. Responses to option 3 suggested that it would not be a complete solution and could be expensive for taxpayers, who are not required to use financial reporting standards, to apply. Stakeholders also noted that the tax treatment of abandoned incomplete assets was unsatisfactorily unanswered if financial reporting standards were applied. Further consideration of option 3 by officials identified a concern that immediate tax deductibility could incentivise decisions to abandon incomplete assets earlier than otherwise occur (in the absence of tax). Option 2 is a response to the concerns stakeholders voiced regarding the application and effect of option 3. Option 2 is preferred as it better meets the assessment criteria in section 3.1. Allowing deductions for expenditure incurred in developing assets, including abandoned incomplete assets, improves neutrality as businesses no longer face tax barriers depending on whether the results of that expenditure are successful or not. Relative to the other options, option 2 should have a lower compliance and administration impacts. This comment is subject to final decisions about the legislative design of the proposal. Further consultation will be carried out on the practical application of Option 2, if Cabinet decides to proceed. The details of when reinstatement of previously deducted expenditure is required has yet to be tested with stakeholders. It is, however, necessary to ensure the integrity of the proposal and the wider tax system. There are no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. A summary of our analysis of the options is set out in the table on page 10. The analysis is by reference to the status quo.

The intent of the preferred option is to remove barriers to firms carrying out expenditure on developing new assets, business processes and other investments where the result of that expenditure is uncertain and could result in abandonment or impairment of the investment. This type of investment is important to innovation and driving productivity improvements. As such, the preferred option is expected to produce wider benefits to the business community. The final design of the preferred option has not been the subject of full consultation with stakeholders. This consultation is expected to occur in the next few months following the outcome of Cabinet’s decision. To ensure the integrity of the proposal, the consequences of any reinstatement of expenditure have not been fully explored and this may involve trade-offs regarding how simple option 2 operates in practice. Officials have made certain assumptions regarding taxpayer behaviour in response to the proposal, those assumptions have inherent uncertainties, including:  Whether the proposal may incentivise taxpayers to commit to completing uneconomic assets to reduce tax payments (raising tax-base integrity risks); and  Whether this proposal, in conjunction with earlier policy responses outlined in section 2.3, causes introduces more complexity in taxpayer decision-making and associated tax compliance costs. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 11 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 13 of 102 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Following the Trustpowerdecision, the private sector, being corporate taxpayers and their advisors, approached the government seeking a revision of the tax policy settings for expenditure on projects that was more in line with business norms and prevailing practices. Officials undertook preliminary targeted consultation to define the parameters of the problem and consider initial solutions. The outcome from this consultation was the development of a proposal that was released in May 2017 for wider public comment in the government discussion document Black hole and feasibility expenditure. 23 submissions were received that largely supported the policy direction but had concerns regarding the complexity of the proposal and its practical application. In October 2017, a second round of consultation was held on a revised proposal with key stakeholders. Of the ten responses received, feedback was generally supportive of the revised approach but concerns were again expressed over the complexity of the proposal. Submitters were also concerned that the revised proposal created gaps which could still give rise to non-deductibility of feasibility expenditure. The preferred option in this RIA simplifies the rule and introduces a trade-off that deductions are spread over five years rather than immediately unless the qualifying expenditure is $10,000 or less in a tax year. Stakeholders have informed officials that the most important issue is the expenditure being deductible; not necessarily the timing of that deduction. Consultation with stakeholders initially focused on a framework (option 3) that would allow businesses upfront tax deductions for expenditure incurred in developing assets, that if completed would decline in value, at the point when a decision was made to completely abandon progress on that incomplete asset. Immediate tax deductions would also be allowed for feasibility expenditure by reference to accounting principles, with an overlay of tax principles for tax base integrity purposes. Submissions on the practicality of option 3 noted that the proposed deductibility test for feasibility expenditure was too complex. Submissions also noted that partial write down of assets needed to be recognised for tax purposes. Submitters noted that accounting standards imposed tight requirements on when assets should be written off and specific tax rules were recommended to provide for such impairments. Submitters also recommended a safe-harbour threshold that would allow small- to-medium sized businesses immediate tax deductions for low-levels of exploratory expenditure on new assets. Submitters noted that for businesses considering developing new assets, the requirement to use financial reporting standards could be an impediment if the business was not required to use New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards, which also have a compliance cost attached to their use and application. Officials revised the parameters of option 3 in response to submissions and undertook a second round of consultation with key stakeholders. The revised proposal relaxed the basis on which tax deductions could be claimed on partially impaired assets and suggested the tests for deductibility would be based on Inland Revenue’s revised interpretation statement. Submitters were supportive of the revision but again noted the degree of complexity with the proposal (as it was a blend of accounting and tax concepts). Concerns were also expressed that the integrity measures that supported option 3 would lead to gaps with its application. Option 3, without appropriate safeguards could, by allowing immediate tax deductions raise Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 12 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 14 of 102 integrity risks around activities being claimed to be ceased while they were still intended to be progressed in order to access the tax deduction. This option is an improvement over the status quo, but less than option two. There is a risk that if the proposal is not well targeted the change may incentivise taxpayers deferring the recognition of asset (so as to continue incurring feasibility expenses) or encourage the early abandonment of projects and proposals. In response to the concerns identified by submitters on option 3, officials considered that option 2 could provide a more complete response to submitter concerns. However, there is a trade-off. While option 2 is intended to deal with the gaps and problems identified in option 3, the deduction allowed under the option is spread over a specified period. As the requirement to track and record expenditure can create compliance costs, a safe harbour threshold is still required to ensure option 2 does not unreasonably disincentivise small-to-medium sized businesses. Consultation on the final design of option 2 has not occurred and is subject to Cabinet decision-making. Subject to Cabinet decisions, Inland Revenue will discuss the practical application of option 2 with stakeholders. Another round of consultation will also available as part of Parliament’s consideration of any legislative amendment through the Parliamentary select committee process.

The preferred option would require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be introduced in the next available tax omnibus bill planned for early 2020. Legislation implementing the preferred option is expected to have effect for new expenditure incurred from the start of the 2020-21 income year (for most firms this is 1 April 2020) even if the feasibility project itself had started in previous years. It is not intended that these rules would apply to expenditure incurred before that date as these periods have already occurred so the change in tax treatment would not be able to impact on business investment decisions. These proposals would be favourable to affected taxpayers and would be enacted before taxpayers would typically file tax returns for the relevant periods. When the bill is introduced into Parliament, a Commentary on the bill will be concurrently released explaining the amendments. Further explanation about their effect will be contained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletinseries, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed legislative changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. Inland Revenue has assessed the magnitude of the administrative impacts and considers that the proposed approach can be implemented and made effective for qualifying expenditure incurred anytime from the start of the 2020-21 income year. No changes to Inland Revenue systems are expected as a result of implementing the proposals. Taxpayers would be expected to use existing schedules and internal record- keeping processes to capture information to support tax positions that involve tax deductions relating to developing new assets, or when decisions are made to impair and abandon incomplete assets (that would otherwise decline in value if completed). Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? There are no plans to specifically collect data on the proposal as, of itself, expenditure on developing new assets is a general business activity that would be incorporated and aggregated within existing business tax disclosures and tax returns. The existing record- keeping rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 would apply to deductions allowed under the proposal. Monitoring of the proposed approach will be done through existing relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders and their advisors. Following enactment of the proposal, any issues with the new law identified by tax practitioners and taxpayers would be considered for inclusion for remedial change as part of the stewardship programme on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Comments from stakeholders and their advisors will inform officials if the proposal is not working as intended or creating unintended outcomes. Inland Revenue’s enforcement of the relevant rules (referred to in section 6.1) would also Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 14 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Page 16 of 102 inform officials if the risks noted in section 4.2 are material, or raise concerns regarding the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes as per the objectives of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to confirm that the proposed approach meets its objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? If the Government adopts option 2, officials propose to engage with key stakeholders 18 months after the proposal’s enactment and receive feedback regarding the effectiveness of the proposal (if feedback is not received earlier) for the period 2020-21. The Government’s tax policy work programme makes provision for work required to deal with remedial matters where tax legislation is not achieving its policy intent. Remedial work is informed from a variety of sources external and internal to Inland Revenue. Any concerns identified by stakeholders about the proposed approach discussed in this RIA would be considered for priority as part of the remedial items component of the tax policy work programme. If the concerns with the proposal are more substantive, consideration would be given to prioritising the matter on the tax policy work programme.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis An assumption has been made that applying GST or VAT to outbound mobile roaming services is more likely to become the common approach worldwide. This assumption is based on the OECD finalising in 2017 its International VAT/GST Guidelines (the Guidelines) which set forth internationally agreed standards for the GST/VAT treatment of international transactions and the European Union applying VAT to outbound roaming services received by its residents. Under the Guidelines, remote services (which includes telecommunications services) should generally be subject to GST/VAT in the country that the recipient of the services is normally resident. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST on telecommunications services regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria.

Under New Zealand’s current GST rules for telecommunications services both outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas and inbound mobile roaming services received by non-residents in New Zealand are not subject to GST (or are subject to GST at the rate of 0%). 1 The current rules are inconsistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework, under which one of outbound or inbound mobile roaming services should be subject to GST. As GST is intended to be a tax on final consumption, applying GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services received by GST registered businesses should not have a net revenue benefit. Businesses receiving roaming services should (if GST-registered and using the services for making taxable supplies) be able to claim back the GST incurred on these services as an input tax deduction. The net revenue benefit from applying GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services should therefore only be the GST incurred by final consumers. The OECD released International VAT/GST Guidelines in 2017. Under these Guidelines remote services (including telecommunications services) should generally be subject to GST or VAT in the jurisdiction where the recipient of the service is normally resident. Remote services are services in which there is no necessary connection between the place of performance of the services and the location of the recipient of the services. In light of the OECD’s Guidelines, the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have begun applying VAT to outbound mobile roaming services received by their residents travelling overseas. However, in over 80 other jurisdictions (including Canada, Japan and Singapore) GST, VAT or a local sales tax is added to inbound mobile roaming services, generally by applying these taxes to the wholesale roaming services supplied by local telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable the supply of inbound mobile roaming services. The GST/VAT rules for telecommunications services in most of these jurisdictions pre-date the OECD finalising its International VAT/GST Guidelines. It is unclear whether these countries have made a considered decision to maintain their pre-existing rules for telecommunications services or if they have simply not reviewed these rules yet in light of the OECD’s Guidelines. Like New Zealand’s current rules, Australia does not apply GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services. The differing treatment of mobile roaming services around the world can result in both double taxation and double non-taxation. For example, the roaming services received by an EU resident travelling in Canada would be subject to GST/VAT in both the EU and Canada. Conversely, the roaming services received by a Canadian resident in the EU would not be 1 Inbound mobile roaming services may, in certain circumstances, be subject to GST but these circumstances rarely arise. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 20 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 3 IN CONFIDENCE subject to GST/VAT in either jurisdiction. On 8 April 2019 Cabinet agreed as part of Budget 2019 to amend the GST rules for telecommunications services to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services from 1 October 2020 (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). The issues paper GST and telecommunications services was then released on 17 May 2019 to consult on the detailed design of the proposed changes. This RIA updates the analysis of options following consultation on the issues paper. However, the proposed option is still to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. Application date Cabinet has previously agreed to an application date for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services of 1 October 2020. However, this application date may not give telecommunications suppliers enough time to make and test the necessary systems changes to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are suppliers of telecommunications services and the consumers of these services. New Zealand telecommunications suppliers will be affected as the proposed options would impact on the GST treatment of their supplies of outbound mobile roaming services. Consumers of telecommunications services will be affected as the price they pay for mobile roaming services may increase depending on whether suppliers pass on the full GST cost, or alter their pricing strategies. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Applying GST to the actual inbound mobile roaming services supplied by foreign telecommunications suppliers to non-residents travelling in New Zealand is unlikely to be a viable option and has therefore not been considered. Many telecommunications suppliers sell global or regional roaming packs that allow a consumer to roam in multiple jurisdictions for a single fee. At the time of supply the telecommunication supplier will not know which jurisdiction a consumer will consume the roaming services in. Furthermore, a consumer may consume the roaming services in multiple jurisdictions. If the actual inbound roaming services were subject to GST it would therefore be likely to cause telecommunications suppliers significant difficulties in attempting to apportion roaming charges between the different jurisdictions in which a customer consumed the roaming service. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 21 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tion 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? The objective is to maintain New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework by extending the application of GST to more services. The following criteria have been used to assess the options against this objective: • Destination principle: The option should be consistent with the principle that GST or VAT should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. • Business neutrality: The option should be consistent with the principle that GST should be borne by final consumers and should not be a cost to businesses. • International consistency: The option should give consideration to approaches taken internationally to minimise instances of double taxation or double non-taxation. • Compliance costs – The option should minimise compliance costs for telecommunications suppliers as much as possible. Option 1: Status quo Under the status quo both outbound and inbound roaming services are not subject to GST at 15%. The status quo does not achieve the objective as, under New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework, GST should apply to one of outbound or inbound mobile roaming services. Option 2: Apply GST at 15% to outbound mobile roaming services (proposed option) Under this option, outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas would become subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. The gross GST that would be collected under this option is estimated to be $12.993 million per annum. However, GST registered businesses paying GST on the outbound mobile roaming services they receive would be able to claim back this GST as an input tax deduction. It is therefore estimated that this option would increase net GST revenue by $7.041 million per annum. Analysis of option This option would be consistent with the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework as it would add GST to the entire outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas. Applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is not consistent with the destination principle as to receive mobile roaming services a New Zealand resident must be outside New Zealand. However, there are circumstances in which it is appropriate to depart from the destination principle. The OECD’s Guidelines recommend using a consumer’s usual place of residence for determining which jurisdiction’s GST or VAT applies to a supply of remote services (including telecommunications services) regardless of the physical location of the consumer. For example, if a New Zealand resident downloads a movie while on holiday in Australia, New Zealand GST should apply to the download of the movie. This departure from the destination principle is considered appropriate as often the supplier of a remote service 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 22 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 5 IN CONFIDENCE will not know the actual location of the consumer and therefore the consumer’s residency is considered an appropriate proxy for the most likely place of consumption of remote services. This option would be consistent with the principle of business neutrality as GST-registered business can claim back the GST they incur as an input tax deduction. This option would be consistent with rules in the European Union and the United Kingdom which apply VAT to outbound mobile roaming services received by their residents. However, this option would be inconsistent with the approach taken in over 80 other jurisdictions which add GST, VAT or a local sales tax to inbound mobile roaming services, generally by applying GST to wholesale mobile roaming services. However, the rules in many of these jurisdictions pre-date the OECD finalising its International VAT/GST Guidelines. The option would also be inconsistent with Australia which, like New Zealand’s current rules, does not apply GST to either outbound or inbound roaming services. The telecommunications industry has estimated that this option would impose on the industry compliance costs associated with updating their billing systems of approximately $1 million. They would also incur costs associated with notifying their customers of the change in the GST treatment of outbound roaming services. The compliance costs for this option would be a one-off cost and on-going compliance costs would be comparable to the status quo. Option 3: Apply GST to inbound wholesale mobile roaming services GST could be added to inbound roaming by applying GST to the wholesale mobile roaming services supplied by New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable the foreign telecommunications suppliers’ customers to roam in New Zealand. This would result in unrecoverable GST being embedded in the price of roaming services received by non-residents travelling in New Zealand. The diagram on the following page illustrates how applying GST to wholesale roaming charges would work. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 23 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 6 IN CONFIDENCE As can be seen in the above diagram, applying GST to the wholesale roaming charges would add GST on to the services NZ Telco supplies to OZ Telco to allow OZ Telco’s customers to roam in New Zealand. There is no GST on the actual supply of roaming to OZ Telco’s customer. However, GST is embedded in the price of the roaming services received by OZ Telco’s customer as OZ Telco is unable to claim an input tax deduction for the GST they paid to NZ Telco. It is estimated that this option would increase GST revenue by $3.8 million per annum. As GST would be imposed on the wholesale roaming services rather than the actual inbound mobile roaming services, non-resident businesses consuming inbound mobile roaming services in New Zealand would not be able to claim back the GST embedded in the price of these services. As such, there is no need to consider the difference between gross and net GST revenue under this option. Analysis of option This option partially achieves the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST system as it would add GST to the price of inbound roaming services received by non- residents travelling in New Zealand. However, the margins charged by the suppliers of inbound roaming services would remain untaxed. This option would be consistent with the destination principle. Applying GST to wholesale roaming services is inconsistent with the principle of business neutrality as it would add unrecoverable GST to the price of inbound roaming services received by non-resident businesses in New Zealand. This option is inconsistent with the approach taken in the European Union and United NZ Telco OZ Telco Customer of OZ telco Connection to NZ Telco’s network Roaming services Wholesale roaming services $11.50 (incl. GST) $15 (no GST) $1.50 GST 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 24 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Kingdom. However, it would be consistent with the approach taken in over 80 other jurisdictions which apply GST or VAT to wholesale roaming services. Like option 2, this option is also inconsistent with the approach taken to mobile roaming services in Australia. The telecommunications industry has not quantified the cost of making systems changes to add GST to wholesale mobile roaming services. However, the industry considers that these costs would not be insignificant. Officials consider that the costs of making systems changes for this option may be similar to the costs of making systems changes for option 2. This option would also impose costs on the New Zealand telecommunications industry related to reviewing and potentially re-negotiating their contracts with foreign telecommunications suppliers. As with option 2, the compliance costs of this option would be one-off costs and on-going compliance costs would be comparable to the status quo. Application date An application date of 1 October 2020 was originally proposed for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services. However, it is proposed to delay this application date by six months to 1 April 2021. The bill containing the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services is scheduled for introduction in March 2020. This would mean that there may be little or no time between the legislation being enacted and the original application date of 1 October 2020. If the bill is not passed before the next general election, enactment might not occur until after 1 October 2020. A very short time period between the bill being enacted and the application date may not give the telecommunications industry sufficient time to make the necessary systems changes to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. The billing systems of telecommunications suppliers are complex as they need to operate in real time to ensure a person is correctly charged as they use the network. As such, while changing outbound mobile roaming services from a zero-rated supply to a standard rated supply is itself a simple change, the telecommunications suppliers would need to do extensive testing to ensure the change does not cause any issues for their billing systems. Given, the factors discussed above, delaying the application date by six months to 1 April 2021 is considered appropriate. Delaying the application date by six months would have a fiscal cost of $3.52 million. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 25 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is to apply GST at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas from 1 April 2021 (option 2 with a six-month delay to the application date previously agreed by Cabinet). While applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is less consistent with the destination principle than the status quo, it best achieves the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework and is more consistent with the principle of business neutrality than applying GST to wholesale roaming services. Furthermore, while there is no clear international consensus at this stage, officials consider that, in light of the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines and the approach taken by the European Union, applying GST to outbound roaming services is more likely to become the common approach worldwide. The proposed approach is aligned with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 26 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (suppliers) One-off compliance costs in complying with the change in GST treatment of telecommunications services.

Low Wider government Fiscal cost from delaying application date by six months $3.52 million Other parties (consumers) Potential increase in the costs of outbound roaming services supplied to New Zealand residents whilst outside New Zealand.

We do not anticipate the proposed approach would have any other impacts. We will consult with tax advisors and the telecommunications industry on how best to draft the changes to the GST Act to ensure there are no unintended impacts. The select committee process will also be used to ensure there are no unintended impacts. Sec tio n 5: Stake h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The issues paper GST on telecommunications services was released on 17 May 2019 to consult on the technical details of the proposal to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. Submissions closed on 28 June and in total 6 submissions were received. Following the close of submissions officials conducted further consultation with representatives of the telecommunications industry. Support for the proposal Two submissions from accounting firms expressed support for the proposal as they consider it consistent with the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines. However, one of these submissions expressed concerned that the benefits of the proposal would be outweighed by the compliance costs. Opposition to the proposal Four submissions, including one made on behalf of the telecommunications industry, were strongly opposed to the proposal to add GST to outbound roaming services. In further consultation with the telecommunications industry they have regularly expressed their opposition to the proposal. The key argument raised in opposition to the proposal was that, as outbound roaming services can only be consumed outside New Zealand, it would be contrary to the destination principle to apply New Zealand GST to outbound roaming services received by New Zealand residents overseas. Under the destination principle, GST should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. In arguing that it is inappropriate to apply GST to outbound roaming some submitters also argued that roaming services are on-the-spot services and not remote services as a consumer needs to be in the vicinity of a cell tower to receive the service. In arguing that roaming services are on-the-spot services these submitters were arguing that it would be inappropriate to use a consumer’s usual place of residence to determine which jurisdiction’s GST or VAT applied to a supply of roaming services. However, roaming services should not be considered on-the-spot services as they are not physically performed at a readily identifiable place, 2 and do not require the physical presence of both the person performing the service and the person consuming the service. The New Zealand telecommunications industry’s strong preference is for the status quo to be 2 Telecommunications services tend to have multiple places of performance and it is difficult to identify a single place of performance. The GST rules for telecommunications services were introduced to address this issue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 28 of 102 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 11 IN CONFIDENCE maintained. They note that while it is not a conceptually pure option, the existing rules for telecommunications services have been working well and the consider the status quo to be less of a compromise on a conceptually pure GST system than the proposed option. Furthermore, they do not consider that the increase in GST revenue of $7.041 million per annum would justify the one-off compliance costs of approximately $1 million from making changes to their billing systems. Application date The telecommunications industry suggested a delayed application date would be appropriate given the time required to make and test systems changes. They are therefore likely to welcome the delayed application date of 1 April 2021. Sec tion 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Following Cabinet approval, the necessary amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 will be included in an omnibus tax bill currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020. The proposals are intended to apply to supplies of telecommunications services from 1 April 2021. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue officials have assessed the magnitude of these administrative impacts and consider that they would be comparable to the status quo. Guidance on how the proposed approach would work would be provided in bill commentary published at introduction of the legislation and a Tax Information Bulletin published after enactment. Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Officials from Inland Revenue expect that, once the proposals are enacted, affected telecommunications suppliers and their tax advisors will raise with them any concerns they have with how the rules are working in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1 above. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Page 29 of 102 Page 30 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet . Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Number of affected parties and potential future fiscal risks are unknown The potential future fiscal risk that the time bar may be ineffective for GST refunds made using credit notes is unknown as it depends on the scale of the particula r issue that gave rise to the refund (e.g. changing interpretations or errors by the affected businesses that have n ot yet been identi fied) and number of past years affected. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate these amounts – although in some potential cases they could be in the tens of millions of GST revenue. Li mited consultation with affected parties Issue one: Cor rect amount of GST adjustment A d raft interpretation of the current law on the first issue is currently being consulted on and the initial feedback that has been received supports the proposed policy change as it would align the law with common business practices. Som e submissions were received on a similar proposal in 2012 (see section 5.1 below for more detail ) which have been used to inform this RIA. Ho wever, there has been no specific consultation on the proposed changes. Issue t wo: Application of the time bar to credit notes The second issue has not been consulted on with external parties as informing external parties that the time bar may be ineffective could expose the Government to a sig nificant fiscal risk. A GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). Con sultation will occur once the bill is introduced and during the Select Committee stage of the bill. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 3 Page 31 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST refunds using credit notes RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. The Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section of the RIA notes that no consultation has been undertaken on the specific proposals and the amount of fiscal risk from not changing issue two is unable to be quantified. The first proposal is taxpayer favourable and maintains current operational practice. The second proposal is a base maintenance change consistent with the policy intent and the fiscal impact, although not quantifiable poses a significant risk if not addressed. The reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties.

Responsible Manager (signature and date): Graeme Morrison Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 23 October 2019 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 32 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? GST credit notes are issued by a supplier when the price for a supply is reduced after a tax invoice was issued, for example when faulty goods are returned. When a credit note is issued: • th e supplier must make an adjustment in their GST return in the period they issued the credit note; and • the recipient (if GST registered), must make an adjustment in their GST return in the period they received the credit note. Through these adjustments, the supplier will effectively be refunded for the GST accounted for on the portion of the supply that was refunded, and the recipient (if GST registered) will be required to repay the GST claimed on the refunded portion of the supply. Inl and Revenue has recently considered how the GST credit note provisions apply in cases where the GST registered business standard-rated (applied 15% GST) to a supply of goods and services which should in fact have been exempt (e.g. a financial service) or zero-rated (e.g. an export). This has raised two policy issues: Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment Firstly, from a policy perspective the current law may provide an incorrect amount of GST adjustment in situations where a supply was standard-r ated but should have been exempt or zero-rated. This is because, the GST adjustment may be limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the adjusted price. Fo r example, consider a supply of $100 plus $15 of GST which was incorrectly charged. The supply should have been exempt or zero-rated (no GST). In this situation, the correct policy outcome would be for the supplier to issue a credit note and make an adjustment for the incorrectly returned $15. The recipient ( if GST registered) would then make an adjustment for $ 15 incorrectly claimed. However, according to a draft interpretation that Inland Revenue is currently consulting on, the GST adjustment is limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the price adjustment. Since the price adjustment is $15, the GST adjustment is limited to $1.96 (3/23 x $15) rather than $15. This interpretation would not accommodate common commercial practices whereby GST registered persons issue credit notes to provide a $15 GST adjustment (rather than amending the original return). Although GST registered persons can request approval from Inland Revenue to amend their original GST re turn to get the correct $15 GST adjustment, this approach is inferior to using a credit note as it involves additional compliance costs and administrative costs. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 33 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The second issue concerns whether the “time bar” is effective at limiting GST refunds that arise due to credit note adjustments. The ability to adjust a GST return to claim a GST refund is “time-b arred” which means a GST registered person can only claim a GST refund in respect of GST returns that were filed less than 4 (or in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight less than 8) years prior to the current date. In contrast, because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment. This poses a potentially large fiscal risk as it means a GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). This would be contrary to the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The first issue affects some GST registered persons (businesses) which have incorrectly charged 15% GST on a sale of goods and services when that sale should in fact have been exempt or zero-rated (0%). However, GST advisors have informed us it is a common commercial practice to use credit notes to provide the correct amount of GST adjustment in such cases, in which case the proposed law change would simply align with existing practice (and therefore have no impact on compliance costs). The second issue could potentially provide additional GST r efunds to some businesses on rare occasions where they made a mistake more than 4 or 8 years ago. However, i t was not intended that GST registered persons could receive additional GST refunds from using a credit note instead of adjusting the original GST return. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the decisions. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 34 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3. 1 What options have been considered? The following criteria was used to assess the options: • Horizontal equity – the affected parties should be able to achieve the intended policy outcomes and similar outcomes as other groups in similar situations such as those who amend their o riginal GST return. • Certainty – the affected parties should understand how the tax rules operate. • Compliance costs and administration costs should be minimised. • Policy stability / sustainability – the option should be able to be maintained and cope with future developments. Issue one: correct amount of GST adjustment issue Option 1: No law change (status quo) GST registered persons will still be required to request approval from Inland Revenue to amend their original GST return to get the correct GST a djustment, or accept a lower GST adjustment through a credit note. Pros: • Requirement to amend original return may provide IRD with a greater ability to check / approve the refund. • IRD can increase certainty by publishing guidance on how the current law operates. Cons: • Provides the wrong policy outcome as it results in a much lower amount of GST ref und compared to amending the original GST return. • Uncertain and would impose compliance and administration costs as IRD’s draft interpretation does not ali gn with current business practices. • Inconsistent with self-assessment basis of GST. Option 2 : Make it easier to make the adjustment through amending the GST return This option would allow the affected GST registered persons to amend their GST returns on a self-a ssessment basis using Inland Revenue’s systems (MyIR). For example, by allowing the amendment to be made in their GST return for the next period, or by relaxing the requirement to apply to Inland Revenue to approve an amendment to an earlier GST return. Pros: • May provide IRD with a greater ability to check the refund. Cons: • Some additional complexity as to get the correct GST adjustment a different refund mechanism must be used depending on why the GST was incorrect. • Would impose compliance and admin costs as does not align with current business practices. • Requires IRD to make systems and process changes and may require a law change. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 35 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Law change to clarify the correct amount of GST adjustment (preferred option) This option would involve adding a new provision that ensures t hat when the affected GST registered person issues a credit note for a particular supply, it provides the same amount of GST refund compared to amending the original GST return w hich included the relevant supply. Pros: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Aligns with current business practices. • Provides certainty about the r efund amounts when GST credit notes are used. • Reduces compliance and admin costs. Cons: • Requires law change. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes issue Option 1: No law change (status quo) Because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment, even though the relevant supply which is adjusted was included in a GST return more than 4 or 8 years ago. Pros: • Allows the business to go back and correct all past mistakes, and claim GST refunds for these, no matter how long ago the mistake occurred. Co ns: • Potentially large fiscal risk to the Government and could effectively allow GST refunds for time-barred returns contrary to the policy intent of the time bar. • High compliance and admin costs due to the potentially large refund amounts and the historic nature of the relevant supplies. Option 2: Align with the time bars which apply for GST refunds made through amending the original G ST return (preferred option) This would involve applying a time limit from the date of a supply in which a credit note may be issued. The time limit would match the existing 4 year (or 8 year in the case of a clear mistake or simple oversight) time limits for GST refunds which apply when an amendment is made to the original GST return which included the relevant supply. Pros: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Provides certainty that the time bar applies to credit notes. • Reduces compliance and admin costs (consistent set of GST refund rules and likely to align with current practices). Co ns: • Limits the ability to claim GST refunds for past mistakes (but still allows a generous 4 or 8 years for this). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 36 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Expand an existing provision which provides a 7 year limit for using credit notes when a s upply of land has been incorrectly standard-rated Credit notes cannot be issued in relation to supplies of land which were incorrectly standard-rated more than 7 years ago. This 7 year limit could be expanded to prevent a credit note from being issued in respect of other supplies that occurred more th an 7 years ago. Pros: • Aligns with an existing 7 year time limit for credit notes and 7 year record-keeping requirements. • Provides certainty for the time limit that applies to credit notes. Co ns: • Can allow a different amount of refund to amending the original GST return (as this has a 4 or 8 year time limit) which could change which refund mechanism is used (and increase administration and compliance costs). • Limits ability to claim GST refunds for past mistakes to 7 years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 37 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment The preferred option is option 3 – a law change to clarify the correct amount of GST adjustment as it: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Reduces compliance and administration costs by aligning the law with some common current practices of the affected businesses. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The preferred option is option 2 - align with the time bars which apply for GST refunds made through amending the original GST return because it: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Reduces compliance and admin costs (consistent set of GST refund rules and likely to align with current practices). • Should be a sustainable policy as it means credit notes cannot be used to undermine the policy intent of the existing time bars for GST refunds and also removes the risk of a potentially large, unintended fiscal cost to the Government. The proposed options are compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 38 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (S ome GST registered businesses which have incorrectly charged 15% GST) Issue two: Lose the potential ability to access an unintended windfall of GST refunds in respect of transactions that took place more than 4 or 8 years ago in “time- barred” periods.

No other impacts have been identified from the proposed options. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment A draft interpretation of the current law on the first issue is currently being consulted on (PUB 00352, Changing GST treatment after reducing the previousl y agreed consideration) and the initial feedback that has been received supports the proposed policy change as it would align the law with common business practices. A similar set of proposed changes to the credit note r ules was consulted on as part of 2012 issues paper GST remedial iss ues. However, a decision was made not to proceed with any changes to the credit note rules in 2012. This was because one part of the 2012 proposals suggested that when a credit note was issued in such circumstances it should be necessary to pass on the GST refund to the purchaser. Submissions from private sector GST advisors disagreed with this aspect of the proposal and noted that whether or not a refund should be paid through to the purchaser was a contractual m atter and should not be dictated by the GST Act. The new proposal does not in clude the aspect which these submitters opposed in 2012. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The issue of how the time bar applies to credit notes has not been directly consulted on with external parties. I nforming external parties that the time bar may be ineffective in such cases c ould expose the Government to a significant fis cal risk. To manage this risk the proposed option could apply from the date that the bill containing the proposed amen dment is introduced. Despite this, a proposed option which would have addressed the second issue was referenced in the 2012 consultation document GST remedial issues ( which asked whether that adjustment should be treated as taking place in the same period as the original supply), but no submissions were received on this option. A decision wa s made not to proceed with any of the proposed changes to the credit note rules in 2012 due to submitter ’s disagreeing with on e aspect of the 2012 credit note proposals that suggested that the refund should be passed onto the purchaser ( described above). Further consultation Further consultation on both issues / proposals will occur during the Select Committee stage of any bi ll containing the proposed amendments. It is expected that some stakeholders will submit against the proposal to apply a time bar to credit notes as the proposed law change could potentially limit businesses ability to claim a GST refund for errors they made in their GST returns more than 4 or 8 years ago. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 41 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 12 IN CONFIDENCE However, it was not intended that GST registered persons could receive additional GST refunds from using a credit note instead of adjusting the original GST return as this would be contrary to the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. Most of the affected businesses have been applying the time bar on GST refunds to credit notes (and this has also been Inland Revenue’s operational practice). This means the proposed law change to apply a time bar would align with these current practices. In contrast, if the existing law is unchanged it could potentially provide an unintended windfall of large GST refunds in respect of transactions that occurred more than 4 or 8 years ago in “time-barred” periods. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 42 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Goods and Services Act 1985 which could be included in the next available tax omnibus bill expected to be introduced in early 2020. Guidance materials to explain how the amendments would operate will be published when the bill is introduced, in response to submissions raised with the Select Committee and after the bill is enacted. There is a risk that the proposed amendments could have unintended consequences or may not adequately accommodate existing business practices. These risks will be mitigated by aligning the provisions with similar existing rules, consulting GST advisors once the relevant provisions are introduced in a bill and through the monitoring described in section 7.1 below. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 43 of 102 Page 44 of 102 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? As both proposed law changes are expected to align the law with the current practices of most of the affected businesses and Inland Rev enue’s operational practice, they should have minor impacts on compliance and administrative costs. Inland Revenue will monitor if any unintended consequences arise through its usual processes of monitoring GST refunds, and through contacts and feedback from the affected businesses and their GST advisors. Inland Revenue would then consider how best to address specific issues that arise. This could include answering queries, publishing guidance materials, adjusting operational practices, making remedial law changes or reviewing the policy. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1. above, on an ongoing basis. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Page 45 of 102 Page 46 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Officials do not hold operating lease payments data for all IFRS 1 taxpayers. Estimating the total amount of annual operating lease payments for all IFRS taxpayers was necessary to determine the fiscal cost of the proposals. We identified the population of IFRS taxpayers and extracted operating lease information on the approximately 43% (by value of income tax payable) of IFRS taxpayers where it was available. This was then used to estimate lease payments for the balance of the population on the assumption their lease payments would be in the same proportion to their income tax payable. This identified total operating lease payments for all IFRS taxpayers of approximately $2.5 billion per annum. Two other factors that influence the fiscal cost are the average lease term (higher cost for longer terms) and the interest rate (higher cost for higher rates). We could not identify data on average lease terms so estimated these for a variety of situations then checked their reasonableness with exte rnal stakeholders. The interest rate on leases will differ from lease to lease and taxpayer to taxpayer; whereas the forecasting model requires a single interest rate. We chose the NZ dollar BBB+ rated corporate 5-year fixed term interest rate on 20 June 2019 which was the date the calculation was performed. In costing the proposals we have assumed that lease payments will remain static over time. A more realistic assumption is that, due to inflation and economic growth, lease payments will slowly grow over time. If this was factored into the costing there would be a small ongoing cost to the proposals; however, this cos t would be very small so has been disregarded on a materiality basis. We h ave also assumed that, for the preferred option, all eligible taxpayers will elect to follow their accounting treatment for eligible leases. This is the most conservative assumption, but we expect the proportion will be very high. We have not attempted to estimate the exact percentage expected to elect. 1 In ternational Financial Reporting Standards – The requirement to prepare accounts under IFRS varies but the most common is having total assets in excess of $60 million or total revenue in excess of $30 million. In 2017 the External Reporting Board (XRB) identified 2,575 entities with IFRS reporting obligations based on 2015 data. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 4 Page 47 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 2 IN CONFIDENCE While changes in these assumptions or the final values will affect the fiscal calculations, officials consider these are sufficiently accurate that they can be relied upon to make decisions on the underlying principles considered. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: Comments from the review of earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 17 October 2019 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 48 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the polic y problem or opportunity? A lease involves one person (known as the lessor) who owns (or otherwise holds) an asset providing it to another person (known as the lessee) to use in exchange for payment o ver the term of the lease. For entities with IFRS 2 reporting obligations, the accounting treatment was previo usly determined under New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 17 Leases (NZ IAS 17). This standard has been replaced by New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases ( NZ IFRS 16 or IFRS 16) for years starting on or after 1 January 2019. 3 Accounting treatment under NZ IAS 17 Under NZ IAS 17, there was a difference in the accounting treatment between operating and finance leases. NZ IAS 17 defines the distinction as follows: A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. For example, a lease would be classified as a finance lease if the lessee leased the asset for the majority of its estimated useful life then had the right to purchase it from the lessor for a fixed price at the end of the lease. In contrast, a lease would be classified as an operating lease if the lessee only leased the asset for a short portion of the estimated useful life then at the end of the lease it was returned to the lessor to lease or sell to someone else. Current tax treatment The Income Tax Act 2007 contains two separate sets of rules for finance and operating leases. These definitions are similar but not identical to the NZ IAS 17 definition. The largest difference is that all leases of real property 4 are operating leases for tax purposes. For finance leases, the lease payments are taxed under the financial arrangements rules and are treated like the repayment o f a loan with interest. For operating leases, the lease payments are currently spread equally over the life of the lease. This treatment is similar to the NZ IAS 17 accounting treatment which reduces the need for tax adjustments. No changes to the tax treatment of tax finance leases are considered in this RIA. Accounting changes moving from NZ IAS 17 to IFRS 16 For lessees, IFRS 16 removes the distinction between operating and financ e leases for accounting purposes. Under IFRS 16, lessees are required to recognise on their balance sheet a new asset, being the right to use the leased asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the obligation to pay rentals. 2 Refer to footnote 1 for an explanation of who is required to follow IFRS 16. 3 IFRS 16 can also be applied for earlier periods for entities that choose to do so and meet certain other criteria. 4 Real property is not specifically defined but generally relates to land and buildings. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 49 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 4 IN CONFIDENCE This RIA does not attempt to explain how accounting expenditure is calculated under IFRS 16; however, there is usually a slight acceleration of deductions compared to accounting under NZ IAS 17. This can be shown in the following simplified example for a 5- year lease, that was an operating lease under NZ IAS 17, with $100,000 per year of lease payments and a 3.7237% 5 discount rate: Year NZ IAS 17 Expenses IFRS 16 Expenses 1 100,000 106,439 2 100,000 103,337 3 100,000 100,120 4 100,000 96,783 5 100,000 93,322 Total 500,000 500,000 The NZ IAS 17 treatment matches the cashflows of the lease, whereas IFRS 16 more closely matches the economic cost of the lease. The IFRS 16 treatment can be thought of similar to a typical fixed-rate mortgage where total payments are consistent over time, but the interest expenditure is higher in earlier periods when the loan is higher, and the interest expenditure is lower (and therefore capital repayments are higher) near the end of the loan when the amount outstanding is lower. Capital repayments are not deductible; however, for an IFRS 16 operating lease, the capital has been applied to acquire the right to use the asset which is deductible as depreciation over the term of the lease. IFRS 16 does not significantly change the accounting tr eatment of leases for the lessor. The lessor will continue to reflect the leased asset on their balance sheet for operating leases. This RIA does not consider changes to the tax treatment of the lessor. Policy opportunity The introduction of IFRS 16 provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax treatment of lessees’ operating leases with the new accounting treatment. This has two main objectives: • Efficiency - As finance leases and debt used to purchase assets is already taxed under the financial arrangements rules deductions are accelerated similar to the IFRS 16 example above. Aligning the tax treatment of operating leases with the IFRS 16 treatment will make the tax treatment of all three methods of asset acquisition more similar which will reduce the tax incentive to choose one method over another to obtain a tax advan tage. • Compliance costs - Unlike when entities followed NZ IAS 17, an entity following IFRS 16 will need to make tax adjustments to remove accounting deductions and claim tax deductions. By following IFRS 16 for tax the number of adjustments required could be reduced and therefore compliance costs would be lower as would be the possibility of inadvertent error. 5 This is the same rate used to forecast the fiscal impact of the proposals as discussed in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section of this RIA. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 50 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Timing cost As shown in the example above, total deductions under b oth NZ IAS 17 and IFRS 16 are identical; however, when broken down they are slightly higher in earlier years and slightly lower in later years under IFRS 16. Accelerating the timing of deductions in this way results in a permanent fi scal cost to the Crown. The appendix to this RIA provides an example to explain how this cost arises. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Businesses seeking to acquire an asset have a choice of financing structures including outright purchase (often funded by borrowing), finance leases and operating leases. IFRS 16 6 provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax treatment of operating leases with how finance leases and debt fun ded asset purchases are treated. This will reduce the tax incentive for businesses to acquire assets under a particular str ucture due to their different tax treatment. More closely aligning tax and accounting treatments also reduces the compliance costs of having to make tax adjustments and reduces the chances that these adju stments will inadvertently be made incorrectly. All IFRS taxpayers consulted supported alignment of tax with accounting for these reasons, provided it was on an optional basis. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There is a distinction in the tax treatment between operating and finance leases and there was previously a (slightly different) distinction in the accounting treatment between operating and finance leases. The adoption of IFRS 16 has removed this distinction for accounting purposes. Officials consider the tax distinction between operating and finance leases is well understood and working as intended so removing or amending this boundary has not been considered. Instead, the project has been limited to changes aimed at simplifying the tax treatment of leases that would have previously been, and will continue to be, classified as operating leases for tax. While there are undoubtedly benefits of aligning tax with IFRS 16 for affected taxpayers, early discussions with stakeholders identified that taxpayers wanted alignment to be optional rather than compulsory. As this project is intended to be a taxpayer favourable simplification all of the options in this RIA are for optional alignment rather than applying t o all IFRS taxpayers. While this will marginally reduce efficiency, officials do not expect this to be material, especially given the small number of IFRS taxpayers expected not to elect. 6 Refer to footnote 1 for an explanation of who is required to follow IFRS 16. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 51 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 6 IN CONFIDENCE While allowing non-IFRS taxpayers to follow an IFRS 16-type treatment for tax would also offer efficiency benefits, officials have not considered extending this treatment to non-IFRS taxpayers. This is because IFRS 16 calculations are relatively complicated a nd are not required for accounting purposes for non-IFRS taxpayers so requiring or allowing them for tax would require complex calculations s olely for tax purposes. This would have a high compliance cost that would outweigh any efficiency benefit available. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Efficiency: the option should align with the economic substance and the accounting treatment of tax operating leases as much as possible. • Sustainability: the option should follow existing income tax deductibility principles and should not offer a more favourable treatment compared with that available to non- IFRS taxpayers. • Compliance costs: the compliance cost should be minimised as far as possible. Option 1: Status quo This option would retain the existing cashflow treatment of operating leases for lessees who are IFRS taxpayers. Once IFRS taxpayers adopted IFRS 16 they would be required to make tax adjustments t o reverse accounting expenses and claim deductions consistent with the current treatment. This would not provide any of the benefits of alignment. Compliance costs may (depending on specific decisions and taxpayer circumstances) be lower than under some variants of option 3 but would be higher than under option 2 or option 4. Option 2: Full alignment This option would allow lessees to claim t ax deductions equal to their accounting expenditure under tax operating leases. This would provide the highest level of efficiency, and compliance cost savings, as it would fully align tax and accounting. However, it would not be sustainable – it would offer a signifi cant more favourable treatment that that available to non-IFRS taxpayers and would have a si gnificant fiscal cost (estimated at approximately $400 million 7 ). 7 As with the cost estimates for Option 3 and Option 4 th is cost is the total cost of this option over all time periods. The time period is dependent on the transitional period chosen which has agreed to be 5 years. Changing the transitional period changes the period the cost arises over but doesn’t change the total cost. There are no costs beyond this transitional period. Refer to the appendix of this RIA for a more detailed explanation. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 52 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Full alignment with adjustments This option would allow lessees to mostly claim tax deductions equal to their accounting expenditure under tax operating leases but w ould require them to make adjustments to recognise the tax principle that tax deductions should (generally) be available only when expenditure is incurred. This is in contrast to a number of items included in IFRS 16 lease expenditure, such as fair value impairments 8 – which are closer to a provision and provisions are not usually deductible – and make good costs 9 – which a re spread over the (remaining) term of the lease rather than when the expenditure is incurred. This would have similar, or slightly lower, sustainability than option 4. However, it would have a fiscal cost of approximately $89 million assuming all IFRS taxpayers elected to align tax and accounting. It would significantly increase compliance costs as the calculation of adjustments would be complex and would have to be regularly updated. This increase in compliance costs would likely result in many taxpayers choosing not to align tax and accounting as the compliance costs could outweigh the benefits. If the proportion of taxpayers choosing to align tax and accounting was similar to option 4 then this option would have higher efficiency (due to the coverage of more leases); however, due to the increased compliance costs its likely less taxpayers would choose to align resulting in lower efficiency than option 4. Option 4: Partial alignment with adjustments This option is the same as option 3 except it would exclude operating leases for real property which would continue to be deductible under the current tax treatment. Real property is a term within the leasing rules and takes its ordinary legal meaning. It can be thought of as land and buildings. A lease of real property cannot be a finance lease for tax purposes even when the terms o f the lease woul d otherwise make it so. Many b usinesses will have more non- real property leases than real property leases. However, real property leases are typically for longer terms and over higher value assets, so the total value of real property leases is expected to be far higher. This option does not capture the full efficiency benefits due to its narrower scope of covered leases so is worse than option 2 based on this cri terion but still higher than option 1 (which does not align at all) and option 3 (due to the expected low take- up of the optional alignment). This option has significantly lower compliance costs than option 3 as most of the adjustments that would be required under option 3 would not frequently arise in non-real property leases (for example, businesses often must restore a commercial building at or before the end of the lease whereas they don’t have to do this with a vehicle lease). It is the most sustainable as it is not significantly more favourable compared with the treatment by non-IFRS taxpayers and also has the lowest cost (approximately $9 million) of any option other than the status quo. 8 Fair value impairments are recorded as an accounting expense when the value of the asset to the business is less than that recognised in the accounts. For example, when a business is contracted to keep making lease payments on a building but no longer wants to operate from that site. 9 Make good costs are the estimated costs of restoring an asset before it can be returned to the lessor. For example, rem oving fitout from a building. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 53 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Option 4 is the preferred option. It will align tax and accounting for the greatest number of leases given the constraints of not creating a significantly more favourable set of rules for IFRS taxpayers that is not available to other businesses. This option will minimise compliance costs to the extent possible as it is expected that a high proportion of eligible taxpayers will elect to follow it. We have not attempted to estimate what proportion would choose to align tax and accounting but as the rules will reduce compliance costs and marginally bring forward deductions there will be few reasons not to elect to align. The forecasts conservatively assume that 100% of eligible taxpayers will elect to do so. There are no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

None identified. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Officials undertook targeted consultation with large corporates who enter into operating leases, their advisors, and relevant representative groups. Stakeholders were supportive of the simplification benefits of more closely aligning tax and accounting for operating leases for IFRS taxpayers provided this was on an optional basis (as the preferred option does and as discussed in section 2.3 above). Stakeholders generally sought a full alignment with few, and preferably no, adjustments from the accounting position on the basis this would minimise compliance costs. For the reasons 10 This cost is permanent to the Crown as it considers the economy as a whole where new leases are always entered into (refer to the appendix of this RIA for more explanation). In contrast, taxpayers enter individual leases where the benefit is only the slight acceleration of deductions but the same total deductions over the life of the lease, so this has only a timing benefit. Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Lessees who follow IFRS and elect to follow the accounting treatment for tax Removal of need to adjust between accounting and tax deductions Timing benefit f rom deductions being brought forward so tax will be paid slightly lat er 10 Reduction in tax incentive to enter into different acquisition structures Medium Medium Medium Inland Revenue Reduction in monitoring of tax adjustments for operati ng leases Low – some adjustments will still be required but the number of adjustments will be significantly reduced.

However, the exclusion of real property leases is likely to significantly reduce the number of adjustments that will be required. There have been varying degrees of support from individual stakeholders on the decision to exclude real property. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 56 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be included in the next available tax omnibus bill expected to be introduced in early 2020. This bill is unlikely to be enacted before late 2020 or early 2021 which is after the application date of IFRS 16 – on or after 1 January 2019. For the earliest possible balance date that IFRS 16 would apply to, of 31 December, the first tax year following IFRS 16 will end on 31 December 2019. This is the 2019/20 tax year and the relevant return will be due to be filed by 31 March 2021 for taxpayers with an extension of time for filing their returns. Therefore, in most instances, affected taxpayers will have started their first-year accounting under IFRS 16 before the enactment of the bill containing the proposals but will not file a tax return until shortly after the enactment of that bill. For a taxpayer who chooses not to elect to align tax and accounting in the 2019/20 year, they should be able to elect to do so in any subsequent year. B ut all taxpayers, once they elect to align tax and accounting treatment, should be required to do so in all future years where they follow IFRS for accounting purposes. When a taxpayer chooses to elect to follow the accounting treatment for tax purposes this will usually result in a one-off deduction (arising from deductions that would have been available had the taxpayer been able to follow IFRS 16 in previous periods but were not available under the previous treatment). In order to manage the fiscal cost of this transition to the Crown, we suggest this deduction is spread over the year of adoption and the following four years. Consulted stakeholders have been supportive of this approach. Inland Revenue will release details of the Cabinet decision once it is made and further detail will be provided in a commentary released when the Bill is introduced and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Inl and Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the rules. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 57 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? No specific data collection or monitoring is expected. Inland Revenue maintains a close relationship with many of the small number of affected large taxpayers and has a specific contact for IFRS issues. Any issues with the proposals or their post enactment implementation are expected to be identified through these channels or through contact with Policy staff. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? • How will the arrangements be reviewed? How often will this happen and by whom will it be done? If there are no plans for review, state so and explain why. • What sort of results (that may become apparent from the monitoring or feedback) might prompt an earlier r eview of this legislation? • What opportunities will stakeholders have to raise concerns? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislati on, and the identification of remedial issues. A post implementation review could occur around 12 months after implementation. Any recommended changes identified from the review would be considered for potential inclusion on the Government's tax policy work programme. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 58 of 102 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix: Timing cost example As referred to in section 2.1, this example explains how a permanent reduction in tax revenue arises from the acceleration of lease deductions even where total deductions for each lease are unchanged. Assume, each year a three-year lease is entered into with $100 of deductions each year. The total deductions will be $300 each year as follows: Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Lease 1 100 100 100 Lease 2 100 100 100 Lease 3 100 100 100 Lease 4 100 100 100 Lease 5 100 100 100 Lease 6 100 100 Lease 7 100 Total 300 300 300 300 300 Instead, assume the timing of deductions is changed to $ 105, $100 and $95 for all leases starting from lease 4. Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Lease 1 100 100 100 Lease 2 100 100 100 Lease 3 100 100 100 Lease 4 105 100 95 Lease 5 105 100 95 Lease 6 105 100 Lease 7 105 Total 300 305 305 300 300 This shows that annual deductions start at $300 and return to $300 in year 6 onwards but in years 4 and 5 increase to $305. This $5 increase in deductions, if taxable at 28%, would permanently decrease tax revenue by $1.40 for both year 4 and year 5. If, in a future year, leases were no longer entered into this cost would reverse as there would be less deductions available. However, on an economy wide basis it is reasonable to assume that leases will continue to be entered into so this cost should be treated as permanent. Detail decisions such as whether to apply to existing leases or to spread a transitional adjustment over multiple years will affect the year the fiscal cost arises in but will not alter the total cost of the decisions in this RIA. Due to inflation and economic growth it would be more accurate to assume a small increase in lease payments each year rather than this example’s static lease payments. The consequence of such an assumption would be to create a small ongoing cost from an acceleration of lease deductions. However, this effect is not expected to be significant so has been omitted from the analysis. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Page 59 of 102 Page 60 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyers & sellers Sec tio n 1 : Gen er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There are a number of limitations or constraints. These are: •There is no data to confirm that the issues the policy proposals are intending to address are currently a problem. Instead, officials have identified a gap in the current legislation that may be exploited by taxpayers considering recent and ongoing changes to tighten the rules for taxing land disposals. On that basis, officials consider that it is important to address these issues at this time. •Options have been limited to considering making the current framework more effective. Officials did not consider options that would tax more categories of land. •The lack of data on the scope and scale of taxpayer practices and structuring makes it difficult to determine which options best address the problem. •The lack of data means that no qualitative impact analysis is possible. However, problem definition and solutions were subject to targeted and public consultation. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyers & sellers RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. As identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section there is no data to support the current scale of the problem or the impact of the proposed changes if they were 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 5 Page 61 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 2 IN CONFIDENCE enacted. However, the RIA sets out the rationale for why the status quo is an issue and why a regulatory change is preferred. The reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version.

This RIA considers proposals to tighten the rules that apply where people regularly buy and sell land that is used mainly as a home or business premises while it is held by them. Current situation The land sales rules contained in part CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 tax gains from the sale of land when the land is held by a person effectively as trading stock (in the same way that a furniture vendor is taxed on the gains they make from selling their furniture). It is not intended that the rules tax gains on capital assets (e.g. gains from selling the furniture vendor’s shop or a person’s home). However, the rules are drafted quite broadly to ensure that people cannot easily structure around them, which means they can catch some land that is inherently a capital asset. To limit this potential overreach, the rules contain exclusions. Relevantly, the rules exclude from tax gains from the sale of: • a person’s main home, where land sales are subject to tax under the bright-line test 1 (the main home exclusion) • a person’s residence, where land sales are subject to tax because the land was acquired with an intention of disposal, or where the owner or an associated person is in a business involving land (the residential exclusion) • a business premises, where land sales are subject to tax because the land was acquired with an intention of disposal, or where the owner or an associated person is in a business involving land (the business premises exclusion). For example, the land sales rules tax all sales of land by a land dealer, but the exclusions ensure the dealer will not be taxed on the sale of their home. To ensure these exclusions are not abused, they are subject to regular pattern restrictions which stop the exclusions applying where a person has a regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a main home, residence or business premises. The regular pattern restriction in the main home exclusion for the bright-line test is also supplemented by a time- period rule, which states that the main home exclusion will not apply if a person has relied on it twice in the previous two years. These restrictions ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land effectively as trading stock cannot rely on the exclusions to escape tax. Why is the current situation a problem? Given the recent tightening of the land rules 2 there is a concern that taxpayers can avoid the regular pattern restrictions by arranging their affairs so they do not have a pattern of buying and selling main homes, residences or business premises. This is contrary to the policy intention. 1 The bright-line test taxes gains from the sale of residential land acquired and sold within five years. 2 Including the introduction of the bright-line test and the new residential rental ring-fencing rules that only allow deductions to be offset against income derived from land (e.g. rental income). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 63 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 4 IN CONFIDENCE The risk is that the government is missing out on tax revenue from those that are effectively making trading profits from the buying and selling of land, but are relying upon the main home, residential or business premises exclusions to escape tax. Over time there is a risk that greater numbers of investors may become involved in trading homes and business premises to take advantage of the tax-free gains. We are unable to estimate the size of the current tax gap or how this could change with increased investor activity. The general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) will continue to effectively override other provisions of the tax legislation to deny the tax benefits of an arrangement where a more than incidental purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit. In some circumstances the GAAR could be invoked where a taxpayer has structured their affairs in such a way that they have avoided establishing a regular pattern of purchase and sale of home or business premises. However, in many circumstances the GAAR may not be the most effective tool to counter such structuring. It is considered preferable for there to be clarity and transparency in the underlying law to give certainty to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. What is the underlying cause of the problem? Officials have concerns that the current regular pattern restrictions are not working as intended. This undermines the integrity of the tax system by allowing people to take advantage of the exclusions in circumstances where this was not intended. As the restrictions are currently drafted, taxpayers who are undertaking regular buying and selling activity can structure around the regular pattern restrictions in one of two ways. Firstly, the regular pattern restrictions apply quite narrowly to the activities of a single person. This allows taxpayers to circumvent the application of the regular pattern restrictions by buying and selling land using different persons or entities each time (for example, the first property is purchased by the person, the second is purchased by their partner, the third by their family trust). Secondly, the regular pattern restrictions have been interpreted narrowly to apply only when there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This means that the regular pattern restrictions will not apply where a person does something different to each piece of land. For example, the first property is bought, lived in and sold, the second is renovated while it is lived in and sold, or the third is a bare section where a house is built and occupied then sold. Why does it need to be addressed now? The Government has indicated that people who engage in property speculation will come under increasing scrutiny. This is why a review of the land rules was added to the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme earlier in the year. One of the aims of this review is to consider ways to improve the integrity of the tax system. How much confidence is there in the evidence and assumptions for the problem definition? While there is currently no data, to the extent that there is currently a gap in the current land rules, it is reasonable to assume that some investors will look to exploit the existence of tax- free gains. Other context The issues considered in this RIA have been identified as part of a review of the current land tax rules undertaken by Inland Revenue. As part of this review, other regulatory changes 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 64 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 5 IN CONFIDENCE have been identified, including: • clarifying the extent to which holding costs (such as interest, rates and insurance) should be deductible when the gain from the sale of private use land (such as a bach) is taxable; and • moving the requirements of the Land Transfer Tax Statement (a form filed with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) when people buy, sell or transfer property) from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to new secondary regulations operated by LINZ to provide a more flexible way to make any future changes to the form. A second tranche of the land review is planned which will include consideration of the following: • extending the bright-line test to farmland and commercial properties; • extending Residential Land Withholding Tax to New Zealand residents; • reviewing the re-zoning rule; • reviewing the land tax frameworks; • considering the introduction of a vacant land tax; and • various compliance and administration matters. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The group of people potentially affected by tightening the rules are taxpayers who regularly buy land to be used mainly as a home or business premises and then sell that land. The proposed regulatory changes seek to clarify and support, rather than depart from, existing policy in the area by ensuring that the regular pattern restrictions apply to people who regularly buy and sell land to stop them escaping tax. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The Government announced in April 2019 that it would not be proceeding with a capital gains tax, but that other initiatives to improve the fairness of the tax system would be considered, including tightening the rules around land speculation and working on ways to counter land banking. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 65 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? This RIA deals with proposed regulatory changes to tighten the rules that relate to regular buying and selling of homes and business premises to ensure people cannot escape paying tax by relying on the exclusions where that was not intended. The proposals have arisen in the context of the review of the current land tax rules, to meet the Government’s objectives of improving the efficient use of land, and ensuring that tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourage and support productive investment. All options are assessed against the following criteria: a) Integrity of the tax system: the tax rules should operate so as to collect revenue where intended. b) Effectiveness: the tax rules should produce the right amount of tax at the right time; the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved. c) Fairness: the tax rules should not be arbitrary and should be fair to different taxpayers. d) Certainty and simplicity: the tax rules should be as clear and simple as possible so that taxpayers who attempt to comply with the rules are able to do so. Increasing the integrity of the tax system is a primary objective of these changes. However, it is necessary to balance this objective against ensuring that the rules are effective, fair and balanced, and that they provide certainty and simplicity for taxpayers. Group of persons or entities The current regular pattern restrictions apply when a single person (which includes a company, trust or other entity type) has a pattern of buying and selling. This limited application gives rise to a risk that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions by using other persons or entities to carry out each transaction, rather than carrying out multiple transactions on their own. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo, so the regular pattern restrictions continue to apply only to the actions of a single person. This option undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system because it allows taxpayers to structure around the rules to avoid tax. It also unfair as it benefits those taxpayers who are willing and able to structure around the rules. However, remaining with the status quo could be said to be a simpler option, and would avoid the need for more complex rules. Option 2: Extend the regular pattern restrictions to groups of people The second option is to expand the regular pattern restrictions to apply to groups of people, as follows: 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 66 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 7 IN CONFIDENCE • For the residential exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they all occupy all of the properties as their residence, or if the people who occupy all of the properties as their residences control the trusts or other entities that own the properties. • For the business premises exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they are all controlled by the same person or persons (e.g. all the companies have the same shareholders). This option will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. However, these changes will introduce further complexity to the rules. Similar activities The current regular pattern restrictions have been interpreted as only applying when there is a similarity or likeness in the transactions. There is a concern that this allows taxpayers to structure around the regular pattern restrictions by carrying out different activities on each piece of land so there is not sufficient similarity or likeness in the transactions. Option 1: Status quo The first option would be to maintain the status quo. This option undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system because it allows taxpayers to structure around the rules to avoid tax. It is also unfair as it benefits those taxpayers who are willing and able to structure around the rules. Option 2: Focus on regularity of transactions The second option is to amend the rules to capture patterns of buying and selling, with the focus being on the regularity of the transactions, rather than on the similarity or likeness of what is done on the land. This option will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. This option will reduce complexity and add clarity to the legislation by simplifying the factors that must be satisfied before the restriction will apply. Intention test The residential and business premises exclusions currently apply both: • when a person acquired land with a purpose or intention of disposal or for business involving land; and • for disposals of land within 10 years when a person is associated with a person who carries on a business involving land. Therefore, it is possible that the current regular pattern restrictions could result in a person who is associated with a land dealer being taxed on the sale of their home or business premises because they have been forced to move for family or business reasons several times over a couple of years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 67 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 8 IN CONFIDENCE It has been proposed by submitters that the regular pattern restrictions could be limited to situations where the land has been acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo and continue to apply the regular pattern restrictions to situations where a person is associated with a person in a business involving land. In the context of the other proposed amendments, this option has the potential to be unfair, because it risks capturing sales of genuine homes and business premises. The potential for unfairness undermines the integrity of the tax system, and heightens the risk of tax avoidance and evasion as taxpayers seek to escape a tax they consider unfair. However, retaining the status quo could be seen as being simpler as it applies the same rules to all taxpayers who are subject to the exclusions. Option 2: Introduction of intention test The second option is to limit the application of the regular pattern restrictions to situations where the owner of the land acquired it with an intention of disposal. This option improves the integrity of the tax system in that it helps to ensure the rules only operate to collect revenue where intended. It also improves the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by only taxing true revenue gains. The introduction of a further limitation will, however, add some complexity to the rules. Amending the business premises regular pattern restriction The business premises exclusion applies only where the owner of the land mainly uses the land to carry on a substantial business. Because the business premises exclusion is limited in this way, it has been suggested by submitters that it is already hard to structure around and does not require amendment to cover activities by a group of people. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo. This option is simple because it will not require complex grouping rules. However, this option risks allowing taxpayers to structure around the regular pattern restriction, which reduces the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system. It could also be argued that not amending the business premises exclusion if the residential and main home exclusions are amended (as proposed above) would be unfair in that it would allow those owning land for business purposes advantages over those owning land for residential purposes. Option 2: Amend the business premises regular pattern restriction The second option is to amend the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion to apply when a person, or a group of people or entities that are all controlled by a person or group of persons, regularly buy and sell land used as business premises. This option would improve the integrity, effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by ensuring that taxpayers cannot avoid tax by using separate entities to carry on buying and selling activities where those activities would be subject to tax if they were carried on by one 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 68 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 9 IN CONFIDENCE person alone. By doing so, it will better ensure that the right amount of revenue is collected over time. This option also improves clarity for taxpayers by clearly indicating activity that should be subject to tax. This option will, however, not be simpler because it will require relatively complex rules to capture the intended group of people or entities. Time-period rule The regular pattern restriction in the main home exclusion for the bright-line test is supplemented by a time-period rule, which states that the main home exclusion will not apply if a person has relied on it twice in the previous two years. This time-period does not appear in the residential and business premises exclusions. To attempt to provide clarity and objectivity, a similar time-period rule could be added to the residential and business premises exclusions. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo and have no time-period restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions. This option is simple but leaves uncertainty in the rules because the current rules are subjective making them harder to apply. However, this option is more likely to maintain the integrity of the tax system by ensuring that transactions would not be subject to tax simply due to volume. In doing so, it would also ensure that the rules are perceived to be fair. Option 2: Add time period restrictions The second option is to add time-period restrictions (i.e. the exclusions will not apply if they have been used twice in two years) to the residential and business premises exclusions. This option could add clarity to the rules because it would introduce an objective test to apply. However, introducing an extra provision decreases the simplicity of the rules. However, this option could reduce the integrity of the tax system as it risks taxing sales of genuine homes and business premises merely due to the level of transactions undertaken with no consideration given to the person’s intention. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 69 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 10 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Officials consider that the following amendments to the regular pattern restrictions are the best options to resolve the issue: Group of persons or entities Recommendation: Option 2 - Extend the regular pattern restrictions to groups of people The regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply to a person or a group of persons that undertake buying and selling activity together: • For the residential exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they all occupy all of the properties as their residence, or if the people who occupy all of the properties as their residences control the trusts or other entities that own the properties. • For the business premises exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they are all controlled by the same person or persons (e.g. all the companies have the same shareholders). This will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. Similar activities Recommendation: Option 2 - Focus on regularity of transactions The regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply more broadly to any pattern of buying and selling land used as a residence or business premises. It should not matter whether properties were simply bought and sold, or whether any building or renovation work occurred while the person owned the land. What should be relevant is that there are “regular” transactions (that is, the transactions occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals). This will ensure that the regular pattern restrictions are no longer restricted to applying only where there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This will increase the integrity of the tax system. Intention test Recommendation: Option 2 - Introduce intention test The regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions should be targeted so they only apply where the person acquired the land with an intention of disposal. Expanding the regular pattern restrictions gives rise to an increased risk that they could catch ordinary residential transactions that occur for family reasons, and small businesses who are upgrading as their business grows because the person is, or is associated with, a person in a business involving land. Officials consider that the regular pattern restrictions should be limited to ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land effectively as trading stock cannot use the home or business premise exclusions to escape tax. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 70 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 11 IN CONFIDENCE This option improves the integrity of the tax system in that it helps to ensure the rules only operate to collect revenue where intended. It also improves the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by only taxing true revenue gains. Amending the business premises regular pattern restriction Recommendation: Option 2 - Regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion should be amended The regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion should be amended to apply to activities by a group of people or entities. Under the current rules, a single person cannot escape tax by using land acquired as trading stock as a business premises while they hold it. This outcome should not be able to be structured around by using a group of entities controlled by a person. The proposed changes will ensure this is the case. The main concern raised by submitters appeared to be the concern of overreach. Officials consider that this risk is mitigated by limiting the regular pattern restrictions, so they only apply when land is acquired with an intention of resale. Time-period rule Recommendation: Option 1 - Status quo A time-period rule such as that included in the bright-line main home exclusion is not appropriate for the residential and business premises exclusions. In the context of the bright-line test, which taxes sales without consideration of intention, presuming the exclusion should not apply simply because there were multiple transactions within a defined period can be justified. However, regularity alone should not be enough to give rise to a taxable transaction under the other provisions. Instead, it is important that the owner also has an intention of disposal. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 71 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Impac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Taxpayers who regularly buy land, use it as a main home, residence or business premises and then sell it, structuring the transactions around the regular pattern restrictions as the legislation is currently drafted Will need to return the disposal of land for tax purposes.

Consultation document Officials issued a consultation document “Habitual buying and selling” in September 2019 setting out the issues and proposing possible solutions and asked for taxpayers’ views on the proposals. Prior to releasing the document publicly, officials also tested their thinking with some private sector advisors. Feedback In general, submitters appear to understand officials’ concerns that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions, and most supported changes in the area. However, almost all submitters expressed concerns about the potential for overreach from the proposed amendments and, in particular, that the amendments risk taxing transactions that should not be subject to tax (i.e. sales of genuine homes or business premises). Submitters also disagreed with proposals to amend the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion. They submitted there was no evidence of any abuse of that exclusion. Submitters could see that a time-period rule may be useful to supplement the regular pattern restriction in the residential exclusion. However, there was concern that a time-period rule would be arbitrary and could not accommodate factors outside a person’s control. Submitters’ views and concerns were taken into account by officials in forming the preferred views discussed above. In particular, officials addressed submitters’ concerns around overreach i.e. that the proposals risk taxing the sale of homes or business premises for genuine reasons. In response to those concerns, officials propose to target the regular pattern restrictions to situations where there is an intention of resale. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 73 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be included in the omnibus tax Bill scheduled to be introduced in early 2020. The changes should apply prospectively, i.e. only properties acquired and sold after the application date would be taxable. However, properties acquired before the application date would be able to be considered for the purposes of determining whether a taxpayer has a regular pattern. Inland Revenue will release details of the Cabinet decision once it is made and further detail will be provided in a commentary released when the Bill is introduced and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the rules. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 74 of 102 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sectio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue undertakes regular review of land transactions via its Property Compliance Programme (PCP), which is aimed at ensuring that those involved in property dealing or speculation pay their fair share of tax. Inland Revenue undertakes regular reporting to government as part of the PCP. Inland Revenue is also developing a Data Intelligence Platform (DIP) to enable right-time interaction and appropriate risk-based interventions, by identifying affected customers, understanding customer behaviours and needs, and highlighting areas of compliance focus as well as policy weakness, including how these matters relate to land. The DIP will be able to pull in relevant sources of data and can be used to identify certain types of customer groups, build customer profiles and understand the problem in a wider context. However, as with any other information system it will be dependent upon the personnel, data available and cases run in order to deliver its potential value. The DIP will continue to be developed to further refine Inland Revenue’s ability to target particular transactions including assisting Inland Revenue in monitoring whether the exclusions are operating as intended, and educating taxpayers on the matter as appropriate. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Inland Revenue would closely monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes as part of the PCP programme. The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. A post-implementation review could occur around two years after the tax year that the amendments first apply. Any recommended changes identified from the review would be considered for potential inclusion on the Government's tax policy work programme. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Page 75 of 102 Page 76 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue Secti o n 1: G en er al in fo rmati on Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Range of options considered A more long-term generic process or provision for handling severe adverse events and future biosecurity incursions affecting livestock has not been considered. Given the timeframe for addressing the current Mycoplasma bovis issue (taxpayers that are clients of tax agents with a valid extension of time are due to file tax returns for the 2018/19 income tax year by 31 March 2020) a specific solution is required as it would not be possible to fully consider a longer-term solution. Consultation Consultation has been focussed on discussing the issue and potential solutions with Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). Given the timeframe for addressing this issue other groups have not been consulted at this stage. Officials will consider whether other groups should also be consulted as we work through the detailed design of the proposal before legislation is introduced and at the select committee stage.

Overview Some farmers that have had their livestock culled owing to the Government’s attempts to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand have faced an unexpected and significant tax liability as a result. This tax liability may impede their ability to replace their culled herd and is contrary to a key principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person is made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. Background Mycoplasma bovis is a bacterium that can cause a range of serious conditions in cattle. The disease may be dormant in an animal – causing no symptoms at all. But in times of stress (for example, calving, drying-off, transporting, or being exposed to extreme weather), the animal may shed bacteria in milk and nasal secretions. As a result, other animals may be infected and become ill or carriers themselves. The presence of Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand was first detected in 2017. The Government, in partnership with the dairy and beef sectors, has decided to try to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand. As a result, Biosecurity New Zealand can require all the stock on a farm where Mycoplasma bovis has been found to be culled. In exchange, the Government pays compensation to the affected farmers for the difference between the normal market value of the stock and the amount received when the stock is slaughtered. This compensation is intended to leave farmers in no better or worse position than a person whose property is not directly affected by the exercise of the powers. To date, around 200 properties have been cleared of stock with a similar number being monitored for the presence of Mycoplasma bovis. These have been predominantly dairy farms although Mycoplasma bovis is increasingly being found on beef farms that acquired young stock from affected dairy farms before the disease was identified. Of the total 90,000 stock culled and compensated for by the end of January 2020, 52,000 were dairy cattle and 38,000 were beef cattle, with the bulk of the beef cattle being from fattening operations rather than breeding operations. 1 For income tax purposes livestock must be valued annually to establish its opening and closing values as part of determining the cost of sales. A farmer has the choice of several valuation options. Many use the national standard cost (NSC) scheme which values the animals at: • a standard cost (determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue), if the animal is homebred, for the respective age and type of animal that reflects average home breeding costs; or • at its purchase cost if the animal is purchased. 1 Fattening operations involve the growing of animals for meat. Such operations have much quicker turnover of stock than breeding operations as the stock will be slaughtered within 1-2 years. Conversely, breeding operations involve the rearing of animals for the ultimate replacement of existing herd animals and the sale of any excess. The quicker turnover of stock for fattening operations means the tax issue discussed in this impact summary is less significant for fattening operations. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 79 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 4 IN CONFIDENCE A few farmers also use the self-assessed cost scheme which involves farmers using their own farm costs rather than standard costs. Policy problem in detail When breeding livestock has been valued under either the NSC scheme or the self- assessed cost scheme, culling the herd can result in a significant and unexpected tax liability that can impede a farmer’s ability to restock their farm. This is because the compensation payments plus slaughter receipts are income, and there is no immediate comparable deduction in relation to the replacement stock to offset that income. The replacement stock value for NSC and self-assessed cost purposes is its purchase price and this stock value is only gradually written down (over the next five or so years) as the stock ages and is itself replaced from homebred animals. Although this is a tax timing issue, there are potential cash flow problems and interest costs for farmers in the meantime that can impede the recovery process. Simplified example Cow A with a market value of $1,500 is culled because of Mycoplasma bovis. The farmer receives $1,500 for the cow from a combination of compensation and slaughter receipts. For tax purposes, as cow A was valued under the NSC scheme at $700, there is taxable income of $800 from its cull. The $1,500 is used to buy replacement cow B. Under NSC, cow B is valued at its purchase price of $1,500. Cow B remains in the herd for five years before being slaughtered and is replaced by a cow bred up through the herd (cow C) which has a NSC of $700 (its homebred cost). There is a tax deduction of $800 at that point, being the difference between the cost of cow B and the cost of cow C. If there had been no Mycoplasma bovis cull, cow A would have remained in the herd and been replaced by the equivalent of cow C with no NSC implications given that both cow A and cow C have a NSC value of $700. As farmers will have a herd made up of different age cows that will be progressively slaughtered the single $800 deduction in this example will result in a deduction each year when considered on a whole of herd basis. For fattening stock valued under the NSC scheme or self-assessed cost scheme, the tax issue is less acute as the livestock turn-over much more regularly so that normal tax rules should apply. In that case, or when other valuation methods (such as the herd scheme) are used to value the herd, the income equalisation deposit scheme should provide sufficient flexibility to manage any tax issues. The income equalisation scheme enables the recognition of income to be deferred by up to five years if the income is deposited into the scheme. The income equalisation scheme will not provide sufficient flexibility to deal with the tax issues created by the culling of breeding animals that are valued under NSC or self-assessed cost because the deposit would need to be withdrawn to pay for replacement stock, at which point the income is recognised. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 80 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are farmers that use the NSC scheme or the self-assessed cost scheme to value their breeding stock on hand for tax purposes and have had their herds culled and replaced because of Mycoplasma bovis. Overall, possibly up to 50 farmers to date could have unexpected tax liabilities because they value their dairy and/or beef breeding animals under the NSC or self-assessed cost schemes. The impact is most severe for those with a high proportion of mixed-age cows as, under normal circumstances, they would be relying on holding those animals for several years and on using them to breed replacement stock. Sharemilkers would be particularly affected as their main asset is livestock. Since very few farmers use the self-assessed cost scheme, because of its complexity, it may be that none of the farmers affected by Mycoplasma bovis are using it. However, if they have there would be a sizeable tax liability as a result of the cull. Federated Farmers wrote to the Minister of Revenue in December 2019 asking for this issue to be addressed. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) also supports the proposals. 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? A core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 is that no person should be any better or worse off because of the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. The objective of the proposal is to ensure that farmers are not made worse off because of a tax liability arising from the culling of Mycoplasma bovis infected livestock. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 81 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 3: O p ti on s id en ti fi cati o n 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Equity – the option should result in farmers using the NSC or self-assessed cost scheme not being made worse off as a result of their herds being culled or better off than farmers who have used other valuation methods. • Timeliness – the option should be able to be enacted as soon as possible to provide certainty to farmers with culled and replaced herds • Compliance and administration costs – the option should be as simple as possible. Option 1: No law change (Status quo) The status quo would not be an equitable option as farmers using the NSC scheme would face a significant and unexpected tax liability owing to their herds being culled because of the presence of Mycoplasma bovis. This is contrary to the principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person should be made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that act. Option 2: Spreading the additional income (preferred option) Under this option, the additional taxable income arising from culling and replacing a herd would be able to be spread evenly over subsequent income years. This would allow the income to be offset each year by the increased deductions arising from the reducing cost of the stock on hand. The ideal length of this spread for farmers would be between 5 and 7 years depending on the profile of their herds. Therefore, for simplicity the length of the spread would be 6 years, starting from the income year after the income originally arose. Certain requirements would need to be met for the income to be spread: • The business would need to be subject to Biosecurity Security New Zealand requiring a cull of Mycoplasma bovis affected stock. • Stock would need to be substantially replaced with equivalent stock within a reasonable timeframe, say twelve months. Farmers that choose not to replace their stock after a cull are in a similar position to a farmer that sells their stock to exit the industry. • The business would need to be a dairy or a beef breeding operation, with the breeding stock valued under the NSC or self-assessed cost schemes. • Only the income derived from the culling of the breeding stock valued under the NSC or the self-assessed cost schemes could be spread. Income derived from culling fattening stock would not be able to be spread as the tax issue is less acute owing to the more frequent turnover of stock. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 82 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 7 IN CONFIDENCE • The replacement stock must continue to be valued using, as relevant, NSC or self-assessed cost. This is to ensure that farmers cannot enter the herd scheme on more advantageous terms than those not affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Analysis of option This option increases equity as it would ensure affected farmers do not suffer from an unexpected tax burden and associated cash flow issues. This is consistent with the core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person should be made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that act. This option would also be a more timely solution to the problem as it could be announced by the Minister of Revenue prior to the 31 March 2020 due date for 2018/19 income tax returns for clients of tax agents with a valid extension of time. This will help to provide certainty to farmers and their tax advisers. This option is not expected to have a significant impact on compliance costs for affected farmers. Farmers intending to spread the additional income will be required to advise Inland Revenue when filing their returns so that their files can be manually adjusted. Given the relatively low number of affected farmers, the costs associated with administering this option for Inland Revenue should be minimal and could be absorbed within existing baselines. Option 3: Offset the taxable income against the cost of replacement stock This option would involve offsetting the taxable income against the cost of the replacement livestock, which would essentially write down the purchase price to what the NSC would have been had the incident not occurred. While this option would conceptually achieve the desired outcome, it would be complex to achieve in practice as it would require an exact matching of the culled stock with the replacement stock, and rules about adjustments where that did not arise. Therefore, this option was not preferred as the option of spreading the income evenly over a number of income years is simpler. Option 4: Amending the income equalisation scheme This option would involve enabling deposits made in relation to Mycoplasma bovis to be withdrawn from the income equalisation scheme without being treated as income. This option would compromise the integrity of the scheme and is, therefore, not preferred. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 83 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is spreading the additional income arising from culling and replacing a herd affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Spreading the income over the six subsequent income years offsets the income against the expected increased deductions, in effect leaving the farmer in a similar position to if no unexpected income had arisen. This is the proposed approach as it is the only option that can be implemented in a timely manner and is consistent with the principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no one is made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. The proposed approach is compatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 84 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 4: I mp ac t An al ysi s (Pr o po sed ap p r o ach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits NB.

No other impacts have been identified from the proposed option. Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) will continue to be consulted on the detailed design of the proposal to ensure there are no unintended impacts. Secti o n 5: Sta keh o ld er vi ew s 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? This issue was raised by Federated Farmers in a letter sent to the Minister of Revenue in December 2019. Since then officials have worked with Federated Farmers and CA ANZ on developing a solution to the issue. Federated Farmers and CA ANZ both consider that an immediate solution is required and support the proposed income spreading option. Officials, CA ANZ and Federated Farmers have established a working team to work through the detailed detail of the proposed spreading option. Given the urgent timeline for addressing this issue the focus has been on consulting with Federated Farmers and CA ANZ. However, officials will consider whether other groups should also be consulted as we work through the detailed design before legislation is introduced and at the select committee stage. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 86 of 102 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 6: I mpl em en tati o n an d op er ati o n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposal will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments would be included in a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to an omnibus taxation Bill scheduled to be introduced in April 2020. The SOP would be released at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage in time for submissions to be made on the proposed amendments. Guidance material will be published on the amendments following the Bill’s enactment. Following Cabinet approving the proposed option the Minister of Revenue will issue a press release advising of Cabinet’s decision and the process for affected 2018/19 returns due by 31 March 2020. This will help to provide certainty for farmers and their tax advisers. Already filed returns Although the bulk of the impact to date will be in relation to 2018/19 income tax, as the culls began in late 2017, this option would be backdated to include the effects of the cull in the 2017/18 income year. Affected farmers who have already filed returns for 2017/18 or 2018/19 would have the option of applying the spread retrospectively and having their returns reassessed. However, some may instead choose to leave their returns as is as there may be some impact on farmers social assistance entitlements and liabilities if the additional income is now spread. For this to be effective, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have to be allowed to make associated adjustments to the farmers’ tax positions. Secti o n 7: M o ni tori n g, eval uati o n an d r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. This will be facilitated by farmers who choose to spread their additional income being required to advise Inland Revenue of their intention to do so. The proposed option has been developed alongside Federated Farmers and CA ANZ. Officials expect that, once the proposals are enacted, these two groups will raise any concerns affected farmers are having with the rules in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result would be recommended for addition to the Government’s tax policy work programme. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1 above. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Page 87 of 102 Page 88 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 1 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Supplementary Analysis Report (SAR), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. The purp ose of this report is to explain the policy rationale and development behind the “purchase price allocation” proposal contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, as a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was not required for the proposal. It is a modified version of the approach set out in an officials’ issues paper – Purchase price allocation – which was released for public consultation in December 2019 with Cabinet’s approval. The i ssues paper functioned as an interim RIA when it was considered by Cabinet and a final RIA was not required as policy decisions were made by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue under delegated authority from Cabinet. Therefore, this SAR has been produced to improve transparency and understanding of the policy as the amendments go through the legislative process. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis A limitation on the analysis is the absence of precedent for the proposed approach in foreign jurisdictions. However, t here is one instance of the approach in current New Zealand statute, and it appears to have worked without problem for many decades. Officials are confident that the approach will achieve the desired outcome, acknowledging that aside from the aforementioned instance, it is untried and therefore less certain. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Casey Plunket Special Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 27 May 2020 7 Page 89 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 2 To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Purchase Price Allocation Supplementary Analysis Report prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Supplementary Analysis Report meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of this draft have been incorporated into the final version. Although this SAR will not be presented to Cabinet it has still been reviewed consistent with the quality assurance framework. Page 90 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? When business assets are bought or sold, they may be subject to different tax treatments. Some assets, such as land or goodwill 1 , are generally held on capital account and are not taxable or deductible. Other assets, such as trading stock 2 and financial arrangements 3 , are held on revenue account and are both taxable and immediately deductible. Still other assets – capital assets that are expected to decline in value over time (‘depreciable property’) – are only deductible over a number of years, in line with their estimated useful lives (if the asset is sold for more than its depreciated value, the excess deductions are clawed back as taxable income). Parties to a sale of two or more assets with different tax treatments (a ‘mixed supply’) are required to allocate the total sale/purchase price between the various assets for tax purposes. The allocation determines the vendor’s tax liability from the sale, and the purchaser’s cost base for claiming deductions in the future. To correctly account for the business going forward, the owner must maintain a schedule for any depreciable assets – which have different depreciation rates – and a register of all the other assets, some of which may be bought or sold separately. The policy problem is that currently, vendors and purchasers are able to adopt different price allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities, resulting in an overall loss to the revenue base. Moreover, in a small number of cases, parties have been found to adopt different allocations in their tax returns despite having agreed an allocation during the sale process. The problem stems from the existing legal framework governing purchase price allocation. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, parties are generally required to ascribe market values to the assets transferred. But market value is a range rather than a single value and the parties are not required to use the same market values, other than for trading stock (the specific instance alluded to earlier where a rule akin to the proposed approach – discussed in the next section – is already used). There is also some doubt about how the law applies to a purchaser of depreciable property. Consequently, the vendor can allocate lower amounts to depreciable property and financial arrangements, which are taxable, and higher amounts to non-taxable capital assets, to reduce its tax liability, while the purchaser can allocate higher amounts to depreciable property and financial arrangements in order to maximise its deductions over time. Since the law does not require consistency, it is difficult f or the Commissioner to challenge different allocations that are both based on market values, despite the result being a loss to the tax base. Investigations undertaken by Inland Revenue into a number of large commercial property transactions have revealed discrepancies between vendor and purchaser allocations resulting in overall revenue losses in the millions of dollars. Given the cost and uncertainty of disputes, these losses are often unable to be eliminated. If the status quo continues, such outcomes are likely to recur. 1 Any excess of the total sale price above the aggregate value of all the assets being sold, attributable to the established reputation of the business. 2 Items bought and sold regularly in the course of a business, such as books in a bookstore. 3 Arrangements under which a person receives money in exchange for providing money at a future time, such as loans. Page 91 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 4 Officials do not consider these discrepancies to be justifiable. In a normal commercial transaction, the vendor and purchaser will take different views of the value of an asset. The vendor will not sell the asset unless it thinks the asset is worth less than the purchaser is willing to pay for it, and the purchaser will not buy the asset unless it thinks the opposite. But the asset is sold and bought for a single price, and that price is the amount taken into account in the tax returns for both parties. There is no obvious reason to depart from this “single price” principle where multiple assets are sold together. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The purchase price allocation amendments affect vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies – particularly those that do not agree an allocation under current law. Compliant parties to a sale are generally not opposed to alignment between sale and purchase prices but often do not support structured rules that increase compliance costs. 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? The policy objective is to prevent revenue loss arising in mixed supplies – i.e. promote “revenue integrity” – while keeping any additional compliance and administration costs and disruption to natural commercial dynamics as small as possible. Since the only way to prevent revenue loss is for the vendor and purchaser to use the same purchase price allocation, the objective of revenue integrity can also be represented as “consistency”. Page 92 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? • Option 1 – Status quo • Option 2 – Party allocation (vendor first) • Option 3 – Commissioner allocation • Option 4 – Operational approach Options 2 and 3 are the main legislative approaches considered by officials, and relate to how an allocation is made if the vendor and purchaser do not reach an agreement between themselves. Officials have always considered that if the parties agree an allocation, they should not be able to adopt separate, more favourable allocations in their tax returns. Officials have also been of the view that the allocation should always be based on relative market values (market values proportionate to the total purchase price) – in line with the current law – and that t he Commissioner should be able to challenge an allocation that she considers is not so based. Other elements that did not differ between options 2 and 3 during policy development were: • Granularity of allocation: parties should not be required to agree an allocation to every individual asset, but rather asset categories with unique tax treatments – e.g. depreciable property, buildings, land, revenue account property etc. While this may leave some scope for arbitrage between different write- down rates for depreciable property, for example, the compliance cost of working out and agreeing a value for every single asset might be unrealistic for many taxpayers. • Notification of allocation: parties should be required to notify the Commissioner if they have not agreed an allocation. • De minimis: transactions falling below certain value thresholds should not be subject to the consistency requirement for purchase price allocation, as the scope for tax manipulation is not great enough to present a material risk to the revenue base. The thresholds should be a total purchase price of $1 million, or an allocation to taxable property by the purchaser of $100,000. Option 4 is the operational approach generally favoured by stakeholders. The criteria against which the options were assessed are: - Compliance costs: compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised. - Administration costs: administration costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised. - Neutrality: the tax rules should not distort economic outcomes by incentivising business behaviours that do not make commercial sense, and are only adopted for tax reasons. They should not advantage one party over another. Page 93 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 6 Option 1 – Status quo Vendors and purchasers can continue either to agree an allocation or to make their own separate allocations. The Commissioner can challenge allocations that she considers are not at market, but cannot require parties to adopt the same allocation. Revenue would continue to be lost where vendors and purchasers adopt separate allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities. Pros Parties would not have to change their behaviour, therefore compliance costs would be low. Cons There would likely be an ongoing substantial loss of revenue, meaning the objective of revenue integrity/consistency would not be achieved. Inland Revenue would continue to incur the administration costs associated with identifying inconsistent allocations through audit, and attempting to resolve inconsistencies without a legal basis to require resolution. Moreover, the status quo is not economically neutral, because parties adopting different allocations are relying on an effective subsidy from the revenue base to support their commercial transaction, when the transaction should stand on its own. Option 2 – Party allocation (vendor first) If the vendor and purchaser do not agree an allocation, they must step through a short sequence of rules that allow one of the parties to determine the allocation. For two months after transfer of the property, the vendor is required to determine the allocation, and must notify the purchaser and the Commissioner of it. However, the vendor cannot allocate amounts to taxable property that result in an additional loss on the sale of that property (other than for part year depreciation). 4 If the vendor fails to notify an allocation within the two-month window, the purchaser must determine the allocation, and notify the vendor and Commissioner of it. Whether the vendor or the purchaser determines the allocation, both parties must follow it in their tax returns. The allocation must be at market, and the Commissioner can challenge the allocation if she considers that it is not. If neither party notifies an allocation, the vendor is treated as disposing of the assets for market value, and the purchaser is treated as acquiring the assets for nil consideration. The effect of this is that the purchaser is unable to claim any deductions in relation to the property until it has made an allocation. This incentivises the purchaser to make and notify an allocation, which is key to achieving consistency. 4 The vendor will not be able to satisfy this rule if the total purchase price is lower than the vendor’s aggregate carrying cost of the taxable property . In this case, therefore, the minimum allocation to taxable property will be its carrying value reduced (pro rata) in proportion to the difference between the aggregate carrying cost of the taxable property and the purchase price. Page 94 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 7 Pros This option achieves the objective of revenue integrity/consistency by driving parties towards using a single allocation. It has low administration costs, as it is the parties who must allocate, not the Commissioner. Importantly, the parties will have much better knowledge of the transaction and the assets in it than the Commissioner, and are therefore better placed to make the allocation. Cons This option appears less neutral between the vendor and purchaser, as it allows the vendor to determine the allocation in the first instance. This may be perceived as unfair by some purchasers, or may be an additional source of tension in the negotiations, which could mean increased compliance costs. However, as the purchaser will be aware of the rule when negotiating the sale, an unfavourable or undisclosed vendor allocation could be answered by a reduced purchase price. Moreover, the vendor is constrained by not being able to allocate amounts to taxable property that would result in an additional loss. Option 3 – Commissioner allocation If the vendor and purchaser do not agree an allocation, they must request an allocation from the Commissioner. The Commissioner may choose the vendor’s allocation, the purchaser’s allocation, or any other allocation within a market value range. Both parties must then follow that allocation in their tax returns. The Commissioner’s allocation cannot be challenged. The Commissioner may or may not decide to seek an external valuation to determine the allocation. Pros This option ensures revenue integrity/consistency by driving parties towards using a single allocation. It has low compliance costs, because if the parties cannot agree, it is the Commissioner who determines the allocation. The uncertainty of what the Commissioner will decide to allocate also provides a strong incentive for both parties to reach an agreement between themselves. Since neither party is given the opportunity to allocate before the other, this option is relatively neutral in its impact on the commercial dynamic. Cons The administration costs of this option could be high. The Commissioner has to dedicate resources to making an allocation every time parties fail to agree one. To avoid costly disputes, the Commissioner’s allocation has to be unchallengeable, but this is likely to be seen as unfair by aggrieved parties – particularly if the Commissioner’s position is not supported by an independent valuation. This might lead to attempts to chall enge an allocation regardless of any legal provisions, for example through judicial review. Option 4 – Operational approach The vendor and purchaser can continue either to agree an allocation or to make their own separate allocations. In the latter case, the parties are required to notify the Commissioner that they have not agreed, and to provide both the Commissioner and the other party with Page 95 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 8 copies of their respective allocations. Penalties will apply to parties who are found not to have complied with this requirement. If the Commissioner takes issue with one or both of the parties’ allocations, she can enter into a dispute with both parties simultaneously, leveraging the associated costs as an incentive for the parties to agree an allocation. The Commissioner will issue clear guidance to the effect that vendors and purchasers should agree a purchase price allocation or risk a dispute with the Commissioner. She will also clarify the existing legislative provisions governing allocations. There will be no other changes to the legislation. Pros This approach may be seen as more subtle and targeted at the concern area – a relatively small number of large transactions where there is deliberate and substantial tax planning. It may seem fairer to vendors and purchasers than enforced legislative rules, and more neutral on transactions. Cons The Commissioner cannot require the desired outcome of consistency, because there is no legal basis for her to do so. Parties may be deterred by the costs of dispute, but they may not, and then an operational approach is ineffective at resolving the revenue risk. The Commissioner has failed to achieve consistency in a number of real disputes, and it is unlikely that this would change simply through administrative guidance. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 2. Officials consider that it is the best option on balance, for the reasons outlined below. Legal foundation Option 2 provides a strong legal requirement for consistency, which does not currently exist. This enables the Commissioner to mandate consistency, not merely expect it. While the operational approach (option 4) may be seen as less intrusive, it is also likely not to lead to the desired outcome in some cases. Expertise Where the parties do not agree an allocation, it is better to keep the responsibility to allocate with the parties rather than transfer it to the Commissioner, because the parties are directly engaged in the transaction and have a much better understanding of the assets being sold, and their value. The Commissioner is detached from the transaction, has no particular valuation expertise, and is largely indifferent to what allocation is chosen provided it is a single allocation and is tethered to market values. An allocation determined by the Commissioner will be seen as at least as arbitrary – if not more arbitrary – than an allocation chosen by the vendor or the purchaser, and to avoid the possibility of costly disputes that would ultimately have to be funded by the Government, the Commissioner’s Page 96 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 9 determination has to be unchallengeable. Stakeholder feedback has indicated that this would not be popular. Neutrality The main criticism of the proposed approach is that it favours the vendor, since, if the parties do not agree an allocation before filing their returns, the vendor is given the power to determine it first. Thus, the vendor is not incentivised to agree an allocation, and the rules disrupt the neutrality of the commercial dynamic. However, officials consider that this concern is overstated for the reasons outlined below. In the first place, if the allocation is important to the purchaser, the purchaser can insist on agreeing the allocation with the vendor as a condition of the deal. If the vendor is not prepared to agree the allocation, the purchaser may either refuse to go ahead with the transaction, or lower its price. These strategies operate as a counterbala nce to the vendor’s perceived advantage. Even if the vendor gets the opportunity to determine the allocation, it is constrained by not being able to allocate amounts to taxable property that result in an additional loss. This means that the purchaser’s cost basis for claiming deductions in the future cannot be lower than the vendor’s basis would have been had the transaction not occurred. It also means that if the vendor considers the value of taxable property to be lower than its current carrying value, it is incentivised to agree an allocation with the purchaser to avoid paying more tax on the transaction than it thinks is appropriate. Thus, the ability for the vendor to determine the allocation is only advantageous if it thinks the taxable property is worth more than its carrying value. Probabilistically, it seems reasonable to assume this might only be the case half of the time. Finally, the Commissioner can challenge an allocation that she considers is not based on market values. If the amounts allocated by the vendor to taxable property are unjustifiably low (even taking into account the aforementioned constraint), and the transaction is sufficiently large, the Commissioner may intervene and substitute an allocation that is more favourable to the purchaser. Awareness of the rules Another related concern with the proposed approach is that parties may not turn their minds to the tax implications of the transaction until after the sale and purchase is completed, and then the vendor has the power to allocate. This may occur in multiple bid scenarios, or where parties are distressed. If parties neglect to consider tax until filing their returns, then the result will be either that the purchaser must settle for the vendor’s market values or the vendor for the purchaser’s, if more than two months have elapsed since the property was transferred. However, officials consider that this is unlikely to occur if the parties are well advised and the rules are signalled so that taxpayers and advisors are aware of them. Officials anticipate that taxpayers will adapt sale and purchase practices to ensure there is sufficient time for an allocation to be agreed before the transaction is completed. Moreover, for the reasons given in the previous section, officials do not think purchasers will be significantly disadvantaged by a vendor-determined allocation.

Other parties Total Monetised Benefit Estimated $154 million over forecast period Non-monetised benefits Medium Page 98 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 11 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Some sale and purchase transactions may take longer as a result of a single allocation having to be used. This may place more pressure on some purchasers in multi-bid deals where there is competition with foreign purchasers that are not subject to the consistency rule. Officials note, however, that purchasers from different jurisdictions may be on an unequal footing already for a variety of reasons that are unrelated to purchase price allocation. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Officials engaged in targeted consultation with the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG), Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and Russell McVeagh, and an official’s issues paper – Purchase price allocation – was released for public consultation in December 2019. S ubmissions on the issues paper were received from the above stakeholders as well as Business NZ, Bell Gully, the New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax, Chapman Tripp, and EY. Almost all stakeholders support the proposition that parties to a mixed supply should adopt the same purchase price allocation. A number of advisors have noted that they always advise their clients to agree an alloc ation, as it is considered best practice from a tax perspective. However, clients do not always follow this advice. A few stakeholders disagree with the central premise that parties should always be required to agree on the value ascribed to an asset, as parties could legitimately take different views of its value (officials acknowledge this reality but do not think it is a valid reason to treat the asset as being sold for two different values for tax purposes). Nearly all stakeholders disagreed with the proposals set out in the issues paper for legislative reform. Many felt that legislative measures were unnecessary or overly burdensome, and that the policy objectives could instead be achieved operationally through better enforcement of the existing law and the publication of additional guidance for businesses on price allocations. The strongest concern expressed by most stakeholders was that the approach set out in the issues paper gave too much power to the vendor, by allowing the vendor to determine the allocation if the parties could not reach agreement. Stakeholders were not convinced that the purchaser would always have the negotiating power to insist that the vendor agree an allocation with it, or that the parties would always turn their minds to tax during the negotiation, and once the transaction was completed, the purchaser would have no recourse. In response to these concerns, officials made a significant modification to the proposal: the vendor cannot allocate amounts to taxable property (depreciable property, revenue Page 99 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 12 account property, financial arrangements) that result in an additional loss on that property. Therefore, the vendor cannot, for example, allocate to an item of depreciable property an amount that is less than its adjusted tax value. This constraint protects the purchaser from an unreasonably low vendor allocation that may not be challenged by the Commissioner. It also means that the purchaser cannot end up with a lower cost basis for deductions than the vendor would have had if the transaction had not occurred. This enhances the neutrality of the rules. The modification went some way to allaying stakeholder concerns, but stakeholders are still in disagreement with the proposals. The majority are of the view that legislation is unnecessary, and thus would not agree with the amendments in any form. Officials explored the possibility of an operational solution early on, but determined that it would not be effective, as ultimately the Commissioner would have no legal basis on which to require the desired outcome of revenue integrity/consistency. Parties might choose to agree an allocation, but that is the case under the status quo, and the lack of an obligation for them to do so is the problem perpetuating the loss of revenue. Page 100 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 13 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The new rules will be legislated via the Taxation (Annual Rates 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, and will apply to agreements for the disposal and acquisition of property entered into on or after 1 April 2021. In conjunction with the enactment of the legislation, Inland Revenue will publish guidance on the new rules so that taxpayers and advisors are aware of them and have time to prepare. Officials note that the basic requirement for parties to make a purchase price allocation is not new, so a long lead-in period is not necessary. For vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies that agree an allocation, nothing will be different, other than that they will now be obliged under income tax law to follow the agreed allocation in their tax returns (which happens in almost all cases in any event). For parties that do not agree an allocation before filing their returns, but determine that the transaction falls below at least one of the two de minimis thresholds – a $1 million transaction value or a $100,000 allocation to taxable property by the purchaser – nothing will be different. Officials envisage that these thresholds will exclude many rental property sales (as residential buildings cannot be depreciated by the purchaser and are therefore not counted towards the taxable property threshold), as well as some small business sales. Where parties do not agree an allocation and both de minimis thresholds are exceeded, whichever party unilaterally allocates under the new rules will have to notify both the other party and the Commissioner of its allocation. This will tell the other party what values it must use to complete its tax return, and will give the Commissioner visibility of the allocation, so that she is in a position to ensure the other party follows it, and to challenge it if necessary. The notification procedures are set out in section 14 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Compliance with the new rules will be monitored through routine audit and through evaluation of any allocations notified to the Commissioner by the parties. Overall, implementation risks are low, provided the rules are well-signalled, as they are intended to be. Page 101 of 102 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 14 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Officials will engage with the tax advisory community and Inland Revenue investigators again when the rules are in force to seek feedback on how the rules are working for vendors and purchasers. Officials considered requiring all vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies to notify the Commissioner of their allocation, regardless of whether they agreed the allocation or not, however this would increase compliance costs for taxpayers and officials expect the monitoring methods outlined above to be sufficient. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community, and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if needed. Page 102 of 102
Impact Statement T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Coversheet: Child support Business Transformation Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought Approve proposed amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 intended to improve the administration of the scheme and incentivise compliance and payments Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Su mma r y : Pr o ble m a n d Pr o po se d Ap pr o ac h Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation (BT) programme to modernise the tax system, the child support scheme will move to new systems and processes in April 2021. Some aspects of the current child support scheme are overly prescriptive and do not support engagement and compliance with the scheme as well as they could do. The BT change provides an opportunity to make legislative changes to improve administration, make the rules fairer, less complex and more flexible, thereby improving compliance (particularly for liable parents) with the scheme which in turn supports improvements to the welfare of children. If policy changes to simplify the legislation are not made now, the existing complexity of the current legislation will need to be built into the new system. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposals are to: • change the penalty rules – including introducing a penalty grace period for people newly liable, or returning to the scheme; • introduce compulsory employer deductions from salary and wages for newly liable parents; • put a time limit of four years on retrospective reassessments; • change the definition of “income”; and • make a number of minor and technical amendments, including working with customers in unusual circumstances. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Taken together, the proposals will make the rules fairer and less complex. This should improve engagement and compliance with the scheme which would in turn support improvements to the welfare of children. They will allow Inland Revenue to work better with parents to help prevent debt occurring in the first place. Sec tio n B: Su mma r y Imp a c ts : Be ne fits a n d c o s ts Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The beneficiaries of the proposals are parents, carers and children in the child support scheme. As at 31 May 2019 the child support customer base was made up of: • 164,000 liable parents (including 29,700 with debt only); • 135,500 receiving carers; and • 182,800 children. The proposals are expected to simplify parts of the scheme and make it fairer which should better incentivise and improve compliance of liable parents. This improves payment certainty and timeliness for receiving carers which contributes to the welfare of their children. Where do the costs fall? The costs of administering the child support scheme fall on Inland Revenue. There is the potential for increased costs on employers as a result of the compulsory deduction proposal for newly liable parents. However, employers are already required to deduct in cases when the liable parent has chosen employer deduction as a payment method or has defaulted on a payment. Accordingly, this proposal should only result in a marginal increase in costs for employers who do not currently deduct child support, or for those employers for whom the proposal increases the number of employees that they must make deductions for. Over time we estimate an additional 3,800 employers will be asked to make child support deductions. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Some people may not respond as expected to the penalty measures and levels of compliance could reduce. This can be mitigated by use of customer education and existing enforcement provisions, the proposed introduction of compulsory deductions for newly liable parents and improved information made available through Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposals are compatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n C: Ev id e nc e c er ta in ty a n d q u ality a ss u ra n ce Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue has a medium–high level of confidence in the evidence base. The key uncertainty is the impact of the penalty proposals on customer behaviour which cannot be modelled. However, literature suggests that measures designed to be fairer are more likely to lead to better compliance outcomes. Research Inland Revenue conducted with child support liable and receiving carers 1 indicated that penalties had a role to play in encouraging compliance but that the overly punitive nature of the current penalties and the complexity of the penalty rules acted as a barrier to compliance. Inland Revenue collects data relating to numbers of liable parents, compliance levels, debt and penalties imposed. This data has been used to estimate the potential direct impacts of the penalty proposals, compulsory deductions for employers, the effect of the time bar proposal and the change that the income definition could have. Some of the administrative data is manually input and therefore subject to errors however their impact should be relatively minor and would not change the “dollar” value of the impacts. The data relating to interest and dividends (which is relevant to the proposal to change the definition of income) is being sourced from Inland Revenue’s new system START and it is the first period that this income has been provided. While every effort has been made to ensure it is complete, there is no benchmark to compare to and it is likely some data is missing given the newness of these rules. Currently, all dividend information is sourced from records provided by parents. It will become compulsory for third parties to provide this information from 1 April 2020 which should improve the data from that point onwards. We are unable to identify the impacts of some of the more minor and technical amendments - such as allowing overseas liable parents to apply for prisoner exemptions. However, we consider that these changes will affect few customers and will help to make the child support rules fairer. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Child support Business Transformation Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the quality assurance criteria. 1 The research consisted of 27 one-on-one interviews around the country. The interviewees were a mix of liable parents and receiving carers, and a mix of levels of income including beneficiaries. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Statement: Child support Business Transformation Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated.

The scope of the programme was predominately focussed on changes to improve the overall administration of the New Zealand tax and social policy systems by reducing compliance and administrative costs rather than any fundamental policy shifts. A time constraint exists to implement the recommended options because the opportunity to progress any changes is provided by Inland Revenue’s BT programme which sees child support move from the current system (FIRST) to the new system (START) in April 2021. If policy changes to the child support administrative rules are not made in time for the roll-out of START, the complexity of the existing administrative rules would need to be incorporated into the design of START. Extensive public consultation took place on the main proposals in this Regulatory Impact Assessment with the exception of the proposal to introduce a time bar for reassessing past years, and the specific penalties proposals relating to the penalty changes. Research was conducted with a small number of liable parents and receiving carers to gauge their attitudes towards the penalty rules and how they see penalties affecting compliance. The problems around the current policy that reassessments can happen at any time for any year was identified more recently. Due to time constraints, consultation on the proposal to introduce a child support time bar was limited to interest groups rather than parents and carers. Some of the minor or technical changes were not consulted on due to their minor nature. However, the use of discretion for those in unusual circumstances was included in the 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy. The data used to analyse reassessments in relation to the time bar proposal are liable parent-centric and identify impacts specifically on liable parents (although this means the opposite impact occurs for the receiving carer). Also, some of the administrative data is manually input and therefore subject to errors. However, this impact should be relatively minor and would not change the “dollar” value of the impacts. The income data relating to interest and dividends has been sourced from Inland Revenue’s new system START and it is the first period that this income has been provided.

Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme is modernising New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. Child support is part of release 5 2 of BT which provides an opportunity to review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. The Government is concerned with improving the welfare of children and minimising the impact of government agency debt on New Zealanders. The child support scheme works to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Inland Revenue assesses, collects and disburses payments. As part of the assessment process Inland Revenue will identify the liable parent (the parent responsible for making the child support payment) and the receiving carer (the parent (or other carer) entitled to receive the child support payment). When a liable parent does not pay or pay on time they are charged initial late payment penalties and continue to be penalised each month until they pay or come to an arrangement to pay the outstanding amount. The financial burden when a liable parent does not pay falls on the receiving carers and their children. Aspects of the current penalty rules unreasonably penalise parents. Child support debt is significant at $2.2 billion dollars 3 with penalties making up a large portion – 75%. Changes introduced to penalties and write-offs in 2015 have slowed the growth of child support debt but primarily through write-offs and reducing penalty charges rather than addressing debt prevention. Liable parents’ compliance in their first three months of liability is very low – less than 30% pay on time as they adjust to being required to make payments. Liable parents are proportionately over-penalised by a $5 penalty rule that requires the 2% initial penalty for defaulting on payment to be a minimum of $5. This rule affects any liable parent with a monthly obligation of less than $226, which means it particularly affects liable parents on lower incomes. The minimum monthly child support assessment is $78. Penalty debt is 97% impaired (when imposed) meaning it is largely not expected to be collected. Write-offs have been successful as an incentive to get some parents to re-engage with the scheme but are not effective at preventing debt. Some liable parents are concerned that the rules do not encourage them to comply with their child support payments and at times could promote non-compliance. This is because the rules are complex, can penalise parents unreasonably, and in some cases create uncertainty for all parties (including Inland Revenue). Receiving carers are most concerned about the 2 BT is being progressively rolled out over each tax and social policy type. Release 5 is scheduled for April 2021. 3 Includes liable parent, receiving carer, and employer debt. Liable parent debt arises from payments by the liable parent to the receiving carer being made late, or not being paid. Receiving carer debt arises from overpayments to the receiving carer. Employer debt arises when the employer has deducted a child support payment from a liable parent’s wages or salary but has not passed the payment on to Inland Revenue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE non-payment of child support as it impacts on their ability to support their children. There are some unintended or inequitable outcomes as a result of some of the rules in the scheme. For example, because the rules do not cater for some complex family arrangements a liable parent may be assessed to pay more than they should be. These outcomes can contribute to a liable parent’s willingness to engage with the scheme and therefore lead to non-compliance. If the current rules were left in place reliance would solely be placed on operational improvements that may be provided through BT. However, the policy problems outlined above would largely remain and improvements to child support compliance and engagement may not be achieved. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? Child Support Act 1991 The New Zealand administrative child support scheme has been in place since July 1992. The key feature of the regulatory system is to assess, collect and disburse child support in accordance with the Child Support Act 1991. The key objective of child support is to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Any parent or carer can make an application for a child support assessment. 4 Using a formula that is legislated for under the Act, Inland Revenue assesses which parent is liable for a child support payment (the liable parent) and which parent will receive child support payments (the receiving carer), and the amount to be paid by the liable parent. This formula includes components such as the income of each parent, the age of the child, and how much care of the child each parent does. Changes were made in the child support reforms (effective 1 April 2015) to modernise the scheme and improve fairness, primarily through changes to the formula assessment and by assessing the income and other circumstances of both parents (rather than just the liable parent). Once Inland Revenue has determined who the liable parent is, the liable parent must make the child support payment to Inland Revenue. Child support payments are due to Inland Revenue monthly. Inland Revenue then passes the payment on to the receiving parent. When payments are not made, or not made on time, the financial burden generally falls on carers and their children. 5 Penalties and other tools (such as contact by Inland Revenue and compulsory deductions for defaulting liable parents) are used by Inland Revenue to encourage compliance. 4 For parents receiving a sole parent rate of benefit from the Ministry of Social Development the scheme is mandatory, and they must apply for a child support assessment against the child’s other parent. Child support payments are used to offset the cost of benefits paid. 5 Or if the receiving parent is on a sole parent benefit, there is an impact on Government revenue because in those cases the payment is not passed on to the carer. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Initial late payment penalties apply if a payment is not paid on time. In addition to the initial late payment penalties, for each subsequent month that the child support remains outstanding (with no repayment arrangement in place), compounding incremental penalties are also applied (initially at 2%, but reduced to 1% after 12 months). International agreements There is a reciprocal agreement with Australia which allows for the enforcement of payments when a liable parent moves to Australia or a parent liable under the Australian child support scheme moves to New Zealand. The Family Proceeding Act 1980 details the rules for recognition of overseas maintenance orders made in Commonwealth countries as well as countries that are parties to the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance (UNCRAM). The Family Court registers overseas court orders and refers them to Inland Revenue for enforcement. The Family Court can also make child support orders to be sent for enforcement in other countries if an administrative assessment cannot be raised under the Child Support Act. Why is Government regulation preferable? Regulation is preferable because parents may not be able to come to agreement between themselves regarding the support of their children. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The opportunity provided by BT allows Inland Revenue to introduce changes to work better with customers when they are new to the scheme and assist them to get things right from the start – particularly those who are willing to comply but might have trouble at times meeting their payments. Penalty rules Impact of current penalty charges On balance, the New Zealand child support scheme has been very successful in collecting assessed child support debt. Since the scheme’s introduction in 1992, Inland Revenue has collected 89% of all the child support payments assessed by Inland Revenue. This rate compares very favourably internationally. However, parents who are new to the scheme have a low initial level of compliance. Research indicates this is because parents are adjusting to the changes in the family situation (i.e. recent separation), there is lack of understanding of the child support rules and their obligations, or previous negative interactions with Inland Revenue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE The table below illustrates the value of overall child support debt and the proportion made up of penalties. Mar 16 Sept 16 Mar 17 Sept 17 Mar 18 Sept 18 Mar 19 Assessment debt $651m $633m $621m $596m $579m $562m $558m Penalty debt $2.67b $2.59b $2.48b $2.03b $1.80b $1.65b $1.66b Penalties as % of debt 80% 80% 80% 77% 76% 75% 75% Total debt $3.3b $3.2b $3.1b $2.6b $2.4b $2.2b $2.2b In April 2016, the initial late payment penalty was split into a two-stage penalty charge. An initial charge of 2% on the day after the due date and a further 8% seven days later. Before this, the penalty was combined and a single 10% penalty was charged the day after the due date. The introduction of the two-stage penalty was intended to reduce penalty charges on those who were only a few days late and give Inland Revenue an opportunity to try and contact parents and remind them of their payment. The change has had little impact on overall compliance or reduced penalty charges. This is because the time between charging the 2% and 8% penalty is not long enough for Inland Revenue to undertake any interventions such as a reminder notice. Research indicated it also wasn’t long enough for parents to adjust their budgets to make the payment. Low-income liable parents are over-penalised proportionately to their assessment by a $5 penalty rule that requires the first stage 2% initial penalty to be a minimum of $5. This means anyone with an assessment of less than $226 per month is over penalised. The table below shows on average how many are proportionately over-penalised each month. Number of liable parents incurring the initial penalty Number of parents who are charged as a result of the $5 minimum rule Total amount charged as a result of the $5 minimum rule Amount of penalty that would be charged if there is no $5 rule Amount over- penalised per month as a result of the $5 minimum rule 38,171 19,435 $97,175 $34,547 $62,628 Compulsory deductions There is an opportunity to improve the timeliness of child support payments and reduce defaults as a result of the pay-day reporting rules 6 introduced into the tax rules from 1 April 2019. Making deductions compulsory has been considered before, but the monthly PAYE system meant this could not be effectively administered. This is because the information was not timely enough to ensure Inland Revenue knew who a liable parent’s employer was and to inform those employers of amounts required to be deducted before the payments became 6 A number of changes have been introduced including requiring employment information to be provided to Inland Revenue each time an employee is paid. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 12 IN CONFIDENCE overdue. Deductions of child support by employers are already compulsory once a liable parent defaults on their payment or when a liable parent is receiving a benefit. Additionally, a person can choose employer deductions as their payment method. Time bar A child support assessment takes into account a number of factors - for example, income and shared care arrangements for the child. If Inland Revenue becomes aware of a change to one of these factors, a reassessment is required. These reassessments can be made retrospectively and as far back as 1992 (when the child support scheme began). This retrospective approach becomes more unsustainable and costlier administratively as the scheme gets older. Further, this creates uncertainty for liable parents and receiving carers and possibly debt as a result of increased assessments (for liable parents) or over payments (to receiving carers) which then needs to be repaid. Often the reassessment results in no change to the child support payment obligation but creates a notification to all parties that a reassessment has occurred which can cause confusion and stress. In some cases, the liable parent and receiving carer have exited the child support scheme and the reassessment brings them back in. In practice, most reassessments to a past year occur within four years of that child support year ending. Less than 2% of reassessments occur more than four years after the end of the child support year. A four-year time bar, applying from the end of the relevant child support year would allow for 98% of current reassessments to occur. From 1 April 2017 to 30 June 2019 about 156,000 liable parents (and their associated receiving carers) were reassessed a total of 611,000 times (this includes reassessments during a current year). About 2,830 of these liable parents were reassessed on average 2.3 times (6,690 occasions in total) for years that would be time barred under the proposals. Many reassessments affect more than one year. At an aggregate level, the net impact of reassessments for child support years that ended more than four years ago has been a reduction in liabilities for liable parents and therefore a reduction in entitlements to receiving carers. The table below shows the number of liable parents who saw no change to their payment obligations, or an increase or a decrease to their payments. Some parents were reassessed for multiple years so will appear in more than one “change” row – hence the number of liable parents in each change group shown in the table is more than the total number of liable parents reassessed (2,830). Change Liable parents Annual change Per liable parent No change 1,000 $0 N/A Decrease 1,590 ($15,492,300) ($9,743) Increase 960 $6,386,200 $6,652 Net change 3,550 ($9,106,100) ($3,091) 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Reassessments occur for a variety of reasons. The table below shows the main reason for the reassessment and the net impact to liabilities that can be attributed to the change. Some parents will have more than one reason for change, hence the number is greater than total liable parents reassessed (2,830). Reason for change Number of liable parents Net change Income 1,997 ($5,490,787) Cessation 419 ($3,839,438) Child change 287 $470,070 All other reasons 322 ($245,948) Total 3,025 ($9,106,103) An “income” change most commonly occurs because a person has confirmed their taxable income for a past year and that income is replacing a default income amount used in the child support assessment. “Cessation” means the child support obligation for the liable parent has ended – this could be because the liable parent and receiving carer have reconciled, or the last child that a parent is liable for no longer qualifies for child support. “Child change” covers a variety of changes specific to a child – for example, parents start to share the care of the child or a child turns 13 (which changes the costs associated with a child). There are many other reasons a reassessment of child support can occur - for example, a child or parent dies. These have been combined in the above table in “all other reasons.” The aggregate net impact on reassessed liable parents is to reduce liable parents’ obligations – that is, the majority of the reassessments resulted in the liable parent’s child support obligations being reduced. If the liable parent has not already paid the amount assessed (before the reassessment) the receiving carer has a reduced amount owed to them. Alternatively, if the liable parent has met their obligation, the receiving carer has been overpaid their child support. When the payment has been paid to the receiving carer, Inland Revenue will undertake collection action to recover the overpaid amount from the receiving carer. Amounts overpaid to receiving carers can be written-off if it is shown that collection of the overpayment would create serious hardship for them. 7 If the receiving carer is in receipt of a sole parent rate of benefit, the child support payment is not paid to the receiving carer but is kept by the Government to cover the cost of their benefit. In these cases, it is the Crown that is “overpaid,” and a refund is issued to the liable parent. 7 The liable parent will still receive a refund of overpaid child support – the cost of the written-off overpayment of child support to the receiving carer is met by Crown revenue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Although the aggregate net impact is a reduction in child support obligations, 960 liable parents do have an increase in their obligations. In the main, this becomes a debt because the liable parent does not pay the increased amount by the due date (30 days from the date of reassessment). Only 33 (of the 960) liable parents paid the new amounts on time, 875 were already in debt and the new amounts owed increased the size of their debt. The remaining 52 liable parents were fully compliant with their child support obligations (and possibly no longer in the scheme) and the reassessment caused them to fall into debt as did not pay by the due date. Changes to the definition of “income” for child support Adding investment income (such as interest and dividends) Currently, if during a year a parent earns solely withholding income (any income where tax is deducted before it is paid to the parent), they are assessed using only their income from employment (salary and wages). This means investment income such as interest or dividends they earn is not included in their child support assessment – this is because it was not readily available (other than annually). Changes to the income tax rules require that interest and dividends are now reported more frequently by third parties (for example, banks) which means the income can now be included in a parent’s child support assessment. The table below indicates how much additional interest income is not currently being included in a parent’s annual child support assessment. Annual interest income Parent type Number of parents Total interest Median Receiving 37,680 $4,979,100 $0.57 Both 15,150 $2,424,800 $0.52 Liable 26,800 $3,934,100 $0.47 Total 79,630 $11,338,000 N/A The table shows all parents in the scheme over the course of a child support year. Where parent type is “both” the parent has either been both a liable parent and receiving carer during the year or they are registered as both a liable parent and receiving carer (usually because shared care is in place). They are in the “both” category to avoid double counting. The median interest is less than $1 which indicates the large majority have an immaterial amount of interest but that a few have significant amounts of interest income that is currently not being accounted for when calculating a parent’s capacity to support their children. The following table shows the distribution of interest income: Distribution of annual income Parent type <$1 $1<$1,000 $1,000<$5,000 >$5,000 Receiving 21,301 15,491 614 125 Both 8,616 6,157 292 60 Liable 15,767 10,384 488 291 Total 45,684 32,032 1,394 476 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Reporting of dividend income to Inland Revenue by third parties only becomes compulsory from 1 April 2020. Based on information provided by parents for the tax year ending 31 March 2019 less than 70 parents (liable and receiving) have some dividend income. The combined dividend income declared by these parents is about $900,000. It is possible in some of these cases the income is being taken into account through an application for a departure 8 (known as an administrative review). Having the income taken into account automatically would remove the requirement to go through the administrative review process which generally takes up to three months. Ignoring losses from prior years in determining income for current year A parent’s income to support a child in a year may be reduced by tax losses that occurred in an earlier year – that is, the losses are “brought forward” to the current year. This is the approach used in calculating income tax obligations. A concern with this approach is that it is at odds with the objective to assess a parents’ relative financial capacity to support their children in a given year. Further, the current approach does not align with the way that these losses are accounted for when working out Working for Families entitlements and student loan obligations. From administrative data fewer than 500 child support parents (liable and receiving) have their child support income reduced by tax losses brought forward. There is an even split between receiving carers and liable parents. For about half of these, parent’s income is being reduced by less than $5,000. About 25 have their income reduced by more than $50,000. Minor and technical amendments to improve fairness, equity, compliance or administration of the scheme Other minor and technical amendments have been identified to address specific issues with the scheme. Combined, they are intended to make the administration of the scheme fairer, simpler and less confusing – for example, by aligning the rules across different social policies. Not all of these proposals are required to be included in this impact assessment; they have been included for transparency and completeness. Most of these minor and technical amendments will impact positively on customers. The exception is a proposal to amend the maximum age of child support which would mean that for a small group of carers (a maximum of about 150 children) child support for the child would end some months sooner than is currently the case. However, this proposal largely aligns child support with Working for Families tax credits which Inland Revenue also administers. An explanation of each proposed amendment is included in the appendix. 8 A person can apply for a “departure” from their child support assessment on certain grounds - for example, the financial capacity of the other parent. If a departure is granted, it means a relevant component used in the formula is adjusted - for example, the income. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Why does the Counterfactual constitute “a problem”? Relying solely on operational improvements that may be provided through BT is unlikely to lead to significant improvements to child support compliance or engagement with the scheme and we would not expect to see any substantial improvement in parents’ behaviour. If no policy changes are made, the complexities of the existing system would be introduced to the new system. Further, the opportunity to improve child welfare as part of Inland Revenue’s BT programme would be lost. The policy changes could be considered at a later date. However, if the changes are implemented at a later date they would come with significant additional implementation costs, whereas if they are implemented as part of BT the changes will not have additional costs because they can be included in the new systems and processes that are being developed as part of BT. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The focus of BT has been on administrative improvements to the tax and social policy systems. Given this, fundamental changes to the child support scheme such as changes to the child support formula, are out of scope. The Welfare Expert Advisory Group has proposed changes which, if adopted, would impact the child support scheme (such as passing on child support payments from liable parents to parents who are on the sole parent benefit). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 17 IN CONFIDENCE 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The main stakeholders are parents and carers who are in the child support scheme, and employers who deduct child support payments from wages. The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy was released in July 2017 which included proposals outlined in this document to: • introduce compulsory employer deductions of child support from salary and wages; • not penalise people who are trying to comply, and better support early intervention to prevent debt; • align the child support definition of income with the definition of income used for other social policy products; and • work with customers in unusual circumstances. An extensive engagement strategy was developed to support the release of the discussion document, including online public consultation which provided a vehicle for the public to comment on the proposals. It included an online forum with views sought on specific questions, short summaries of the key proposals, a simplified online survey and animated videos of the proposals. The summaries, surveys and videos were available in nine languages other than English and the video was also available in New Zealand sign language. Officials also met with key interest groups around New Zealand – for example, the National Beneficiary Advocacy Group. Submitters broadly agreed with the proposals. Submitters’ comments were mixed about making compulsory child support wage deductions for all liable parents with employment income. Some submitters expressed concerns about the compliance costs for employers and there were concerns whether compulsory deductions should apply to fully compliant parents. Submitters supported expanding the income definition used for child support purposes to better align with that used for Working for Families tax credits and student loans. Submitters supported Inland Revenue working proactively with customers to manage debt. Submitters strongly supported the proposal to provide Inland Revenue with additional authority to work with customers who have these unusual circumstances in order to achieve the intended outcome for the specific social policies. In relation to the proposal to introduce a time bar, targeted consultation was undertaken with interest groups. These groups were: • National Beneficiaries Advocacy Consultative Group; • The Federation of Budget Advisors; • Citizens Advice Bureau; and • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 18 IN CONFIDENCE One group were comfortable with the proposal and thought that the proposed exceptions addressed any possible inequities. Another group supported a time bar when there has been a default assessment 9 and a reassessment would result in a reduction of child support paid by the liable parent and a debt for the receiving carer. However, they do not support the introduction of a time bar when there has been a default assessment and a reassessment would result in an increase in child support being payable by the liable parent and money due to the receiving carer. Their concerns include: • that the proposal undermines the integrity of the child support scheme and may be perceived by the public and those who pay the correct amount of child support as unfair; • it fails to meet the objective of the child support scheme which is to ensure parents fulfil their responsibilities to financially support their children; and • that it fails to ensure that Inland Revenue meets its responsibilities to administer the scheme for those parents who voluntarily choose to receive their child support through Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue considered these concerns and consider that, on balance, the proposal is fairer as it provides parents and carers with more certainty. Any equity concerns can be addressed by the specified exceptions to the time bar. Inland Revenue consulted with the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development and Oranga Tamariki (as Inland Revenue collects child support for beneficiaries and Oranga Tamariki as the custodian of wards of the State) on the proposals set out in this regulatory impact assessment. The Ministry of Justice and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (child poverty unit) were consulted on relevant proposals. These agencies generally supported the proposals. Officials have consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on the compulsory deductions proposal. The Privacy Commissioner is pleased to support the compulsory deductions proposal as a measure that is consistent with applying good privacy values. The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy included information in Te Reo. The proposals will apply to Maori the same as for any customer in the child support scheme. The proposal to include Maori authority income (which is a type of investment income) will affect those with income from Maori authorities in the same way as it affects people with other types of investment income. 9 A default assessment is when a parent has not filed a relevant return and the Commissioner has determined the income on which to base the child support assessment. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 19 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3 : O p tio n s id en tific a tio n 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? This regulatory impact assessment contains a number of proposals. The recommended options work together in combination to deliver on the key objectives to simplify the rules, make the rules fairer, and encourage engagement and compliance with the scheme. Penalties rules Option 1: Maintain the status quo with some operational improvements including, better education, improved statements and better online content. The option would be unlikely to deliver significant improvements on current state. Option 2: Make some small changes to the existing rules including, increasing the time period between the imposition of the 2% and 8% initial penalties and only charge a 1% incremental penalty each month (rather than a 2% incremental penalty reducing to 1% after a year). This option would slow the escalation of the debt book but is unlikely to have much impact on preventing debt in the first instance and improving compliance behaviours. Option 3: Charge no penalties. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book due to the accumulation of penalty growth but could increase the value of assessment debt. It could mean some liable parents stop paying altogether. Research conducted showed penalties do play a part in incentivising compliance by keeping child support “front of mind”. Charging no penalties may reduce compliance with the scheme. Option 4: Introduce a grace period for new payers (for a three-month period), increase the period between the imposition of the 2% and 8% initial late payment penalties (up to 28 days – that is, closer to the next due date), and remove the $5 minimum penalty rule. The changes would simplify aspects of the scheme, reduce administration and compliance costs and enable Inland Revenue to better work with customers to encourage their ongoing compliance. Penalties would still be charged when a person is non-compliant, however they would be in proportion to the amount outstanding. Parents agree penalties have a place in the scheme but when they are too punitive they cause them to disengage with the scheme and reduce compliance. Increasing the time between charging the 2% and 8% penalty to 28 days would means on average an additional 540 parents would not be charged the second stage (8%) of the penalty each month. With the additional interventions that could be employed in the 28 days before the 8% penalty is charged, it is expected even more parents would benefit from not incurring a penalty (although we cannot say how many more). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 20 IN CONFIDENCE Compulsory deductions Option 1: Status quo with operational improvements This option could see some improvements in debt collection and compliance due to the better information received by Inland Revenue due to pay day reporting, but it would not prevent people falling into debt. Option 2: Extension of compulsory source deduction payments to liable parents who become liable after the proposals come into effect (rather than just those who have defaulted). The Commissioner would have discretion not to impose deductions in certain cases – for example, for privacy reasons. Liable parents already in the scheme who are compliant would not be subject to compulsory deductions unless they defaulted. This provides more certainty to carers and helps to prevent customers falling into debt in the first place. It aligns the policy with beneficiaries who are liable parents as they have deductions made from their benefit. Time bar Option 1: Status quo. This option does not provide any certainty for carers and parents as adjustments can be made back to 1992, which can result in debt for either parent and can result in reopening cases which have already been closed. Administratively, continuing to make adjustments to child support assessments back as far as 1992 becomes unsustainable, particularly given the move to the new system. Option 2: A time bar with no exceptions. This option improves certainty and reduces administration costs and debt. However, it is open to manipulation and could result in inappropriate outcomes. It would reduce the overall fairness and equity of the scheme. Options 3: A time bar with specific exceptions: • If information provided by a person in the child support assessment is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omits income of a particular nature; • when a parent or child included in the assessment has died; • when a person should never have been made liable – for example, when a person is subsequently found not to be the father of a child; • when a reassessment is required to avoid a dual liability (for the same child) with an overseas jurisdiction; • if Inland Revenue does not meet the notification requirements; or • if a court order is granted that applied to a time barred period. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 21 IN CONFIDENCE Definition of “income” Option 1: Status quo. This option would not make use of the information that Inland Revenue now receives on a regular basis. The current approach of reducing a person’s income for child support purposes due to tax losses from earlier years means the income used in the assessment does not fully reflect the person’s ability to financially support their children and does not contribute to improving the fairness of the scheme. It does not align with how these losses are accounted for when working out Working for Families entitlements and student loan obligations. Option 2: Full alignment with the income definitions used for Working for Families and student loans purposes – for example to include income not reported for tax purposes such as money given by a family member to help with living costs (over a certain threshold) This option would significantly increase complexity, compliance and administration costs. Due to the increased complexity of the rules, more adjustments would be made to people’s assessments as income that should be, or not be, included in the assessment is identified. This would reduce the certainty of payments. Child support already has provisions which allow for other types of financial resources to be taken into account in assessments – for example, administrative reviews. Option 3: Moving to a net income base and including other reported income (aligning more closely with the definition of income for Working for Families and student loans). Moving to a net income basis ensures that income is no longer reduced due to tax losses from an earlier year and more accurately reflects each parent’s ability to financially support their children. Given that the majority of the parents who have losses that reduce their income are liable parents, the net effect of the proposal overall is to increase liable parents’ obligations toward the support of their children. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? Compliance with the scheme – The proposal should improve compliance with the scheme, particularly for liable parents. This should reduce the number of people in debt. Certainty and complexity – The proposal should result in the right amount being paid and will reduce over or underpayments. It should reduce complexity of the rules. Compliance costs – The proposal should reduce compliance costs for parents and carers. Administration cost – The proposal should reduce administration costs. Equity and fairness – The proposal should be fair and equitable, and not encourage or reward undesirable behaviours. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 22 IN CONFIDENCE 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? An option to not have any employer deductions from salary or wages (or source deduction payments) was ruled out as it would reduce compliance with the scheme and further misalign the rules for non-beneficiary liable parents with those that apply to beneficiary liable parents. A beneficiary liable parent must have their child support deducted from their benefit whether in debt or not. Replacing penalties with interest which would be passed on to the receiving carer is considered to be outside the scope of the BT work. Further it does not fit with the purpose of the scheme which is the transfer of payments between parents as interest is generally applied when the Government is the direct recipient of the money collected. More closely aligning the time bar with the time bar for tax by only considering the time bar once a person has had their relevant income assessment for a child support year finalised. As most parents do not file income tax returns this option would mean that child support reassessments would still be available for many years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 23 IN CONFIDENCE Sectio n 4 : Imp ac t An a ly s is Penalty rules Compliance with the child support rules Certainty Compliance costs Administration costs Equity and fairness Status quo and operational improvements 0 0 0 0 0 Increasing period between the imposition of the two phases of the initial penalty and reducing the incremental to 1% + allows for interventions before the 8% penalty is charged 0 + more time before 8% penalty charged, debt growth is slowed + debt growth is slowed 0 No penalties -

Inland Revenue’s preference is to move forward with the following combination of options (as outlined in section 3 Options identification) Penalty rules – option 4 to make changes by introducing a three month grace period for new payers, increase the period between the imposition of the 2% and 8% initial late payment penalties (up to 28 days – that is, closer to the next due date), and remove the $5 minimum penalty rule. This option is recommended as it best meets the assessment criteria that the options were rated against. The changes would simplify aspects of the scheme, reduce administration and compliance costs and enable Inland Revenue to better work with customers to encourage their ongoing compliance. Penalties would still be charged when a person is non-compliant however they would be in proportion to the amount outstanding. Parents agree penalties have a place in the scheme but when are too punitive they cause them to disengage with the scheme and reduce compliance. Compulsory deductions – option 2 which extends compulsory deductions to all new liable parents. This will improve the timeliness of child support and help to prevent newly liable parents getting into debt. Time bar – option 3 which introduces a time bar but with specific exceptions. This will increase certainty for parents and reduce compliance and administration costs. Definition of “income” – option 3 which moves to a net income basis and includes investment income (interest and dividends). These proposals will make the rules fairer and the investment income proposal will reduce compliance and administration costs. Minor and technical proposals – all the minor and technical proposals included in in the appendix (including those applying to customers with unusual circumstances). We consider that the combination of these options would best achieve the desired outcomes of improved ongoing compliance with the scheme and debt prevention. The combination of interventions would improve administration and reduce compliance costs but also make the rules fairer, more equitable, and less complex, thereby improving and incentivising customers, and particularly liable parent compliance. Overall, they should result in a reduction in debt. Non-compliance would still be addressed by penalties but in a more proportional manner. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 27 IN CONFIDENCE 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (Liable parents, receiving carers and employers) Liable and receiving parents About 80,000 parents would have their child support income increased by the income definition changes. This could increase or decrease the child support liability depending on whether they were the liable parent or receiving carer respectively. Liable parents The time bar would mean about 1,600 liable parents who would have been reassessed would not receive a reduction to their obligations. Receiving carers The time bar would mean about 1,000 liable parents would not be reassessed so would not see their obligations increased. This means receiving carers would not see their entitlements increased. Employers Additional compliance costs for compulsory deductions for employers if they are not already required to make child support deductions. Additional interest income added to assessments of $11 million Total reduction to obligations is about $16million per year Total reduction in receiving carer entitlements is about $6million per year Unable to quantify but would be low as child support deductions are already made on behalf of many liable parents and compulsory for child support defaulters Medium–low Medium Medium High 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 28 IN CONFIDENCE Regulators (Inland Revenue) The changes to the way penalties are imposed would reduce the penalties charged, which in turn would reduce the amount of penalties collected.

The proposals would require amendment to the Child Support Act 1991. It is intended that the preferred option be included in a child support amendment bill which is expected to be introduced into Parliament at the end of 2019. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of these options and they will form part of its business as usual function. Although not the key driver, the preferred options will reduce the implementation risks associated with transferring the child support scheme from the current computer platform to the new systems and processes. The proposed changes will apply to child support from April 2021.This will enable sufficient preparation time for Inland Revenue to implement the changes. Changes for employers to make compulsory deductions are effectively business as usual as they are already required to make deductions for some parents under the current rules. The proposed approach will be included in the commentary on the child support amendment bill. Consideration by Select Committee is expected to provide an opportunity for interested parties to further express their views on these proposed changes. Transitional proposals have been included where identified. Further transitional issues may come to light during the design and build of the new system. They will be considered when they arise. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There were no issues concerning implementation raised in consultation. There is a risk that employers choose not to be compliant with the new compulsory deduction rules. However, this is unlikely as they already required to make deductions when they are instructed to do so by Inland Revenue. There is a risk that customers may not respond as expected to the penalty measures and that, as a result, compliance reduces. This can be mitigated by use of customer education and existing enforcement provisions, the introduction of compulsory deductions and improved information made available through Inland Revenue’s BT programme. As part of moving to the new systems, Inland Revenue will begin designing and building the new agreed proposals before the legislation is enacted. If there are any delays in making the amendments, there is a risk that the system and the legislation are not aligned. This risk will be mitigated through consultation with the Minister’s office and the 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Offcial Information Act 1982 Impact Statement T emplate | 32 IN CONFIDENCE development of a contingency plan. Sec tion 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lu a tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue already monitors timeliness of child support payments, obligations paid on time (including for newly liable parents), amounts collected and dispersed (including amounts collected through employers). Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support. These tools will be used to monitor and evaluate the proposals when they are implemented. Inland Revenue will monitor the effectiveness of the proposed legislation when implemented. If we identify any evidence that suggests the legislation is not operating as intended, we will consider options for addressing the issues raised. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Any necessary changes identified from the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support. These tools will be used to monitor and evaluate the proposals when they are implemented. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 33 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix Minor and technical amendments to improve fairness, equity, compliance or administration of the scheme The following proposals are aimed at specific issues that have been identified with the scheme. Combined, they are intended to make the administration of the scheme fairer, simpler and less confusing – for example, by aligning the rules across different social policies. Not all of these proposals are required to be included in this impact assessment; they have been included for transparency and completeness. Most will impact positively on customers. The exception is the proposal to amend the maximum age of child support which would mean that for a small group of carers (a maximum of about 150) child support for the child would end some months sooner than is currently the case. However, this proposal largely aligns child support with Working for Families tax credits which Inland Revenue also administers. Improvements to the income estimation provisions Estimation square ups Child support is based on a past year’s income. An exception is when a person’s income in the current year will decrease by 15% or more when compared to the income in the past year. In such cases the person can “estimate,” and elect to use their current income as the basis of their child support assessment. At the end of the year, any estimate is reconciled with the actual income earned in the period of estimation to assess the final child support payment. If a person estimates more than once during the year, each estimation is reconciled separately at the end of the year. If a person estimates more than once during the year, the current rules mean that when their estimate is reconciled they can be assessed on income that is greater than what they earned in some periods. The proposal is to amend the end of year square up provisions to ensure that a person who estimates more than once during a year is squared up on the income they earned in the period. Estimation timing An estimation is only accepted from the beginning of the month in which the estimate is received. This can mean that a person new to the child support scheme may lose the opportunity to estimate for periods (generally the previous month) because they receive their notice of assessment or entitlement in a later month. The proposal is that when a person joins the child support scheme an estimation can be backdated to the start of the assessment if Inland Revenue receives the estimation on or before the first due date for payment. This would mean that a person has at least 30 days to estimate their income when child support is first assessed and does not miss the opportunity to estimate due to Inland Revenue processing times. Debt offsetting Currently, a person can apply for an administrative review if they want debt owed between themselves and another parent offset. Administrative review is a process where a person’s formula assessment can be changed to better fit a person’s specific situation. The number of times the ground has been used is very low and the provision is difficult to administer as it requires an adjustment to the assessment calculation to achieve the desired result. The proposal is to introduce a provision permitting Inland Revenue to initiate an offset of the amount owed. The offset would net out child support debts two parents owe each other. The person owing the higher amount would be required to pay the difference. Such a provision would be simpler, cheaper, easier for customers to understand and would be more effective at reducing debt, and in some cases would clear the parent’s full debt. Removing this 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 34 IN CONFIDENCE debt burden can reduce financial stress on the parent and may have other flow on effects such improving their credit rating. Repealing a redundant provision for urgent maintenance The Child Support Act contains a provision for a person to apply to the Courts for an urgent maintenance order if they have made an application for child support to Inland Revenue, but the child support application has not been processed. It is believed the provision was included in the Child Support Act to cover the period of transition when child support moved to Inland Revenue in 1992 in case there were any unforeseen circumstances that could mean Inland Revenue is unable to raise an assessment. An order under this provision has never been granted so it is recommended the provision is removed. The Ministry of Justice has been consulted and is comfortable with the provision being repealed. Working with customers with unusual circumstances Changes to temporary exemptions Subject to a person meeting specified income criteria, temporary exemptions from payment of financial support (child support and domestic maintenance) are available to a liable person if they are a long-term (13 weeks or more) prisoner or hospital patient. They are justified on the basis that the person has no capacity to earn an income for the period. The proposal is to extend the ability to grant a prisoner exemption to a person in an overseas prison, and to give Inland Revenue discretion to grant a hospital exemption to a person who is not in hospital but who is suffering from long-term illness or injury (and, for example, is being cared for at home). In both instances, granting the exemption would be subject to the current income criteria being met. The number of people who might qualify for the amended exemptions is not quantifiable. However, it is expected it would be low. The proposals align with the overall policy intent that prisoners and the long-term ill should be given temporary relief from their obligations if they do not have the financial capacity to pay at least the minimum child support amount. Removal of the mixed age expenditure table The child support formula uses expenditure tables to calculate the costs of children. They have been developed based on research that concluded teenagers cost more than younger children and economies of scale apply – i.e. each subsequent child costs less. There are three expenditure tables used for calculating the costs of children for child support. One for children aged 12 and younger, one for children aged 13 and older and a ‘mixed age’ table which is an average of the two other tables. The mixed age table is used when there are at least two children in the same child support calculation and they fall into different age brackets. However, if the children do not live in the same household (for example one child lives with mum and the other with dad), the use of the mixed age able does not allocate costs appropriately to each child (although the total expenditure for all children is correct). Removal of the mixed age table will mean costs are calculated for each child based on their age and would better reflect that costs are higher for older children. It will not change the total expenditure calculations but when children live in different households it would ensure the household with the younger child does not benefit from being allocated some of the expenditure intended for the older child. Discretion to modify expenditure calculations when perverse outcomes are reached Although the child expenditure tables are developed on the basis of economies of scale the child support formula then provides that total expenditure is divided equally by number of children rather than attempting to 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 35 IN CONFIDENCE identify the “marginal costs” of each subsequent child. This can cause perverse outcomes in situations when there are multiple children in a child support calculation that have different care arrangements. For example, a person’s dependent child allowance reducing when additional children come into their care – it is expected that the allowance remain the same or increase. Allowing Inland Revenue, the discretion to modify expenditure calculations would give it the ability to modify the calculation to resolve these complex cases by, for example, identifying the actual marginal costs of children. It is expected the number of cases to consider would be low. Based on 2016 data and the known criteria that could lead to perverse outcomes, less than 40 cases each year could arise that need adjustment. Clarifying that child support should end when a child leaves State care When a child moves from the receiving carer to the liable parent child support can continue and a new application for child support is not required. The exception to this is when the receiving carer is Oranga Tamariki because the child has been placed in their care. In these situations, if the child leaves Oranga Tamariki’s care and is placed with one of the parents the child support is stopped. This practice is followed due to potential safety concerns for the child and their carer as the other parent would be notified of the change in carer. If the parent with the child in their care would like to receive child support, they are able to apply. Parents who choose not to apply for child support due to safety concerns may be eligible for other financial assistance from the state - such as Working for Families tax credits. The proposed amendment explicitly ends child support when a child leaves the care of Oranga Tamariki. It clarifies and reinforces the current practice. Introducing timeframes for parents and carers to provide orders of parentage If a person makes an application for child support and they do not have any proof of who the other parent is, the child support application is declined. If the applicant subsequently provides a court order stating that the person named on the child support application is the parent of the child, the child support application is accepted from the date the original application was received. The proposal is to introduce some time limits to improve fairness. The rules would mean child support would only be back-dated on receipt of a court order declaring parentage if the carer applied for the order either before or within two months of submitting their child support application and, having been granted, the order is given to Inland Revenue within two months. There would be discretion for Inland Revenue to accept orders outside the two-month period if the delay was due to circumstances beyond the carers control – for example, they were seriously ill. These court orders are used as proof of parentage in a small number of cases. Between 1 January 2016 and 28 February 2019, an order was used as proof of parentage in 325 cases. For most (260), the order was received either with the child support application or within two months of the application being received, so the proposal would have had no impact in these cases. For the remaining carers, if the time limits were met, there would have been no impact on the amount of child support they receive. However, the proposal would remove the ability for the carer to ‘hold off’ giving Inland Revenue the order knowing the support can still be backdated. For liable parents it restores some equity as it means an onus is put on carers to be timelier in their decisions to seek child support through Inland Revenue (as opposed to the current state where some cases have taken more than 13 years for the carer to provide the order). Timeframes to advise of circumstances when first assessed When Inland Revenue is satisfied that a relevant change of circumstance has occurred – for example, the birth of a new dependent child or a change in care arrangements, the Child Support Act determines when the change is to be treated as having occurred. If a change is notified within 28 days of it occurring, it is recognised from the date it occurred. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 36 IN CONFIDENCE However, this does not apply when the circumstance existed at the time the child support was assessed for the first time. In these situations, the assessment is considered incorrect and should be corrected effective from the start of the child support assessment. This can cause overpayments to carers (for example, if a liable parent notifies Inland Revenue of a dependent child that reduces their payments) or increases in payments by liable parents (if a receiving carer likewise notifies of a dependent child). Any increase in payments for past periods are due within 30 days. The proposal is that similar notification rules that apply to changes of circumstances during a child support assessment should also apply to the notification of circumstances that existed at the time child support was first assessed. The parent should have 28 days from the date of their notice of assessment to advise of their existing circumstances, otherwise the change would apply from the date of notification. Minimum age at which a child can be considered financially independent When a child is financially independent they no longer qualify for child support. To be financially independent the child must be working full time (considered 30 hours or more per week, or what might be considered full time for the type of work), or in receipt of a benefit or student allowance. Fewer than 60 children under the age of 16 have had child support ceased by virtue of being considered financially independent since the scheme began. If a parent believes the child has significant financial resources that should be taken into account in determining the child support assessment, they can ask for this to be considered by apply for a departure from their assessment (commonly referred to as an administrative review). The proposal is to introduce a minimum age of 16 before a child can be considered financially independent. This would fully align the financially independent definition for child support with that used for Working for Families tax credits. Maximum qualifying age of a child A child ceases to qualify for child support once they turn 18 unless they are still at school. Once a child turns 18 child support ends the earlier of: - when they leave school if they do not finish the school year; - the 31 st of December if they finish the school year and they are not attending school the following year; or - the day before the child turns 19 if the child is still in school until their 19 th birthday. The proposal is to amend the qualifying criteria, so the latest child support could be paid is the 31 st of December of the year in which the child turns 18. The schooling criteria would be retained. This change aligns the child support ‘maximum qualifying age’ of a child with similar tests for Working for Families and main benefit recipients. Administrative data shows that this change would mean child support would end sooner for about 150 children. Residency for child support purposes A parent can apply for child support for a child if the child is a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand. Child support is payable by a parent who is a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand or in a country with which New Zealand has a reciprocal agreement with. A person is “ordinarily resident in New Zealand” if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or they are physically 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14 Impact Statement T emplate | 37 IN CONFIDENCE present in New Zealand for at least 183 days in a year and are not overseas for more than 325 days in aggregate in any 12 month period. For child support, residency decisions are often based on a person’s intended, rather than actual, movements. This means that child support applications are accepted (or ended) in a timely manner rather than up to 12 months later during which time children may be living without the financial support of both their parents. The proposal is to better reflect the current operational practice that a person’s intention to be ordinarily resident (or not) should be taken into account. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 14:37:14
Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 1 \[SENSITIVE\] Coversheet: Supplementary Analysis Report — Repeal of child support incremental penalties and simplification of penalty write-off rules Sum m ar y: Pr o bl em an d Pr o po sed Ap pr o ach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? A key aim of the child support scheme is to support liable parents to meet their child support obligations. To encourage compliance with the scheme, late payment penalties are charged on overdue child support payments. 1 Two types of penalties are applied: • initial penalties, which are applied in two stages: o the greater of 2% of the outstanding amount or $5 the day after the due date; and o a subsequent 8% of the outstanding amount eight days after the due date. • incremental penalties, which are applied at: o 2% of the outstanding amount including penalties from one month after the due date for the next 12 months; and o 1% of the outstanding amount including penalties each month from 13 months after the due date. This Supplementary Analysis Report (SAR) covers three areas where the repeal of incremental penalties offers benefits for both child support customers and Inland Revenue. The proposal offers the benefits of: • improving liable parent compliance and engagement with the scheme; • creating simplification opportunities for Business Transformation (BT) Release 5, particularly by enabling simplification of the child support penalty write-off rules; and • alleviating pressure on Inland Revenue to deliver policy responses to COVID-19 by reducing transactions and customer contacts. Incremental penalties do not support liable parents to meet their obligations Research 2 undertaken by Inland Revenue shows that many customers feel that the current penalty rules are overly punitive and complex. Because incremental penalties compound and create further debt for liable parents, it can lead to them disengaging with the scheme and their debt spiralling. Inland Revenue considers that the policy of charging incremental penalties does not support liable parents to meet their obligations. Inland Revenue considers 1 Under the Child Support Act, Inland Revenue administers payments of financial support – that is, both child support and domestic maintenance. Domestic maintenance refers to payments made by a person to a former partner under both Court Orders registered in the New Zealand Family Courts and voluntary agreements. Throughout this document the term “child support” is used to refer to financial support for readability purposes. 2 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. The research consisted of 27 one-on-one interviews around the country. The interviewees were a mix of liable parents and receiving carers, and a mix of levels of income including beneficiaries. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 2 \[SENSITIVE\] that other approaches - including measures to “get it right from the start” - will be more effective. As at January 2019, the child support debt was $2.2 billion, of which $558 million was unpaid child support and $1.6 billion was penalties. Currently, most penalties can be written off – for example, if the person complies with a payment arrangement for 26 weeks. In the child support year 1 April 2018-31 March 2019, Inland Revenue wrote off $244 million in child support penalties. This is down from the $594 million written off in the 2017-2018 child support year, but will increase again in 2020 and 2021 as we focus more on resolving historical debt cases to minimise the impacts of converting data to go into our new system, START. The recovery of debt is challenging and currently 97 percent of child support penalty debt is written down at initial recognition as we do not expect to collect the debt. Repealing incremental penalties is a key simplification opportunity for Business Transformation Release 5 As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation (BT) programme to modernise the tax system, the child support scheme will move to new systems and processes in 2021 (Release 5). Alongside this process, the Child Support Amendment Bill has been introduced containing proposals to take advantage of the opportunity created by BT to improve and simplify the administration of the child support scheme. The current proposal was developed alongside the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill but has been progressed separately as it requires funding; it should be considered alongside the proposals in the Bill. 3 As a consequence of repealing incremental penalties, the child support penalty write-off rules can be considerably simplified. The current rules are highly complex, both for customers to understand and Inland Revenue to administer. The complexity of these rules is reflected in that the incremental penalty and write-off rules are some of the most complex code in Inland Revenue’s FIRST IT system (in which child support is currently administered). With no change, moving child support to Inland Revenue’s new IT system (START) will require us to write and configure bespoke code. This increases the cost and risk profile of Release 5, with increased build and testing effort. In the long run, having bespoke configuration will increase the ongoing administrative cost as Inland Revenue must undertake additional work each time a version upgrade to the system is implemented. Repealing incremental penalties would simplify the penalty and write-off rules and reduce the complexity they present for the BT Release 5 IT build. Repealing incremental penalties will reduce transactions and allow Inland Revenue to focus on implementing COVID-19 policy responses With the advent of COVID-19, the repeal of incremental penalties has been reprioritised along the COVID-19 funding track as it will allow Inland Revenue to focus on implementing other COVID-19 policy responses. 3 Regulatory Impact Assessment for the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-ria-child-support.pdf 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 3 \[SENSITIVE\] The proposal will do so by reducing the high volume of transactions created for Inland Revenue by the current penalty rules. In the 12-month period to 31 December 2019, 41 million penalty or penalty write-off transactions were applied to the accounts of about 105,000 liable parents with child support debt – an average of 390 transactions per customer per annum. Inland Revenue estimates that we manage around 62,000 customer contacts per annum in relation to child support penalty write offs. As noted above, most penalties are written off. Repealing incremental penalties would eliminate these transactions and reduce customer contacts. This would alleviate pressure on Inland Revenue to deliver the COVID-19 policy responses which have been agreed to. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? The preferred option is to repeal incremental penalties from the child support scheme and simplify the write-off rules, alongside other measures in the Child Support Amendment Bill. This is the preferred option because it offers the greatest simplicity, and is the option which will maximise the benefits for customers and Inland Revenue. Secti o n B: Su mm ar y I m p acts: Ben efi ts an d co sts Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The parents, carers and children in the scheme are expected to benefit from the proposed change As at March 2020 the child support customer base was made up of: • 163,429 liable parents (including 29,067 with debt only); • 135,617 receiving carers; and • 182,233 children. The proposal will make the penalty rules simpler and less punitive, and is therefore expected to improve compliance. In theory, a benefit to imposing incremental penalties is that it may (even if they are written- off) encourage liable parents to contact Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue can then help them comply in their circumstances. However, because child support is due each month, if a person is late paying month-after-month there already opportunities to engage with the person when initial penalties are imposed. Therefore, in this respect, no benefits are offered by charging incremental benefits. Although penalties are intended to discourage non-compliance, research 4 undertaken by Inland Revenue suggests that they can have the opposite effect. This is because incremental penalties compound causing debt to grow continuously, often resulting in customers 4 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 4 \[SENSITIVE\] disengaging with the scheme. In many cases, the amount of the penalties owed is significantly larger that the unpaid child support. Improved compliance would benefit all those in the scheme; liable parents would be penalised less, and receiving carers could have more certainty and timeliness in receiving payments, which contributes to the welfare of their children. Inland Revenue would also benefit from the proposed change Inland Revenue would also benefit from the repeal of incremental penalties as a major simplification measure to support the implementation of child support in BT Release 5. Implementing the current incremental penalty and write-off rules in the new system presents great complexity for, and therefore greater cost and risk profile to, BT release 5 when compared to the option of repealing incremental penalties and simplifying the write-off rules. Further, the number of transactions on customers’ accounts and customer contacts resulting from penalties represent considerable administrative resources for Inland Revenue. Repealing incremental penalties would reduce transactions for Inland Revenue and alleviate the pressure on Inland Revenue to deliver the COVID-19 responses that have been committed to. In the long-term, the preferred option would enable version upgrades to the new system to be implemented with less work, and therefore less cost. Where do the costs fall? Repealing incremental penalties has a fiscal cost to the Government of $2m per annum. Simplification of the write-off rules has no fiscal cost. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Some liable parents may not respond as expected to the repeal of incremental penalties and levels of compliance could reduce. We do not think this is likely. If our expectations are incorrect, this can be mitigated by use of customer education, existing enforcement provisions and improved information made available through Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Initial penalties will still be charged. These will continue to discourage non- compliance and provide Inland Revenue an opportunity to contact the liable parent to get them back on track. Certain proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill, which is also intended to support BT release 5, are intended to improve compliance (for example, the proposed compulsory deductions of child support from payments made by employers to newly liable parents). These proposals would further mitigate any reduction in compliance due to the removal of incremental penalties. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 5 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n C: Evid en c e cer tain ty an d q u ali ty assu r an c e Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue has a medium–high level of confidence in the evidence base. The key uncertainty is the impact of repealing incremental penalties on customer behaviour, which cannot easily be modelled However, literature suggests that measures designed and perceived to be fairer are more likely to lead to better compliance outcomes. Research conducted by Inland Revenue with child support liable parents and receiving carers 5 indicated that penalties had a role to play in encouraging compliance but that the overly punitive nature of the current penalties and the complexity of the penalty rules acted as a barrier to compliance. Inland Revenue collects data relating to numbers of liable parents, compliance levels, debt and penalties imposed. This data has been used to estimate the potential direct impacts of removing incremental penalties. Some of the administrative data is manually input and therefore subject to errors. However, their impact should be minor and would not change the “dollar” value of the impacts.

The purpose of this report is to explain the policy rationale and development behind the repeal of incremental penalties and simplification of the write-off provisions as a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) was not required for these proposals. This was because the repeal of incremental penalties was subject to the temporary suspension of RIA requirements for direct COVID-19 responses, and the simplification of the write-off rules is consequential to that proposal. Inland Revenue has produced this report to improve transparency and understanding of the policy as the amendments go through the legislative process; it has not been used to inform Cabinet’s final decisions to proceed with a policy change. 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key uncertainty is the impact of repealing incremental penalties on customer behaviour, which cannot easily be modelled. However, research conducted by Inland Revenue with child support liable parents and receiving carers 6 indicated that the overly punitive nature of the current penalties and the complexity of the penalty rules acted as a barrier to compliance. 1.3 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Carolyn Elliott Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 4 June 2020 6 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 7 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n 2: Pr obl em d efi ni ti o n an d o bj ecti ve s 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? Inland Revenue’s multi-year business transformation (BT) programme is modernising the administration of New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. Child support is part of BT release 5, which provides an opportunity to review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. The Government is also concerned with improving the welfare of children and minimising the impact of government agency debt on New Zealanders. Further to these, the Child Support Amendment Bill (the Bill) is currently part way through its first reading. The proposed repeal of incremental penalties relates to the proposals in the Bill aimed at improving compliance; however, the repeal is being progressed separately as it requires funding. Unlike the proposals in the Bill, the repeal of incremental penalties can be implemented in Inland Revenue’s current IT system, and its benefits can be realised sooner. Consequently, it is intended for it to be progressed in a different legislative vehicle. The child support scheme and penalties The child support scheme works to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Inland Revenue assesses, collects and disburses payments. As part of the assessment process Inland Revenue will identify the liable parent (the parent responsible for making the child support payment) and the receiving carer (the parent (or other carer) entitled to receive the child support payment). Most liable parents do, or are willing to, comply with their child support obligations, but at times may have trouble meeting their payments. For example, 70 percent of payments are made on time; 81.5 percent of child support payments assessed in a year are paid within that year (which increases to 85 percent if only considering child support payable by parents living in New Zealand). Although some payments are late, it illustrates liable parents are generally trying to comply. However, when a liable parent does not pay or pay on time they are charged initial late payment penalties and continue to be charged incremental penalties each month until they pay or come to an arrangement to pay the outstanding amount. The financial burden when a liable parent does not pay falls on the receiving carers and their children. As at January 2019, child support debt was $2.2 billion, of which $558 million was core child support debt and $1.6 billion was penalties. Currently, most penalties can be written off – for example, if the person complies with a payment arrangement for 26 weeks. In the child support year 1 April 2018-31 March 2019, Inland Revenue wrote off $244 million in child support penalties. This is down from the $594 million written off in the 2017-2018 child support year, but will increase again in 2020 and 2021 as we focus more on resolving historical debt cases to minimise the impacts of converting data to go into our new system, START. The recovery of debt is challenging and currently 97 percent of child support 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 8 \[SENSITIVE\] penalty debt is written down at initial recognition as Inland Revenue does not expect to collect the debt. In the 12-month period to 31 December 2019, 41 million penalty or penalty write-off transactions were applied to the accounts of about 105,000 liable parents with child support debt - an average of 390 transactions per customer per annum. Inland Revenue estimates that we manage around 62,000 customer contacts per annum in relation to child support penalty write offs. Incremental penalties are mostly written-off. Changes introduced to penalties and write-offs in 2015 have slowed the growth of child support debt but primarily through write-offs and reducing penalty charges rather than addressing debt prevention. Write-offs have been successful as an incentive to get some parents to re-engage with the scheme but are not effective at preventing debt. Some liable parents are concerned that the rules do not encourage them to comply with their child support payments and at times could promote non-compliance. This is because the rules are complex. Receiving carers are most concerned about the non-payment of child support as it impacts on their ability to support their children. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? Child Support Act 1991 The New Zealand administrative child support scheme has been in place since July 1992. The key feature of the regulatory system is to assess, collect and disburse child support in accordance with the Child Support Act 1991. The key objective of child support is to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. Any parent or carer can make an application for a child support assessment. Using a formula that is legislated for under the Act, Inland Revenue assesses which parent is liable for a child support payment (the liable parent) and which parent will receive child support payments (the receiving carer), and the amount to be paid by the liable parent. This formula includes components such as the income of each parent, the age of the child, and how much care of the child each parent does. Changes were made in the child support reforms (effective 1 April 2015) to modernise the scheme and improve fairness, primarily through changes to the formula assessment and by assessing the income and other circumstances of both parents (rather than just the liable parent). Once Inland Revenue has determined who the liable parent is, the liable parent must make the child support payment to Inland Revenue. Child support payments are due to Inland Revenue monthly. Inland Revenue then passes the payment on to the receiving parent. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 9 \[SENSITIVE\] When payments are not made, or not made on time, the financial burden generally falls on carers and their children. 7 Penalties and other tools (such as contact by Inland Revenue and compulsory deductions for defaulting liable parents) are used by Inland Revenue to encourage compliance. Initial late payment penalties apply if a payment is not paid on time. In addition to the initial late payment penalties, for each subsequent month that the child support remains outstanding (with no repayment arrangement in place), compounding incremental penalties are also applied (initially at 2 percent, but reduced to 1 percent after 12 months). International agreements There is a reciprocal agreement with Australia which allows for the enforcement of payments when a liable parent moves to Australia or a parent liable under the Australian child support scheme moves to New Zealand. Further, the Family Proceeding Act 1980 details the rules for recognition of overseas maintenance orders made in Commonwealth countries as well as countries that are parties to the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance (UNCRAM). Finally, New Zealand signed the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Domestic Maintenance on 27 November 2019. Generally, a child support assessment is raised under the jurisdiction of the country in which the receiving carer resides; when Inland Revenue administers the child support assessment, initial and incremental penalties are applied to overdue payments. Why is Government regulation preferable? Government regulation in the form of the Child Support Act is preferable because parents may not be able to come to agreement between themselves regarding the support of their children. Because the existing penalty rules are imposed by legislation, they require legislation to be repealed. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? On balance, the New Zealand child support scheme has been very successful in collecting assessed child support debt. Since the scheme’s introduction in 1992, Inland Revenue has collected 89 percent of all the child support payments assessed by Inland Revenue. This rate compares very favourably internationally. However, the child support debt remains substantial. The table below illustrates the value of overall child support debt and the proportion made up of penalties: 7 If the receiving carer is a sole parent beneficiary or in receipt of an Unsupported Child’s Benefit, their child support is retained by the Crown to offset the cost of their benefit. Therefore, in these cases the impact is on Government revenue. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 10 \[SENSITIVE\] Mar 16 Sept 16 Mar 17 Sept 17 Mar 18 Sept 18 Mar 19 Assessment debt $651m $633m $621m $596m $579m $562m $558m Penalty debt $2.67b $2.59b $2.48b $2.03b $1.80b $1.65b $1.66b Penalties as % of debt 80% 80% 80% 77% 76% 75% 75% Total debt $3.3b $3.2b $3.1b $2.6b $2.4b $2.2b $2.2b Further, the current penalty rules are perceived to be overly harsh. The imposition of penalties means that some people stop interacting with Inland Revenue and do nothing, resulting in spiralling debt and further disengagement. Finally, the current penalty and write-off rules present considerable complexity for the move of child support to the new system. The system load of the high volume of transactions (41 million per annum) created on customers’ accounts currently caused by, and the high number of customer contacts (around 62,000 per annum), regarding penalties and write- offs, represent considerable administrative resource for Inland Revenue. 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? The main stakeholders are parents and carers who are in the child support scheme. Inland Revenue has undertaken research to determine what interventions would encourage customers to comply with their child support obligations and why currently compliant customers comply. 8 The options canvassed ranged from removing all penalties through to removing incremental penalties and changes to initial penalties. This research showed that customers felt that penalties are necessary to encourage compliance. There were concerns that if no penalties were applied when child support is not paid on time, people would stop complying – that is, penalties are needed as an incentive to keep child support “top of mind”. However, customers felt that Inland Revenue was too quick to penalise customers and the penalties imposed are too high. Many customers did not understand the rules and therefore did not understand how to “fix things”. Customers felt that the rules need to provide “clarity, flexibility and the perception that Inland Revenue is working with customers.” The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy was released in July 2017, and contained proposed approaches to social policy debt management that included no longer charging penalties and interest in certain situations and supported an early intervention approach aimed at debt prevention. However, it did not canvass the specific proposal to repeal incremental penalties put forward here. Submitters broadly agreed with the proposals, and supported Inland Revenue working proactively with customers to manage debt. 8 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 11 \[SENSITIVE\] 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? The key objectives are to encourage engagement and compliance with the scheme, simplify the rules, and make them fairer. And further, to realise fully the benefits made available by the opportunity offered in the move of the child support scheme to Inland Revenue’s new system as part of BT release 5. Secti o n 3: O p ti on i d en ti fi cati o n 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Option 1: Maintain the status quo with some operational improvements offered by BT Release 5 including better education, improved statements and better online content. Option 2: Charge no incremental penalties. This option would help prevent debt increasing to levels which cause customers not to engage with Inland Revenue on managing that debt as they feel it is unmanageable. It would also slow the growth of the debt book. Further, it would allow for simplification of the write-off rules. Initial penalties would still be charged, and would continue to discourage non-compliance and provide Inland Revenue an opportunity to contact the liable parent to get them back on track. Option 3: Charge neither initial nor incremental penalties. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book due to the accumulation of penalty growth but could increase the value of assessment debt. It would also mean no penalty or write-off rules would need to be built for the new system. It could mean some liable parents stop paying altogether. Research 9 conducted showed penalties do play a part in incentivising compliance by keeping child support “front of mind”. Charging no penalties may reduce compliance with the scheme. Option 3: Lowering the rate at which incremental penalties are charged. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book, but is unlikely to have much impact on preventing debt in the first instance and improving compliance behaviours and would have no impact on simplifying the write-off rules. Option 4: Do not apply penalties by default and start applying penalties if the customer falls into arrears more than a certain number of times per year. This option may slow the escalation of the debt book, however it could encourage occasional non-compliance as liable parents would have a certain number of instances 9 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 12 \[SENSITIVE\] they could default without being penalised. As such, it may reduce compliance and have a negative impact on receiving carers. Further, it would have no impact on simplifying the write-off rules. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The following criteria have been used to assess the likely impact of the options under consideration: Simpler for customers – the option should make the rules simpler for customers to understand. Impact on compliance – the option should have a positive impact on compliance with the child support scheme and incentivise timely payment. Administration costs – the option should result in simpler penalty and write-off rules which will be easier to build for the Inland Revenue’s new system. Effectiveness – the option should lead to a reduction in the child support debt. The balance between having penalties to incentivise timely payment and not having overly punitive rules presents a trade-off. While research does suggest that overly punitive penalty rules discourage compliance and engagement with the scheme, too lenient rules could reduce compliance with the scheme. While simplification of the penalty and write-off rules presents significant benefits for BT release 5, and to slow the escalation of the debt book, this is secondary to the primary purpose of having penalties: to encourage compliance with the scheme. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Several other changes to the penalty rules canvassed in the research document Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment and the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy are being progressed separately in the Child Support Amendment Bill. This is because they did not require funding, whereas the proposal to repeal incremental penalties does. Simplification of the write-off rules was also not progressed alongside the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill because it is consequential to, and dependent on, the repeal of incremental penalties. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 13 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n 4: Im p act An al ysi s Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified in section 3.1 compare with taking no action under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Status quo Repeal incremental penalties Repeal all penalties Apply incremental penalties at a lower rate Allowing a number of defaults before penalties are applied Simpler for customers 0 ++ This approach would greatly reduce the complexity of the existing penalty rules for customers as they will only need to understand one set of penalty rules (initial penalties). + Mechanically, this approach would be easier for customers to understand, however carers could struggle to see the rationale for not penalising non-compliance. 0 Customers would still need to understand the underlying rules, just at different penalty rates. - Customers would need to understand the same rules, with increased complexity in knowing when penalties will be applied. Impact on compliance 0 + Repeal of incremental penalties is expected to improve compliance. However, it is possible that it could remove a further incentive for some parents to comply. - - Penalties play an important role in incentivising timely payment and keeping child support top of mind. 0 Inland Revenue research 10 notes that child support customers find it hard to quantify percentages and prefer thinking in dollar figures; the difference between (for instance) 2 percent and 1 percent might not be meaningful enough to customers to change their attitudes. - This approach could decrease compliance as liable parents would have a certain number of times when they could default without being penalised. Simpler for R5 IT build 0 ++ This approach would mean that the current, complex incremental penalty rules will not need to be built for the new system, and will enable simplification of the write-off rules. ++ This approach would mean that no penalty or write-off rules would need to be built for the new system. 0 Largely similar penalty and write-off rules would need to be built for child support in the new system. - The current penalty and write-off rules would need to be built for the new system, as well as additional rules to know when to apply penalties. Reduction in child support debt 0 ++ This approach would have a significant impact on penalty debt as the amount of penalties charged would be greatly reduced. The expected positive impact on compliance would also help lessen overdue child support payments. ++ This approach would greatly slow the growth of penalty debt as no new penalties would be charged. However, the likely negative impact on compliance would likely increase the amount of unpaid child support. + Because incremental penalties would be applied at lower rates, the amount of penalties charged would be less. 0 Although fewer penalties would be applied at first, the likelihood that this approach could encourage occasional non-compliance would lessen the impact of that. Overall assessment This option would be unlikely to deliver significant improvements on current state. This option is able to realise the benefits of simpler penalty and write-off rules for both customers and Inland Revenue, while also likely having a positive impact on compliance. The likely negative impact on compliance by removing all penalties outweighs any benefits of this proposal. This option would slow the escalation of the debt book, but is unlikely to have much impact on preventing debt in the first instance and improving compliance behaviours. Further, it would not address the concerns of simplicity for customers and BT release 5. This option would add complexity to the current rules, while not offering improvements to compliance.

On the basis of the above analysis, the preferred option is to repeal incremental penalties from the child support scheme (Option 2). This option is best able to meet policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits. That is, the benefits of simpler penalty rules for both customers and Inland Revenue, particularly in allowing for simpler write-off rules, and improvements in compliance with the scheme. Inland Revenue has high confidence that the rules will be simpler for customers to understand, and for child support to be implemented in the new system, if incremental penalties are repealed. Research suggests that removing incremental penalties will improve compliance. 11 Research undertaken by Inland Revenue shows that customers felt that penalties are necessary to encourage compliance. 12 There were concerns that if no penalties were applied when child support is not paid on time, people would stop complying – that is, penalties are needed as an incentive to keep child support “top of mind”. However, customers felt that Inland Revenue was too quick to penalise customers and the penalties imposed are too high. Many customers did not understand the rules and therefore did not understand how to “fix things”. Customers felt that the rules need to provide “clarity, flexibility and the perception that Inland Revenue is working with customers.” The proposal to repeal incremental penalties was mentioned at a high level in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill. 13 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach 11 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 12 Changing Penalties to Incentivise Child Support Payment, 2019. 13 Regulatory Impact Assessment: Child Support Business Transformation, pp 17-8.

The proposal would require amendment to the Child Support Act 1991. It is intended that the preferred option be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Child Support Amendment Bill. The proposed changes would apply from April 2021, which aligns with the application date for the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Bill and also the go-live date of BT Release 5. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of these options and they will form part of its business as usual function. Although not the key driver, the preferred option will reduce the implementation risks associated with transferring the child support scheme from the current computer platform to the new systems and processes. Incremental penalties charged before the application date of the repeal would remain. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The implementation will be done by Inland Revenue only. No issues concerning implementation were raised during internal consultation and Inland Revenue considers that repealing incremental penalties will reduce implementation risks for BT Release 5. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-07-06 11:08:48 Repeal of child support incremental penalties | 18 \[SENSITIVE\] Secti o n 7: M o ni tori n g, eval u ati o n an d r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue already monitors timeliness of child support payments, obligations paid on time (including for newly liable parents), amounts collected and dispersed (including amounts collected through employers). Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support. These tools will be used to monitor and evaluate the proposals when they are implemented. Inland Revenue will monitor the effectiveness of the proposed legislation when implemented. If we identify any evidence that suggests the legislation is not operating as intended, we will consider options for addressing the issues raised. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Any necessary changes identified from the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. Inland Revenue is currently building a monitoring and evaluation framework for child support.

Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non- deductible expenditure for incomplete assets Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There is no direct evidence on hand to give an estimate about the extent to which non- deductible expenditure affects efficiency in the tax system. This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem or the potential benefits from introducing the preferred option. Officials were informed during consultation of anecdotal examples where current tax policy settings were acting as a barrier for businesses in respect of developing assets where uncertainty existed in respect of their completion or potential impairment and abandonment. Estimates on the impacts of the proposed option have been based on New Zealand 2018 gross fixed capital formation ($m) provisional statistics. The assessed impacts in the table in section 4.1 contain assumptions regarding taxpayer compliance and the composition of private sector asset creation in the 2018 statistics. Officials have a moderate level of confidence in the assumptions we have used but note the 2018 statistics are subject to volatility as a result of asset revaluations. Although the proposals in this RIA have been developed over several years the recent development of final proposal has been completed in a short timeframe which has limited officials’ ability to undertake a complete analysis of the final proposals including its final design. The time available has also prevented officials from fully testing the design of the preferred option with stakeholders.

This RIA considers two questions:  Do the current tax policy settings hinder businesses from committing resource to developing new assets in situations where the completion of that asset is uncertain, and  If the answer to the first question is yes, what is the best option for solving the problem. The first question is considered in this section, section 2, the second question is considered in section 3. Do current tax policy settings hinder businesses from committing resource to developing new assets in situations where the completion of that asset is uncertain? Business decision-making on the potential or practicality of developing new assets, business models or processes is vital to innovation and driving productivity improvements. The Government is concerned that current tax settings are acting as a barrier to business decision-making on these types of investment, specifically investments that decline in value. Under current law, expenditure (that is more than preliminary in nature) incurred to invest in a new asset, process, or business model (feasibility expenditure), and expenditure that is incurred to create a business asset that is subsequently abandoned, is generally not deductible. As a general principle, the economic value of business expenditure that does not provide an enduring benefit should either be immediately deductible, or, when it provides an enduring benefit, deductible over time if that benefit declines over time and has a finite lifetime. When the tax system does not provide for that treatment, an economic distortion is created. Overlaying this principle, New Zealand’s income tax framework draws a distinction between the treatment of economic income from capital and non-capital sources. The distinction is best described using the following metaphor of a fruit-bearing tree. New Zealand’s income tax is designed to tax the fruit from the tree. It does not necessarily tax the tree itself. The corollary of the example is that expenditure is deductible when it has a connection or relationship with producing taxable income (fruit) and is non-deductible when it relates to capital assets (the tree). Consistent with the general principle above, the system also allows depreciation deductions recognising the use of capital assets in producing taxable income. The income tax system’s distinction between income from capital and revenue can result in expenditure not being deductible. For example, feasibility expenditure or other expenditure that results in an economic cost to a taxpayer, but for which neither immediate deductions nor depreciation deductions are available (commonly referred to as “black hole” expenditure). Such examples can skew investment decisions. Feasibility expenditure is expenditure that is undertaken to determine the practicality of a new proposal. In some cases, the Income Tax Act 2007 will deny taxpayers an immediate deduction for such expenditure when it has a connection with an asset that has the potential to yield future economic benefits beyond the taxpayer’s immediate income year. In addition, because of the early-stage nature of feasibility expenditure uncertainty exists over the outcome and this can make it difficult for taxpayers to assess whether an asset indeed exists. Inland Revenue’s original interpretation statement 1 on feasibility expenditure allowed a Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 2 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 relatively wide scope for preliminary expenditure to be immediately deductible if there was no definitive commitment to proceeding with a project. Concerns that the Income Tax Act was skewing business decisions came to a head in 2016 as a result of obiter comments by the Supreme Court in Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2 (the Trustpowerdecision). The case itself was about resource costs, which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue maintained were not immediately deductible. The Supreme Court agreed with the Commissioner’s view but noted that the statutory test for deducting certain types of expenditure was narrower than Inland Revenue’s interpretation and taxpayer expectations at the time. Officials have been informed that an effect of the Trustpowerdecision is that less expenditure is immediately deductible for tax purposes than previously thought 3 which increases the likelihood that businesses will incur non-deductible expenditure when creating income producing depreciable assets. In 2017 Inland Revenue released an updated interpretation statement that applies the analysis from the Trustpowerdecision. 4 Inland Revenue has been anecdotally informed by stakeholders that the current state following the Trustpowerdecision is discouraging businesses from undertaking spending on new assets or processes that they otherwise would have undertaken in the absence of tax. Additionally, if a project or investment is unsuccessful or abandoned, the capitalised expenditure may not generate depreciation deductions over time. As such, businesses may be incentivised to complete projects that, but for the tax effect, would be abandoned. This behaviour affects economic efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates a simple project timeline and the tax treatment of the expenditure incurred in developing that project following the Trustpower decision and Inland Revenue’s 2017 interpretation statement: Figure 1: Tax treatment of feasibility expenditure 1 Interpretation Statement IS 08/02: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008) available at https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/e/e/ee3c54c3-4675-45d3-8fa4-2cea747ff52b/tib- vol20-no6.pdf 2 Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZSC 91. 3 This outcome is appropriate, however, for assets that are not expected to decline in value. 4 Interpretation Statement IS 17/01: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017) available at https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/3/e/3e0303d0-0b02-4f86-844a- 547a6179b661/tib-vol29-no3.pdf Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 3 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 2.2 Who is affected and how? The proposal in this RIA is directed at businesses, specifically in the following circumstances:  Businesses delaying or not undertaking feasibility studies that would otherwise occur if there is uncertainty over whether the expenditure would be deductible and the higher after-tax cost of an unsuccessful investment.  Businesses continuing with feasibility studies that would be uneconomic on a pre-tax basis to ensure they can claim deductions for expenditure already incurred. The Government is concerned that current tax settings are not providing the correct outcome for businesses in respect of expenditure on new assets and processes (that would, if completed, decline in value). The Government wants to remove these tax barriers to promote economically efficient business decisions. It is not intended that the reform would have effect on spending related to assets that are not expected to decline in value over time, such as land or shares, or other assets where the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for a specified treatment. Inland Revenue does not hold information to inform who is directly impacted by the current treatment of expenditure directed at creating new assets. We are, however, aware from tax practitioner comment following the Trustpowerdecision and the views of submitters about the initial problem definition and initial solutions, that there is an impact on small-to-medium sized firms and the large corporate sector. Not for profits, public sector entities and individuals are not considered be within the scope of those affected. Reform in this area of tax law has had long-standing support from the business community. The magnitude of the impact is also difficult to estimate as Inland Revenue does not directly capture data relating to the costs incurred by business when making investment decisions or when decisions are made that result in physical assets being abandoned. In assessing the revenue impact of the preferred option discussed in this RIA, Inland Revenue has used asset formulation statistics to get an understanding about how asset formulation changes from year to year. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 4 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? To date, the government has taken an incremental approach to other instances of non- deductible expenditure under New Zealand’s tax system in relation to:  Research and development;  Company administration costs;  Resource consents;  Software projects;  Patents; and  Plant variety rights. The options discussed in this impact statement are not intended to replace or otherwise alter the rules that are specific to the type of expenditure on the activities or transactions listed above. As such, it is not within the scope of this project to review or consolidate these previous responses. It is expected that any policy change would be directed at expenditure that is not the subject of these other rules in the Income Tax Act; as such, it is likely to act as a rule of last resort. The options in this RIA therefore consider expenditure that is not dealt with elsewhere in the Income Tax Act. The options are also not intended to alter the current non-deductibility for assets that are expected to appreciate in value such, as land or shares, as such assets are not expected to result in an economic loss. The Tax Working Group’s consideration of the treatment of expenditure on feasibility and expenditure on abandoned assets, as set out in its final report in February 2019 have also had a strong influence on the selection of the preferred option. 5 5 Future of Tax: Final Report Volume I – Recommendations, Thursday, 21 February 2019 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report-vol-i-html#section-3, recommendation 33 refers. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 5 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered:  Neutrality: the tax rules should not influence taxpayer decisions about incurring feasibility expenditure  Compliance and administration costs: the impacts on taxpayers complying with the tax rules and Inland Revenue’s administration of those rules, should be minimised as far as possible.  Integrity: Tax deductions should not be available for expenditure that when incurred is unlikely to give rise to taxable income now or in the future or for expenditure on assets that are not expected to decline in value over time. Option One: Status quo This would leave the deductibility of feasibility expenditure to be considered on a case-by- case basis with guidance from Inland Revenue’s 2017 interpretation statement following the Trustpowerdecision. Option Two: Spread the timing and recognition of feasibility expenditure over 5 years This option would allow taxpayers to deduct expenditure on developing new assets and incomplete assets over a defined period of 5 years. Alternative spreading periods have been considered such as 7 years. Officials initially considered 7 years was most appropriate for New Zealand, noting the absence of a comprehensive tax on the income from capital. A 5-year spread was chosen following detailed consideration of the treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure on incomplete assets by the Tax Working Group headed by Sir Michael Cullen. It is also noted that Australia has a comparable 5 year spreading rule to deal with expenditure incurred for similar purposes when developing new assets. 6 A period shorter than 5 years was considered to introduce a distortion to abandon incomplete assets earlier than would otherwise occur (in the absence of tax). 7 Officials plan to carry out an additional round of consultation with key stakeholders on the final design of this option including any resulting draft amendments. An outstanding matter for stakeholder comment is the test(s) that would need to be met to establish the point in time in which expenditure can be recognised for tax deductibility. Option Three: Generally accepted accounting practice (application of Financial Reporting Standards) This option would allow generally accepted accounting practice (with certain constraints) to determine the recognition and timing of deductions. 6 Inland Revenue notes that any comparison of this proposal with tax deductibility rules that apply in Australia should be considered in the context of differences between New Zealand’s and Australia’s treatment of income from capital. 7 Noting that a tension can exist for taxpayers who are required to comply with financial reporting standards. Assets expensed for tax purposes have a direct reflex in the taxpayer’s balance sheet and profit and loss statement. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 6 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 This would allow for:  a defined class of expenditure, known as “feasibility expenditure”, to be immediately tax deductible until an asset is recognised under generally accepted accounting practice; and  an immediate deduction if the project or proposal is abandoned and written off under generally accepted accounting practice. This option would also require support by new rules to deal with abandoned partially completed assets. The additional rule would be needed to remove distortions that would otherwise be created as depreciation deductions are available for completed assets only. Modifications to options 2 and 3 for compliance and tax base integrity reasons Options 2 and 3 have modifications that are not separate options in themselves but alter their application and effect to ensure the reform option is appropriately targeted and contains appropriate safeguards. Reinstatement of expenditure if abandoned or completed asset is subsequently recognised Under options 2 and 3, safeguards would be added to provide that deductions claimed for abandoned or impaired assets that are subsequently reinstated would be reversed in the year of reinstatement. Reinstatement would involve bringing back earlier tax deductions as an increase in revenue in the year of reinstatement and capitalizing those values in the cost of the asset (which would then be subject to tax depreciation). Safe harbour for low threshold expenditure Submitters on option 3 argued that a safe harbour was necessary to reduce compliance costs on small-to-medium sized taxpayers. This was largely due to the fact that such taxpayers were unlikely to be required to comply with New Zealand financial reporting standards. Similar compliance cost savings arguments apply to option 2 as there are costs attached with identifying and spreading expenditure under the option. It therefore makes sense for low levels of spending on investigating and/or developing a new asset, model or process to be immediately deductible. It has yet to be explored with stakeholders if expenditure covered by the safe harbour would have to be reinstated if it related to a completed asset that is expected to decline in value. 8 A threshold of $10,000 was suggested by stakeholders, and officials considered that it was an appropriate amount that targeted asset creation expenditure by small-to-medium sized businesses. The $10,000 threshold is similar to other compliance cost savings measures in the Income Tax Act that allow taxpayers to deduct low levels of expenditure, such as legal fees. 8 Ibid footnote 8. Officials note that taxpayers who are not required to comply with financial reporting standards do not always face a tension between accounting for tax and financial reporting when making decisions about whether to abandon an asset prior to completion. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 7 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The Government considers the status quo is inefficient. Current tax policy settings, based on comments from stakeholders and the conclusions reached by the Tax Working Group, act as a barrier to businesses committing to expenditure on developing assets when uncertainty exists as to whether that asset would be completed. In the absence of regulatory change, the current state requires taxpayers and Inland Revenue to take decisions regarding the deductibility of expenses and the recognition of assets through to disputes and the Courts. Regulatory intervention therefore seeks to remove, or substantially reduce, these interpretative transaction costs. The next question is, which option for reform is preferable. Option 3 was initially developed in response to stakeholder concerns following the Trustpowerdecision and was the subject of the government discussion document Black hole and feasibility expenditure. Option 3 proposed that financial reporting should be used by businesses to determine the deductibility of expenditure or if it should be capitalised. Responses to option 3 suggested that it would not be a complete solution and could be expensive for taxpayers, who are not required to use financial reporting standards, to apply. Stakeholders also noted that the tax treatment of abandoned incomplete assets was unsatisfactorily unanswered if financial reporting standards were applied. Further consideration of option 3 by officials identified a concern that immediate tax deductibility could incentivise decisions to abandon incomplete assets earlier than otherwise occur (in the absence of tax). Option 2 is a response to the concerns stakeholders voiced regarding the application and effect of option 3. Option 2 is preferred as it better meets the assessment criteria in section 3.1. Allowing deductions for expenditure incurred in developing assets, including abandoned incomplete assets, improves neutrality as businesses no longer face tax barriers depending on whether the results of that expenditure are successful or not. Relative to the other options, option 2 should have a lower compliance and administration impacts. This comment is subject to final decisions about the legislative design of the proposal. Further consultation will be carried out on the practical application of Option 2, if Cabinet decides to proceed. The details of when reinstatement of previously deducted expenditure is required has yet to be tested with stakeholders. It is, however, necessary to ensure the integrity of the proposal and the wider tax system. There are no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. A summary of our analysis of the options is set out in the table on page 10. The analysis is by reference to the status quo.

The intent of the preferred option is to remove barriers to firms carrying out expenditure on developing new assets, business processes and other investments where the result of that expenditure is uncertain and could result in abandonment or impairment of the investment. This type of investment is important to innovation and driving productivity improvements. As such, the preferred option is expected to produce wider benefits to the business community. The final design of the preferred option has not been the subject of full consultation with stakeholders. This consultation is expected to occur in the next few months following the outcome of Cabinet’s decision. To ensure the integrity of the proposal, the consequences of any reinstatement of expenditure have not been fully explored and this may involve trade-offs regarding how simple option 2 operates in practice. Officials have made certain assumptions regarding taxpayer behaviour in response to the proposal, those assumptions have inherent uncertainties, including:  Whether the proposal may incentivise taxpayers to commit to completing uneconomic assets to reduce tax payments (raising tax-base integrity risks); and  Whether this proposal, in conjunction with earlier policy responses outlined in section 2.3, causes introduces more complexity in taxpayer decision-making and associated tax compliance costs. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 11 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Following the Trustpowerdecision, the private sector, being corporate taxpayers and their advisors, approached the government seeking a revision of the tax policy settings for expenditure on projects that was more in line with business norms and prevailing practices. Officials undertook preliminary targeted consultation to define the parameters of the problem and consider initial solutions. The outcome from this consultation was the development of a proposal that was released in May 2017 for wider public comment in the government discussion document Black hole and feasibility expenditure. 23 submissions were received that largely supported the policy direction but had concerns regarding the complexity of the proposal and its practical application. In October 2017, a second round of consultation was held on a revised proposal with key stakeholders. Of the ten responses received, feedback was generally supportive of the revised approach but concerns were again expressed over the complexity of the proposal. Submitters were also concerned that the revised proposal created gaps which could still give rise to non-deductibility of feasibility expenditure. The preferred option in this RIA simplifies the rule and introduces a trade-off that deductions are spread over five years rather than immediately unless the qualifying expenditure is $10,000 or less in a tax year. Stakeholders have informed officials that the most important issue is the expenditure being deductible; not necessarily the timing of that deduction. Consultation with stakeholders initially focused on a framework (option 3) that would allow businesses upfront tax deductions for expenditure incurred in developing assets, that if completed would decline in value, at the point when a decision was made to completely abandon progress on that incomplete asset. Immediate tax deductions would also be allowed for feasibility expenditure by reference to accounting principles, with an overlay of tax principles for tax base integrity purposes. Submissions on the practicality of option 3 noted that the proposed deductibility test for feasibility expenditure was too complex. Submissions also noted that partial write down of assets needed to be recognised for tax purposes. Submitters noted that accounting standards imposed tight requirements on when assets should be written off and specific tax rules were recommended to provide for such impairments. Submitters also recommended a safe-harbour threshold that would allow small- to-medium sized businesses immediate tax deductions for low-levels of exploratory expenditure on new assets. Submitters noted that for businesses considering developing new assets, the requirement to use financial reporting standards could be an impediment if the business was not required to use New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards, which also have a compliance cost attached to their use and application. Officials revised the parameters of option 3 in response to submissions and undertook a second round of consultation with key stakeholders. The revised proposal relaxed the basis on which tax deductions could be claimed on partially impaired assets and suggested the tests for deductibility would be based on Inland Revenue’s revised interpretation statement. Submitters were supportive of the revision but again noted the degree of complexity with the proposal (as it was a blend of accounting and tax concepts). Concerns were also expressed that the integrity measures that supported option 3 would lead to gaps with its application. Option 3, without appropriate safeguards could, by allowing immediate tax deductions raise Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 12 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 integrity risks around activities being claimed to be ceased while they were still intended to be progressed in order to access the tax deduction. This option is an improvement over the status quo, but less than option two. There is a risk that if the proposal is not well targeted the change may incentivise taxpayers deferring the recognition of asset (so as to continue incurring feasibility expenses) or encourage the early abandonment of projects and proposals. In response to the concerns identified by submitters on option 3, officials considered that option 2 could provide a more complete response to submitter concerns. However, there is a trade-off. While option 2 is intended to deal with the gaps and problems identified in option 3, the deduction allowed under the option is spread over a specified period. As the requirement to track and record expenditure can create compliance costs, a safe harbour threshold is still required to ensure option 2 does not unreasonably disincentivise small-to-medium sized businesses. Consultation on the final design of option 2 has not occurred and is subject to Cabinet decision-making. Subject to Cabinet decisions, Inland Revenue will discuss the practical application of option 2 with stakeholders. Another round of consultation will also available as part of Parliament’s consideration of any legislative amendment through the Parliamentary select committee process. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 13 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The preferred option would require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be introduced in the next available tax omnibus bill planned for early 2020. Legislation implementing the preferred option is expected to have effect for new expenditure incurred from the start of the 2020-21 income year (for most firms this is 1 April 2020) even if the feasibility project itself had started in previous years. It is not intended that these rules would apply to expenditure incurred before that date as these periods have already occurred so the change in tax treatment would not be able to impact on business investment decisions. These proposals would be favourable to affected taxpayers and would be enacted before taxpayers would typically file tax returns for the relevant periods. When the bill is introduced into Parliament, a Commentary on the bill will be concurrently released explaining the amendments. Further explanation about their effect will be contained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletinseries, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed legislative changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. Inland Revenue has assessed the magnitude of the administrative impacts and considers that the proposed approach can be implemented and made effective for qualifying expenditure incurred anytime from the start of the 2020-21 income year. No changes to Inland Revenue systems are expected as a result of implementing the proposals. Taxpayers would be expected to use existing schedules and internal record- keeping processes to capture information to support tax positions that involve tax deductions relating to developing new assets, or when decisions are made to impair and abandon incomplete assets (that would otherwise decline in value if completed). Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? There are no plans to specifically collect data on the proposal as, of itself, expenditure on developing new assets is a general business activity that would be incorporated and aggregated within existing business tax disclosures and tax returns. The existing record- keeping rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 would apply to deductions allowed under the proposal. Monitoring of the proposed approach will be done through existing relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders and their advisors. Following enactment of the proposal, any issues with the new law identified by tax practitioners and taxpayers would be considered for inclusion for remedial change as part of the stewardship programme on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Comments from stakeholders and their advisors will inform officials if the proposal is not working as intended or creating unintended outcomes. Inland Revenue’s enforcement of the relevant rules (referred to in section 6.1) would also Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 14 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 inform officials if the risks noted in section 4.2 are material, or raise concerns regarding the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes as per the objectives of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to confirm that the proposed approach meets its objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? If the Government adopts option 2, officials propose to engage with key stakeholders 18 months after the proposal’s enactment and receive feedback regarding the effectiveness of the proposal (if feedback is not received earlier) for the period 2020-21. The Government’s tax policy work programme makes provision for work required to deal with remedial matters where tax legislation is not achieving its policy intent. Remedial work is informed from a variety of sources external and internal to Inland Revenue. Any concerns identified by stakeholders about the proposed approach discussed in this RIA would be considered for priority as part of the remedial items component of the tax policy work programme. If the concerns with the proposal are more substantive, consideration would be given to prioritising the matter on the tax policy work programme.

Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet . Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Number of affected parties and potential future fiscal risks are unknown The potential future fiscal risk that the time bar may be ineffective for GST refunds made using credit notes is unknown as it depends on the scale of the particula r issue that gave rise to the refund (e.g. changing interpretations or errors by the affected businesses that have not yet been identified) and number of past years affected. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate these amounts – although in some potential cases they could be in the tens of millions of GST revenue. Limited consultation with affected parties Issue one: Cor rect amount of GST adjustment A draft interpretation of the current law on the first issue is currently being consulted on and the initial feedback that has been received supports the proposed policy change as it would align the law with common business practices. Some submissions were received on a similar proposal in 2012 (see section 5.1 below for more detail ) which have been used to inform this RIA. However, there has been no specific consultation on the proposed changes. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The second issue has not been consulted on with external parties as informing external parties that the time bar may be ineffective could expose the Government to a sig nificant fiscal risk. A GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). Consultation will occur once the bill is introduced and during the Select Committee stage of the bill. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST refunds using credit notes RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. The Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section of the RIA notes that no consultation has been undertaken on the specific proposals and the amount of fiscal risk from not changing issue two is unable to be quantified. The first proposal is taxpayer favourable and maintains current operational practice. The second proposal is a base maintenance change consistent with the policy intent and the fiscal impact, although not quantifiable poses a significant risk if not addressed. The reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: Comments from the review of earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version.

GST credit notes are issued by a supplier when the price for a supply is reduced after a tax invoice was issued, for example when faulty goods are returned. When a credit note is issued: • the supplier must make an adjustment in their GST return in the period they issued the credit note; and • the recipient (if GST registered), must make an adjustment in their GST return in the period they received the credit note. Through these adjustments, the supplier will effectively be refunded for the GST accounted for on the portion of the supply that was refunded, and the recipient (if GST registered) will be required to repay the GST claimed on the refunded portion of the supply. Inl and Revenue has recently considered how the GST credit note provisions apply in cases where the GST registered business standard-rated (applied 15% GST) to a supply of goods and services which should in fact have been exempt (e.g. a financial service) or zero-rated (e.g. an export). This has raised two policy issues: Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment Firstly, from a policy perspective the current law may provide an incorrect amount of GST adjustment in situations where a supply was standard-rated but should have been exempt or zero-rated. This is because, the GST adjustment may be limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the adjusted price. Fo r example, consider a supply of $100 plus $15 of GST which was incorrectly charged. The supply should have been exempt or zero-rated (no GST). In this situation, the correct policy outcome would be for the supplier to issue a credit note and make an adjustment for the incorrectly returned $15. The recipient (if GST registered) would then make an adjustment for $15 incorrectly claimed. However, according to a draft interpretation that Inland Revenue is currently consulting on, the GST adjustment is limited to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the price adjustment. Since the price adjustment is $15, the GST adjustment is limited to $1.96 (3/23 x $15) rather than $15. This interpretation would not accommodate common commercial practices whereby GST registered persons issue credit notes to provide a $15 GST adjustment (rather than amending the original return). Although GST registered persons can request approval from Inland Revenue to amend their original GST re turn to get the correct $15 GST adjustment, this approach is inferior to using a credit note as it involves additional compliance costs and administrative costs. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The second issue concerns whether the “time bar” is effective at limiting GST refunds that arise due to credit note adjustments. The ability to adjust a GST return to claim a GST refund is “time-barred” which means a GST registered person can only claim a GST refund in respect of GST returns that were filed less than 4 (or in cases of a clear mistake or simple oversight less than 8) years prior to the current date. In contrast, because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment. This poses a potentially large fiscal risk as it means a GST registered person may be able to use credit notes to claim large GST refunds if they discovered they had been applying an incorrect GST treatment for a long time (e.g. more than 8 years). This would be contrary to the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The first issue affects some GST registered persons (businesses) which have incorrectly charged 15% GST on a sale of goods and services when that sale should in fact have been exempt or zero-rated (0%). However, GST advisors have informed us it is a common commercial practice to use credit notes to provide the correct amount of GST adjustment in such cases, in which case the proposed law change would simply align with existing practice (and therefore have no impact on compliance costs). The second issue could potentially provide additional GST refunds to some businesses on rare occasions where they made a mistake more than 4 or 8 years ago. However, it was not intended that GST registered persons could receive additional GST refunds from using a credit note instead of adjusting the original GST return. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the decisions. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria was used to assess the options: • Horizontal equity – the affected parties should be able to achieve the intended policy outcomes and similar outcomes as other groups in similar situations such as those who amend their original GST return. • Certainty – the affected parties should understand how the tax rules operate. • Compliance costs and administration costs should be minimised. • Policy stability / sustainability – the option should be able to be maintained and cope with future developments. Issue one: correct amount of GST adjustment issue Option 1: No law change (status quo) GST registered persons will still be required to request approval from Inland Revenue to amend their original GST return to get the correct GST adjustment, or accept a lower GST adjustment through a credit note. Pros: • Requirement to amend original return may provide IRD with a greater ability to check / approve the refund. • IRD can increase certainty by publishing guidance on how the current law operates. Cons: • Provides the wrong policy outcome as it results in a much lower amount of GST ref und compared to amending the original GST return. • Uncertain and would impose compliance and administration costs as IRD’s draft interpretation does not ali gn with current business practices. • Inconsistent with self-assessment basis of GST. Option 2: Make it easier to make the adjustment through amending the GST return This option would allow the affected GST registered persons to amend their GST returns on a self-assessment basis using Inland Revenue’s systems (MyIR). For example, by allowing the amendment to be made in their GST return for the next period, or by relaxing the requirement to apply to Inland Revenue to approve an amendment to an earlier GST return. Pros: • May provide IRD with a greater ability to check the refund. Cons: • Some additional complexity as to get the correct GST adjustment a different refund mechanism must be used depending on why the GST was incorrect. • Would impose compliance and admin costs as does not align with current business practices. • Requires IRD to make systems and process changes and may require a law change. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Law change to clarify the correct amount of GST adjustment (preferred option) This option would involve adding a new provision that ensures that when the affected GST registered per son issues a credit note for a particular supply, it provides the same amount of GST refund compared to amending the original GST return which included the relevant supply. Pros: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Aligns with current business practices. • Provides certainty about the refund amounts when GST credit notes are used. • Reduces compliance and admin costs. Cons: • Requires law change. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes issue Option 1: No law change (status quo) Because the credit note is issued on the current date, the time bar may be ineffective in respect of a credit note adjustment, even though the relevant supply which is adjusted was included in a GST return more than 4 or 8 years ago. Pros: • Allows the business to go back and correct all past mistakes, and claim GST refunds for these, no matter how long ago the mistake occurred. Cons: • Potentially large fiscal risk to the Government and could effectively allow GST refunds for time-barred returns contrary to the policy intent of the time bar. • High compliance and admin costs due to the potentially large refund amounts and the historic nature of the relevant supplies. Option 2: Align with the time bars which apply for GST refunds made through amending the original GST return (preferred option) This would involve applying a time limit from the date of a supply in which a credit note may be issued. The time limit would match the existing 4 year (or 8 year in the case of a clear mistake or simple oversight) time limits for GST refunds which apply when an amendment is made to the original GST return which included the relevant supply. Pros: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Provides certainty that the time bar applies to credit notes. • Reduces compliance and admin costs (consistent set of GST refund rules and likely to align with current practices). Cons: • Limits the ability to claim GST refunds for past mistakes (but still allows a generous 4 or 8 years for this). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Expand an existing provision which provides a 7 year limit for using credit notes when a supply of land has been incorrectly standard-rated Credit notes cannot be issued in relation to supplies of land which were incorrectly standard-rated more than 7 years ago. This 7 year limit could be expanded to prevent a credit note from being issued in respect of other supplies that occurred more th an 7 years ago. Pros: • Aligns with an existing 7 year time limit for credit notes and 7 year record-keeping requirements. • Provides certainty for the time limit that applies to credit notes. Cons: • Can allow a different amount of refund to amending the original GST return (as this has a 4 or 8 year time limit) which could change which refund mechanism is used (and increase administration and compliance costs). • Limits ability to claim GST refunds for past mistakes to 7 years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment The preferred option is option 3 – a law change to clarify the correct amount of GST adjustment as it: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Reduces compliance and administration costs by aligning the law with some common current practices of the affected businesses. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The preferred option is option 2 - align with the time bars which apply for GST refunds made through amending the original GST return because it: • Provides the same GST refund amount as amending the original GST return. • Reduces compliance and admin costs (consistent set of GST refund rules and likely to align with current practices). • Should be a sustainable policy as it means credit notes cannot be used to undermine the policy intent of the existing time bars for GST refunds and also removes the risk of a potentially large, unintended fiscal cost to the Government. The proposed options are compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (Some GST registered businesses which have incorrectly charged 15% GST) Issue two: Lose the potential ability to access an unintended windfall of GST refunds in respect of transactions that took place more than 4 or 8 years ago in “time- barred” periods. Both issues: Minimal ongoing compliance costs as should be no change compared to current practices for most of the affected businesses. Unknown, potentially high depending on the scale of the issue that creates the GST refund and number of years affected.

No other impacts have been identified from the proposed options. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Issue one: Correct amount of GST adjustment A draft interpretation of the current law on the first issue is currently being consulted on (PUB 00352, Changing GST treatment after reducing the previousl y agreed consideration) and the initial feedback that has been received supports the proposed policy change as it would align the law with common business practices. A similar set of proposed changes to the credit note rules was consulted on as part of 2012 issues paper GST remedial iss ues. However, a decision was made not to proceed with any changes to the credit note rules in 2012. This was because one part of the 2012 proposals suggested that when a credit note was issued in such circumstances it should be necessary to pass on the GST refund to the purchaser. Submissions from private sector GST advisors disagreed with this aspect of the proposal and noted that whether or not a refund should be paid through to the purchaser was a contractual m atter and should not be dictated by the GST Act. The new proposal does not include the aspect which these submitters opposed in 2012. Issue two: Application of the time bar to credit notes The issue of how the time bar applies to credit notes has not been directly consulted on with external parties. Informing external parties that the time bar may be ineffective in such cases could expose the Government to a significant fis cal risk. To manage this risk the proposed option could apply from the date that the bill containing the proposed amen dment is introduced. Despite this, a proposed option which would have addressed the second issue was referenced in the 2012 consultation document GST remedial issues (which asked whether that adjustment should be treated as taking place in the same period as the original supply), but no submissions were received on this option. A decision wa s made not to proceed with any of the proposed changes to the credit note rules in 2012 due to submitter ’s disagreeing with on e aspect of the 2012 credit note proposals that suggested that the refund should be passed onto the purchaser (described above). Further consultation Further consultation on both issues / proposals will occur during the Select Committee stage of any bill containing the proposed amendments. It is expected that some stakeholders will submit against the proposal to apply a time bar to credit notes as the proposed law change could potentially limit businesses ability to claim a GST refund for errors they made in their GST returns more than 4 or 8 years ago. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 12 IN CONFIDENCE However, it was not intended that GST registered persons could receive additional GST refunds from using a credit note instead of adjusting the original GST return as this would be contrary to the policy intent of the time bar on GST refunds. Most of the affected businesses have been applying the time bar on GST refunds to credit notes (and this has also been Inland Revenue’s operational practice). This means the proposed law change to apply a time bar would align with these current practices. In contrast, if the existing law is unchanged it could potentially provide an unintended windfall of large GST refunds in respect of transactions that occurred more than 4 or 8 years ago in “time-barred” periods. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Goods and Services Act 1985 which could be included in the next available tax omnibus bill expected to be introduced in early 2020. Guidance materials to explain how the amendments would operate will be published when the bill is introduced, in response to submissions raised with the Select Committee and after the bill is enacted. There is a risk that the proposed amendments could have unintended consequences or may not adequately accommodate existing business practices. These risks will be mitigated by aligning the provisions with similar existing rules, consulting GST advisors once the relevant provisions are introduced in a bill and through the monitoring described in section 7.1 below. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16 Impact Summary: GST refunds using credit notes | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? As both proposed law changes are expected to align the law with the current practices of most of the affected businesses and Inland Rev enue’s operational practice, they should have minor impacts on compliance and administrative costs. Inland Revenue will monitor if any unintended consequences arise through its usual processes of monitoring GST refunds, and through contacts and feedback from the affected businesses and their GST advisors. Inland Revenue would then consider how best to address specific issues that arise. This could include answering queries, publishing guidance materials, adjusting operational practices, making remedial law changes or reviewing the policy. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1. above, on an ongoing basis. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:43:16
Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis An assumption has been made that applying GST or VAT to outbound mobile roaming services is more likely to become the common approach worldwide. This assumption is based on the OECD finalising in 2017 its International VAT/GST Guidelines (the Guidelines) which set forth internationally agreed standards for the GST/VAT treatment of international transactions and the European Union applying VAT to outbound roaming services received by its residents. Under the Guidelines, remote services (which includes telecommunications services) should generally be subject to GST/VAT in the country that the recipient of the services is normally resident. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST on telecommunications services regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Graeme Morrison Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 23 October 2019 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Under New Zealand’s current GST rules for telecommunications services both outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas and inbound mobile roaming services received by non-residents in New Zealand are not subject to GST (or are subject to GST at the rate of 0%). 1 The current rules are inconsistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework, under which one of outbound or inbound mobile roaming services should be subject to GST. As GST is intended to be a tax on final consumption, applying GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services received by GST registered businesses should not have a net revenue benefit. Businesses receiving roaming services should (if GST-registered and using the services for making taxable supplies) be able to claim back the GST incurred on these services as an input tax deduction. The net revenue benefit from applying GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services should therefore only be the GST incurred by final consumers. The OECD released International VAT/GST Guidelines in 2017. Under these Guidelines remote services (including telecommunications services) should generally be subject to GST or VAT in the jurisdiction where the recipient of the service is normally resident. Remote services are services in which there is no necessary connection between the place of performance of the services and the location of the recipient of the services. In light of the OECD’s Guidelines, the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have begun applying VAT to outbound mobile roaming services received by their residents travelling overseas. However, in over 80 other jurisdictions (including Canada, Japan and Singapore) GST, VAT or a local sales tax is added to inbound mobile roaming services, generally by applying these taxes to the wholesale roaming services supplied by local telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable the supply of inbound mobile roaming services. The GST/VAT rules for telecommunications services in most of these jurisdictions pre-date the OECD finalising its International VAT/GST Guidelines. It is unclear whether these countries have made a considered decision to maintain their pre-existing rules for telecommunications services or if they have simply not reviewed these rules yet in light of the OECD’s Guidelines. Like New Zealand’s current rules, Australia does not apply GST to either outbound or inbound mobile roaming services. The differing treatment of mobile roaming services around the world can result in both double taxation and double non-taxation. For example, the roaming services received by an EU resident travelling in Canada would be subject to GST/VAT in both the EU and Canada. Conversely, the roaming services received by a Canadian resident in the EU would not be 1 Inbound mobile roaming services may, in certain circumstances, be subject to GST but these circumstances rarely arise. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 3 IN CONFIDENCE subject to GST/VAT in either jurisdiction. On 8 April 2019 Cabinet agreed as part of Budget 2019 to amend the GST rules for telecommunications services to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services from 1 October 2020 (refer DEV-19-MIN-0059). The issues paper GST and telecommunications services was then released on 17 May 2019 to consult on the detailed design of the proposed changes. This RIA updates the analysis of options following consultation on the issues paper. However, the proposed option is still to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. Application date Cabinet has previously agreed to an application date for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services of 1 October 2020. However, this application date may not give telecommunications suppliers enough time to make and test the necessary systems changes to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are suppliers of telecommunications services and the consumers of these services. New Zealand telecommunications suppliers will be affected as the proposed options would impact on the GST treatment of their supplies of outbound mobile roaming services. Consumers of telecommunications services will be affected as the price they pay for mobile roaming services may increase depending on whether suppliers pass on the full GST cost, or alter their pricing strategies. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Applying GST to the actual inbound mobile roaming services supplied by foreign telecommunications suppliers to non-residents travelling in New Zealand is unlikely to be a viable option and has therefore not been considered. Many telecommunications suppliers sell global or regional roaming packs that allow a consumer to roam in multiple jurisdictions for a single fee. At the time of supply the telecommunication supplier will not know which jurisdiction a consumer will consume the roaming services in. Furthermore, a consumer may consume the roaming services in multiple jurisdictions. If the actual inbound roaming services were subject to GST it would therefore be likely to cause telecommunications suppliers significant difficulties in attempting to apportion roaming charges between the different jurisdictions in which a customer consumed the roaming service. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tion 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? The objective is to maintain New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework by extending the application of GST to more services. The following criteria have been used to assess the options against this objective: • Destination principle: The option should be consistent with the principle that GST or VAT should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. • Business neutrality: The option should be consistent with the principle that GST should be borne by final consumers and should not be a cost to businesses. • International consistency: The option should give consideration to approaches taken internationally to minimise instances of double taxation or double non-taxation. • Compliance costs – The option should minimise compliance costs for telecommunications suppliers as much as possible. Option 1: Status quo Under the status quo both outbound and inbound roaming services are not subject to GST at 15%. The status quo does not achieve the objective as, under New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework, GST should apply to one of outbound or inbound mobile roaming services. Option 2: Apply GST at 15% to outbound mobile roaming services (proposed option) Under this option, outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas would become subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. The gross GST that would be collected under this option is estimated to be $12.993 million per annum. However, GST registered businesses paying GST on the outbound mobile roaming services they receive would be able to claim back this GST as an input tax deduction. It is therefore estimated that this option would increase net GST revenue by $7.041 million per annum. Analysis of option This option would be consistent with the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework as it would add GST to the entire outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas. Applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is not consistent with the destination principle as to receive mobile roaming services a New Zealand resident must be outside New Zealand. However, there are circumstances in which it is appropriate to depart from the destination principle. The OECD’s Guidelines recommend using a consumer’s usual place of residence for determining which jurisdiction’s GST or VAT applies to a supply of remote services (including telecommunications services) regardless of the physical location of the consumer. For example, if a New Zealand resident downloads a movie while on holiday in Australia, New Zealand GST should apply to the download of the movie. This departure from the destination principle is considered appropriate as often the supplier of a remote service 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 5 IN CONFIDENCE will not know the actual location of the consumer and therefore the consumer’s residency is considered an appropriate proxy for the most likely place of consumption of remote services. This option would be consistent with the principle of business neutrality as GST-registered business can claim back the GST they incur as an input tax deduction. This option would be consistent with rules in the European Union and the United Kingdom which apply VAT to outbound mobile roaming services received by their residents. However, this option would be inconsistent with the approach taken in over 80 other jurisdictions which add GST, VAT or a local sales tax to inbound mobile roaming services, generally by applying GST to wholesale mobile roaming services. However, the rules in many of these jurisdictions pre-date the OECD finalising its International VAT/GST Guidelines. The option would also be inconsistent with Australia which, like New Zealand’s current rules, does not apply GST to either outbound or inbound roaming services. The telecommunications industry has estimated that this option would impose on the industry compliance costs associated with updating their billing systems of approximately $1 million. They would also incur costs associated with notifying their customers of the change in the GST treatment of outbound roaming services. The compliance costs for this option would be a one-off cost and on-going compliance costs would be comparable to the status quo. Option 3: Apply GST to inbound wholesale mobile roaming services GST could be added to inbound roaming by applying GST to the wholesale mobile roaming services supplied by New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to foreign telecommunications suppliers to enable the foreign telecommunications suppliers’ customers to roam in New Zealand. This would result in unrecoverable GST being embedded in the price of roaming services received by non-residents travelling in New Zealand. The diagram on the following page illustrates how applying GST to wholesale roaming charges would work. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 6 IN CONFIDENCE As can be seen in the above diagram, applying GST to the wholesale roaming charges would add GST on to the services NZ Telco supplies to OZ Telco to allow OZ Telco’s customers to roam in New Zealand. There is no GST on the actual supply of roaming to OZ Telco’s customer. However, GST is embedded in the price of the roaming services received by OZ Telco’s customer as OZ Telco is unable to claim an input tax deduction for the GST they paid to NZ Telco. It is estimated that this option would increase GST revenue by $3.8 million per annum. As GST would be imposed on the wholesale roaming services rather than the actual inbound mobile roaming services, non-resident businesses consuming inbound mobile roaming services in New Zealand would not be able to claim back the GST embedded in the price of these services. As such, there is no need to consider the difference between gross and net GST revenue under this option. Analysis of option This option partially achieves the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST system as it would add GST to the price of inbound roaming services received by non- residents travelling in New Zealand. However, the margins charged by the suppliers of inbound roaming services would remain untaxed. This option would be consistent with the destination principle. Applying GST to wholesale roaming services is inconsistent with the principle of business neutrality as it would add unrecoverable GST to the price of inbound roaming services received by non-resident businesses in New Zealand. This option is inconsistent with the approach taken in the European Union and United NZ Telco OZ Telco Customer of OZ telco Connection to NZ Telco’s network Roaming services Wholesale roaming services $11.50 (incl. GST) $15 (no GST) $1.50 GST 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Kingdom. However, it would be consistent with the approach taken in over 80 other jurisdictions which apply GST or VAT to wholesale roaming services. Like option 2, this option is also inconsistent with the approach taken to mobile roaming services in Australia. The telecommunications industry has not quantified the cost of making systems changes to add GST to wholesale mobile roaming services. However, the industry considers that these costs would not be insignificant. Officials consider that the costs of making systems changes for this option may be similar to the costs of making systems changes for option 2. This option would also impose costs on the New Zealand telecommunications industry related to reviewing and potentially re-negotiating their contracts with foreign telecommunications suppliers. As with option 2, the compliance costs of this option would be one-off costs and on-going compliance costs would be comparable to the status quo. Application date An application date of 1 October 2020 was originally proposed for the proposed changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services. However, it is proposed to delay this application date by six months to 1 April 2021. The bill containing the changes to the GST rules for telecommunications services is scheduled for introduction in March 2020. This would mean that there may be little or no time between the legislation being enacted and the original application date of 1 October 2020. If the bill is not passed before the next general election, enactment might not occur until after 1 October 2020. A very short time period between the bill being enacted and the application date may not give the telecommunications industry sufficient time to make the necessary systems changes to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. The billing systems of telecommunications suppliers are complex as they need to operate in real time to ensure a person is correctly charged as they use the network. As such, while changing outbound mobile roaming services from a zero-rated supply to a standard rated supply is itself a simple change, the telecommunications suppliers would need to do extensive testing to ensure the change does not cause any issues for their billing systems. Given, the factors discussed above, delaying the application date by six months to 1 April 2021 is considered appropriate. Delaying the application date by six months would have a fiscal cost of $3.52 million. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is to apply GST at the standard rate of 15% to outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents travelling overseas from 1 April 2021 (option 2 with a six-month delay to the application date previously agreed by Cabinet). While applying GST to outbound mobile roaming services is less consistent with the destination principle than the status quo, it best achieves the objective of maintaining New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework and is more consistent with the principle of business neutrality than applying GST to wholesale roaming services. Furthermore, while there is no clear international consensus at this stage, officials consider that, in light of the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines and the approach taken by the European Union, applying GST to outbound roaming services is more likely to become the common approach worldwide. The proposed approach is aligned with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (suppliers) One-off compliance costs in complying with the change in GST treatment of telecommunications services. Approximately $1 million Regulators (Inland Revenue) Administration costs of proposed approach are comparable to the status quo.

We do not anticipate the proposed approach would have any other impacts. We will consult with tax advisors and the telecommunications industry on how best to draft the changes to the GST Act to ensure there are no unintended impacts. The select committee process will also be used to ensure there are no unintended impacts. Sec tio n 5: Stake h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The issues paper GST on telecommunications services was released on 17 May 2019 to consult on the technical details of the proposal to apply GST to outbound mobile roaming services. Submissions closed on 28 June and in total 6 submissions were received. Following the close of submissions officials conducted further consultation with representatives of the telecommunications industry. Support for the proposal Two submissions from accounting firms expressed support for the proposal as they consider it consistent with the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines. However, one of these submissions expressed concerned that the benefits of the proposal would be outweighed by the compliance costs. Opposition to the proposal Four submissions, including one made on behalf of the telecommunications industry, were strongly opposed to the proposal to add GST to outbound roaming services. In further consultation with the telecommunications industry they have regularly expressed their opposition to the proposal. The key argument raised in opposition to the proposal was that, as outbound roaming services can only be consumed outside New Zealand, it would be contrary to the destination principle to apply New Zealand GST to outbound roaming services received by New Zealand residents overseas. Under the destination principle, GST should generally apply in the jurisdiction in which consumption occurs. In arguing that it is inappropriate to apply GST to outbound roaming some submitters also argued that roaming services are on-the-spot services and not remote services as a consumer needs to be in the vicinity of a cell tower to receive the service. In arguing that roaming services are on-the-spot services these submitters were arguing that it would be inappropriate to use a consumer’s usual place of residence to determine which jurisdiction’s GST or VAT applied to a supply of roaming services. However, roaming services should not be considered on-the-spot services as they are not physically performed at a readily identifiable place, 2 and do not require the physical presence of both the person performing the service and the person consuming the service. The New Zealand telecommunications industry’s strong preference is for the status quo to be 2 Telecommunications services tend to have multiple places of performance and it is difficult to identify a single place of performance. The GST rules for telecommunications services were introduced to address this issue. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34 Impact Summary: GST on telecommunications services | 11 IN CONFIDENCE maintained. They note that while it is not a conceptually pure option, the existing rules for telecommunications services have been working well and the consider the status quo to be less of a compromise on a conceptually pure GST system than the proposed option. Furthermore, they do not consider that the increase in GST revenue of $7.041 million per annum would justify the one-off compliance costs of approximately $1 million from making changes to their billing systems. Application date The telecommunications industry suggested a delayed application date would be appropriate given the time required to make and test systems changes. They are therefore likely to welcome the delayed application date of 1 April 2021. Sec tion 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Following Cabinet approval, the necessary amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 will be included in an omnibus tax bill currently scheduled for introduction in March 2020. The proposals are intended to apply to supplies of telecommunications services from 1 April 2021. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue officials have assessed the magnitude of these administrative impacts and consider that they would be comparable to the status quo. Guidance on how the proposed approach would work would be provided in bill commentary published at introduction of the legislation and a Tax Information Bulletin published after enactment. Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Officials from Inland Revenue expect that, once the proposals are enacted, affected telecommunications suppliers and their tax advisors will raise with them any concerns they have with how the rules are working in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1 above. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:42:34
Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Cover page: revised proposal Summary of revised proposal The original version of the attached impact summary entitled, Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements, was prepared to inform Cabinet decisions made on 21 March 2019. The RIA proposed a number of KiwiSaver administrative refinements to form part of Release 4 of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Subsequent concerns raised by stakeholders about the employer compliance costs of certain proposals, have resulted in officials revising the impact of these proposals and recommending the following changes: • deferring KiwiSaver members being able to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council; • removing the change requiring employers to report an employee’s employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate to Inland Revenue; and • only requiring employers to report to Inland Revenue the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees (the attached regulatory analysis proposed this information be reported for existing employees where it had changed since it was reported, in addition to new employees). All other aspects of the proposed approach remain unchanged, and the re-assessment below relates only to the proposals that officials are recommending changes to. The attached RIA has also been updated to reflect the revised recommendations. Problem definition Stakeholders have raised concerns about employer compliances costs in relation to the proposals to allow KiwiSaver members to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (as this would require employers to apply contribution rates advised by Inland Revenue) and the proposals to require employers to report ESCT rates and KiwiSaver income information to Inland Revenue, for new employees and existing employees where this information has changed. Concerns raised about additional compliance costs on employers hold particular weight at this time, given the number of earlier Business Transformation changes that are currently bedding in with employers (for example payday filing, which became compulsory for employers to comply with from 1 April 2019). Officials have also undertaken further analysis of the issue of incorrect ESCT payments by employers, which has indicated the problem may often arise as a result of an employer not determining the correct ESCT rate in the first place, rather than calculating the ESCT deduction incorrectly. As a result, the benefit of collecting ESCT rate information may not be as significant as officials originally considered it to be. Options considered Option A: proceed with all proposals agreed to by Cabinet on 21 March 2019 Under this option no changes would be made to the proposals previously agreed to by Cabinet. This would be undesirable as it would result in concerns about employer compliance costs not being addressed. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Option B: do not proceed with proposals Under this option both the contribution rate change and employer reporting requirement proposals would not be proceeded with. This outcome would be undesirable as it would not address the issues raised in the problem definition in the attached RIA about improving existing information flows to help ensure KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements and giving members more flexibility about how they change their contribution rate. Removing the proposal to allow members to change their contribution rates through a scheme provider or Inland Revenue, would also not recognise this change has received positive feedback from the KiwiSaver industry and KiwiSaver members. Option C: modify proposals to minimise compliance costs and allow for further stakeholder engagement The application date of the proposal to allowing members to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue would be deferred until 1 April 2022 (or an earlier date set by Order in Council). Deferring the application date would enable officials to undertake further consultation with stakeholders to explore concerns raised in more detail and to investigate operational processes that would minimise the compliance cost of this change on employers. The proposal to require employers to report employees’ ESCT rates to Inland Revenue would be removed from the Bill. Based on feedback received about the compliance cost of this change for employers, in addition to the fact further analysis has indicated the root of the problem may not be employers miscalculating ESCT deductions, officials now consider the costs of this change to employers is likely outweigh the benefits to Inland Revenue. Under this option employers would also only be required to report to Inland Revenue the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees (not for existing employee’s where this information has changed since last reported, as was previously proposed). Employer compliance costs would be minimised, as this information would be provided on a “one-off” basis, as part of existing new employee on-boarding processes. While it would still ensure Inland Revenue received the benefit of KiwiSaver income information, which could be used to identify miscalculation of contributions. Proposed approach For the reasons outlined above, the proposed approach is Option C. Stakeholder views The original RIA noted that limited consultation had been a constraint on decision making. The proposal has been revised to incorporate feedback that was subsequently received through targeted consultation (focus groups including employers) and public submissions received by Select Committee. These changes are described in option C above and are expected to reduce compliance costs compared to the original proposal. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing To maximise the administrative efficiencies of the proposals, changes need to align with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation timelines for transferring KiwiSaver into its new administrative system. KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred into START on 1 April 2020. To ensure that policy decisions are taken, and legislation passed in this timeframe, this has created a constraint on the time available to analyse options. Despite this, officials are confident that the proposed approach would be the most effective option to address the problem definition. Consultation and testing Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers. However, as a result of time constraints, wider public consultation was not carried out prior to original Cabinet decisions being made in March 2019. Due to the largely technical administrative nature of the changes proposed, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. Moreover, taken as a whole, the package of options proposed would be beneficial to KiwiSaver members. There would be some compliance costs for employers (they would be required to communicate information they already hold to Inland Revenue, on a one-off basis and apply KiwiSaver employee contribution rates advised by Inland Revenue). Targeted consultation with employers was undertaken subsequent to March 2019 Cabinet decisions being made. Feedback from this consultation has informed officials revising the assessment of certain proposals. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis In relation the proposal to guarantee employer contributions, additional funding is not expected to be required. The primary caveat to this is that it assumes static behaviour. If the introduction of the proposal created a behavioural change amongst employers (that is it results in more unpaid employer contributions), this would increase the fiscal cost of the proposed approach. However, given that levels of employer contribution debt are currently comparable to levels of employee contribution debt (which are already guaranteed), this suggests that the proposal should not have a significant impact on employer’s behaviour. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 12 September 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de finitio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the administration of KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred from its current system to its new administration system on 1 April 2020. This provides an opportunity to make refinements to KiwiSaver settings to improve administrative efficiency and enhance members’ experience with the scheme. The following are areas that would assist in achieving these outcomes: • facilitating the faster transfer of contributions from Inland Revenue to KiwiSaver scheme providers (and between scheme providers); and • improving information flows between members, employers, scheme providers and Inland Revenue. Transfer of contributions Part of Inland Revenue’s role as the central administrator for KiwiSaver, involves receiving KiwiSaver employer and employee contributions from employers and then forwarding these contributions on to KiwiSaver scheme providers. A reduction in the time taken to transfer contributions would improve the efficiency of the central administration of KiwiSaver. Payday filing reforms, which become compulsory from 1 April 2019, will result in Inland Revenue having employer information sooner after a payday (within 2 days of a payday for large employers and with 10 days for smaller employers). This will include information about KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions. The reforms will allow KiwiSaver employee contributions to be passed to scheme providers sooner after a member’s payday. This is because current KiwiSaver settings permit the use of Crown funds to pay employee contributions to scheme providers before contribution amounts have been paid to Inland Revenue by employers (effectively creating a Government guarantee of employee contributions). This Government guarantee does not currently extend to employer contributions. To ensure that the benefits of Inland Revenue being in receipt of earlier payday information are fully realised in relation to KiwiSaver, this RIA considers how to enable Inland Revenue to forward employer contribution amounts to scheme providers as soon as payday reporting information from employers has been received, rather than having to wait until the employer has actually paid the amount of the contribution to Inland Revenue (the current state). This RIA also considers other refinements that would facilitate the faster transfer of contributions. Improving information flows Inland Revenue is in the unique position of having on-going contact with KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers. This means Inland Revenue is able to facilitate the flow of information between relevant KiwiSaver parties (employers, providers and members) and also should have access to information to ensure that members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution entitlements. However, in some instances, Inland Revenue does not have access to sufficient information to effectively police the accuracy of contribution 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE amounts received from employers. This RIA considers refinements that could be made to improve existing KiwiSaver information flows, to help ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements. Consideration is also given to how information flows could be utilised to give members increased flexibility (for example whether the application process for changing an employee contribution rate could be simplified for members). 2.2 Who is affected and how? KiwiSaver members Taken as a whole, KiwiSaver members would benefit from the package of proposals – the changes would result in them earning market investment returns on contributions sooner, help ensure they are receiving the correct contribution amounts and give them additional flexibility in respect of how they can change their contribution rate. KiwiSaver scheme providers KiwiSaver scheme providers would benefit from the faster transfer of contributions, as it would result in them having more funds under management. Schemes have also indicated enabling KiwiSaver contribution rates to be changed through providers, would enhance member-provider relationships. Employers Helping to ensure members are receiving correct contribution amounts, would result in employers being required to communicate some additional information they should already hold to Inland Revenue. While the proposal enabling KiwiSaver members to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, would require employers to deduct employee contributions from salary and wages at rates advised by Inland Revenue. These changes would create additional compliance costs for employers. Inland Revenue The proposals would enhance Inland Revenue’s central administration of KiwiSaver and create administrative savings. As implementation of the proposals would be aligned with Business Transformation, there would be no additional implementation costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the scope for decision making. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 8 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Administration: administrative costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Equity: the option should ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving the correct contribution amounts. • Sustainability: the option should be consistent with wider KiwiSaver settings. Option One: Status quo Administration: The status quo would not reduce administrative costs. Compliance: The status quo would not reduce compliance costs. Equity: The status quo results in some KiwiSaver members not receiving employer contributions that other members are receiving (as a result of employers not paying the correct contribution amounts or not paying employer contribution amounts at all). Sustainability: As far as practical, the KiwiSaver regime settings are intended to facilitate administrative efficiency. The problem definition identifies that there are some aspects of the regime that would be more efficient if subject to further refinements. Option Two: build on payday filing reforms This option would build on the improved information available through payday filing reforms to facilitate the faster transfer of employer contributions to scheme providers and to improve the accuracy of contribution entitlements passed to scheme providers. Specifically, it would involve passing employer contribution amounts to scheme providers based on payday information received by employers, before Inland Revenue had received the contribution amount (essentially a Government guarantee, that would align with the existing treatment of employee contributions). Based on the improved information received through payday filing, this option would also align the commencement of interest paid while contributions are held by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday. 1 Administration: This option would increase administrative efficiency, as employer contributions could be passed to scheme providers sooners. However, as it does not include other administrative enhancements to KiwiSaver, savings may not be maximised. Compliance: This option should make it easier for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver accounts with the KiwiSaver contributions recorded on their payslips (as employer contributions would be passed in full to KiwiSaver providers sooner after the member payday). Consequently, this should also reduce the level of contacts from members to scheme providers. Equity: This option would ensure that all KiwiSaver members receive the employer 1 Currently, interest on employee contributions commences on the 15 th of the month the amount was deducted from the member’s salary or wages and interest on employer contributions commences on the 1 st of the month the contribution amount was paid to Inland Revenue. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE contributions amounts they are entitled to. It would also improve the accuracy of interest paid on contributions by Inland Revenue (the current rules result in under and over payment of interest on employee contributions and under payment of interest on employer contributions). However, this option would not address situations where a member’s employer is incorrectly calculating contributions amounts. Sustainability: This option would ensure that the benefit of information obtained via payday filing reforms were fully utilised in the KiwiSaver context. It would also align the treatment of employer contributions with employee contributions and other PAYE deductions (which are guaranteed). Option Three: Additional transfer, information and administrative refinements In addition to the changes proposed under option 2, this option would use the opportunity created by Business Transformation, to make further refinements to KiwiSaver settings. Refinements aimed at facilitating faster transfers would be to reduce the initial KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months (this would mean initial contributions could be transferred to providers a month earlier) and to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and member information, when a member decides to transfer to a new scheme from 35 to 10 days. The later change would only impact non-default providers, as arrangements with default providers already require them to complete transfers in 10-days. Information flows would be utilised to ensure members were receiving their correct contribution amounts, by requiring employers to provide information to Inland Revenue about the income KiwiSaver contributions have been calculated from, 2 in respect of new employees. To recognise that members will have different first points of contact for information on their KiwiSaver account, this option also proposes that members should be able to apply to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (in addition to their employer). Employers would be advised of the employee’s contribution rate change request by Inland Revenue. As a further administrative refinement, is also proposed that the 3-month grace period – that a person who has been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver has to gain New Zealand residence before their account is shut – be removed. This period has not operated as intended and is not utilised by members. The below analysis of this option against the assessment criteria, identifies impacts that are additional to those set out in the analysis of option 2 above. Administration: Reducing the provisional period and removing the 3-month grace period would increase administrative efficiency. Compliance: The option would reduce compliance costs for members looking to change contribution rates. However, this would increase compliance costs for employers, as they would be required to apply contribution rates advised by Inland Revenue. There would also be some additional compliance costs for scheme providers and employers, relating to the proposals to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and information to a new 2 Some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE are exempt for the purposes of calculating KiwiSaver contribution amounts. Examples includes the value of accommodation and a benefit from an employer share scheme. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE provider when a member transfers schemes and the additional employer information requirements, respectively. Equity: The additional employer information should make it easier for Inland Revenue to identify situations where contribution amounts have been calculated incorrectly. Based on this information it would be possible to follow-up with employers, so these issues could be resolved sooner and would not arise again. Sustainability: This option identifies enhancements to KiwiSaver administrative settings in addition to the changes proposed in option 2 – to maximise improvements to KiwiSaver it would be logical to implement all changes. Implementing a package of changes is also more sustainable in terms of the legislation (as opposed to making singular refinements to KiwiSaver legislative settings on an on-going basis). Other options not considered Aligning payment of KiwiSaver contributions with an employee’s payday As part of the work on the payday filing reforms, consideration was given to the option of employers being required to pay PAYE and other deductions from salary or wages (including KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions) to Inland Revenue to align with an employee’s payday. If employers were required to pay KiwiSaver contribution amounts to Inland Revenue sooner after their employees’ payday, this would facilitate the faster transfer of these contributions to scheme providers. However, the decision was made only to require employers to file information sooner after a member’s payday, as feedback from employers was that requiring them to pay the actual monetary amounts of deductions (including KiwiSaver contributions) in a shorter timeframe would be too onerous comply with. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 3. This package of refinements is comprised of the following proposals: • the Crown funding the payment of employer contribution amounts passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers until these amounts are received from the employer (essentially a Government guarantee of employer contributions); • changing the date the calculation of interest on employer and employee contributions commences, to align with the pay date a member’s employer has reported; • reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months; • reducing the maximum period an old scheme provider has to share information and transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes, from 35-days to 10-days; • allowing members to change contribution rates through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, rather than only through their employer; • removing the 3-month grace period for members who have been incorrectly automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence; and • requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with information about the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees. Of the options considered this package would be most effective in facilitating the faster transfer of contributions to (and between) KiwiSaver scheme providers, and reducing on- going administrative costs for Inland Revenue. It is also the most coherent and equitable option for KiwiSaver members as it will help ensure members are receiving the correct contribution amounts and these contribution entitlements are being passed to scheme providers. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 3 A decrease in interest payable on employee contributions would be expected to be offset by an increase in interest on employer contributions for employees with a payday between the 15 th and 23 rd of the month. Affected parties Comment Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members, scheme providers and employers) KiwiSaver members Aligning KiwiSaver interest payments to a member’s payday would result in a reduction in interest paid on employee contributions for some members with paydays after the 15 th of the month. The impact of this would be small given interest is paid at a rate of 0.72% per annum and would be offset by their contributions earning market investment returns sooner and an increase in interest on employer contributions in many cases. 3 Scheme providers Reducing the time scheme providers have to send members’ information and funds to a new provider in scheme transfer situations from 35-days to 10- days would have compliance costs for non-default providers, who are not already required to comply with the 10- day transfer time. Feedback from providers indicates this would be manageable and would align with industry best practice. Employers Employers would need to provide Inland Revenue with information about the income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from. Compliance costs should be small, as employers would already need to hold this information to accurately calculate contribution amounts and the information would only need to be provided about new employees as part of employee on-boarding processes.

Costs associated with calculating employee contributions from a payday would be negligible (as current under and over payments would broadly offset). Employers Most of the changes would not directly impact employers. The additional employer information requirement may reduce employer contact time with Inland Revenue. (Currently, where it appears employers may have calculated contributions incorrectly, Inland Revenue will contact the employer to obtain the relevant information). Low. Regulators (Inland Revenue) The package of proposals would increase the efficiency of Inland Revenue’s administration of KiwiSaver and create on-going administrative savings. The faster transfer of employer contributions to KiwiSaver providers and reduction of the holding period for initial contributions would decrease KiwiSaver interest payable by Inland Revenue.

There is the potential that the proposal to guarantee employer contributions could have a behavioural impact on employers - that is employer’s may be less likely to pay employer contributions. (While only $2.6 million in employer contribution debt was written-off for the financial year ending 30 June 2018, approximately $2 billion in employer contributions were passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers during this same year). Current levels of employer and employee contribution debt are broadly comparable (as at 30 June 2018, employer contribution debt since the commencement of KiwiSaver was $18 million, while employee contribution debt was $24 million). This suggests that the existing guarantee of employee contributions has had limited behavioural impact on employers and that introducing a guarantee of employer contributions would also have a minimal behavioural impact. Moreover, Inland Revenue has processes to monitor and recover unpaid amounts of employer contributions from employers, which would remain in place after the introduction of this proposal. These include penalties available under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment and the Treasury have been consulted on the proposals and support them. The proposals also reflect feedback on the operation of the KiwiSaver regime from the Financial Markets Authority. Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers (in the form of Business Transformation focused co-design workshops). Providers are supportive of the proposals. Consultation with KiwiSaver members was not undertaken prior to original Cabinet decisions in March 2019. On a whole, the package of changes should be beneficial for KiwiSaver members and given the technical nature of the proposed changes, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. Some subsequent consultation has been undertaken with KiwiSaver members, in the form of focus groups. Participants were supportive of the proposals. The original proposed approach included employers being required to provide Inland Revenue with KiwiSaver income information and ESCT rates for new employees and existing employees where this information had changed since it was last provided. It also included KiwiSaver members being able to change their contribution rate through Inland Revenue or their KiwiSaver scheme provider from 1 April 2020. The impacts of the proposals were not tested with employers prior to original Cabinet decisions in March 2019. However, subsequently targeted consultation has been undertaken with employers and payroll providers (in the form of focus groups). Public submissions have also been received through the Select Committee process. Feedback on the above proposals was that the compliance costs on employers were likely to outweigh the benefit to KiwiSaver members and Inland Revenue. Officials have taken this feedback into account by modifying the additional employer information requirements, so that 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE under the revised approach employers would only be required to provide information about income KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from for new employees (not every time this information changed) and would not be required to report ESCT rates. As a result, the modified reporting requirements could be incorporated into the employee onboarding process, therefore, reducing employer compliance costs. Moreover, the application date for the contribution rate change proposal has been deferred (this change would now apply from 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council). The later application date would enable further consultation with employers and allow time to devise an operational approach that would minimise employer compliance costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 17 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals would require amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation Bill. To align with the transfer of the administration of KiwiSaver from its current operating system into its new operating system, the changes would come into effect from 1 April 2020. The only exception to this would be the proposal to allow members to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue which would apply from 1 April 2022, or an earlier date set by Order in Council. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Aligning implementation of the proposals with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, would mean the cost of system changes would be absorbed into Business Transformation. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 18 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes of the proposals pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Inland Revenue collects KiwiSaver data which could be used to assess the effectiveness of the changes in facilitating the faster transfer of employer contributions and enhancing information flows. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? No formal review is planned. However, the final step in the GTTP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. All KiwiSaver scheme providers have an on-going relationship with Inland Revenue, which includes an annual meeting to discuss policy and operational issues that have arisen over the past year. This would provide an opportunity for scheme providers to give feedback about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:13
Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyers & sellers Sec tio n 1 : Gen er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There are a number of limitations or constraints. These are: •There is no data to confirm that the issues the policy proposals are intending to address are currently a problem. Instead, officials have identified a gap in the current legislation that may be exploited by taxpayers considering recent and ongoing changes to tighten the rules for taxing land disposals. On that basis, officials consider that it is important to address these issues at this time. •Options have been limited to considering making the current framework more effective. Officials did not consider options that would tax more categories of land. •The lack of data on the scope and scale of taxpayer practices and structuring makes it difficult to determine which options best address the problem. •The lack of data means that no qualitative impact analysis is possible. However, problem definition and solutions were subject to targeted and public consultation. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyers & sellers RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. As identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section there is no data to support the current scale of the problem or the impact of the proposed changes if they were 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 2 IN CONFIDENCE enacted. However, the RIA sets out the rationale for why the status quo is an issue and why a regulatory change is preferred. The reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version.

This RIA considers proposals to tighten the rules that apply where people regularly buy and sell land that is used mainly as a home or business premises while it is held by them. Current situation The land sales rules contained in part CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 tax gains from the sale of land when the land is held by a person effectively as trading stock (in the same way that a furniture vendor is taxed on the gains they make from selling their furniture). It is not intended that the rules tax gains on capital assets (e.g. gains from selling the furniture vendor’s shop or a person’s home). However, the rules are drafted quite broadly to ensure that people cannot easily structure around them, which means they can catch some land that is inherently a capital asset. To limit this potential overreach, the rules contain exclusions. Relevantly, the rules exclude from tax gains from the sale of: • a person’s main home, where land sales are subject to tax under the bright-line test 1 (the main home exclusion) • a person’s residence, where land sales are subject to tax because the land was acquired with an intention of disposal, or where the owner or an associated person is in a business involving land (the residential exclusion) • a business premises, where land sales are subject to tax because the land was acquired with an intention of disposal, or where the owner or an associated person is in a business involving land (the business premises exclusion). For example, the land sales rules tax all sales of land by a land dealer, but the exclusions ensure the dealer will not be taxed on the sale of their home. To ensure these exclusions are not abused, they are subject to regular pattern restrictions which stop the exclusions applying where a person has a regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a main home, residence or business premises. The regular pattern restriction in the main home exclusion for the bright-line test is also supplemented by a time- period rule, which states that the main home exclusion will not apply if a person has relied on it twice in the previous two years. These restrictions ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land effectively as trading stock cannot rely on the exclusions to escape tax. Why is the current situation a problem? Given the recent tightening of the land rules 2 there is a concern that taxpayers can avoid the regular pattern restrictions by arranging their affairs so they do not have a pattern of buying and selling main homes, residences or business premises. This is contrary to the policy intention. 1 The bright-line test taxes gains from the sale of residential land acquired and sold within five years. 2 Including the introduction of the bright-line test and the new residential rental ring-fencing rules that only allow deductions to be offset against income derived from land (e.g. rental income). 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 4 IN CONFIDENCE The risk is that the government is missing out on tax revenue from those that are effectively making trading profits from the buying and selling of land, but are relying upon the main home, residential or business premises exclusions to escape tax. Over time there is a risk that greater numbers of investors may become involved in trading homes and business premises to take advantage of the tax-free gains. We are unable to estimate the size of the current tax gap or how this could change with increased investor activity. The general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) will continue to effectively override other provisions of the tax legislation to deny the tax benefits of an arrangement where a more than incidental purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit. In some circumstances the GAAR could be invoked where a taxpayer has structured their affairs in such a way that they have avoided establishing a regular pattern of purchase and sale of home or business premises. However, in many circumstances the GAAR may not be the most effective tool to counter such structuring. It is considered preferable for there to be clarity and transparency in the underlying law to give certainty to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. What is the underlying cause of the problem? Officials have concerns that the current regular pattern restrictions are not working as intended. This undermines the integrity of the tax system by allowing people to take advantage of the exclusions in circumstances where this was not intended. As the restrictions are currently drafted, taxpayers who are undertaking regular buying and selling activity can structure around the regular pattern restrictions in one of two ways. Firstly, the regular pattern restrictions apply quite narrowly to the activities of a single person. This allows taxpayers to circumvent the application of the regular pattern restrictions by buying and selling land using different persons or entities each time (for example, the first property is purchased by the person, the second is purchased by their partner, the third by their family trust). Secondly, the regular pattern restrictions have been interpreted narrowly to apply only when there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This means that the regular pattern restrictions will not apply where a person does something different to each piece of land. For example, the first property is bought, lived in and sold, the second is renovated while it is lived in and sold, or the third is a bare section where a house is built and occupied then sold. Why does it need to be addressed now? The Government has indicated that people who engage in property speculation will come under increasing scrutiny. This is why a review of the land rules was added to the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme earlier in the year. One of the aims of this review is to consider ways to improve the integrity of the tax system. How much confidence is there in the evidence and assumptions for the problem definition? While there is currently no data, to the extent that there is currently a gap in the current land rules, it is reasonable to assume that some investors will look to exploit the existence of tax- free gains. Other context The issues considered in this RIA have been identified as part of a review of the current land tax rules undertaken by Inland Revenue. As part of this review, other regulatory changes 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 5 IN CONFIDENCE have been identified, including: • clarifying the extent to which holding costs (such as interest, rates and insurance) should be deductible when the gain from the sale of private use land (such as a bach) is taxable; and • moving the requirements of the Land Transfer Tax Statement (a form filed with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) when people buy, sell or transfer property) from the Land Transfer Act 2017 to new secondary regulations operated by LINZ to provide a more flexible way to make any future changes to the form. A second tranche of the land review is planned which will include consideration of the following: • extending the bright-line test to farmland and commercial properties; • extending Residential Land Withholding Tax to New Zealand residents; • reviewing the re-zoning rule; • reviewing the land tax frameworks; • considering the introduction of a vacant land tax; and • various compliance and administration matters. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The group of people potentially affected by tightening the rules are taxpayers who regularly buy land to be used mainly as a home or business premises and then sell that land. The proposed regulatory changes seek to clarify and support, rather than depart from, existing policy in the area by ensuring that the regular pattern restrictions apply to people who regularly buy and sell land to stop them escaping tax. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The Government announced in April 2019 that it would not be proceeding with a capital gains tax, but that other initiatives to improve the fairness of the tax system would be considered, including tightening the rules around land speculation and working on ways to counter land banking. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? This RIA deals with proposed regulatory changes to tighten the rules that relate to regular buying and selling of homes and business premises to ensure people cannot escape paying tax by relying on the exclusions where that was not intended. The proposals have arisen in the context of the review of the current land tax rules, to meet the Government’s objectives of improving the efficient use of land, and ensuring that tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourage and support productive investment. All options are assessed against the following criteria: a) Integrity of the tax system: the tax rules should operate so as to collect revenue where intended. b) Effectiveness: the tax rules should produce the right amount of tax at the right time; the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved. c) Fairness: the tax rules should not be arbitrary and should be fair to different taxpayers. d) Certainty and simplicity: the tax rules should be as clear and simple as possible so that taxpayers who attempt to comply with the rules are able to do so. Increasing the integrity of the tax system is a primary objective of these changes. However, it is necessary to balance this objective against ensuring that the rules are effective, fair and balanced, and that they provide certainty and simplicity for taxpayers. Group of persons or entities The current regular pattern restrictions apply when a single person (which includes a company, trust or other entity type) has a pattern of buying and selling. This limited application gives rise to a risk that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions by using other persons or entities to carry out each transaction, rather than carrying out multiple transactions on their own. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo, so the regular pattern restrictions continue to apply only to the actions of a single person. This option undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system because it allows taxpayers to structure around the rules to avoid tax. It also unfair as it benefits those taxpayers who are willing and able to structure around the rules. However, remaining with the status quo could be said to be a simpler option, and would avoid the need for more complex rules. Option 2: Extend the regular pattern restrictions to groups of people The second option is to expand the regular pattern restrictions to apply to groups of people, as follows: 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 7 IN CONFIDENCE • For the residential exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they all occupy all of the properties as their residence, or if the people who occupy all of the properties as their residences control the trusts or other entities that own the properties. • For the business premises exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they are all controlled by the same person or persons (e.g. all the companies have the same shareholders). This option will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. However, these changes will introduce further complexity to the rules. Similar activities The current regular pattern restrictions have been interpreted as only applying when there is a similarity or likeness in the transactions. There is a concern that this allows taxpayers to structure around the regular pattern restrictions by carrying out different activities on each piece of land so there is not sufficient similarity or likeness in the transactions. Option 1: Status quo The first option would be to maintain the status quo. This option undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system because it allows taxpayers to structure around the rules to avoid tax. It is also unfair as it benefits those taxpayers who are willing and able to structure around the rules. Option 2: Focus on regularity of transactions The second option is to amend the rules to capture patterns of buying and selling, with the focus being on the regularity of the transactions, rather than on the similarity or likeness of what is done on the land. This option will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. This option will reduce complexity and add clarity to the legislation by simplifying the factors that must be satisfied before the restriction will apply. Intention test The residential and business premises exclusions currently apply both: • when a person acquired land with a purpose or intention of disposal or for business involving land; and • for disposals of land within 10 years when a person is associated with a person who carries on a business involving land. Therefore, it is possible that the current regular pattern restrictions could result in a person who is associated with a land dealer being taxed on the sale of their home or business premises because they have been forced to move for family or business reasons several times over a couple of years. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 8 IN CONFIDENCE It has been proposed by submitters that the regular pattern restrictions could be limited to situations where the land has been acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo and continue to apply the regular pattern restrictions to situations where a person is associated with a person in a business involving land. In the context of the other proposed amendments, this option has the potential to be unfair, because it risks capturing sales of genuine homes and business premises. The potential for unfairness undermines the integrity of the tax system, and heightens the risk of tax avoidance and evasion as taxpayers seek to escape a tax they consider unfair. However, retaining the status quo could be seen as being simpler as it applies the same rules to all taxpayers who are subject to the exclusions. Option 2: Introduction of intention test The second option is to limit the application of the regular pattern restrictions to situations where the owner of the land acquired it with an intention of disposal. This option improves the integrity of the tax system in that it helps to ensure the rules only operate to collect revenue where intended. It also improves the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by only taxing true revenue gains. The introduction of a further limitation will, however, add some complexity to the rules. Amending the business premises regular pattern restriction The business premises exclusion applies only where the owner of the land mainly uses the land to carry on a substantial business. Because the business premises exclusion is limited in this way, it has been suggested by submitters that it is already hard to structure around and does not require amendment to cover activities by a group of people. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo. This option is simple because it will not require complex grouping rules. However, this option risks allowing taxpayers to structure around the regular pattern restriction, which reduces the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system. It could also be argued that not amending the business premises exclusion if the residential and main home exclusions are amended (as proposed above) would be unfair in that it would allow those owning land for business purposes advantages over those owning land for residential purposes. Option 2: Amend the business premises regular pattern restriction The second option is to amend the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion to apply when a person, or a group of people or entities that are all controlled by a person or group of persons, regularly buy and sell land used as business premises. This option would improve the integrity, effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by ensuring that taxpayers cannot avoid tax by using separate entities to carry on buying and selling activities where those activities would be subject to tax if they were carried on by one 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 9 IN CONFIDENCE person alone. By doing so, it will better ensure that the right amount of revenue is collected over time. This option also improves clarity for taxpayers by clearly indicating activity that should be subject to tax. This option will, however, not be simpler because it will require relatively complex rules to capture the intended group of people or entities. Time-period rule The regular pattern restriction in the main home exclusion for the bright-line test is supplemented by a time-period rule, which states that the main home exclusion will not apply if a person has relied on it twice in the previous two years. This time-period does not appear in the residential and business premises exclusions. To attempt to provide clarity and objectivity, a similar time-period rule could be added to the residential and business premises exclusions. Option 1: Status quo The first option is to maintain the status quo and have no time-period restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions. This option is simple but leaves uncertainty in the rules because the current rules are subjective making them harder to apply. However, this option is more likely to maintain the integrity of the tax system by ensuring that transactions would not be subject to tax simply due to volume. In doing so, it would also ensure that the rules are perceived to be fair. Option 2: Add time period restrictions The second option is to add time-period restrictions (i.e. the exclusions will not apply if they have been used twice in two years) to the residential and business premises exclusions. This option could add clarity to the rules because it would introduce an objective test to apply. However, introducing an extra provision decreases the simplicity of the rules. However, this option could reduce the integrity of the tax system as it risks taxing sales of genuine homes and business premises merely due to the level of transactions undertaken with no consideration given to the person’s intention. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 10 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Officials consider that the following amendments to the regular pattern restrictions are the best options to resolve the issue: Group of persons or entities Recommendation: Option 2 - Extend the regular pattern restrictions to groups of people The regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply to a person or a group of persons that undertake buying and selling activity together: • For the residential exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they all occupy all of the properties as their residence, or if the people who occupy all of the properties as their residences control the trusts or other entities that own the properties. • For the business premises exclusion, a group of people will be undertaking buying and selling activity together if they are all controlled by the same person or persons (e.g. all the companies have the same shareholders). This will protect the integrity and effectiveness of the tax system by ensuring that people cannot structure to avoid their tax obligations. It will also ensure that taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. Similar activities Recommendation: Option 2 - Focus on regularity of transactions The regular pattern restrictions should be extended to apply more broadly to any pattern of buying and selling land used as a residence or business premises. It should not matter whether properties were simply bought and sold, or whether any building or renovation work occurred while the person owned the land. What should be relevant is that there are “regular” transactions (that is, the transactions occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals). This will ensure that the regular pattern restrictions are no longer restricted to applying only where there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This will increase the integrity of the tax system. Intention test Recommendation: Option 2 - Introduce intention test The regular pattern restrictions in the residential and business premises exclusions should be targeted so they only apply where the person acquired the land with an intention of disposal. Expanding the regular pattern restrictions gives rise to an increased risk that they could catch ordinary residential transactions that occur for family reasons, and small businesses who are upgrading as their business grows because the person is, or is associated with, a person in a business involving land. Officials consider that the regular pattern restrictions should be limited to ensure that people who regularly buy and sell land effectively as trading stock cannot use the home or business premise exclusions to escape tax. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 11 IN CONFIDENCE This option improves the integrity of the tax system in that it helps to ensure the rules only operate to collect revenue where intended. It also improves the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system by only taxing true revenue gains. Amending the business premises regular pattern restriction Recommendation: Option 2 - Regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion should be amended The regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion should be amended to apply to activities by a group of people or entities. Under the current rules, a single person cannot escape tax by using land acquired as trading stock as a business premises while they hold it. This outcome should not be able to be structured around by using a group of entities controlled by a person. The proposed changes will ensure this is the case. The main concern raised by submitters appeared to be the concern of overreach. Officials consider that this risk is mitigated by limiting the regular pattern restrictions, so they only apply when land is acquired with an intention of resale. Time-period rule Recommendation: Option 1 - Status quo A time-period rule such as that included in the bright-line main home exclusion is not appropriate for the residential and business premises exclusions. In the context of the bright-line test, which taxes sales without consideration of intention, presuming the exclusion should not apply simply because there were multiple transactions within a defined period can be justified. However, regularity alone should not be enough to give rise to a taxable transaction under the other provisions. Instead, it is important that the owner also has an intention of disposal. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Impac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Taxpayers who regularly buy land, use it as a main home, residence or business premises and then sell it, structuring the transactions around the regular pattern restrictions as the legislation is currently drafted Will need to return the disposal of land for tax purposes.

There are no other identified impacts of this approach. Sec tio n 5: Stak e hold er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Consultation document Officials issued a consultation document “Habitual buying and selling” in September 2019 setting out the issues and proposing possible solutions and asked for taxpayers’ views on the proposals. Prior to releasing the document publicly, officials also tested their thinking with some private sector advisors. Feedback In general, submitters appear to understand officials’ concerns that taxpayers can structure around the regular pattern restrictions, and most supported changes in the area. However, almost all submitters expressed concerns about the potential for overreach from the proposed amendments and, in particular, that the amendments risk taxing transactions that should not be subject to tax (i.e. sales of genuine homes or business premises). Submitters also disagreed with proposals to amend the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion. They submitted there was no evidence of any abuse of that exclusion. Submitters could see that a time-period rule may be useful to supplement the regular pattern restriction in the residential exclusion. However, there was concern that a time-period rule would be arbitrary and could not accommodate factors outside a person’s control. Submitters’ views and concerns were taken into account by officials in forming the preferred views discussed above. In particular, officials addressed submitters’ concerns around overreach i.e. that the proposals risk taxing the sale of homes or business premises for genuine reasons. In response to those concerns, officials propose to target the regular pattern restrictions to situations where there is an intention of resale. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be included in the omnibus tax Bill scheduled to be introduced in early 2020. The changes should apply prospectively, i.e. only properties acquired and sold after the application date would be taxable. However, properties acquired before the application date would be able to be considered for the purposes of determining whether a taxpayer has a regular pattern. Inland Revenue will release details of the Cabinet decision once it is made and further detail will be provided in a commentary released when the Bill is introduced and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the rules. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20 Land tax rules review 2019 – habitual buyes and sellers | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sectio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue undertakes regular review of land transactions via its Property Compliance Programme (PCP), which is aimed at ensuring that those involved in property dealing or speculation pay their fair share of tax. Inland Revenue undertakes regular reporting to government as part of the PCP. Inland Revenue is also developing a Data Intelligence Platform (DIP) to enable right-time interaction and appropriate risk-based interventions, by identifying affected customers, understanding customer behaviours and needs, and highlighting areas of compliance focus as well as policy weakness, including how these matters relate to land. The DIP will be able to pull in relevant sources of data and can be used to identify certain types of customer groups, build customer profiles and understand the problem in a wider context. However, as with any other information system it will be dependent upon the personnel, data available and cases run in order to deliver its potential value. The DIP will continue to be developed to further refine Inland Revenue’s ability to target particular transactions including assisting Inland Revenue in monitoring whether the exclusions are operating as intended, and educating taxpayers on the matter as appropriate. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Inland Revenue would closely monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes as part of the PCP programme. The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. A post-implementation review could occur around two years after the tax year that the amendments first apply. Any recommended changes identified from the review would be considered for potential inclusion on the Government's tax policy work programme. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-12-16 16:19:20
