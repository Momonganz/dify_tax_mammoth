1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. At the back of this TIB there is a page listing draft binding rulings that Inland Revenue will soon be finalising. You can use that page to order copies of any of those drafts if you want to comment on them before we finalise them. National Mutual policyholders Summary of product ruling BR Prd 95/4 This summary of product ruling BR Prd 95/4 does not form part of the ruling. Introduction In August 1995, policyholders of National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited (“NM Life”) voted to amend the articles of association of NM Life. The change to the articles of association results in policy- holders losing certain rights they have in NM Life (including the right to vote at general meetings and the right to participate in any surplus on winding up). In exchange for giving up their rights in NM Life, the policyholders obtain the right to receive shares (or cash from the sale of the shares) in National Mutual Hold- ings Limited (“NMH”). It is intended that the policy- holders will receive the shares (or the cash) in approxi- mately two years from the vote to amend NM Life’s articles of association. A number of questions arise as to whether there are any tax consequences as a result of the policyholders giving up their rights in NM Life and receiving shares (or cash from the sale of the shares) in NMH. A product ruling has been sought on some of these questions. The ruling Essentially, the ruling explains that there will be no tax consequences for the vast majority of policyholders as a result of the arrangement whereby they receive shares in NMH (or cash from the sale of the shares). In particu- lar: • The issue of shares by NMH to policyholders will not be assessable as a dividend. • For those policyholders who elect to receive cash rather than shares, the cash payment will not be assessable income as long as the cash payment does not exceed the value of the shares to which they would otherwise have been entitled. • The arrangement whereby the policyholders give up rights and ultimately receive shares in NMH will not give rise to rise to “accrual” income. • The policyholders will not be liable to pay gift duty. The product ruling, together with an analysis of the ruling, follows. The Commissioner must follow the ruling if NM Life policyholders apply the tax laws in the way stated in the ruling. National Mutual policyholders Product ruling - BR Prd 95/4 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of: • Section CE 1 (1)(c). • Section CF 1. • Section HH 6 (1). • The definition of “corpus” in section OB 1. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) • The definition of “qualifying trust” in section OB 1. • The definition of “unit trust” in section OB 1. • Section 61 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Arrangement to which this ruling applies The arrangement is that whereby policyholder members (“PHMs”) of National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited (“NM Life”) agree to extinguish certain ownership rights they have in NM Life in exchange for shares in Na- tional Mutual Holdings Limited (“NMH”). This arrangement can be described as the demutualisation of NM Life. This arrangement will be effected by the follow- ing steps: 1. NMH is established by incorporation in Australia. NMH will issue five shares, initially to five individual shareholders. 2. A trust (“the voting trust”) is established with an Australian resident trustee. The trust is established for the benefit of all eligible PHMs (that includes New Zealand resident PHMs) of NM Life. The voting trust will purchase the five NMH shares from the five individual shareholders. The five shares have two special rights as follows: • The right to control 60% of the votes in a general meeting. • The right to direct that NMH use its share premium account to issue shares to NM Life PHMs. 3. A Deed of Entitlement is executed by NMH, AXA Societe Anonyme (“AXA”) a non-New Zealand resident, and the trustee of the voting trust. Under the Deed of Entitlement, the parties give undertakings to NM Life PHMs that if the PHMs agree to amend NM Life’s articles of association to allow for the demutualisation, PHMs will receive shares in NMH when NMH lists on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges. This listing will occur approxi- mately two years from the vote by the PHMs to demutualise NM Life. Under a Supplemental Deed, NMH and NM Life agree that, for the purposes of the definition of “core acquisition price” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the lowest price for the ownership rights the PHMs have in NM Life shall be an amount equal to the consideration provided for those rights (the consideration being rights the PHMs obtain under the voting trust and under the Deed of Entitlement, and the conversion of those rights into fully paid shares in NMH). 4. PHMs vote to amend NM Life’s articles of association. Essentially, the amendment means that the PHMs ownership rights in NMH Life are extin- guished and that NM Life is able to issue shares. 5. NMH will issue fully paid and partly paid shares to AXA. AXA will pay a premium for these shares. The shares will give AXA 40% of the voting rights in NMH that will increase to 51% once the partly paid shares are paid up. 6. NM Life will issue 100% of its share capital to NMH. NMH will use part of the funds it has arising from the premium paid by AXA to pay for the shares in NM Life. 7. Approximately two years from the amendment of NM Life’s articles of asso- ciation, NMH will be publicly floated. One of two things will happen: • Eligible PHMs in NM Life will be invited to apply for one ordinary share each in NMH. The PHMs will apply for one ordinary share each and the amount due on the shares will be paid by AXA. Following the issue of one ordinary share to each PHM, NMH will issue a number of fully paid shares (“the issue of shares”) to the PHMs. The number of shares issued will depend on the type of NM Life policy held by the particular PHM. The from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) issue of shares by NMH will be funded from the premium paid by AXA for its NMH shares. • For those eligible PHMs who do not apply for shares in NMH, the trustee of a trust (“the sale trust”) will apply for one ordinary share on behalf of each such PHM. A separate trust will be formed for each PHM who does not apply for shares. Following the issue of one ordinary share to the trustee of the sale trusts on behalf of each PHM who does not apply, NMH will issue a number of fully paid shares (“the issue of shares”). The trustee of the sale trust will sell all of the shares held, invest the proceeds pending distribution, and distribute the proceeds to the relevant PHMs. Under the sale trust deed, the PHMs cannot direct the trustee to transfer the shares or proceeds to them at any particular stage. 8. Once all shares have been issued, either to PHMs or to the trustee of the sale trust, the special rights attached to the five shares held by the trustee of the voting trust extinguish. The voting trust is wound up and the shares sold or distributed in specie to NM Life’s Staff Superannuation Fund. 9. AXA will pay the amount due on the partly paid shares in NMH which will increase their voting rights to 51%. Other facts and details relating to the arrangement are contained in the Explana- tory Memorandum dated 13 June 1995 issued by NM Life to its PHMs. Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumptions that: • NMH will not make an election under section CF 8 (a) that the issue of shares will be a taxable bonus issue. • The value of the NMH shares attributable to the PHM who is the beneficiary of any particular sale trust would not constitute assessable income if distrib- uted to the PHM rather than to the trustee of the sale trust. • All trustee income of the sale trusts will be liable for income tax in New Zealand where the PHM beneficiary is a New Zealand resident. • The obligations of the trustees of the sale trust in respect of their liability for New Zealand taxation will be satisfied. The period for which the ruling applies This ruling applies from 8 August 1995 to 8 August 1998. The ruling The issue of shares by NMH to NM Life PHMs The issue of shares by NMH to NM Life PHMs who are eligible to receive the shares under the Deed of Entitlement will not be assessable as a dividend under section CF 1. The extinguishment of NM Life PHMs ownership rights in NM Life in exchange for shares in NMH The agreement by NM Life PHMs to extinguish their ownership rights in NM Life in exchange for rights under the voting trust and the Deed of Entitlement and ultimately shares in NMH will not give rise to income under the qualified accruals rules under section CE 1 (1)(c). The voting trust The voting trust is not a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) The sale trusts The sale trusts are not “unit trust\[s\]” as defined in section OB 1. The sale trusts established for New Zealand resident NM Life PHMs are subject to the trust taxation regime in subpart H and, as such: • The “corpus”, as defined in section OB 1, of each sale trust will be an amount equal to the market value of the NMH shares issued to the trustee as at the date of issue. • Any distribution made to the beneficiaries will not be taxable in their hands to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the corpus of the relevant sale trust. • Each sale trust will be a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1. • The ordering rules in section HH 6 (1) will not apply to distributions made by the trustee of each sale trust. The payment by AXA of the amount due upon application by NM Life PHMs (or by the trustee of the sale trusts) for one ordinary share in NMH The amount paid by AXA on behalf of PHMs who have each applied for one ordinary share in NMH (or the amount paid by AXA on behalf of the trustee of the sale trust for those PHMs who do not personally apply) is not a dutiable gift and is not subject to gift duty under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Signed Simon Sherry Rulings Analysis of product ruling BR Prd 95/4 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background A ruling has been requested that relates to a number of issues arising as a consequence of the demutualisation of National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited (“NM Life”). The issues are discussed under the following headings: • The issue by National Mutual Holdings Limited (“NMH”) of fully paid shares to NM Life policyholder members (“PHMs”). • The agreement by NM Life PHMs to extinguish ownership rights in NM Life in exchange for rights under the voting trust and the Deed of Entitlement and ultimately shares in NMH. • The voting trust. • The sale trusts. • The payment by AXA of amounts due upon applica- tion by NM Life PHMs (or by the trustee of the sale trusts) for one ordinary share in NMH.

The question arises as to whether the issue of shares is assessable as a dividend. The ruling states that the issue of shares to NM Life PHMs who are eligible to receive the shares under the Deed of Entitlement will not be assessable as a divi- dend. Discussion Under section CF 1, dividends are included within the assessable income of any person. Section CF 2 defines the meaning of the term “dividends”. Section CF 3 sets out a number of exclusions from the term “dividends”. Of particular note, section CF 2 (1)(f) includes within the term “dividends”, any “taxable bonus issue”. Section CF 3 (1)(a) excludes from the term “dividends” any “non-taxable bonus issue”. Section OB 1 defines “bonus issue”, in relation to a company, to mean: (a) The issue of shares in a company ... where the company receives no consideration (other than an election by the shareholder not to receive money or money’s worth as an alternative to the issue) for the issue ... Section OB 1 defines a “taxable bonus issue” to mean: (a) Any bonus issue in lieu: (b) Any bonus issue that the company elects in accordance with section CF 8 (a) ... to be a bonus issue that will be treated as a dividend for the purposes of this Act. Section OB 1 defines a “non-taxable bonus issue” to mean: any bonus issue ... (b) In respect of which the company fails to make any election under section CF 8 There are two possible approaches to reaching the decision that the issue of shares is not a dividend. The approach taken depends on whether the issue of shares is characterised as a “bonus issue” as defined in section OB 1. The first approach is that the issue of shares is, in the first instance, a “bonus issue” as defined in section OB 1. This approach takes the view that NMH does not receive any consideration for the issue of shares. Given that the issue of shares by NMH is not a bonus issue in lieu and assuming that NMH does not make an election under section CF 8 to treat the issue of shares as a taxable bonus issue, the issue of shares will be a non- taxable bonus issue. As a non-taxable bonus issue, the issue of shares is excluded from being a dividend. The alternative approach is that the issue of shares is not a “bonus issue” because NMH does receive consid- eration for the issue of shares. The issue of shares therefore falls outside the definition of “bonus issue”. Because the issue of shares is not a bonus issue, the issue of shares cannot be a “non-taxable bonus issue” and is not specifically excluded from the definition of “dividends” under section CF 3 (1)(a). As a conse- quence, the issue of shares could potentially be a dividend if the issue of shares falls within paragraphs (a) to (l) of the definition of “dividends” in section CF 2 (1). However, it is the Commissioner’s view that the issue of shares does not fall within any of these para- graphs and, as such, will not be assessable income under section CF 1. The Commissioner does not need to form a view on which approach is correct (and whether NMH does receive consideration for the issue of shares). This is not necessary because the end result is the same, i.e., the issue of shares to NM Life PHMs is not a dividend. The extinguishment of NM Life PHMs ownership rights in NM Life in exchange for shares in NMH Under the Deed of Entitlement, NMH, AXA and the trustee of the voting trust undertake with each NM Life PHM, in consideration of the PHMs voting to amend the articles of association of NM Life to: • Issue one ordinary share in NMH upon receiving an application from each PHM (or from the trustee of the sale trusts); and • Issue a number of fully paid shares in NMH to each PHM (or to the trustee of the sale trusts). The amendment to NM Life’s articles of association results in the extinguishment of certain ownership rights each PHM has in NM Life. In particular, the rights of PHMs to vote at general meetings and to vote on a change to the articles of association are removed. Also, a provision is inserted stating that only sharehold- ers may vote at general meetings. It is planned that the shares will be issued to the PHMs (or the trustee of the sale trusts) approximately two years from the alteration of the articles of association when NMH lists on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges. The question arises as to whether the demutualisation and the eventual receipt by PHMs of shares in NMH give rise to income under the accruals rules for PHMs. The ruling states that no income under the accruals rules will arise for PHMs by virtue of the PHMs agree- ing to extinguish their ownership rights in NM Life in exchange for rights under the voting trust and the Deed of Entitlement and ultimately shares in NMH. Discussion Section CE 1 (1)(c) includes within the assessable income of any person: continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) “Unit holders” is defined in section OB 1: in relation to any unit trust, means any person who holds a beneficial interest in the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trusts governing that unit trust Section HE 1 sets out certain income tax consequences of a scheme or arrangement being included within the definition of unit trust in section OB 1. Some of these consequences are: • The unit trust is deemed to be a company; and • The interests of the unit holders in the unit trust are deemed to be shares in the company; and • The unit holders are deemed to be shareholders in the company. The purpose of the voting trust is to protect the interests of NM Life PHMs through the holding, by the trustee of the voting trust, of the majority of voting interests in NMH. The voting trust is not a unit trust because it is not a scheme or arrangement that provides facilities for the beneficiaries to participate as subscribers, purchas- ers or contributors. The beneficiaries are not required to contribute anything to the trust. The sale trusts Sale trusts will be established for the benefit of those NM Life PHMs who do not personally apply for shares in NMH. A sale trust will be set up for each NM Life PHM who does not apply for NMH shares. The sale trust will not operate as a global trust for all NM Life PHMs who do not apply for shares. The trustee of each sale trust will: • Apply for one ordinary share on behalf of each NM Life PHM who has not personally applied for the share. • Receive the fully paid ordinary shares that are issued by NMH following the issue of the one ordinary share. The number of shares issued will depend on the particular NM Life policy held by the relevant PHM. • Sell all of the NMH shares held on behalf of each PHM as soon as practicable for the best price reason- ably obtainable. • Invest the sale proceeds pending distribution. • Distribute the sale proceeds to the NM Life PHM. The question arises as to whether each sale trust is a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1. If each sale trust is not a “unit trust”, certain questions arise as to the income tax treatment of distributions from the sale trusts. The ruling states that the sale trusts established for New Zealand resident NM Life PHMs are not unit trusts. The sale trusts established for New Zealand resident NM Life PHMs will be subject to the ordinary trust taxation regime set out in subpart H. In relation to this regime, the ruling states, on the basis of the assumptions made, that: Income derived or deemed to be derived under the qualified accruals rules: Generally speaking, income could be derived or deemed to be derived under the qualified accruals rules if the consideration paid to the NM Life PHMs for their ownership rights in NM Life exceeds the “acquisition price” as defined in section OB 1. A key element in the calculation of the “acquisition price” refers to: The lowest price that the parties would have agreed upon for the property that is the subject of the agreement for the sale and purchase of property ... (... the “specified property”) at the time at which the agreement for the sale and purchase of property was entered into ... on the basis of payment in full at the time at which the first right in the specified property is to be transferred. A Supplemental Deed executed by NM Life and NMH essentially provides that the value of shares issued to the PHMs will be equal to the lowest price that the parties would have agreed on the basis of payment in full at the time the PHMs ownership rights in NM Life are extinguished. As a result, no accrual income will arise under section CE 1 (1)(c). The voting trust As part of effecting the demutualisation of NM Life, the trustees of a trust (“the voting trust”) will purchase the five shares issued by NMH. These five shares have the right to control 60% of the votes in a general meeting of NMH and the right to direct that the share premium account of NMH be applied to make an issue of shares to NM Life PHMs. These rights are intended to protect NM Life PHMs in the period from the commencement of demutualisation to the listing of NMH’s shares on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges, i.e., the trustee of the voting trust will hold voting rights in NMH in trust for the PHMs. Once all the NMH shares that PHMs are entitled to are issued, the special rights attached to the shares held by the trustee of the voting trust are extinguished. It is contemplated that the voting trust will be wound up and the five shares either sold or distributed in specie to the residual beneficiary (the NM Life Staff Superannuation Fund). The question arises as to whether the voting trust is a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1. If the voting trust is a “unit trust”, then this has consequences for the beneficiaries because the voting trust will, generally speaking, be treated as a company for income tax purposes. The ruling states that the voting trust is not a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1. Discussion “Unit trust” is defined in section OB 1 as: any scheme or arrangement ... that is made for the purpose of or has the effect of providing facilities for the participation, as beneficiaries under a trust, by subscribers, purchasers, or contributors, in income or gains (whether in the nature of capital or income) arising from the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trust ... from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) • The “corpus” of each sale trust will be an amount equal to the market value of the NMH shares issued to the trustee of the sale trusts as at the date of issue. • Any distribution made to the beneficiaries will not be taxable in their hands to the extent that the distribu- tion does not exceed the corpus of the relevant sale trust. • Each sale trust will be a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1. • The ordering rules in section HH 6 (1) will not apply to distributions made by the trustee of each sale trust. Discussion The definition of “unit trust” is set out under the discussion relating to the voting trust above. The definition of “unit trust” requires that facilities are provided for participation by beneficiaries in income and gains. In this case, the element of participation is absent as each NM Life PHM will be a beneficiary under a separate trust. Furthermore, each PHM will be absolutely entitled to the entire share proceeds and any investment income as and when it is derived. Given that the sale trusts are not unit trusts, they will be subject to the ordinary trust taxation regime set out in subpart H. The ruling makes four statements in relation to the application of the trust taxation regime. That the “corpus” of each sale trust will be an amount equal to the market value of the NMH shares issued to the trustee as at the date of issue The definition of “corpus” in section OB 1 means an amount equal to the market value at the date of settle- ment of any property settled on the trust. The property settled on each sale trust will be the NMH shares to which the NM Life PHM is entitled to (and that the trustee of the sale trust applies for on behalf of the PHM). However, there are a number of exclusions from the definition of “corpus” in section OB 1. One of the exclusions, set out in paragraph (b) of the definition, is for a settlement of property which property would have, but for the settlement, have constituted assessable income of the settlor. It is possible that the shares settled on the sale trusts could constitute assessable income of a small minority of NM Life PHMs if the settlement was not made. For this reason, the ruling makes an assumption that the exclusion set out in paragraph (b) does not apply. That any distribution made to the beneficiaries will not be taxable in their hands to the extent that the distribu- tion does not exceed the corpus of the relevant sale trust Section HH 3 states: The assessable income of any person in any income year includes any beneficiary income and any taxable distribution derived by that person in that income year. Section OB 1 provides the following definitions: “Beneficiary income” in relation to any person who is beneficiary of a trust for any income year, means income derived during that income year by a trustee of the trust which - (a) during that income year vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary; or (b) Is paid or applied by the trustee to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during, or within 6 months after the end of, that income year ... “Taxable distribution” ... in relation to any income year and any trust (being in that income year a trust that is a non- qualifying trust or a foreign trust ...) ... A distribution from a sale trust representing the corpus of the trust will be neither beneficiary income (because it is not income derived by a trustee) nor a taxable distribution (because the trust is a qualifying trust - see below). As such, distributions, to the extent they represent corpus, will not be assessable income in the hands of the beneficiaries. Each sale trust will be a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1 “Qualifying trust” is defined in section OB 1 as: In relation to any trust ... and any income year in which a distribution is made from that trust, means any trust where all trustee income derived by the trustee of that trust in income years commencing with the income year in which a settlement was first made to or for the benefit of that trust or on the terms of that trust until the income year in which the distribution is made has been liable under this Act to New Zealand income tax ... and all the trustee’s obligations under this Act in respect of the trustee’s liability to New Zealand income tax have been satisfied. “Trustee income” is defined in section OB 1 as: in relation to any trust and any income year, means income derived in that income year by a trustee of that trust that is not beneficiary income for any beneficiary of that trust. Essentially, a trust will be a “qualifying trust” if all trustee income has been liable for New Zealand income tax and if all the trustee’s obligations in respect of his or her liability to New Zealand income tax have been satisfied. For this reason, the ruling assumes that all trustee income of the sale trusts will be liable for income tax in New Zealand where the NM Life PHM benefici- ary is a New Zealand resident. The ruling also assumes that the trustee’s obligations in respect of his or her liability to New Zealand income tax will have been satisfied. Based on these assumptions, the sale trusts will be “qualifying trusts” as defined in section OB 1. That the ordering rules in section HH 6 (1) will not apply to distributions made by the trustee of each sale trust Section HH 6 (1) deems distributions from trusts to consist of certain amounts according to the ordering rules set out in that section. However, by virtue of continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (“the EGDA”). Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on every “dutiable gift”. “Dutiable gift” is defined in section 63(1) to include and consist of: (a) All the property, wherever situated, comprised in any gift made by any donor to any donee, where the donor is domiciled in New Zealand at the date of the gift or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand: (b) All the property, situated in New Zealand, comprised in any gift made by any donor to any donee, where the donor is domiciled out of New Zealand at the date of the gift, or is a body corporate incorporated out of New Zealand. AXA is neither domiciled nor incorporated in New Zealand. Therefore, the gift could only be a dutiable gift under section 63(1)(b). However, the gift, being the payment of money by AXA to NMH, will be made in Australia through NMH’s bank account. The property comprised in the gift will not, therefore, be situated in New Zealand at the date of the gift and is, therefore, not dutiable. Employee share purchase scheme Product binding ruling published in Gazette The following notice of the issue of a product ruling appeared in the New Zealand Gazette of 28 September 1995. Notice of product ruling 1. This is a notice of a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2. Product ruling No. 95/3 was issued on 30 August 1995. It relates to an employee share purchase scheme and sections BB 4 and CH 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 3. A copy of the ruling may be obtained by writing to the Manager (Systems), Rulings Directorate, Na- tional Office, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington. section HH 6 (2)(a), the ordering rules in section HH 6 (1) do not apply to any distribution from a qualifying trust. As explained above, the sale trusts will be qualify- ing trusts and will therefore not be subject to the rules set out in section HH 6 (1). The payment by AXA of amount due upon application by NM Life PHMs (or by the trustee of the sale trusts) for one ordinary share One ordinary share in NMH will be applied for either by each NM Life PHM personally, or by the trustee of the sale trusts for those NM Life PHMs who do not person- ally apply. AXA Societe Anonyme (“AXA”) will pay the amount due on the one ordinary share on behalf of the PHMs (or on behalf of the trustee of the sale trusts). The question arises as to whether the amount of money paid by AXA is subject to gift duty. The ruling states that the amount of money paid by AXA is not a dutiable gift and is not subject to gift duty from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Policy statements This section of the TIB contains policy statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. Record keeping requirements: goods or services costing $50 or less Summary This item states the Commissioner’s policy on the goods and services tax (GST) record keeping requirements for goods or services costing $50 or less. A registered person who buys goods and services costing $50 or less must keep sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to readily ascertain the GST payable by that person. As a minimum, the Commis- sioner requires the registered person to record the date, description, cost, and supplier of all purchases. Ideally, supporting documentation, such as an invoice or receipt, will indicate if the supplier charged GST. The Commissioner may disallow the GST input tax deduction on the purchase of a service or non-second- hand good if he establishes that the supplier was not registered for GST. Therefore, Inland Revenue advises registered persons purchasing goods or services to be wary of receipts and invoices that do not clearly show whether GST has been charged. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Background Some registered persons mistakenly believe that they do not need to keep records of purchases for GST purposes if the cost of the purchase is $50 or less. However, general record keeping requirements still apply. The misconception seems to have arisen because strict rules requiring the retention of tax invoices only apply for transactions exceeding $50. If a purchaser of goods or services costing over $50 does not hold a tax invoice (or for secondhand goods purchased that are not liable to GST, detailed records of the purchase), the GST legislation normally does not allow an input tax deduc- tion. Legislation Section 24 specifies when a supplier must provide a tax invoice and also what details a tax invoice must contain. Section 24(7) imposes special record keeping require- ments on the purchase of secondhand goods that have no GST charged on their supply. However, none of the record keeping requirements imposed by section 24 apply if the cost of a purchase is $50 or less. Section 75 imposes general GST record keeping re- quirements that apply to all transactions. Section 75(3) states: Subject to subsections (4) and (5) of this section, every registered person who supplies in New Zealand goods and services shall keep in New Zealand copies of records issued by that registered person, and sufficient records in the English language to enable ready ascertainment by the Commissioner or any officer authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf, of that person’s liability to tax and shall retain in New Zealand all such records for a period of at least 7 years after the end of the taxable period to which they relate: ... Section 75(2) states: Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the records required to be kept and retained, pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, shall contain- (a) A record of all goods and services supplied by or to that registered person showing the goods and services, and the suppliers or their agents, in sufficient detail to enable the goods and services, the suppliers, or the agents to be readily identified by the Commissioner, and all invoices, tax invoices, credit notes, and debit notes relating thereto; and ... Section 75 is similar to section 22 of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994 (section 428, Income Tax Act 1976) which governs record keeping for income tax. Section 22(2) of the Tax Administration Act states: Subject to subsections (3), (4), and (6) of this section, every person who- (a) Carries on any business in New Zealand: ... shall keep in New Zealand sufficient records in the English language to enable ascertainment readily by the Commis- sioner, or any other officer authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf, of- (g) The assessable income derived by that person ... ; and (h) The deductions allowable in the calculating of that assessable income; ... continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) missioner will allow the registered person to claim the input tax deduction and will attempt to recover the GST from the supplier. Registered persons making purchases should therefore be wary of receipts and invoices that do not clearly show whether the supplier charged GST. Example 1 Mr A is a GST registered self-employed consultant. On 6 May 1995 he uses a taxi to get to the premises of one of his clients. Mr A pays the fare of $23.50 in cash. The taxi company provides him with a receipt that gives the name of the taxi company, a GST number, and states “Fare (incl GST): $23.50”. Mr A’s accountant later records the date of the transaction, a description, the price paid and the name of the taxi company. The receipt is also kept. Mr A has more than met the income tax and GST record keeping requirements for his taxi ride. Further, the taxi company clearly represented that GST was charged. Mr A can therefore safely claim an input tax deduction for the GST paid on the taxi fare. Example 2 Mrs F is a small retailer registered for GST who sells arts and crafts. She regularly buys new items costing less than $50 from a local supplier, Mr G. She records each purchase in a cash book and retains the receipt given by Mr G. The receipt states that the price “includes GST if applicable” but gives no GST number. Mrs F assumes that Mr G is registered for GST and claims an input tax deduc- tion for the assumed GST component of the pur- chases. Inland Revenue audits Mrs F. Although the auditor accepts that Mrs F’s records are adequate for income tax and GST purposes, further checking reveals that Mr G is not registered for GST. The items purchased from Mr G were new (so no secondhand goods input tax deduction can be claimed) and Mr G was not clearly representing that GST was charged, so the Commissioner disallows all the input tax deductions Mrs F claimed on her purchases from Mr G. Trust disclosure requirements Summary This item outlines the circumstances when a settlor or nominee settlor must disclose information about a trust to the Commissioner, and what information must be provided. Disclosure is required when there are no resident trustees. These disclosure requirements do not apply to superan- nuation funds. Legislation The requirements discussed in this item are found in section 59 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section HH 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 27 allows the Commissioner to make an assess- ment showing the amount of GST considered payable by certain persons, including a non-registered person who represents that tax is charged on a supply. Section 27(6) states: For the purposes of this Part and Parts III, VI, and X of this Act, where- (a) A person, not being a registered person, supplies goods and services and represents that tax is charged on that supply; ... that person shall be deemed to be a registered person and any tax represented to be charged on the relevant supply by that person shall be tax payable by that person. Policy Persons registered for GST must keep a record of all purchases made that are related to their taxable activity. For all purchases costing $50 or less, the GST legisla- tion imposes general record keeping requirements that are similar to the income tax record keeping require- ments. The Commissioner generally expects that registered persons will, as a minimum, keep a record of the following details: • purchase date • a description of the goods or services purchased • purchase price • supplier’s name. The onus is on registered persons to demonstrate that their GST position is correct, so they should also keep any supporting documentation such as invoices, vouch- ers, or receipts (if obtained). Ideally, the supporting documentation will show whether the supplier was registered for, and charged, GST. This will give the registered person a sound basis for claiming an input tax deduction when the purchase is treated as including GST. If the Commissioner finds that a registered person has claimed an input tax deduction on the purchase of a service or non-secondhand good, and the supplier of that good or service was not registered for GST, the Commissioner may disallow the input tax deduction. However, if the non-registered supplier clearly repre- sented that GST was charged on the supply, the Com- from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Cross-reference table Tax AdministrationIncome Tax Act 1976 Act 1994 59(1)231(2) 59(2)231(3) 59(4)231(6) 199416 222(3)427(3) Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 HH 7231(4) OB 1226(2) When disclosure is required 1. When a settlor is resident and there is no resident trustee at the time of settlement, the settlor must make a disclosure within three months of the date of settlement. (The meaning of “settlor” is discussed below.) The Commissioner’s policy on residence is discussed in PIB 180 (June 1989). 2. When the settlor is resident, and, at any time after settlement of a trust there is no resident trustee, the settlor must make a disclosure within three months of the date on which the trust ceased to have a resident trustee. 3. When a person who is New Zealand resident makes a settlement on a trust: •as nominee for another person; or •of a nominal amount at the request of another person, and there is no resident trustee at the time of settle- ment, that person must make a disclosure within three months of the date of settlement. Information to be disclosed The settlor or nominee must disclose all of the following information: • details of the settlement, including the date of the original settlement and the dates of any subsequent settlements • the market value of the property transferred • any consideration received by the settlor for the property • the trustee’s name and address • the beneficiary’s name and address • a copy of the trust deed • if a nominee is required to make a disclosure, the name and address of the person for whom the nomi- nee is acting • any further details the Commissioner requires. If the property settled includes land, shares, financial arrangements, or the provision of services for less than market value, the settlor must also disclose: • land - the legal description and the location of the property • shares - the number, type, the name of the company, and its country of incorporation • financial arrangements - the holder and issuer, and interest rate and term • services - the nature of the service and consideration paid. Who is a settlor “Settlor” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. A settlor includes someone who does any of the following to or for the benefit of a trust for less than market value: • makes any disposition of property • makes any property available (including financial assistance) • provides any service. Any person who acquires property or obtains the use of services from a trust for greater than market value is also a settlor. See the Appendix to TIB Volume One, No. 5 (Novem- ber 1989) for a detailed discussion of “settlors” and other aspects of the trust rules. Disclosure form The information must be disclosed using an IR 6D form. When a disclosure is required, the person making the disclosure must include the IR 6D form with the trust’s IR 6 income tax return. Some additional disclosures are required on the IR 6D form, relating to rights held in foreign entities and certain sales of property. Failure to disclose If a disclosure is not made, or if insufficient information is supplied, the Commissioner may determine the amount of trustee income for the income year in a fair and reasonable manner. Penalties may also be charged for non-disclosure or knowingly giving any false information. The penalties are a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for up to two years, or both. A person who aids, abets, or incites either of these offences is liable to the same penalties. These offences and penalties are set out in sections 199 and 222(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Imputation - carrying forward unused credits Summary This item sets out the tax treatment when a company in a tax loss situation receives an imputed dividend. A credit will arise in the loss company’s imputation credit account when the dividend is paid. To the extent that the company’s existing tax losses mean that the imputa- tion credit is not fully utilised, a loss is deemed to occur. The company may carry this loss forward. This does not affect the balance in the company’s imputation credit account. All legislative references in this item are to Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background Under the imputation system, a company may allocate the tax it pays on its income to its shareholders by attaching imputation credits to the dividends it pays. Both the dividends and the imputation credits attached to the dividends are included in the shareholders’ assessable income, and the shareholders are allowed to offset the imputation credit against their income tax liability. The credits are not refundable to shareholders, but to the extent to which the imputation credit is not credited in payment of income tax, a deemed loss to the shareholder arises. Inland Revenue has received a number of questions about the correct tax treatment of imputation credits attached to dividends paid to a shareholder that is a company when that company is in a tax loss situation. Specifically, we have been asked whether a company may choose whether or not to convert unused credits into a loss, rather than retaining the credit in its imputa- tion account. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 CB 10 (2)63(2K) LB 2 (3)394ZE(3) ME 4 (1)(d)394D(1)(d) Section LB 2 (3) states: There shall be no refund to a taxpayer of any of a credit of tax under this section, but where the whole of the credit of the tax is not credited in payment of the income tax payable by the taxpayer for the income year - (a) The taxpayer shall, in respect of any amount of the credit that is not so credited, be deemed to have incurred, on the date upon which the dividend to which the imputation credit was attached was paid, an amount of loss for the income year that may- (i) To the extent permitted by sections IE 1 and IF 1, be carried forward and deducted from or set off against the assessable income of a succeeding income year; and (ii) To the extent permitted by section IG 2, be deducted from or set off against the assessable income of another company for that or any succeeding income year; and (b) The amount of any such loss that may be so carried forward or deducted or set off shall be an amount calcu- lated in accordance with the following formula: a b where- a is the amount of the credit of tax not credited in payment of income tax payable for the income year; and b is- (i) In any case where the taxpayer is a company, the rate of resident companies’ income tax, expressed as a percentage, stated in clause 5 of Part A of Schedule 1 and applying for the income year ... Application When a company receives a dividend with imputation credits attached, a credit arises to the company’s imputation credit account. If the company is in a tax loss situation, it will not be able to use all of the credits to pay tax as its losses will reduce the amount of tax to pay. Section LB 2 (3) states that the unused credit cannot be refunded. However, section LB 2 (3) deems the company to have incurred a loss in respect of any unused imputation credits. Under section LB 2 (3)(a)(i), the company can carry forward these losses and deduct them from its assessable income in subsequent income years. Alternatively, section LB 2 (3)(a)(ii) permits the losses to be deducted or set off against the assessable income of a company in the same group. Section LB 2 (3)(b) provides the formula for working out the loss to be carried forward. The loss is calculated using the formula: a b In this formula: a is the amount of the credit of tax not credited in payment of income tax payable for the income year b is 33% in the case of a company (the rate of resident companies income tax, expressed as a percentage). Sometimes this process is described as converting the tax credits into a loss. This has led to confusion, because some taxpayers have assumed that the credit in the imputation credit account is lost when the deemed loss occurs. This is not so. The credit which is not used remains in the imputation credit account. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) A limitation applies to dividends received from another company in a wholly-owned group. These are exempt from tax under section CB 10 (2). Such intercorporate dividends do not constitute assessable income of the recipient company, so the provisions discussed above about deemed losses for unused imputation credits do not apply. However, the amount of any imputation credit attached to a dividend paid to a company during an imputation year is available for crediting to the imputation credit account under section ME 4 (1)(d). Example X Co Ltd has a loss carried forward of $100 in the 1994 income year. Its only income is a fully im- puted dividend from Y Co Ltd of $100. X Co Ltd and Y Co Ltd are not members of a wholly-owned group. The dividend included $33 of imputation credits. The $33 imputation credit was credited to X Co’s imputation credit account. X Co did not have to use the imputation credit to pay tax on the dividend it received from Y Co Ltd, as the dividend of $100 was set off against the X Co’s existing $100 loss. Under section LB 2 (3)(b), X Co Ltd is deemed to have incurred a further loss of $100 (being $33/33%) in respect of the imputation credits which were not used. The $33 remains in the company’s imputation credit account, and there are losses of $100 to be carried forward. Consumable aids - deductibility of cost Summary Consumable aids are goods and materials used up in producing a product or service. The cost of acquiring a consumable aid is deductible when incurred. However, if the provisions of section EF 1 apply, the expenditure incurred on consumable aids that are not used by the end of the income year is included in assessable income. Under Determination E10, section EF 1 only applies to taxpayers when the cost of consumable aids unused at the end of the income year exceeds $58,000. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background Goods purchased by a taxpayer for use in a business are depreciable property, non-depreciable property, trading stock, or consumable aids. Each type of property has a different tax treatment. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 7104 EF 1104A The term “consumable aid” is not defined. Sections BB 7 and EF 1 govern the deductibility of expenditure incurred on consumable aids. Currently, the accruals determination E10 modifies the application of section EF 1. Determination E10 was published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No. 4 (October 1994). Under the transitional provisions in section YB 5, all accruals determinations in force after 1 April 1995 that refer to sections in the Income Tax Act 1976 are interpreted as referring to the equivalent sections in the Income Tax Act 1994. Policy The Commissioner considers that consumable aids are goods or materials to which all of the following criteria apply: • They are used in any way in the manufacture or production of goods or services from which a taxpayer derives assessable income. • They are wholly or almost wholly consumed in the production process, or become unusable or worthless after being used once in the production process, or are capable of limited repetitive use, or have a very short life. • They are not component parts of a finished product, or goods acquired for further processing. Examples of consumable aids are the chemicals used by a plastic manufacturer, the printer ribbons used by an accountant, and the fertiliser used by a farmer. Expenditure on buying consumable aids is deductible when incurred. However, such expenditure is accrual expenditure for the purposes of section EF 1. Under section EF 1, the unexpired portion of accrual expendi- ture must be included in assessable income. For consumable aids, the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure is the amount of expenditure attributable to consumable aids that at the end of the income year have not yet been used by the taxpayer to produce assessable income. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Example Bigfoot Shoes Ltd purchases 50,000 litres of solvent at a cost of $100,000 during the 1994-95 income year. The solvent is for use in shoe manufacturing. At the end of the income year drums containing 30,000 litres of solvent (with a cost of $60,000) remain unopened. The entire cost of the solvent is deductible in the 1994-95 income year as expenditure on a consum- able aid. However, because the unexpired portion of the expenditure on solvent is $60,000, and therefore greater than $58,000, section EF 1 applies. This means the unexpired accrual expenditure of $60,000 must be returned as income in the 1994-95 income year. The $60,000 becomes deductible in the 1995-96 income year, but if section EF 1 applies again in the 1995-96 income year further income will arise from unexpired accrual expenditure. Export market development expenditure refunds and further income tax Summary This item states the Commissioner’s current policy on imputation credit accounts and further income tax liability caused by export market development expendi- ture refunds. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. The Commissioner’s policy is that section YB 4 (1) (section 394L(4A), Income Tax Act 1976) neutralises the further income tax liability caused by export market development expenditure refunds in the year of the refund, and in subsequent imputation years. However, section 394L(4A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 does not cancel the debit in the company’s imputation credit account. Taxpayers should contact their local Inland Revenue office if they have been incorrectly charged further income tax and penalty/additional tax on their debit imputation credit account balances resulting from export market development expenditure refunds. Background Section 156F of the Income Tax Act 1976 allows, up to the end of the 1990 income year, tax credits called export market development expenditure (EMDE) credits for expenditure incurred in relation to developing export markets. If the EMDE credits exceed a taxpayer’s income tax liability, a refundable excess arises. When this is refunded to a company, a debit is made to the company’s imputation credit account (“ICA”). If a debit ICA balance arises from the receipt of an EMDE refund at the end of the imputation year, under section YB 4 (1) no further income tax (FIT) is payable in the year of the refund. However, section YB 4 (1) does not cancel out the debit in the ICA. The debit will roll over into the next imputation year, and assuming that there are no debits or credits in that year, a FIT liability will again result. The question is whether FIT liability can be neutralised by section YB 4 (1) in imputation years after the refund. The following diagram represents the issues involved. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 ME 9 (1)394L(1) YB 4 (1)394L(4A) Omitted156F A determination made by the Commissioner under section EF 1 (3) exempts some taxpayers from comply- ing with section EF 1. The most recent determination, determination E10, applies from the 1994-95 income year. Under it, section EF 1 does not apply to expendi- ture on the purchase of consumable aids when the unexpired portion of the expenditure is $58,000 or less. However, determination E10 applies only to consumable aids in the possession of the taxpayer at balance date. Determination E10 also applies only if the expenditure has not been deferred for financial reporting purposes. Unexpired accrual expenditure included in assessable income for an income year is deductible in the following income year. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Section YB 4 (1) is a savings provision, and states: Notwithstanding the repeal by this Act of sections ...394L(4A)...those provisions shall continue to apply, as if they had continued in force, in the same manner as they applied immediately before the commencement of this Act. Section 394L(4A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 states: Where- (a) Pursuant to section 156F(4) of this Act a company has been paid any refundable excess in respect of the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1988 or any subsequent income year; and (b) The amount of that refundable excess has in any imputa- tion year arisen as a debit to the company’s imputation credit account,- any amount that the company would otherwise be liable to pay by way of further income tax pursuant to subsection (1) or subsection (3) of this section shall be reduced (so far as it extends) by an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - b where a is the sum of all such refundable excesses paid to the company on or before the date on which the relevant debit balance giving rise to the liability for further income tax is determined; and b is the sum of any credits arising, in accordance with section 394C(2)(b)(i) and section 394D(1) of this Act, in the company’s imputation credit account during the imputation year in which the amount of any such refundable excess first arose as a debit to the company’s imputation credit account and during any subsequent imputation year. Policy The Commissioner’s view is that section YB 4 (1) also applies to imputation years subsequent to the year that the EMDE credit is refunded. The formula in section YB 4 (1) requires taxpayers to trace back and aggregate the following entries over current and prior imputation years: • all EMDE refund debits on or before the time the relevant debit balance is determined (variable “a”) • all credits that arise to the ICA during the year in which the EMDE refund debits first arose, and during subsequent imputation years (variable “b”). The sum of all credits is offset against the sum of all EMDE refund debits arising, and the balance of the EMDE refund debits remaining, if any, is the amount by which the FIT liability is reduced. This formula enables taxpayers to neutralise the FIT liability that would otherwise be payable because of a debit balance arising from EMDE refunds. Note that the formula does not cancel the debit balance in the ICA. Taxpayers should contact their local Inland Revenue office if they have been incorrectly charged FIT and penalty/additional tax on their debit ICA balances caused by EMDE refunds. Example URAP Ltd’s ICA opening balance on 1 April 1989 is nil. During the year, URAP Ltd received an EMDE refund of $100,000 which resulted in a $100,000 debit to its ICA. It also received $30,000 worth of credits to the ICA during the year. At the end of the imputation year 31 March 1990, URAP Ltd’s ICA closing balance is $70,000 in debit. Under section ME 9 (1), a FIT liability of $70,000 would ordinarily arise. However, under section YB 4 (1), the FIT liability is reduced by the formula, a - b, in which: • “a” is the sum of all such refundable excesses paid to the company on or before 31 March 1990. This is $100,000. • “b” is the sum of any credits arising in the company’s ICA during the year in which the EMDE refund first arose, and during subsequent imputation years. This is $30,000. Therefore, on 31 March 1990 the potential FIT liability of $70,000 from the debit balance will, under section YB 4 (1), be reduced by $70,000 ($100,000-$30,000) to nil. The debit balance remains and rolls over into the next imputation year. On 1 April 1990 the ICA has an opening debit balance of $70,000. During the 1990-1991 imputation year there are no debits to the ICA, and $50,000 credits to the ICA. At 31 March 1991 the ICA will have a closing debit balance of $20,000, and a possible FIT liability of $20,000. The formula in YB 4 (1), a - b, neutralises the $20,000 FIT liability that would arise at the end of the 1991 imputation year. Under the formula: • “a” is the sum of all such refundable excesses paid to the company on or before 31 March 1991. Before 31 March 1991, the total EMDE refunds is $100,000. • “b” is the sum of any credits arising in the company’s ICA during the year in which the EMDE refund first arose, and during subsequent imputation years. This is $30,000 (1990) + $50,000 (1991) = $80,000. Therefore, the FIT liability is reduced by $20,000 ($100,000 (a) - $80,000 (b)) to nil. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Asset no longer used but retained by taxpayer - application to deduct adjusted tax value depreciation method) shall be, if the Commissioner so determines, an amount equal to the adjusted tax value of that property.

Section EG 19 contains the tax treatment of a gain or loss when depreciable property is disposed of. Section EG 19 (2) states: Subject to subsection (4), where in any income year any property is disposed of by a taxpayer for a consideration that exceeds the adjusted tax value of that property on the date of disposition, the lesser of the following amounts shall be included in the assessable income derived by the taxpayer in that income year- (a) The aggregate of amounts allowed under this Act and the Income Tax Act 1976 to the taxpayer as a deduction on account of depreciation in respect of the property (and additionally, in the case of property referred to in subsec- tion (1)(a)(ii), any deduction allowed for the purchase or creation of that property); and (b) The amount (if any) by which the consideration derived by the taxpayer from the disposition exceeds the adjusted tax value of the property as at the date of disposition. Section EG 19 (3) states: Subject to subsection (4), where in any income year any depreciable property (other than a building) is disposed of by a taxpayer for a consideration that is less than its adjusted tax Summary Section EG 12 of the Income Tax Act 1994 allows a taxpayer to apply to deduct the adjusted tax value (ATV) of an asset that can no longer be used, but which the taxpayer keeps. Before allowing the deduction, the Commissioner must be satisfied that both of these conditions are met: • The taxpayer no longer uses the property in the production of assessable income or in a business. • The costs of disposing of the property would exceed any consideration that could be derived from its disposal. The Commissioner must also have regard to whether the property could still be used in the production of assessable income or in a business. When the Commissioner issues a determination, it will apply, at the taxpayer’s option, in one of these years: • the income year which finished immediately before the income year when the application is made • the income year the applicant makes the application • the income year in which the asset meets the three criteria set out in section EG 12 (6). All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background There is some confusion surrounding section EG 12. Several taxpayers have applied to write off the remain- ing ATV of an asset under section EG 12 when the three criteria in section EG 12 (6) are not satisfied. For example, some taxpayers have applied for the deduction when they have already sold or otherwise disposed of the asset. Other taxpayers have applied for the deduc- tion when the costs of disposal do not exceed the estimated consideration that they could receive from the disposal of the asset. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 EG 12108K EG 19117 Section EG 12 states: (1) The deduction on account of depreciation that may be claimed for any income year in respect of any depreciable property that can no longer be used (other than a building or property that has been depreciated using the pool 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) value at the time of disposition, the amount by which the adjusted tax value of the property as at the date of disposition exceeds the consideration derived by the taxpayer from the disposition shall be deducted from the assessable income of that taxpayer in the income year in which the sale or disposi- tion occurs. Application of legislation Under the legislation the Commissioner must consider three issues when deciding whether to issue a determi- nation allowing the deduction: • The Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer no longer uses the property in the production of assessable income or in a business. • The Commissioner must be satisfied that the costs of disposing of the property would exceed any considera- tion that could be derived from the disposition of the property. • The Commissioner shall have regard to whether the property could still be used in the production of assessable income or in a business. If an item is disposed of, physically or otherwise, there is no need to make any application to claim a deduction. A taxpayer can generally claim a loss on sale or disposal against assessable income under section EG 19 (3). If the Commissioner issues a determination to allow a taxpayer to write off the ATV of an asset that the taxpayer later sells, the amount of the consideration received (less costs of disposal) up to the total amount of depreciation deductions claimed, is depreciation recov- ered. Under section EG 19 (2), depreciation recovered is assessable income in the year the asset is disposed of. Income year from which determination applies The legislation does not provide a timeframe for making the application, nor for when the determination applies. The taxpayer may apply for this deduction at any time after the date that the property can no longer be used. The Commissioner has established new policy on when the determination applies. This policy supersedes that outlined in TIB Volume Five, No.10 (March 1994), in the item “Miscellaneous depreciation issues - questions and answers”. The new policy is that when the Commissioner issues a determination, it will apply, at the taxpayer’s option, in one of these years: • the income year which finished immediately before the income year the application is made • the income year the applicant makes the application • the first income year in which the asset meets the three criteria set out in section EG 12 (6). The new policy recognises that most taxpayers decide to apply for a deduction for an asset that is no longer used, at the time of finalising the end of year accounts. Example 1 X Bank Limited installs new computers that replace its outdated ones. The old computers are considered worthless, because of their age. X Bank has no room to store them, and so pays for their transport to the dump. Although the cost of disposing of them exceeds any proceeds, the assets have actually been disposed of. X Bank must write off the computers under section EG 19 (3), and claim the loss against assessable income in that income year. X Bank does not claim a deduction under section EG 12. Example 2 Anthony and Peter set up in business baking pies. They buy a small oven for this purpose. The business expands beyond their wildest dreams, and they realise that the oven is far too small for their requirements. They advertise the oven for sale several times, without response. Finally, they approach a local secondhand dealer who, knowing that there is a market for the item, offers to buy the oven for around half the price they expected. Anthony and Peter decide to store the oven for a few months, and continue to advertise, hoping to get a better price. Finally, they apply to write off the ATV of the oven under section EG 12. The Commissioner declines their application. He considers that it does not meet the requirements of the section, as the oven can still be used in a business or in the production of assessable income. Also, it is likely that the costs of disposing of the oven would not exceed any consideration that could be derived from the disposition of the oven. Example 3 Sarah and Angela have a lawn-mowing round. One of the mowers breaks down. It is uneconomical to repair it, so they decide to put it out for collection on the local Council’s next non-organic rubbish collection day. In the meantime, they apply to write off the ATV of the mower under section EG 12. The Commissioner declines their application, as it does not meet the criterion that the costs of disposing of the property must exceed any consideration that could be derived from the disposition of the prop- erty. Once the Council collects the mower on the non- organic rubbish collection day, Sarah and Angela can claim the loss on disposal against assessable income under section EG 19 (3). Example 4 Minex Company Ltd installed railway tracks from one of its mines to its processing plant. As that mine is no longer productive, the line is no longer continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Manufacturing Ltd is aware that any manufacturer, buying equipment for that kind of production line, would only consider equipment incorporating the new technology as it produces a product far superior to that made using the older equipment. The Commissioner considers that Manufacturing Ltd’s application meets the criteria for a write-off under section EG 12. The taxpayer no longer uses the replaced part of the production line. The costs of disposing of it are more than its scrap value. It can no longer be considered useable in the production of assessable income or in a business. Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Library books and periodicals - depreciation rate review We have been asked to review the rates set for library books and periodicals. These are the rates that currently apply: Estimated usefulDiminishingStraight-line Asset classeslife (years)value rate (%)rate (%) Library books, and periodicals (if to be bound) (lending) (not specified)82215.5 Library books, and periodicals (if to be bound)(in-house)209.56.5 Library books, and periodicals (if to be bound)(law)209.56.5 Library books, and periodicals (if to be bound)(public)82215.5 Library books, and periodicals (if to be bound)(school)82215.5 Library books, and periodicals (if to be bound)(scientific)209.56.5 Library books, and periodicals (if to be bound)(university)82215.5 Newspapers and periodicals (if not to be held)expenseexpenseexpense Newspapers (where to be held)263.563.5 Periodicals (if to be held but not to be bound)263.563.5 These rates are also set out on page 46 of the Depreciation Guide (IR 260), April 1994. It has been suggested to us that the rates are too low and that the various categories make compliance difficult and increase costs.

The cost of removing the tracks far outweighs their value as scrap metal, and no other business could use them. Minex leaves the tracks where they are, and applies for a write-off under section EG 12. The application meets the requirements for a write- off under section EG 12. Example 5 Manufacturing Ltd modernises its factory for the first time in twenty years, replacing part of the production line with the latest electronic equipment. The replaced equipment is stored in the building, as the value of the scrap metal is less than the trans- port costs of getting it to the scrap metal dealer. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Charitable exemption request following bequest to defunct organisation Section CB 4 (1)(d) (section 61(26), Income Tax Act 1976) - Categories of exempt income: In her will, a deceased taxpayer left $100,000 to an organisation con- cerned with the harmful effects of gambling. The organisation wound up its operations in 1990, having never requested charitable status recognition from Inland Revenue. The deceased’s trustee proposes to set aside the money in perpetuity to pay the income towards the objects of the defunct organisation. The trustee sent Inland Revenue a copy of the former organisation’s constitution and rules, and asked us to grant an income tax exemption under section CB 4 (1)(d) to the sub-fund within the estate on the basis of that fund’s charitable objects. Under certain circumstances, by means of the cy-prés doctrine or through appli- cation of section 32 of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, bequests made to charities that no longer exist are able to be carried out. Inland Revenue’s concern is with the status of the sub-fund being set up within the deceased’s estate. Inland Revenue will take into account the documents relating to the defunct organisation only to the extent that the sub-fund has adopted them. Clearly the sub-fund will not have adopted the constitution and rules of the former organi- sation in total - such rules concerning meetings, for example, would have no relevance - but the sub-fund will have taken on its objects. After a request from Inland Revenue, the trustee provided documentation that showed the sub-fund is a charitable entity in its own right. In this and similar cases it is necessary to look at the status of the ultimate recipient of the funds (in this instance the sub-fund), rather than that of the originally intended recipient. Regardless of whether or not the defunct organisation was charitable, the sub- fund was shown to be charitable so Inland Revenue granted an exemption under section CB 4 (1)(d). Allowances paid to staff in wheelchairs - exemption Section CB 12 (section 73, Income Tax Act 1976) - Power to exempt employees’ allowances: An employer pays a daily allowance to staff confined to wheelchairs to cover the cost of parking close to their workplace. The employer has re- quested that the allowance be exempted from tax. Under section CB 12 (1): An amount paid by an employer in respect of an employee’s employment or service is exempt from tax where and to the extent that the amount - (a) Reimburses the employee for expenditure that, but for section DE 1, would be deductible in calculating the employee’s assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is expenditure on account of an employee which, if incurred by the employee and but for section DE 1, would be deductible in calculating the employee’s assessable income. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) from page 19 Under section DE 1 (section 105, Income Tax Act 1976), no deduction is allowed for expenditure or loss incurred in the production of income from employment. Paying an allowance to cover parking costs is not a reimbursement of expendi- ture incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. It is the reimbursement of an expense incurred in putting the employee in a position to earn assessable income. Accordingly, the allowance paid to the employees in wheelchairs cannot be exempted from tax, and is taxable in full to the employee. Use of money interest and the accruals rules Section EH 9 (section 64M, Income Tax Act 1976) - Application of accruals rules: A taxpayer has raised a concern that payments of use of money interest to Inland Revenue will involve her in a financial arrangement under the accruals rules. She has asked for an assurance that accounting under the accruals rules will not be necessary in these circumstances. Section EH 9 gives a number of instances when the accruals rules will not apply. Section EH 9 (f) states that they are not applied: In relation to a financial arrangement to the extent that the income or expenditure incurred by a person in respect of the financial arrangement consists of interest payable to or by the Commis- sioner under section 121 or section 122 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, being interest payable in relation to the tax on income derived in the 1994-95 income year or any subsequent year. Therefore, use of money interest payable either to the Commissioner under section 121, or by the Commissioner under section 122, does not have to be accounted for under the accruals rules. Loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) elections Section HG 14 (section 393N, Income Tax Act 1976) - Loss attributing qualify- ing companies: A company has five shareholders, four of whom have agreed to sign election notices so that the company can become an LAQC under the quali- fying company rules. The fifth shareholder who holds 10% of the company’s shares has refused to sign. The four shareholders have asked whether the fifth shareholder’s election is required. A company that is a qualifying company (QC) can become an LAQC when all of the following conditions are met: • the company is a qualifying company at all times during the income year. • The company’s shares each carry the same voting rights and rights to any profits or distributions of assets. • No share in the company has been subject to any arrangement whose pur- pose is to defeat the intention of section HG 14. • An election that the company be an LAQC is executed by each sui juris share- holder and each sui juris director of the company. It is the last point that is of concern in this case. The fifth shareholder does not want the company to become an LAQC and has not executed an election. In the absence of an election from each sui juris shareholder, the company cannot become an LAQC. The legislation does not allow an election by a majority of shareholders to override this requirement. Note: The term sui juris is a legal phrase used to describe people who are under no disability affecting their legal capacity to deal with their property, bind themselves by contracts, and to sue and be sued. People who do not have legal capacity (and are therefore not sui juris) include minors and people who are mentally disabled. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) continued on page 22 NZ Super surcharge - why only half of NZ superannuation fund pension included Section JB 3 (1) (section 336D(1), Income Tax Act 1976) - Determination of “other income”: A taxpayer has asked why, in determining other income for surcharge purposes, only half of some pensions or annuities is taken into ac- count. New Zealand superannuitant surcharge is imposed when a taxpayer’s income, other than New Zealand superannuation, exceeds the stated minimum. In determining that “other income”, the formula in section JB 3 (1) includes the taxable income of the New Zealand superannuitant, together with: ...one-half of any amount received in the form of a pension from a superannuation fund or an annuity to which section CB 9 (f) applies, which amount is not otherwise included in the taxable income of the New Zealand superannuitant... The pensions and annuities of which only half is taken into account for sur- charge purposes are those non-taxable pensions which are not included as income in a superannuitant’s tax return. That is, non-taxable pensions or annui- ties from New Zealand registered superannuation schemes or life insurance funds, such as the Government Superannuation Fund, which are registered with the Government Actuary. Income tax is already paid on this income by the funds themselves - but not surcharge. By including half the pension or annuity in the surcharge calculation, it is recognised that approximately half of those payments represents income earned, and the other half is a drawdown in capital. The 50% income earned is subject to the surcharge, as is interest earned in a bank account. The other 50% is effectively a return of capital, and is not subject to the surcharge. Non-resident’s liability to file income tax return Section NG 1 (section 310, Income Tax Act 1976) - Application of non-resident withholding tax rules: A New Zealand national has lived in Australia for 20 years. She has recently received a bequest which will provide for payments of company dividends and interest from New Zealand. She has asked if she must file a tax return to Inland Revenue in New Zealand. The payer of the interest is neither an approved issuer in terms of section NG 6 (section 311B, Income Tax Act 1976), nor an associated person of the Australian resident. Section NG 1 (2) makes income consisting of interest, royalties, and dividends deemed to be derived from New Zealand, by a person who is not resident in New Zealand, subject to the non-resident withholding tax rules. Section NG 2 (1) (section 311, Income Tax Act 1976) sets the rates of NRWT applicable to non-resident withholding income: • dividends - NRWT at 30%, section NG 2 (1)(a) • interest (not paid by an approved issuer) - NRWT at 15%, section NG 2 (1)(c). Under section BB 11 (section 294, Income Tax Act 1976), the provisions of a double taxation agreement (DTA) are able to modify domestic law. The Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 1995 (New Zealand - Australia DTA) sets the following rates: • dividends - taxed at 15% under paragraph 2 of Article 10 • interest - taxed at 10% under paragraph 2 of Article 11. Provided NRWT is correctly deducted and accounted for by the payer (or agent), and the Australian resident’s only New Zealand-sourced income is non-resident 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) from page 21 withholding income, she will not have to file a tax return in New Zealand. This is because in her circumstances section NG 3 (section 317, Income Tax Act 1976) excludes the dividends and interest from assessable income, and makes NRWT the final tax payable. Family Support for children living overseas Section OB 1 (section 374A, Income Tax Act 1976) - Principal caregiver: A New Zealand resident taxpayer is unable to look after his children as his job requires him to travel around the country. His sister who lives in Australia has agreed to look after the children until his circumstances change. At this stage, the taxpayer and his sister consider that the children are living with her on a permanent basis. She looks after the children as if they were her own. The taxpayer sends money to her each week to meet the costs of looking after them. He has asked if he can claim Family Support for his children while they are living in Australia. To be able to claim Family Support, a person must satisfy the definition of “qualifying person” in section OB 1. To be a “qualifying person”, a person must, among other things, be the principal caregiver of the dependent children. Section OB 1 also defines who is a “principal caregiver”. A person is a “principal caregiver” when, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the person has the primary responsibility for the day to day care of the child, other than on a temporary basis. The definition excludes: (a) Any body of persons (whether incorporated or unincorporated); or (b) Any person who is the proprietor of, or employed in,- (i) A residence established under the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989; or (ii) A home registered under the Disabled Persons Community Welfare Act 1975; or (iii) Any other institution in which the child is being cared for. In this case, the Commissioner considers that the New Zealand resident is not eligible to claim Family Support for the children living in Australia. He does not fulfil the role of principal caregiver for the children, as he does not look after them on a day to day basis. Because he is not a principal caregiver he cannot be a qualifying person for the purposes of the Act. Income Tax Act 1976 Livestock sale income when farmer retires - can no longer be spread Section 93 - Spreading of excess income derived on sale of livestock where unduly low standard values or nil value adopted (repealed): A tax practitioner has asked if any income spreading is available for income resulting from the selling up of farm livestock when a farmer retires. The short answer is no. Up until the income year ending 31 March 1987, under section 93 (repealed from 1 August 1990) a farmer disposing of livestock upon retirement from the farming business could apply to Inland Revenue for income arising from such disposal to be apportioned between the year of sale and up to 3 subsequent years. Under the livestock rules in operation at that time, section 93 was necessary because large disparities often occurred between the sale price of livestock and prevailing book values. This resulted in significant income assessability. 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) In general, the advent of the herd scheme has seen livestock book values more closely approximate actual values achieved at the saleyards. However, in some circumstances farmers using the national standard cost scheme may find that there is a significant disparity between book values and market values. When this occurs, it may be advisable to progressively move livestock from the na- tional standard cost scheme to the herd scheme so as to lessen the ultimate amount of assessable income at retirement. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST and fines imposed by sporting body Section 5 - Meaning of the term “supply”: A local sports association is regis- tered for GST. It is responsible for running a sport in its particular area, and has authority under its constitution to impose fines on member clubs or individuals in certain circumstances. For instance, it may impose a fine on a club that fails to supply a team card or result card within a certain time, or on an individual who is considered to have breached accepted standards of behaviour (e.g. has abused an official or failed to meet dress standards). An official of the sports association has asked if the fines it collects under its constitution are subject to GST, and if an input tax deduction is available to a GST registered club that has paid a fine. In the circumstances described above, the fines are imposed by the association as punishment for offences against its rules. Payment of the fine does not constitute payment for a supply of goods or services. Therefore, the association does not have to account for GST on the fines it collects, and no input tax deduction is available to a club that has been fined. Trading in private car to obtain business vehicle - GST implications Section 6 - “Taxable activity” defined: A self-employed taxpayer voluntarily registered for GST before he started his business activities. He used his private car for business use during the set up of the business. On average, the business use of the vehicle was 45%, based on his logbook. He is now in a position to trade this vehicle and purchase a more suitable business vehicle. He expects the new vehicle’s business use to be around 90%. He has asked if he must account for GST on the trade-in value of his car when he purchases the business vehicle. Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity”, and excludes from the definition: ...any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby... Although the vehicle to be traded was used in the taxpayer’s business opera- tions, it did not form part of the business assets. Therefore, when the vehicle is subsequently sold (in this case, traded in), the “sale” is considered to be that of a private asset, and the taxpayer does not need to account for GST on the trade-in value received. The new vehicle will be acquired principally for business use, so the taxpayer will be able to claim one-ninth of the total purchase price in his GST return. He will be required to make an adjustment in each (subsequent) GST return to reflect the private (or non-taxable) use of the vehicle in that period. He can use a reasonable method to apportion the use of the new vehicle between taxable and private use. The acceptable methods are set out on page 15 of TIB Volume Five, No. 13 (June 1994). 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) GST on moveable personal property in New Zealand Section 11(2) - Zero-rated services: A Japanese resident owns a racehorse that is trained and stabled in New Zealand. She is being charged GST at 12.5% on the costs incurred, and has asked if zero-rating should apply. Generally, under section 11(2)(e), services are able to be zero-rated when: The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed,... The racehorse owner is such a recipient. However, the section continues by saying: ...not being services which are supplied directly in connection with- (i) Land...;or (ii)Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed;- In this scenario the racehorse is “moveable personal property”, and as the serv- ices are supplied “directly in connection” with it, and it is not a temporary import (paragraph (ca)), zero-rating does not apply. GST is correctly being charged to the owner at 12.5%. Trade display equipment temporarily imported into New Zealand Section 12 - Imposition of goods and services tax on imports: An Australian company brought equipment into New Zealand for display at a trade exhibition, and paid GST on the items to NZ Customs. A company representative has asked Inland Revenue if the GST can be refunded now that the equipment has been re- exported. She has pointed out that as the Australian company was not conduct- ing a taxable activity in New Zealand it was not able to register for GST. It could not get a GST refund from NZ Customs. In these situations, and provided the goods will be re-exported within twelve months of being imported, the goods should be imported on a temporary basis only. This means that rather than paying duty and GST to NZ Customs at the time the goods enter New Zealand, NZ Customs takes a deposit which can be refunded when the goods are re-exported. This is only applicable when the goods are to be re-exported. Alternatively, if the Australian company intends to start a taxable activity in New Zealand, it could register for GST before importing the equipment. This would enable it to claim input tax for the GST paid to NZ Customs in the normal manner. In this particular case the Australian company was not conducting a taxable activity in New Zealand, so it was unable to register for GST. Consequently, Inland Revenue is unable to refund the GST. Personal representative, receiver, liquidator, etc - liability to register for GST Section 58 - Personal representatives, liquidators, receivers, mortgagees in possession: An executor plans to carry on the taxable activity of a deceased GST registered person. She has asked if she should continue to use the GST number allocated to the deceased, or if a new one is required. She should continued to use the existing GST number. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) When a registered person dies, section 58 deems the person who temporarily takes over the deceased’s business affairs (being a taxable activity) to become a “specified agent”, and deems that person to be a registered person carrying on the deceased’s taxable activity. A “specified agent” is: a person carrying on any taxable activity in a capacity as personal representative, liquidator, or receiver of an incapacitated person, or otherwise as agent for or on behalf of or in the stead of an incapacitated person. An “incapacitated person” is defined as: a registered person who dies, or goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt or incapacitated. Under section 58(3), a person who becomes a specified agent must inform the Commissioner, in writing, of that fact within 21 days of becoming a specified agent. The specified agent is personally liable for GST payable, and for all other re- quirements under the GST Act, such as filing returns, issuing tax invoices, etc., from the date that the person becomes the specified agent. The specified agent is not legally responsible for filing any returns outstanding or for any liabilities incurred by the incapacitated person before the agency period began. The specified agent must continue to use the GST registration number allocated to the deceased for the period of the agency. In time, if the taxable activity is transferred to a trust or to any other person, e.g., if the business is sold, a new registration number will be required. Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Gift duty on group superannuation scheme election Section 74 - Exemption for certain elections by members of group superannua- tion schemes: A taxpayer is a member of a group superannuation scheme. He has elected to accept a reduced pension so that his wife can receive a pension after his death. He has asked if that election creates a gift duty liability. Since its operative date of 1 January 1969, the Act has exempted from gift duty an election to accept a reduced pension from a group superannuation scheme in consideration for a pension to be paid to the spouse or other dependant of the member or participant after his or her death. This exemption is now provided for in section 74(a). Section 74, as amended by section 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1992, states: Where a member of or a participant in any group superannuation scheme makes an election to accept from the group superannuation scheme a reduced retirement allowance or pension in consideration of the payment- (a) After his or her death, of a pension from the group superannuation scheme to the surviving spouse or any dependant of the member or participant; or (b) Commencing before his or her death, of a pension from the group superannuation scheme to the spouse of the member or participant,- the election shall not constitute a dutiable gift. Since the operative date of the above amendment, 13 March 1992, section 74(b) allows an election to accept a reduced pension so that the spouse or dependant of the member or participant may be paid a pension concurrently with that paid to the member or participant, to be free of a gift duty liability. Inland Revenue therefore told the taxpayer that no gift duty liability has been created. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Employer’s obligations concerning loan deductions Section 19 - Employer to make repayment deductions: A taxpayer has just started in business and is about to employ a graduate who has a student loan. He will be paying the graduate $30,000 per annum, and has asked what his obligations are regarding the student loan deductions. Under section 18, a student loan borrower must notify an employer of any student loan repayment obligation. Section 19 states: (1) Every employer (being an employer who has in any income year received from a borrower a notice under section 18 of this Act) shall on each occasion on which that employer pays any amount to that borrower by way of salary or wages in respect of that income year, make a deduction from that amount. (2) The deduction shall be made at the standard deduction rate or, if a special deduction rate applies, at that rate. (3) The repayment deductions made under this section shall be in addition to any tax deductions required to be made under the PAYE rules of the Income Tax Act 1994. The effect of section 19 is that when a borrower notifies his or her employer that student loan repayment deductions must be deducted from wages, that em- ployer must make deductions in the same manner as PAYE deductions are made. Borrowers who expect their primary income to exceed the current repayment threshold of $13,884 a year must advise their employer that loan repayment deductions are to be made, by adding “ED” to the “G” or “SEC” codes when completing their IR 12s. The employer pays the deductions to Inland Revenue with the PAYE deductions for the same period. The due dates for these payments are the same as those for PAYE deductions. Student Loan deductions are credited to the borrower’s account on the 15th of the month of the deduction. When remitting repayment deductions for any borrower, the employer must complete a schedule (IR 66L) setting out the name and IRD number of the bor- rower and the amount of the repayment deduction remitted for that borrower. 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Newspaper advertising space sold to non-residents - zero-rating Rating:•••• Case:Wilson & Horton Limited v CIR CA 159/94 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 11(2)(e) Keywords:zero-rating of services, for and to, advertising space Summary:The Court of Appeal allowed the appellant’s appeal and overturned the High Court’s decision in Wilson & Horton Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11221 at 11228. The Court of Appeal held that the word “for” simply emphasises the word “to” in section 11(2)(e). Accordingly, the Commissioner had acted incorrectly in excluding from zero- rated supplies, advertising space supplied by the appellant to persons who were not resident in New Zealand. The Court of Appeal also dismissed the Commissioner’s request to advance a new argument that zero-rating is excluded. The Commissioner’s argument was that the services supplied by the appellant were directly in connection with moveable property situated inside New Zealand at the time the services were performed, namely published newspapers. Facts:The appellant carries on the taxable activity of producing newspapers. It sold advertising space in the NZ Herald to overseas clients and zero-rated these supplies. The Commissioner audited the appellant and determined that the supplies had been incorrectly zero-rated. The High Court found for the Commissioner. It agreed with the Commissioner’s interpretation that “for” means “beneficially for”. It held that the supply of advertising space to non-residents is subject to GST at 12.5% if a New Zealand resident benefits from the advertisement. Also, to qualify for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), the services must be provided “contractually to” and “benefi- cially for” a non-resident person. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) The High Court also found that the supply of advertising space and related services were directly in connection with the advertising but not with the subject matter of the advertisement. Accordingly, services provided by the appellant were not supplied “directly in connection with” land or moveable property in New Zealand. The appellant appealed the High Court decision. Decision:The Court of Appeal rejected the High Court decision and found for the appel- lant. The Court held that the supply of advertising space to non-resident clients is zero-rated irrespective of any benefit arising to New Zealand residents. Justice Richardson considered that the particular meaning intended by the phrase “for and to” hinged on the context in which the words are used and how they are used in that context. His Honour found that both words were employed to convey emphasis. The focus of section 11(2)(e) is on the contractual supply of services and it is the foreign client to which the expression “for and to a person” relates and not others that might be affected by the supply. Any benefit that may occur in supplying the services is not a relevant consideration in determining whether the services are zero-rated. Justice Penlington also found that the purpose of the two words was for empha- sis. His Honour considered that the word “for” is interchangeable with “to”. Justice McKay agreed that “for and to” is a composite phrase meaning no more than that the supply of the goods and services is pursuant to a contract for and to an overseas resident. The Commissioner was precluded from advancing the new argument that the services were supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property (the newspapers). The Court of Appeal held that doing so would change the basis on which the assessment was made and objected to. Justice Richardson considered that accepting the new ground would be inconsistent with the ap- proach previously taken by the Commissioner in Farnsworth v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1984\] 6 NZTC 61770 at 61781. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Revenue and capital - distinction Rating:•• Case:Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Ltd v CIR M1565/91 Act:Land and Income Tax Act 1954, Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:capital, revenue, losses, rent reduction, payment for surrender of option Summary:In return for surrendering an option to purchase three ships, the taxpayer re- ceived three annual amounts of compensation by way of cash payments from one company, and rent reductions from another company. The High Court found that the cash receipts were capital and should not be deducted from losses to be carried forward by the taxpayer. The rent reductions were found to reduce the taxpayer’s expenses, and therefore reduce the losses available to be carried forward. The rent reductions were not receipts of capital. Facts:The taxpayer leased three ships. The lease payments were paid to MCNZ. MCNZ chartered the ships from DSS, an associated company. The taxpayer had an option to purchase the ships. The taxpayer entered into an agreement with MCNZ and DSS by which the taxpayer surrendered its option in return for compensation. The compensation was calculated in the following way: from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) MCNZ was to accept a lower fixed rental ($250,000) for the ships in each of the 1975, 1976 and 1977 accounting years; and DSS was to pay the taxpayer $250,000 in each of the 1975, 1976 and 1977 accounting years. The taxpayer took a deduction for the full rental payment in each of the three years, without reducing expenses for the lower rental. The amount from DSS was also not deducted from expenses. The taxpayer argued that as the option to purchase involved ships that would have been capital assets, the surrender of the option was the sale of a capital asset, and the consideration for that surrender should be a capital amount. The Commissioner argued that the arrangements were for rent reduction, and that the amounts of compensation should be deducted from the revenue expenses for the respective income years. The Commissioner required the full amount of the compensation ($1,500,000) to be deducted from the losses that could be carried forward, as they should have been deducted from allowable expenses. Decision:Justice Anderson analysed the transactions on the basis of their legal form, not their economic consequences, applying Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd v CIR \[1976\] 1 NZLR 546. His Honour held that the cash payments that the taxpayer received from DSS were capital receipts. As such they did not need to be deducted from allowable expenses, and there should be no reduction in the amount of loss carried for- ward for DSS’s payments. The reduction in rent payable by the taxpayer to MCNZ was not a receipt of capital by the taxpayer, but consisted of amounts by which the costs of the taxpayer were reduced. Accordingly, the taxpayer’s revenue expenses were reduced by $250,000 for each of the years in which the rent was reduced. There should be a reduction in the amount of loss carried forward for the rent reduc- tion. Comment:We do not yet know whether either party will be appealing this decision. Land acquired for the purpose of erecting dwellinghouses - whether exempt from stamp duty Rating:•• Case:TRA No 93/241 Act:Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 - section 24(1)(b) Keywords:conveyance duty, subdivision, residential sections, purpose Summary:Judge Barber followed Howick Parklands Limited v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,246 and held that a developer who acquired land for subdivision with the purpose of having dwellinghouses erected was exempt from conveyance duty. The exemp- tion only applies if the Commissioner is satisfied that the dwellinghouses will be erected as soon as practicable after the date the instrument of conveyance was signed. Facts:The objector subdivided land for residential purposes and sold vacant sections. Sale agreements for a subdivision in Palmerston North contained a covenant that the purchaser must erect a residential dwelling within two years of obtaining possession of the section and must complete construction within one year of starting construction. However, sale agreements for a subdivision in Hamilton did not contain such a covenant, due to an oversight. continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) The issue was whether the conveyance duty exemption under section 24(1)(b) for land acquired “for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it” was available to developers who acquire land for residential subdivision and sell vacant sections to purchasers who have agreed to erect a dwellinghouse. Decision:Judge Barber, following Justice Fisher in the Howick Parklands case, held that the objector’s purpose when purchasing the land was the relevant purpose for the conveyance duty exemption. If at the time of acquisition the objector had the purpose of exercising some form of power or control over others to require them to erect a dwellinghouse on the land, that would come within the relevant mean- ing of the section. The Judge was satisfied that this was the case with the subdi- vision at Palmerston North, but he was not satisfied in regard to the subdivision at Hamilton. The exemption was therefore granted to the former, but not to the latter. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Inducement and restraint of trade payments - capital or income? Rating:•••• Case:Fraser v CIR AP 262/91 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 section 65(2)(a), (b) and (l) (Income Tax Act 1994 section BB 4) Keywords:revenue/capital distinction, restraint of trade, inducement payments Summary:The issue was whether certain payments made to a media personality for televi- sion commercials were properly characterised as an “inducement payment” and “restraint of trade agreement payments”. The Court held the payments were an inducement payment and payments under a restraint of trade agreement, and therefore non-assessable. Facts:The taxpayer was a well-known media personality. Colenso Communications Limited (Colenso) approached him to front an advertising campaign for the Bank of New Zealand. He entered into an agreement with Colenso through Moremedia Enterprises Limited, a company he had formed with his wife. The agreement provided not only for payments for services, but for other payments, one characterised as an inducement payment and three described as payments in respect of a restraint of trade. The agreement restrained the taxpayer from advertising or endorsing any other product. Also, Colenso had the power to veto appearances on television in any capacity, if Colenso deemed this to be in the BNZ’s interest. The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer on the basis that the inducement and restraint of trade payments were income. A case stated was requested. Inducement payment The taxpayer argued that the payment was an inducement, to compensate for the loss of career opportunities in television, and the risks he took in entering a new career. The Commissioner argued that the payment could not be characterised as an inducement payment. It was a payment related to or in respect of services that the taxpayer provided to the BNZ. The payment was part of an overall arrange- ment whereby the taxpayer provided his services to the BNZ through Colenso, and he was effectively an employee of the BNZ. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Restraint of trade payment The taxpayer argued that the payments were restraint of trade payments, made as compensation because he could no longer undertake other work advertising or endorsing products. The Commissioner argued that: • there was a high degree of arbitrariness in the allocation process between the fees paid for services and those in respect of restraint of trade; • the payments applied to the time during which services were given, rather than only following termination of the service agreement. In other cases where restraint of trade payments were held to be capital, the restraint of trade applied after termination of the services. • the payments were regular, having more the form of income. Decision:The High Court held for the taxpayer. The restraint of trade payments were intended as compensation for the restraint on the taxpayer’s activities, separate from any payment for services. The tax- payer gave up a substantial sphere of his income-producing activities in return for the restraint of trade payments. The Court did not accept the Commissioner’s argument that there was a high degree of arbitrariness in the allocation process between the fees paid for serv- ices and those paid for the restraint of trade. Further, the restraint of trade ex- tended beyond the period during which the taxpayer provided services to the BNZ. Obligations flowing from the restraint of trade were separate from the obligations flowing from the contract of service. They gave rise to different remedies in the event of any breach. The payments were not regular in the sense that employment-related payments are. The relationship between the taxpayer and the BNZ was not one of employ- ment. The inducement payment was made in compensation to the taxpayer for giving up a capital asset in respect of his chosen career as a current affairs presenter. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. The appropriate procedure for contesting a decision by the Commissioner Rating:••••• Case:Miller and O’Neil v CIR CA 158/93 Judgment 15 September 1995 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 99 (anti-avoidance) (Income Tax Act 1994 - section BB 9 ) Income Tax Act 1976 - section 27 (assessment correct except on proceed- ings for objection) (Tax Administration Act 1994 - section 109) Judicature Amendment Act 1972 (judicial review). Keywords:assessment, judicial review, striking out Summary:There is a distinction between challenging the correctness of an assessment on the one hand, and challenging the process followed and the character of the resulting decision, on the other. In the first situation, the objection and appeal procedures apply and judicial review is not available, being precluded by section 27 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In the second, the process and the outcome may be challenged in other proceedings on traditional administrative law grounds. The legitimacy or validity of the process actually adopted by the Commissioner and the true character of the resulting decision may be challenged in judicial review proceedings if supported by an evidential foundation. continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Facts:Assessment (a) The Commissioner made amended assessments against the taxpayers under the general anti-avoidance provisions of section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976. (b) The taxpayers objected to the amended assessments. (c) The Commissioner disallowed the objections. (d) The Commissioner submitted the objections to the Taxation Review Author- ity for determination and hearing. Judicial review (a) The taxpayers issued proceedings in the High Court for judicial review, alleging that the Commissioner had improperly exercised his powers. (b) The Commissioner applied to the High Court for an order striking out the taxpayers’ proceedings on the grounds that: (i) Section 27 of the Income Tax Act 1976 prohibited a challenge to the amended assessments other than through the objection processes (ii) The proceedings did not disclose a cause of action. (c) In the High Court, Justice Blanchard struck out the taxpayers’ application for judicial review. (d) The taxpayers lodged an appeal to the Court of Appeal. Assessment (a) Before the hearing in the Court of Appeal took place, Judge Barber in the Taxation Review Authority heard the case on the amended assessments and upheld them (with some modifications). He also held that the Taxation Review Authority did not have jurisdiction to deal with administrative law type issues, especially since they had already been dealt with by the High Court. (b) The taxpayers have appealed the Authority’s decision to the High Court. The issues then are: 1. whether section 27 of the Income Tax Act 1976 precludes judicial review 2. whether the judicial review proceedings disclosed a cause of action. Decision:Justice Richardson delivered the Court of Appeal’s judgment. On the first issue he held that although section 27 precludes judicial review of the correctness of an assessment, it does not preclude judicial review of the process followed and the character of the resulting decision. On the second issue, after reviewing the affidavits before the Court, which showed substantial conflicts, he held that the only safe course in the interests of justice was to determine the appeal against the striking out order on the as- sumption that the allegations in the statement of claim were factually correct. The allegation of fact was that the Commissioner assessed the taxpayers indi- vidually because they might be better able than their trading company to pay the income taxes which the Commissioner sought to claim. If this was true, it was outside the power of and a misuse of authority for the Commissioner to make an amended assessment on the footing that the person selected may have a greater ability to pay than the trading company through which the individuals concerned derived their income. Whether that allegation would be sustained would depend on the evidence adduced in the ordinary way at the hearing of the substantive review proceedings. But it could not be said, for the purposes of the striking out action, that the taxpayers’ cause of actions was untenable. from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) The appeal against the striking out of the statement of claim was allowed. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Crown payments and GST Rating:••• Case:New Zealand Refining Company Limited v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,307 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 2, 8(1) Keywords:supply of services, output tax Summary:The taxpayer was not required to account for output tax on payments that the Crown made under an agreement to compensate for the deregulation of the petroleum industry. The payments were not for a supply of services. Facts:The taxpayer operated the Marsden Point oil refinery. In 1977, it entered into an agreement with the Government to expand the refinery, as part of the “Think Big” strategy. The agreement included price control and protection from compe- tition for the taxpayer. In 1988, following the adoption of a policy of deregula- tion of the oil industry, the Government entered into a further agreement with the taxpayer. This provided for three annual payments to the taxpayer, condi- tional on the refinery still being operational, and cancellation of the 1977 con- tract. The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer for output tax on the payments. The taxpayer objected and a case was stated. Decision:The Court held that the taxpayer did not have to account for output tax on the payments under the legislation as it applied in 1988. The Court held that the service the taxpayer supplied in its taxable activity was the conversion of feedstock into an end product, and not the availability of the refinery operations to oil companies. The availability of the refinery operations to oil companies was a condition of the agreement under which the payments were made, but was not the service sup- plied in the course of the taxpayer’s taxable activity. Therefore, payments were not in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of a supply of services. They were to achieve the taxpayer’s acceptance of deregulation and to discharge the Crown’s obligations under the 1977 agreement. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was amended in 1991. Payments of a grant or subsidy (as defined in the Act) made by the Crown or any public authority in respect of a taxable activity are now deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods and services by the person to whom or for whose benefit the payment is made. The amendment provided that when an objection was lodged before 19 December 1990, the application of the amendment would not be retrospective. If the taxpayer had not lodged an objection in time, the amended legislation would have applied. The Court noted that the amendment in 1991 applied only to payments made by or on behalf of the Crown or a public authority. There appears to be a strong argument that payments made by others must therefore be outside the ambit of the Act. This lends further weight to the view that payments in the nature of a grant or subsidy are not otherwise within the ambit of section 8(1). Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.4 (October 1995) Upcoming TIB items In the next few months we’ll be releasing policy statements and public binding rulings on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: Policy Statements • Applications to retain records in Maori • Taxation of allowances and expenditure on account of an employee • Amounts received by way of insurance, indemnity, compensation, or damages for loss or damage to trading stock or consumable aids • Remission under section 413 of the Income Tax Act 1976 of underestimation additional tax charged prior to 1994-95 income year • Remission of additional or incremental tax • Approved issuer levy - late registration of securities • Cash basis holder status not optional • Taxation of allowances and expenditure on account of an employee Public Binding Rulings • Financial planning fees: income tax deductibility • GST treatment of financial planning fees • GST: importers and input tax deductions • GST: what constitutes an invoice? • GST: invoices and time of supply • GST and supplies paid for in foreign currency • Employers’ liability to deduct PAYE from Employ- ment Court awards for lost wages • Tax deductions and bonus payments • Applications to retain records in Maori • Taxation of allowances and expenditure on account of an employee Due dates reminder November 5 Large employers: PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for period ended 31 October 1995 due.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995).

Bonus payments - tax deductions and assessability Public Ruling - BR Pub 95/7 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections OB 1 and OB 2 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to employers that make bonus payments (whether the bonus is an annual bonus or an irregular or regular bonus) to employees. The term “bonus” has the ordinary meaning of that term, and is a monetary payment made to an employee in respect of or in relation to that employee’s employment. In this ruling a “regular bonus’ is a bonus that is paid regularly throughout the year and is linked to the employee’s normal pay periods. An “irregular bonus” is any other bonus paid to the employee. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to bonuses paid to an employee in the 1997, 1998, and 1999 income years. The ruling An employer must make tax deductions from any bonuses paid to employees. The tax deduction must be calculated using the appropriate tax rates in force at the time of payment. Annual or irregular bonuses An annual or irregular bonus paid to an employee is an “extra emolument” because of its irregular nature, so the employer must make tax deductions at the extra emolument rate when paying the bonus to the employee (unless the em- ployee gives a special tax code certificate to the employer which authorises the employer to make deductions at a different tax rate). Regular bonuses A bonus that is regularly included in the salary or wages paid to an employee is treated as salary or wages. The bonus must be added to the salary or wages paid continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) for the same pay period to calculate the tax to be deducted. The employer must calculate the tax in the normal manner using the tax deduction tables, and de- duct the tax when paying the salary or wages to the employee. Assessability to the employee When an employer pays a bonus to an employee (other than a shareholder- employee to whom section OB 2 (2) applies), the bonus is assessable to the employee in the year of receipt. This is the case even where the bonus relates to services performed by the employee in a previous income year. The year that the bonus is deductible to the employer is not relevant to when it is assessable to the employee. The employer must make the correct tax deductions from the bonus in the year that it is received by and assessable to the employee. Shareholder-employees to whom section OB 2 (2) applies When an employer pays a bonus to a shareholder-employee to whom section OB 2 (2) applies, under section EB 1 (3) the bonus is assessable to the share- holder-employee in the same income year that it is deductible to the employer. Section EF 1 determines when monetary remuneration (such as a bonus) is deductible to the employer. An employer does not need to make tax deductions from a bonus paid to a person who is a shareholder-employee to whom section OB 2 (2) applies. The bonus is income of the shareholder-employee which the shareholder-employee must take into account in calculating residual income tax for provisional tax purposes. This ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of December 1995. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 95/7 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background Over the past few years there has been a trend toward the greater use of performance related payments by employers. Many managers and other employees now receive bonus payments. Bonuses may be paid on an irregular basis, such as bonuses given after an employee’s annual review or after the completion of a project. Alternatively, bonuses may be paid regularly throughout the year and be linked to normal pay periods or production periods. There has been some confusion about the year in which a bonus is assessable to an employee when it is paid for services performed by the employee in the previous income year. There has also been confusion about whether a bonus which is paid within 63 days of the end of an income year should be “added back” to the employer’s previous year’s IR 68P and IR 68A for the purposes of deducting PAYE (including earner pre- mium) and assessing employer premium. This is not the correct treatment. The correct treatment is set out in the ruling and the following analysis. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 EB 1 (3)75(3) EF 1104A NC 1 to NC 21337-353, 355, 361, 372-374 NG 15 (g)353(1)(e) OB 1 “extra emolument”, “salary or wages”2 OB 2 (2)6(3) The calculation of tax to be deducted from bonus payments depends on whether the payment is “salary or wages” or an “extra emolument”. These terms are defined in section OB 1. Relevant parts of the defini- tions are as follows: “Extra emolument”, in relation to any person, means a payment in a lump sum (whether paid in one sum or in 2 or more instalments) made to that person in respect of or in from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) relation to the employment of that person (whether for a period of time or not), being a payment which is not regularly included in salary or wages payable to that person for a pay period, but not being overtime pay; and includes any such payment made - (a) By way of bonus, gratuity, or share of profits: ... “Salary or wages”, in relation to any person, means salary, wages, or allowances including all sums received or receiv- able by way of overtime pay, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, commission, or other remuneration of any kind, in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person; and includes - (a) ... but does not include - (j) A payment of exempt income, or an extra emolument, or a withholding payment; or (k) Any salary, wages, or other income to which section OB 2 (2) applies; or ... The deduction of tax from employee remuneration is governed by sections NC 1 to NC 21. Application of legislation Earner and employer premium in respect of bonus payments When an employer pays a bonus to an employee (other than a shareholder-employee to whom section OB 2 (2) applies), ACC earner premium in respect of the bonus must be deducted at the same time as normal tax deductions. The employer premium on such bonuses is chargeable in the year that the bonus is received by the employee, and should be paid when the employer furnishes a section NG 15 (g) reconciliation statement for that year. See section 115 of the Accident Rehabili- tation and Compensation Insurance (“ARCI”) Act 1992 and regulation 3 of the ARCI (Earnings Definitions) Regulations 1992. Annual or irregular bonuses The ruling states that the employer must deduct tax at the extra emolument rate from annual or irregular bonuses (unless the employee has provided a special tax rate certificate to the employer). The employer should also deduct ACC earner premium from the bonus at the same time. The current extra emolument rate is 28 cents per dollar and the current rate of earner premium is 0.6 cents per dollar. This means that tax deductions from annual or irregular bonuses should total 28.6 cents per dollar. Regular bonuses The ruling states that a regular bonus is salary or wages which must be added to the employee’s other salary or wages for the pay period. The employer must make tax deductions (including deductions of ACC earner premium) from the salary or wages including the bonus payment at the employee’s marginal tax rate. When a regular bonus is payable for a period that is greater than one pay period, the tax to be deducted from the bonus must be calculated separately. The bonus should be added to the total salary or wages paid to the employee over the period. The tax deduction that applies to the bonus can be calculated using the follow- ing formula: Tax on (wages for - (tax on wages the period + bonus) for the period) This ensures that tax will not be over-deducted from the bonus. Bonus paid within 63 days of the begin- ning of the employer’s income tax year When a bonus is paid to an employee (other than a shareholder-employee to whom section OB 2 (2) applies) within 63 days of the beginning of the employ- er’s income tax year, the employer should treat the bonus in the same manner as any other bonus paid during that income year. The bonus is assessable to the employee in the year that it is paid, and the employer should make the appropriate tax deductions (including earner premium) from, and account for employer premium in respect of, that bonus in the year that the bonus is paid. Shareholder-employees to whom section OB 2 (2) applies Section OB 2 (2) states: Where a taxpayer is a shareholder in and an employee of a close company and in any income year (or in the taxpayer’s accounting year corresponding with any year), - (a) Salary or wages of a regular amount for regular pay periods of one month or less are not throughout that year regularly paid or credited to the taxpayer or applied on the taxpayer’s account in the taxpayer’s capacity of an employee of the company; or (b) The total of the salary or wages derived by the taxpayer in that year in the taxpayer’s capacity of an employee of the company by way of regular payments throughout that year of a regular amount for regular pay periods is less than two-thirds of the total income which the taxpayer derives in that year from the company by way of director’s fees and by way of salary, wages, or other income for or on account of the taxpayer’s service in the capacity of an employee of the company; or (c) Any amount is paid or credited to the taxpayer, or applied on the taxpayer’s account, in anticipation or in respect of any income that may subsequently be allocated to the taxpayer in the taxpayer’s capacity of a director or employee of the company, - all income that the taxpayer derives from the company in every subsequent year by way of director’s fees and by way of salary, wages, or other income for or on account of the taxpayer’s service in the capacity of an employee of the company shall for the purposes of this Act, except the FBT rules, be deemed to be income derived otherwise than from source deduction payments, unless, and only to the extent that, the Commissioner determines from time to time in any case or class of cases that that income shall be deemed to be income derived from source deduction payments. If any question arises as to whether or not this subsection applies, or as to the continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Example 2 - Regular bonuses C receives weekly performance-related bonuses along with her weekly wages. She has a G tax code. Ordinary weekly wages$300 Weekly bonus for first week of November 1995$ 28 Total weekly earnings$328 The tax to be deducted from total weekly earnings is $70.05. Example 3 - Regular bonus for period longer than a regular pay period D has a production-related bonus added to her wages every four weeks. Her wages of $1,100 are paid fortnightly, and she has a G tax code. Four-weekly bonus paid on 20 October 1995$ 140 Wages received for the four weeks (2 x $1,100)$2,200 Total$2,340 The tax to be deducted from the bonus is the four- weekly tax on $2,340 less the four-weekly tax on $2,200: = $574.24 - $534.20 = $40.04. If D’s four-weekly bonus were simply added to her fortnightly income of $1,100 to calculate tax, the deduction would be calculated on the basis that her fortnightly earnings were $1,240. The tax attribut- able to the bonus would be too high at $42.66. Example 4 - Bonus paid within 63 days of beginning of employer’s tax year E is an employee of F Ltd. F Ltd has a standard balance date. F Ltd pays E a one-off bonus on 1 May 1995 for a project undertaken and completed by her in December 1994. The bonus is deductible by F Ltd under section BB 7 because it is expenditure incurred in gaining F Ltd’s assessable income. As the bonus is paid for services performed in the 1995 income year and is paid within 63 days of the end of the 1995 income year, F Ltd can deduct the bonus in the 1995 income year (under section EF 1). The bonus is assessable to E in the year that she receives the bonus - the 1996 income year. F Ltd must deduct PAYE at the appropriate rate (includ- ing earner premium) and pay employer premium in respect of the bonus in the 1996 income year. The fact that F Ltd is able to deduct the bonus in calculating its assessable income for the 1995 year is irrelevant to when that payment is assessable to E and to when tax deductions should be made and employer premium paid. extent to which this subsection applies, to any taxpayer or to any class of taxpayers, or to any director’s fees, salary, wages, or other income, it shall be determined by the Commissioner, and the Commissioner’s decision shall be final. In summary, section OB 2 (2) applies to shareholder- employees of close companies (including directors) who have previously received remuneration from the com- pany irregularly, unevenly, or in advance of it being allocated (note that until 1 April 1997, the term “close company” includes a private company registered under the Companies Act 1955). The ruling states that a bonus paid to a section OB 2 (2) shareholder-employee is assessable to the shareholder- employee in the same year that the bonus is deductible to the employer (section EB 1). The year that the bonus is deductible to the employer is determined by section EF 1. The employer does not have to make tax deduc- tions from a bonus paid to such a shareholder-employee. Instead: • The shareholder-employee must take the bonus into account when calculating residual income tax for provisional tax purposes; and • The employer must deduct earner premium from, and pay employer premium in respect of, the bonus, by the employer’s terminal tax date for the year that the bonus is assessable to the shareholder-employee and deductible to the employer. See section 115(19) of the ARCI Act and regulation 3A of the ARCI (Earnings Definitions) Regulations 1992. Bonuses paid to shareholder-employees to whom section OB 2 (2) does not apply should be treated in the same way as bonuses paid to other employees. Examples These examples do not form part of the ruling. The tax in the examples has been calculated using the tax deduction tables. Example 1 - Annual or irregular bonuses B receives a one-off bonus of $1,500 in August 1995. The tax deduction at the extra emolument rate is $1,500 ( (0.28 + 0.006) = $429 Note that if B’s annual income is over $30,875, his top or marginal income tax rate will be 33 cents per dollar - 5 cents higher than the extra emolument deduction rate. In these circumstances the tax deducted from B’s bonus will be less than the tax B will have to pay on the bonus. B may find, there- fore, that after filling out his tax return he has extra income tax to pay. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Tertiary student association fees Public ruling- BR Pub 95/8 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies where a student at a tertiary institution pays fees to the tertiary student association at that tertiary institution. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to fees that tertiary students pay to tertiary student associa- tions during the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1999. The ruling Where a student pays a single fee to the student association to become a member of the student association, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on mem- bers, the payment is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5 (4). As the pay- ment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. This ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of December 1995. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 95/8 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. This ruling is intended to confirm current IRD policy. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 KC 556A Section KC 5 states: (1) Subject to this section and section BB 10, in the assess- ment of every taxpayer, other than an absentee or a company or a public authority or a Maori authority or an unincorporated body, or a trustee assessable and liable for income tax under sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, and HZ 2, there shall be allowed as a rebate of income tax the amount of any gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more made by the taxpayer in the income year to any of the following societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts, or funds (being in each case a society, an institution, an association, an organisa- tion, a trust, or a fund in New Zealand), namely: (aa) A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philan- thropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab) A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac) A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad) A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ae) - (bp) \[A list of organisations\] continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) It is arguable whether student association fees are subscriptions. There are many definitions of “subscrip- tion”, some of which are wide enough to include student association fees. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 payments to a school for camp fees, a school trip, stationery, and a manual were not gifts. They conferred rights on the pupil. The Court noted that school activity fees had been allowed as a deduction by the Commissioner because they came within the expanded definition of “gift”. Other fees which conferred a right were not allowed as a deduction. The Court did not comment on what the definition of a subscription was. However, assuming that the fees paid are a subscription, the fees will only be a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5 (4), and will only qualify for a rebate, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment does not confer any rights on the payer. A subscription will only qualify as a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5 if the payer receives no rights to do anything, receive any- thing, or to have access to anything in return for the payment of the subscription. Thus, the payment of a subscription is in the nature of a donation because the payer does not get any direct rights in return for the payment. The requirement that the subscription confers no rights does not contain any words of apportionment (such as “to the extent to which”). It is absolute in its terms. Accordingly, if any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. The provision refers only to rights being conferred: the rights do not have to be exercised or enjoyed by the taxpayer. In Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451, a taxpayer paid the fees of a number of disadvantaged children at a school which qualified as a charitable institution. The Taxation Review Authority held that the payments were not gifts, as the payment of the fees meant that the school had a contractual duty to educate the children. The Court quoted the expanded definition of gift, but did not discuss either the definition of “subscription”, or whether the payments were a subscription (and thus covered by the extended definition of gift). The case was decided in terms of whether the fees paid were a “gift” in the ordinary meaning of the word. Students attending tertiary institutions pay a sum for membership of a student association or union. Being a member commonly gives rights to benefits from the student association and other organisations, such as: • Access to advice, welfare, and counselling services. • Liaison services between students and teaching staff. • Access to newsletters and other information. • Facilities on campus, such as the library, health facilities, sports and recreation facilities. • Student discounts on various goods and services. (2) The rebates provided for in this section shall not, in the case of any taxpayer, in any income year exceed in the aggregate the smaller of- (a) 33 1 / 3 % of the aggregate of all gifts described in subsection (1): (b) $500. (3) No rebate shall be allowed under this section in respect of any gift unless the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner in support of the taxpayer’s claim for the rebate a receipt evidencing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the making of the gift by the taxpayer. (4) In this section, “gift” includes a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, only if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. Application of legislation Where the recipient has charitable status, section KC 5 provides a rebate for the donor of a gift of money in certain circumstances. The meaning of the term “gift” In Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, (in the Court of Appeal) the nature of a gift was referred to by Justice Cooke, who said: in general a gift is something truly gratuitous, although it is possible that nominal or very small considerations may not prevent transactions from being classed as gifts for some purposes: see 20 Halsbury’s Laws of England. In the same case, Justice Richardson said that at com- mon law, the term “gift” refers to: a transaction where the owner of property conveys the ownership of that property to another without consideration. Similar views were expressed in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v McPhail \[1966\] 117 CLR 111, where the Court held that a “gift” has the following attributes: • The property transferred was transferred voluntarily and not as the result of a contractual obligation to transfer it; and • No advantage of a material nature was received by the transferor by way of return. Payments of student association fees are not “gifts” in the ordinary meaning of that word, as payment is not voluntary, and benefits may arise from the payment. The definition of gift in section KC 5 (4) Section KC 5 (4) expands the meaning of “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5, to include subscriptions paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) In addition, it could also be argued that the payment of the student association fee is one of a number of pay- ments a student must make, and things a student must do, in order to qualify for enrolment at a tertiary institution. If the student association fee (or a substitute payment to a charity of the student’s choice) is not paid, the student does not qualify for enrolment. The payment of the student association fee, therefore, confers a further right on students - the right to enrolment if the other conditions of enrolment are met. Similarly, payments to the student association (together with payment of other fees and meeting terms) give students the right to attend university and sit examinations. The student makes his or her payment to the student association, not to any other body which may later be allotted funds by the student association (for example, trust funds, hardship funds). The payment to the student association is a payment which confers rights on the student. For the reasons outlined above, section KC 5 does not apply where the payment of a student association fee confers any rights. In these circumstances, no rebate is available. Example This example does not form part of the ruling. A student enrols at a Polytech. He pays the student association fees, and is able to use the gym facili- ties, counselling services, and the subsidised health care programme. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fees confers certain rights on the student, the payment does not qualify for a rebate as a donation to the student association. However, if a person who is not a student makes a donation to the student association at the Polytech and no rights are conferred because of the payment, a gift is made and a rebate is allowed. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Policy statements This section of the TIB contains policy statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. FBT on benefits provided in NZ to employees of non-resident employers Summary This item explains how fringe benefit tax (FBT) applies to benefits provided in New Zealand to employees of non-resident employers. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. All references to an “FBT period” are to the employer’s FBT period (which is normally three months, but may be an income year for some employers). Paragraph (n) of the definition of “fringe benefit” excludes from that definition benefits received by an employee who does not receive source deduction pay- ments that are assessable in New Zealand in that FBT period. Source deduction payments are generally assess- able in New Zealand if either of these conditions is met, and the earner is not otherwise exempt (under the Act or a double tax agreement (DTA)): • A New Zealand resident earns the source deduction payments • The source deduction payments are earned in New Zealand. When a New Zealand resident employee works in New Zealand for a non-resident employer, the employee’s source deduction payments are assessable in New Zealand, so any fringe benefits the employee receives are subject to FBT. When a non-resident employee works in New Zealand for a non-resident employer, the employee’s source deduction payments may be tax exempt in New Zealand under the Act or under the provisions of a relevant DTA. When all of the employee’s source deduction payments are not assessable in New Zealand in an FBT period, any fringe benefits that the employee receives in that period are not subject to FBT. When some or all of the employ- ee’s source deduction payments are assessable in New Zealand in an FBT period, any fringe benefits that the employee receives in that period are subject to FBT. Background On page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.8 (January 1995) we published the item Fringe benefits granted to employ- ees of overseas branches of New Zealand companies. That item stated the Commissioner’s policy on benefits provided by the overseas branch of a New Zealand employer to non-resident and New Zealand resident employees. This item states the Commissioner’s policy on the application of the FBT provisions to benefits provided by non-resident employers to New Zealand resident and non-resident employees in New Zealand. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 1 (1), (2)38(1), (2) BB 3242 CB 1 - 1561 CB 2 (1)(c)61(19) CI 1336N(1) “fringe benefit” definition NC 18350A ND 1336S(2) OB 1336N(1) OB 2 (1)6(1) OE 1241(1) - (5) OE 4 (1)(c)243(2)(c) FBT is imposed by section ND 1, and is payable by employers on the value of fringe benefits that they provide to their employees. Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules and states: “Fringe benefit” ... does not include: ... (n) Any benefit to the extent to which the Commissioner is satisfied that it is a benefit received or enjoyed by the employee in a quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, in which the employee derives a source deduction payment that is, or, as the case may be, source deduction payments all of which are, not liable for income tax under section BB 1 ... Section OB 1 defines “employee”, and “employer”: “Employee” - ... (d) ...in the FBT rules, means a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduc- tion payment (not being a payment of any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (d), (f), (g), (h), and (i) of the definition of “salary or wages” and not being a withhold- ing payment of the kind specified in Part E of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979) in respect of which the person is liable for income tax under section BB 1: “Employer” - ... (b) ... in the FBT rules, means a person who will pay, pays, or has at any time paid, or who will be, is, or has at any time been liable to pay, a source deduction payment ( not being a payment of any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (d), (f), (g), (h), and (i) of the definition of “salary or wages” and not being a withholding payment of the kind referred to in Part E of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979); ... Part E of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 refers to withholding payments to non-resident contractors. A non-resident contractor is not an employee, and a person who pays a non-resident contractor is not the employer of that contractor. Section OB 2 (1) defines “source deduction payment” as: ... a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. Application of legislation The definition of “fringe benefit” excludes benefits received by an employee in an FBT period in which the source deduction payments received by that employee are not liable for income tax under section BB 1. Section BB 1 imposes income tax. Section BB 3 states when income derived from New Zealand or overseas is assessable in New Zealand. It provides that: •Income derived by a New Zealand resident is assessable in New Zealand. Section OE 1 contains the tests of residence. In summary, under section OE 1 persons (who are not a company) are New Zealand residents if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. Persons lose New Zealand resident status when they are absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period (and they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand). •Income derived from New Zealand is assessable in New Zealand, whether derived by a New Zealand resident or not. Section OE 4 (1)(c) deems persons to derive income from New Zealand if they earn salary, wages, allowances, or emoluments in New Zealand, whether or not the employer or principal is a New Zealand resident. When a non-resident’s source deduction payments are not taxable in New Zealand A source deduction payment derived by a non-resident is not taxable in New Zealand when a provision in the Act or in any relevant DTA deems that income to be tax exempt in New Zealand. (A) Exemptions provided by the Act Under sections CB 1 - 15 certain types of income are exempt from taxation. An exemption that may apply to a non-resident’s employment income is section CB 2 (1)(c) which provides an exemption for: Income derived by a person who is not resident in New Zealand, from personal (including professional) services performed by that person within New Zealand during a visit to New Zealand, if - (i)That visit does not exceed a period of 92 days; and (ii) In the country or territory in which that person is resident, that income, being exempt from income tax in New Zealand, is chargeable with any tax which in the opinion of the Commissioner is substantially of the same nature as income tax under this Act; and (iii)Those services are performed for or on behalf of a person who is not resident in New Zealand: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to the income of public entertainers ... Provided also that this paragraph shall not apply to the income derived in any income year by a person who is present within New Zealand for a period or periods exceeding in the aggre- gate 92 days during that year. Section CB 2 contains other exemptions that may apply to the employment income of non-residents (i.e., income derived by non-resident entertainers, or visiting experts or students). (B) Exemptions provided by DTAs The DTAs to which New Zealand is a contracting party generally provide variations on the following provi- sions: 1. Personal services remuneration is subject to tax in the earner’s country of residence unless the earner performs the services in the other contracting state (“the country of source”). When this is the case, the remuneration may also be subject to tax in the country of source. 2. The above rule does not apply and the remuneration is tax exempt in the country of source when a dependent personal services article applies. Depend- ent personal services articles generally provide that remuneration is tax exempt in the country of source when: continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) for the taxation of fringe benefits. In summary, under article 16 when a fringe benefit would otherwise be subject to FBT in both New Zealand and Australia, the benefit is only taxable in the country that has the sole or primary right to tax the remuneration from the employ- ment to which the benefit relates. A country has the primary right to tax remuneration if the DTA entitles that country to tax that remuneration and the other country is required under the DTA to allow relief for taxes imposed in the first country. Summary - FBT on benefits provided to NZ or non-resident employee employed by a non-resident employer in NZ The following flow chart summarises the effect of paragraph (n) of the definition of “fringe benefit” on the application of FBT to benefits provided to employees of non-resident employers. For the purposes of the flow chart, “source deduction payment” is abbreviated to “SDP”. Taxation of benefits provided in relation to employment \* Note that the employer’s NZ FBT liability is determined by whether the employee has received an SDP in the FBT period. If the employee receives such an SDP, then the employer is liable for FBT regardless of its NZ tax residence status. •The individual is present in the country of source for no more than 183 days in an income year or a consecutive 12 month period (depending on the particular DTA); and •The remuneration is paid by an employer who is not a resident of the country of source; and •The remuneration is not borne by (deducted by) a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the country of source. 3. The DTAs each provide specific exemptions for the income of certain types of persons in certain circum- stances. A DTA may provide special exemptions for the income of certain teachers, professors, students, entertainers, and government employees. (C) DTA between New Zealand and Australia In addition to the general terms set out in (B) above, article 16 of the new DTA between New Zealand and Australia, effective 1 April 1995, specifically provides from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) FBT on benefits provided to NZ resident employee employed in NZ by non-resident employer The flow chart on the previous page shows that source deduction payments paid to a New Zealand resident employee employed in New Zealand are taxable in New Zealand. This is because the employee earns the pay- ments in New Zealand and because he or she is a New Zealand resident. Benefits provided to the employee are subject to FBT, regardless of the fact that the employer is a non-resident. Section CB 2 (1)(c) (“the 92 day exemption”) and the provisions of any relevant DTA do not affect a New Zealand resident employee’s liability to New Zealand tax. These provisions only apply to non-resident em- ployees working in New Zealand. FBT on benefits provided to a non-resident employee employed in NZ by a non-resident employer A non-resident employee’s source deduction payments will not be assessable in New Zealand in either of the following situations: • if an exemption under the Act applies to those source deduction payments • if there is a DTA between New Zealand and the employee’s country of residence and the source deduction payments are exempt under that DTA. When neither of the above occurs, the source deduction payments are assessable in New Zealand because the employee earns the payments in New Zealand, and therefore derives them from New Zealand. When source deduction payments are taxable in New Zealand in an FBT period, any benefits the employer provides to the employee in that period are subject to FBT. The em- ployer is liable for FBT, regardless of the fact that it is a non-resident. The length of time that an employee will stay in New Zealand may not be clear at the time of that employee’s arrival in New Zealand. When the length of the visit is not clear, the Commissioner is not able to establish immediately whether the employee’s source deduction payments (and, therefore, his or her fringe benefits) will be eligible for an exemption from New Zealand tax under the Act or the relevant DTA. The Commission- er’s policy is: 1. The employer must determine whether the employee will be subject to New Zealand tax on source deduc- tion payments during the year. Factors to consider in making such a determination include: •the terms of the employee’s visa, work permit, and employment contract and whether these documents indicate that the employee will satisfy the terms of an exemption under the Act or the relevant DTA. •the employer’s knowledge of the employee’s plans and intentions (i.e. if the employer knows that the employee intends to return to New Zealand during the year and will therefore not meet the terms of an exemption under the Act or the relevant DTA) and the employer’s control over whether the employee returns to New Zealand during the year (an employer will have more control over an employee than over an independent contractor). 2. Under section NC 18, in situations when it is absolutely clear from the outset that the employee will meet the terms of an exemption under the Act or the relevant DTA, and will therefore not be liable for income tax in New Zealand, the Commissioner may accept a bond or other security from the em- ployer in substitution for the employer’s liability to make PAYE deductions. Section NC 18 does not allow the employer to pay a bond in substitution for paying FBT on benefits provided to employees. In these circumstances, Inland Revenue may also issue the employee with a NIL special tax code certificate, in which case the employer will not be required to make PAYE deductions from the employee’s source deduction payments. The payment of the bond or the issuing of a NIL special tax code certificate does not affect whether or not the employee’s income is ultimately assessable in New Zealand. In situations where it is absolutely clear that the employee will not be liable for tax in New Zealand, and the employer is not deducting PAYE from the employee’s source deduction payments (because of a bond and/or a NIL special tax code certificate), the employer may treat those source deduction payments as if they were not liable for income tax in New Zealand for the purposes of paragraph (n) of the definition of “fringe benefit” - the employer may treat any benefits that it provides to the employee as not being fringe benefits subject to FBT. 3. In situations when it is not absolutely clear from the outset that the employee meets the terms of an exemption under the Act or the relevant DTA, the Commissioner considers that he can only properly ascertain whether the employee is entitled to an exemption from income tax after the employee has left New Zealand. The Commissioner will not know until that time whether the employee has been in New Zealand for less than the applicable maximum period and has met the other applicable criteria. The Commissioner’s policy is that, during the employ- ee’s stay in New Zealand, the employee’s source deduction payments are subject to tax in the normal way from arrival, and benefits provided to the employee are subject to FBT in the normal way from arrival. At the end of the employee’s stay in New Zealand, the Commissioner will review the employee’s New Zealand tax liability to determine whether the employee meets the terms of any exemption. If the employee’s source deduction payments are not taxable in New Zealand, any fringe benefits provided to the employee will not be subject to FBT in New Zealand. If this is the case, the Commissioner will continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) from her wages, CleanCo may treat the private use and availability for private use of the car as not being a fringe benefit that is subject to FBT in New Zealand. Example 2 Maxine recommends that SmellCo installs several pollution reduction devices. At SmellCo’s request, CleanCo sends Ken, another employee, to New Zealand to supervise the installation of the devices and to monitor the reduction of pollutants in SmellCo’s emissions. SmellCo and CleanCo agree that Ken will work in New Zealand for approxi- mately seven months. As with Maxine, CleanCo pays Ken’s salary and hotel expenses and provides him with the use of a car during his stay in New Zealand. Because Ken is present in New Zealand for more than 92 days in a year, the section CB 2 (1)(c) exemption does not apply to his salary. The depend- ent personal services exemption in the New Zea- land/USA DTA also does not apply to his salary because he is in New Zealand for more than 183 days. As Ken’s salary is not exempt from tax in New Zealand, the private use and availability for private use of the car is a fringe benefit. CleanCo is subject to FBT on that benefit in New Zealand. Example 3 BurnsCo is a United Kingdom resident which has a branch office in New Zealand. Helen is seconded from the UK head office to the New Zealand branch for five months. The New Zealand branch of BurnsCo pays Helen’s salary during her second- ment. Helen’s salary is not exempt from New Zealand tax under section CB 2 (1)(c) as she is in New Zealand for more than 92 days. The dependent services exemption of the DTA between New Zealand and the UK does not apply when remuneration is borne by (deducted by) a permanent establishment or fixed base which a non-resident employer has in New Zealand. A “permanent establishment” includes a branch office. Helen’s salary is paid by the New Zealand branch of BurnsCo, so her salary is not exempt under the dependent services provision of the DTA. As Helen’s salary is derived in New Zealand, and as no Act or DTA exemption applies to that salary, the salary is assessable in New Zealand. As Helen receives source deduction payments that are subject to tax in New Zealand, BurnsCo is liable to pay FBT in New Zealand on any fringe benefits it provides Helen during the FBT periods that she receives salary which is assessable in New Zealand. All enquiries from non-resident contractors should be made to the Corporates Unit of the Wellington District Office of Inland Revenue. refund any FBT paid by the employer. If the em- ployee is not entitled to an exemption, the FBT will have been correctly paid and will not be refunded. Enforcement of non-resident employer’s FBT liability The payment of FBT is an employer’s obligation which the Commissioner seeks to enforce, whether or not the employer is a New Zealand resident. In some situations a non-resident employer may arrange for an employee to account for the FBT on fringe benefits that the employer provides to the employee. In this situation the employee pays the FBT as the agent of the employer. However, if the employee fails to pay the FBT, liability for compliance with the FBT rules remains with the employer. Example 1 CleanCo is a US resident company which advises firms on pollution reduction. SmellCo, a New Zealand resident company, engages CleanCo to analyse the content of certain emissions from its Auckland plant and to develop a pollution reduction strategy. CleanCo sends an employee, Maxine, to New Zealand to study the emissions, conduct tests, and report on her findings. There is clear evidence that Maxine will not be in New Zealand for any longer than six weeks. During Maxine’s stay in New Zealand, CleanCo pays her salary, pays for her hotel accommodation, and provides a car for her use. Maxine is not a New Zealand resident as she does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand and is in New Zealand for less than 183 days during the year. Maxine derives her salary from New Zealand because she earns it in New Zealand. Maxine’s visit to New Zealand is for less than 93 days, her salary is assessable for income tax in the USA, and she is performing the services on behalf of a USA resident, CleanCo. Her salary is therefore exempt from New Zealand income tax under section CB 2 (1)(c). Maxine is in New Zealand for less than 183 days, and a non-resident employer which does not have a fixed base or permanent establishment in New Zealand pays her salary. Therefore, her salary is also exempt from New Zealand tax under the dependent services article of the DTA between New Zealand and the USA (Article 15). As Maxine has documentary evidence that she will meet the terms of the section CB 2 (1)(c) or DTA exemption, she applies for and is issued with a NIL tax code certificate. CleanCo does not need to deduct PAYE from Maxine’s salary. As it is clear that Maxine will meet the terms of the income tax exemptions, and as CleanCo is not deducting PAYE from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) GST - specified agent for incapacitated persons Summary This item states the Commissioner’s view on how the law relating to “specified agents” who carry on taxable activities for incapacitated GST registered persons applies. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background Under section 58, there are special registration rules when a GST registered person dies, becomes incapaci- tated, or goes into receivership, liquidation, or bank- ruptcy. Section 58(1A) deems the person who conducts the relevant taxable activity (the “specified agent”) on behalf of the incapacitated person to be personally carrying on the taxable activity and to be GST regis- tered for that purpose. The deeming applies from the date on which the specified agent becomes entitled to carry on a taxable activity for an incapacitated person. It ends when the person ceases to be a specified agent, or on the earlier registration of any other person in respect of the taxable activity. Section 58(2) deals with a similar situation when a mortgagee is in possession of mortgaged land or other property of a GST registered mortgagor. Under that section, the Commissioner may deem the mortgagee to be a registered person in respect of, and to the extent to which the mortgagee carries on, any taxable activity of the mortgagor. Legislation Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply (other than an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Section 51 sets out the requirements of registration for persons carrying on taxable activities. Sections 55 to 61A deal with registration and GST liability issues in certain special cases. Section 58 sets out special regis- tration rules when a GST registered person dies, becomes incapacitated, or goes into receivership, liquidation, or bankruptcy. It also deals with the posi- tion of mortgagees in possession. Section 58(1) defines “incapacitated person” as: a registered person who dies, or goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt or incapacitated. Section 58(1) defines “specified agent” as: a person carrying on any taxable activity in a capacity as personal representative, liquidator, or receiver of an incapaci- tated person, or otherwise as agent for or on behalf of or in the stead of an incapacitated person. Section 58(1A) and (2) states: (1A) For the purposes of this Act and notwithstanding section 60 of this Act, where any person becomes a specified agent that person shall, during the agency period, be deemed to be a registered person carrying on the taxable activity of the incapacitated person, and the incapaci- tated person shall during that period be deemed not to be carrying on that taxable activity: Provided that a specified agent shall not be personally liable for any liabilities under this Act incurred by the incapacitated person before the agency period. (2) Where a mortgagee is in possession of any land or other property previously mortgaged by the mortgagor, being a registered person, the Commissioner may, from the date on which the mortgagee took possession of that land or other property, until such time as the mortgagee ceases to be in possession of that land or other property, deem the mortgagee, in any case where and to the extent that the mortgagee carries on any taxable activity of the mortgagor, to be a registered person. Section 58(3) requires any person who becomes a specified agent, or who as a mortgagee in possession carries on any taxable activity of the mortgagor, to give the Commissioner written notice of that fact within 21 days of becoming a specified agent or commencing that taxable activity of the mortgagor. The notice must include the date on which the agency period started or the mortgagee took possession, and in the case of an incapacity other than those expressly defined, the nature of the incapacity and the date on which it began. “Agency period” means: the period beginning on the date on which a person becomes entitled to act as a specified agent carrying on a taxable activity in relation to an incapacitated person and ending on the earlier of- (a) The date on which some person other than the incapaci- tated person or the specified agent is registered in respect of the taxable activity; or (b) The date on which the person ceases to be a specified agent in relation to the incapacitated person: Under section 15(8), when any registered person dies, or goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt, the date of death, liquidation, receivership, or bankruptcy, as the case may be, is deemed to be the last day of that person’s taxable period. Section 6(2) deems anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity to be carried on in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Application of legislation Section 58 deems specified agents who carry on the taxable activity of incapacitated persons to be doing so as registered persons in their own right. The specified agent is personally liable for any liabilities under the continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) taxable activity of an incapacitated person even if he or she only acts in connection with the termination of that activity. For example, selling off the assets of a busi- ness. Example 1 Mele is a sole trader. She owns and operates a florist business trading as “Blooming Good”. She is registered for GST on the invoice basis and files returns two-monthly. Her taxable periods end on the last day of February, April, June, August, October, and December. Mele employs her only sister Tala. Mele dies suddenly on 3 April. When Mele first went into business she made a will. Her will provides that all her property passes to her spouse, Tom. The will appoints Tom and Tala as Mele’s executors. Tom and Tala agree that in the short term it would be prudent for Tala to carry on the business as she knows all the customers and is familiar with how it operates. Following Mele’s death the florist shop is closed for a week. Tala reopens the shop on 10 April. Tala wonders what she must do to continue to meet the business’s GST obligations, and contacts her local Inland Revenue office. Tala is told to provide formal notification in writing that she is now carrying on Mele’s taxable activity, i.e., the florist business as Mele’s personal repre- sentative, and the date of Mele’s death. Inland Revenue advises that she must do so before 25 April, i.e., 21 days from, but not including, 3 April. Under the GST legislation, Tala is now deemed to be a registered person carrying on Mele’s taxable activity. Tala is told that she is personally liable for the GST obligations and liabilities of the florist business incurred on and after 3 April while she continues to carry on the business as Mele’s per- sonal representative. Inland Revenue staff remind Tala that she will need to file a return for the March/April taxable period ending 30 April. This return is due by 31 May. This will involve making two returns: one for the period 1 March to 3 April, the other for the period 4 April to 30 April. Example 2 “Blooming Good” operates from leased premises. The landlord is Get Smart Limited. At the begin- ning of May Tala receives an invoice dated 1 May requesting the monthly rental payment for June of $300, plus GST of $37.50. The rental payment is due on or before 21 May. This reminds Tala that the monthly rental payment for May has probably not been paid. She checks the business records and finds this to be the case. The date of the tax invoice for the month of May is 1 April, payable on or before 21 April. Act incurred during the agency period. The specified agent is not personally liable for any liabilities under the Act incurred by the incapacitated person before the agency period. The registration of a specified agent is automatic. This compares with the position of mortgagees in possession. The Commissioner has a discretion as to whether to deem a mortgagee in possession who carries on any taxable activity of a GST registered mortgagor to be a registered person. Specified agents (and mortgagees) must notify Inland Revenue that they are carrying on the taxable activity, and the circumstances that gave rise to their carrying on the taxable activity, e.g., the death or illness of the registered person, or the registered person’s receivership or liquidation. Inland Revenue will keep a record of the start of the agency period. The GST registration number remains the same as for the incapacitated person. Pre-agency period Although specified agents are not personally liable for pre-agency period GST liabilities, in practice they may, when they have authority to do so, take responsibility as agents for the incapacitated registered person for GST obligations relating to that time. For example, a speci- fied agent may file outstanding returns for the pre- agency period, although he or she is not liable to do so. In certain situations a specified agent may wish to claim an input tax deduction for a supply acquired for the taxable activity during the pre-agency period. Under the proviso to section 20(3), the specified agent may seek input tax deductions relating to prior periods. Alterna- tively, a specified agent may file an amended return for the period to which the input tax claim relates. The Commissioner accepts that in both cases specified agents are acting on behalf of the incapacitated person in administrating that person’s GST rights and obliga- tions for the pre-agency period. For the same reasons the Commissioner accepts that a receiver or liquidator who is a specified agent may wish to make a deduction under section 26 for a bad debt relating to a taxable supply made during the pre-agency period. Filing returns The effect of section 15(8) is that when any registered person dies, or goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt (“the incapacity”), the specified agent in such circumstances is able to file a return for the short period from the date of the incapacity to the end of the relevant taxable period. The specified agent is responsible for filing this return. A return for the short period from the start of the taxable period up to, and including, the date of the incapacity must also be filed. The specified agent is not liable for filing this return, but may choose to do so. Termination of taxable activity The combined effect of sections 58 and 6(2) is that a person is deemed to be a registered person carrying on a from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Tala rings the owner of Get Smart Limited to clarify the position. She explains that Mele has died, and that she is carrying on the business for the time being. Tala apologises for the delay in paying the May rental, and promises to pay it, and the June rental, as soon as possible. Tala is able to claim an input tax deduction for both supplies. In the case of the GST component of the May rental payment, Tala is making the claim for an input tax deduction on Mele’s behalf. Section 9(3) deems the time of supply for the May lease period to be 1 April, i.e., prior to the agency period. In the case of the GST component of the June rental payment, Tala is making the claim for an input tax deduction as the registered person deemed to be carrying on the florist business during the agency period. Example 3 Tom decides to keep the business running and employ Tala as manager. Tala agrees. Tom registers for GST. The registration indicates that Tom intends to carry on the business from the date of distribution. The business is distributed to Tom in accordance with Mele’s will. The supply is made by Tala, as specified agent for Mele, to Tom, the beneficiary under the will. The supply is of a going concern. To comply with section 11(1)(c)(ii), Tala and Tom record in writing, prior to the distribution, that the supply of the business is a supply of a going concern. Tala ceases to be a specified agent from the date of distribution. This is the date on which some other person, i.e., Tom, is registered for the taxable activity. RWT on matrimonial property settlement interest Summary This item states the Commissioner’s policy on whether the payer should deduct resident withholding tax (“RWT”) on the interest granted by the Family Court to a spouse under proceedings under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. Unless there has been money lent, RWT is not deductible. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background In some cases the Family Court orders one spouse to pay interest on an amount outstanding to the other spouse, or former spouse, until the other spouse is paid. This interest can date back to the date that the matrimonial property claim came into existence. Taxpayers have asked Inland Revenue whether RWT is deductible from that interest. Subpart F of Part N of the Act contains the legislation applying to RWT on both interest and dividends. The objective of RWT is to reduce the scope for the evasion or deferral of income tax payable on interest and dividends. In relation to interest, the legislation achieves this by requiring the payer to deduct RWT from the interest at the time of payment. Section NF 2 (4) only requires a person to deduct RWT if the person is either resident in New Zealand or the person is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, and any of these conditions are met: • at the time of payment, the person holds a valid certificate of exemption • the payment is made wholly or partly in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity • the payment is a payment of dividends by a company on shares issued by that company. The last of these categories does not apply in a matrimo- nial property case. The only two categories of relevance are when the payer holds a valid certificate of exemp- tion or if there is a transfer of assets forming part of a taxable activity. The term “taxable activity” has the same meaning as in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, except that it also includes activities relating to the making of exempt supplies. An example of a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity is: the supply of goods applied by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies which are transferred to a spouse to satisfy that person’s claim under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. The recipient includes the gross resident withholding income in his or her tax return, and can claim a credit for the RWT deducted. The RWT deduction rate is 24% for interest, but if the recipient does not provide his or her IRD number to the person paying the interest, RWT is deducted at the higher “no declaration rate” of 33%.

However, the payment the Family Court describes as “interest”, and which is payable by one spouse until payment is made to the other spouse, is not interest in terms of the definition of “interest” for RWT purposes. In other words, it is not resident withholding income. Resident withholding income consists of interest and dividends, subject to certain exceptions listed in section NF 1. Section OB 1 defines “interest” in paragraph (e) for the purposes of the RWT rules as including a redemption payment. This has no relevance in the context of an interest payment ordered by the Family Court. It is necessary to consider the other paragraphs of the definition of “interest” in section OB 1. The only part of the definition relevant to this issue is the para- graph (a) definition of “interest”. The paragraph (a) definition includes the requirement that the interest be in respect of or in relation to money lent. In order for the payment described as “interest” by the Family Court to be “interest” in terms of the RWT rules, there is a requirement that money has been lent. Section OB 1 also contains a definition of “money lent”. This is cited in the legislation section of this item. In most cases, the spouse receiving the payment under the Family Court order will not have lent money. The spouse will not have made an advance of that money or forborne the debt. The debt only comes into existence when the Family Court makes the order. It is possible that a spouse or former spouse might agree not to enforce the judgment of the Court, and elect to receive further interest in return for a delay in payment. In this situation money would be lent. Provided the other requirements in section NF 4 (2) are met, RWT would be deductible on the further interest derived from that agreement or arrangement. Nevertheless, in most cases, there will be no forbearance of any debt nor any money lent. Therefore, any payment of interest made in accordance with the Family Court order will not be resident withholding income. RWT is not deductible if there is no resident withholding income. Unless there is some agreement to forbear payment or advance money, no resident withholding tax is deduct- ible on the “interest” awarded under a Family Court order. Even if there was forbearance, the payer would still have to be within the provisions of section NF 2 (4) before there was a liability to deduct RWT. Occasionally, the High Court or some other court will make an order in relation to matrimonial property issues. In such cases the same principles apply as for the Family Court. Although such payments are not “interest” for the purposes of the RWT rules, this does not mean that such payments are not assessable in the hands of the recipi- ent. The issue as to whether the payments are assessable is a separate and different consideration and will depend on the facts of individual cases. Section OB 1 states that “resident withholding income”: ... has the meaning assigned by section NF 1; and, unless the context otherwise requires, in relation to any amount of resident withholding income, includes any amount of resident withholding tax required to be deducted from that income in accordance with the RWT rules: Section NF 1 (2) states: The RWT rules shall apply to any amount paid (referred to as “resident withholding income”) that consists of - (a) Interest, ... The definition of “resident withholding income” excludes certain types of interest, but they are not relevant in this case. Section OB 1 defines “interest” in paragraph (a) as: In relation to the deriving of income, resident withholding income, or non-resident withholding income by any person (in this definition referred to as the “first person”), means every payment (not being a repayment of money lent and not being a redemption payment), whether periodical or not and however described or computed, made to the first person by any other person (in this definition referred to as the “second person”) in respect of or in relation to money lent to the second person making the payment or to any other person: (emphasis added) Section OB 1 further defines “interest” for the RWT rules in paragraph (e) as including “a redemption payment”. Section OB 1 also contains a definition of money lent. This states: “Money lent”, in relation to any person, means- (a) Any amount of money advanced, deposited, or otherwise let out, whether on current account or otherwise, by the person: (b) Any amount of credit given (including the forbearance of any debt), whether on current account or otherwise, by the person: (c) Any amount advanced, deposited or let out, or for which credit is given, by the person under any obligation or arrangement that is similar to any advancing, depositing, letting out, or giving of credit, of any of the kinds referred to in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b): (d) Any amount paid to, or for the benefit of, or on behalf of, or dealt with in the interest of or on behalf of, any other person in consideration for an agreement to pay or a promise to pay by the other person, where that amount is exceeded by the amount payable to the person in accord- ance with the agreement or the promise, - whether or not the advancing, depositing, or letting out, or the giving of credit, or the obligation or arrangement, or the agreement to pay or promise to pay, is secured or evidenced by writing; and, for the purposes of paragraph (d), the expression “other person”, where it last appears in that paragraph, shall include any further person where the other person and the further person are associated persons: Policy Subject to the requirements set out in section NF 2 (4), a payer must deduct RWT from any payment of resident from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Depreciation on yachts - draft determination Introduction Currently there is one asset class for all types of yachts, with a depreciation rate of 12% DV. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination which will set two new asset classes for yachts. The draft determination is reproduced below. The determination will set a new depreciation rate of 15% diminishing value (“DV”) for the asset class “Yachts (international ocean-going)”. The other asset class will clarify that the existing rate of 12% DV continues to apply, but to “Yachts (other than international ocean-going)” rather than to all “Yachts”. The proposed new depreciation rate for “Yachts (international ocean-going)” of 15% DV is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of six years and a residual value of 40% of cost. The EUL of six years reflects that this type of yacht typically has a useful charter life of six years and after this period is not usually useful for charter (i.e., produc- ing assessable income). The estimated residual market value of this type of yacht at the end of six years is typically 40% of cost.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Rental property - deducting maintenance expenses while property vacant Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A taxpayer has asked whether the expenses involved in maintaining a vacant rental property are tax deductible. Section BB 7 allows a tax deduction for expenditure that is: (a) ... incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year. A landlord will generally incur a number of costs in respect of a rental property, regardless of whether it is tenanted at the time. For example, rates, insurance, electricity and interest costs will still be payable. If the property is available for rental, or temporarily unavailable for rental while maintenance work is being carried out, such costs will continue to be deductible. Example 1 Albert has a flat that he rents to tenants. The tenant that was occupying the flat moved out, and Albert has been seeking a new tenant without success. Albert is still incurring ongoing expenses such as rates, insurance, mortgage interest, and some minor repairs and maintenance. These expenses continue to be tax deductible. If a rental property is temporarily taken off the market, any ongoing expenses that are incurred will still be tax deductible. Example 2 Albert concludes that the reason for not finding a new tenant is that the flat is too run down. He decides to take it off the market so that he can fix it up. Once the flat has been repaired, cleaned and painted, he will look for a new tenant. The ongoing expenses that Albert incurs will still be deductible. To the extent that they are making good fair wear and tear, the repairs and maintenance will also be deductible. Any expenses incurred in improving the property are of a capital nature and are not deductible. When a taxpayer incurs a tax deductible loss, but has no other income against which the loss can be offset, it can be carried forward to be offset against income earned in later years. Rental property - deductibility of renovation costs Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A taxpayer who owns a number of domes- tic rental properties wants to renovate a kitchen that is outdated, dark, and a continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) condensation trap. The taxpayer also intends to replace rotten wooden window frames with low maintenance aluminium ones. He has asked whether the costs incurred can be offset against rental income. Generally, the cost of keeping an asset in a reasonable state of repair and effi- ciency is a revenue cost, allowed as a deduction by section BB 7. Before a deduc- tion can be allowed as repairs and maintenance, the expenditure must have been incurred in making good fair wear and tear that occurred to the asset while it was producing assessable income. The deductibility of this type of expenditure will depend on the specific circumstances of each individual case. Under section BB 8 (a) (section 106(1)(a), Income Tax Act 1976), no deduction is allowed for expenditure of a capital nature. Case law has produced several tests which Inland Revenue applies in deciding whether expenditure incurred is revenue or capital. These tests, which are not exhaustive or to be considered in isolation, consider the questions: • Does the expenditure increase the useful life of the asset, its output, or effi- ciency? • Is the expenditure a one-off expense? • Does the expenditure create a new asset that did not exist before? • Does the expenditure confer an enduring benefit to the taxpayer? • Does the expenditure relate to the profit-earning structure, rather than the profit-making process, of the business? If the answer to these questions is predominantly “yes”, the expenditure is likely to be of a capital nature. In this case, the renovations to the kitchen do not fall within the criteria for being repairs and maintenance as the value of the property will be substantially im- proved. The improvements are of a capital nature, and the costs cannot be offset against rental income. However, the cost of the replacement windows may be either revenue or capital. A decision on this cannot be made on the information provided. The cost of the renovations that are capitalised can be added to the cost of the property, and depreciation claimed in the normal manner. Rental property - deductibility of interior redecorations Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: An owner of a domestic rental property that has been rented out for 8 years plans to do some interior redecoration. Wear and tear over the years necessitates new paint and paper. Rather than inconven- ience the tenants, she is considering completing the work on the expiry of the tenancy agreement when she will take over the occupancy of the house herself. She has asked if the timing of the redecorations affects the deductibility of their cost. In any situation involving repairs and maintenance, it is necessary to consider the application of section BB 8 (a) (section 106(1)(a), Income Tax Act 1976) which denies a deduction for capital expenditure. On the facts here, the work is making good wear and tear, and so the section does not apply. Under section BB 7, a deduction is permitted, unless the Act provides otherwise, when it: from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year. This means that for the expenditure to be deductible, it must be closely linked to the income producing process. If the redecorating takes place when the property owner is living in the house, no deduction will be available as it will then be expenditure of a private or domestic nature under section BB 8 (b) (section 106(1)(j), Income Tax Act 1976), and will not come within section BB 7. In the Taxation Review Authority decision Case J97 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,552, it was held that expenditure incurred in one year to repair damage sustained in earlier years could not be related back, once the renting activity had ceased, to rent received in those years. We advised the taxpayer that the timing of the redecorations was relevant, and that for a deduction to be claimed the work should be carried out whilst the renting activity was still carried on. Inland Revenue’s policy on repairs and maintenance is provided in TIB Volume Five, No.9 (February 1994) at page 1. Netting used to protect grapes from birds - deduction Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A grape grower has resorted to using netting to keep birds off her grapes, at a cost of $12,000. The netting is estimated to last for little more than a year. The grower has asked how she can claim the cost of the netting. Section BB 7 allows a claim for expenditure or loss incurred in the production of assessable income. The netting is expenditure incurred in the production of income. However, section BB 8 (a) (section 106(1)(a), Income Tax Act 1976) denies a deduction for expenditure of a capital nature. Case law has produced several tests which Inland Revenue finds useful in deciding whether expenditure incurred is revenue or capital. These tests are set out in the item at the top of the previous page. If the answer to them is predomi- nantly “yes”, it is likely that the expenditure is of a capital nature. In this case, the netting is not capital in nature for these reasons: • It does not increase the useful life of an asset. • It is recurrent, rather than one-off. • It does not confer an enduring benefit on the taxpayer. The taxpayer can therefore claim a deduction for the cost of the netting in the year she incurs the expenditure. Employee home telephone costs - reimbursement by employer Section CB 12 (section 73, Income Tax Act 1976) - Power to exempt employee’s allowances: A tax practitioner has asked if an employer needs to gain the Com- missioner’s approval before treating reimbursements of an employee’s employ- ment-related home telephone costs as not assessable in the hands of the em- ployee. This situation arises when an employee uses a home telephone partially for employment purposes, pays the resulting employment-related expenses, and is specifically reimbursed for those expenses by the employer. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) The employer does not need to gain the Commissioner’s prior approval before treating the reimbursements as not assessable in the employee’s hands. The specific reimbursement payments are exempt under section CB 12 (1)(a). The application of section CB 12 is considered in detail in Tax Information Bulle- tin Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995). Section CB 12 sets out the amended rules regarding reimbursing allowances and payments on account of employees that were formerly contained in sections 73 and 73A of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Commissioner’s policy on the tax treatment of employee home telephone costs is set out more fully on page 4 of TIB Volume Four, No. 8 (April 1993). Motor vehicle dealers - valuation of trade-in stock Section EE 1 (section 85, Income Tax Act 1976) - Valuation of trading stock, including livestock: Motor vehicle dealers are able to use a formula method to value trade-in vehicles for the purposes of section EE 1. A dealer in motorcycles has asked whether she can use the same method to value trade-in motorcycles. Section EE 1 (1) states: Where any taxpayer owns or carries on any business, the value of the taxpayer’s trading stock at the beginning and at the end of every income year shall be taken into account in ascertaining whether or not the taxpayer has derived assessable income during that year. Under section EE 1 (3), the taxpayer can choose to value trading stock at its cost price, its market selling value, or the price at which it can be replaced. Inland Revenue has approved the following formula for use by motor vehicle dealers who are master agents or sub-agents (i.e. the franchise holder or an agent of the franchise holder), for valuing trade-in vehicles: If on the floor less than 1 monthat the basic (trade-in) value After 1 monthbasic value less 10 percent After 2 monthsbasic value less 20 percent After 3 monthsbasic value less 30 percent After 4 months or longerbasic value less 40 percent We recognise that turnover is the only principle for determining values of trade- in vehicles in the used car market. If a car remains on the floor for any length of time, it must be assumed that the price is wrong or there is something wrong with the car, i.e., the purchase price or trade-in allowance is in excess of true value. The formula for write-down of the basic value applies to all secondhand vehi- cles, including tractors, whether purchased outright or as a trade-in for a new vehicle. The cost of reconditioning a trade-in vehicle is capitalised in all cases. Demonstration vehicles (vehicles purchased new but used for demonstration) are written down on the same basis. The approval to use the formula method does not apply to secondhand car dealers who are not master agents or sub-agents. A dealer in motorcycles must register as a motor vehicle dealer with the MVDI. As long as the dealer in this case meets the required criteria, she is able to value trade-in motorcycles using the above formula. Using this formula method is not mandatory. A dealer can value stock at the lower of cost, market value, or replacement cost. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Distributorship contract is a chose in action Section 2(1) - Definitions of “Goods” and “Input tax”: A GST registered person has acquired a business consisting of a vehicle and a distributorship contract from a non-registered person. The contract, amongst other things, grants her exclusive rights to distribute and sell a company’s products within a defined territory. She has asked if, for the purposes of obtaining an input tax deduction under paragraph (c) of the section 2(1) definition of “Input tax”, the contract is considered to be goods or a chose in action, and seeks more information on identifying choses in action. In order for a GST registered person to claim an input tax deduction for second- hand goods acquired from a non-registered person, or from a registered person when the goods are outside that person’s taxable activity, the definitions of “Input tax” and “Secondhand goods” must be satisfied. However, before consid- ering the criteria within those definitions, the registered person must first deter- mine that what has been acquired meets the definition of “goods”. Section 2(1) defines “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money. A chose in action is a thing recoverable by action e.g., a lawsuit, as opposed to a chose in possession which is a thing that a person not only owns but also has actual physical possession of, e.g., clothes, a dog, a television set. The term “chose in action” is used for both corporeal (tangible, having a material exist- ence) and incorporeal (intangible, not having a material existence) personal property which is not in possession. The distributorship contract is a chose in action because it grants rights which someone else (the company whose products are being sold) owns. The taxpayer is unable to take physical possession of those rights, and would need to sue for them if they were withheld. As choses in action are not goods, they cannot be secondhand goods and, there- fore, cannot come within paragraph (c) of the Input tax definition. No deduction is available under section 20(3), as no GST is chargeable by the non-registered vendor of the business. Other examples of things considered by the courts to be choses in action are: Debts: bills of exchange: debenture stock: an option to purchase land or shares: rights under a hire purchase agreement: a ticket in a sweepstake: the benefit of a contract: shares in a company: copyrights: a share in a partnership: a share in a racehorse: bills of lading: policies of insurance: a right to rent. “Services” as defined in section 2 are anything which is not goods or money, so choses in action are services. Multi-draw lottery - time of supply for GST Section 9(2) - Time of supply in certain circumstances: A company is running a large lottery, and will make three prize draws over a six-week period. The com- pany has a one month GST taxable period. A company representative has asked when GST on the proceeds of the lottery must be accounted for. Under section 5(10), a supply occurs when a person pays money to participate in a lottery. The amount paid is deemed to be for a supply of services by the per- son, society, licensed promoter, or organiser who conducts the lottery. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Section 9(2) and (3) give time of supply rules that are exceptions to the general rule under section 9(1). Under section 9(2)(e), a supply of goods and services is deemed to take place: Where that supply is deemed to be made pursuant to section 5(10) of this Act, on the date on which the first drawing or determination of a result of the ...lottery...commences... This ensures that when there is more than one drawing or determination of prizes in any lottery or other competition, the GST liability arises on the date of the first draw or determination. Under section 10(14), the consideration for a supply deemed to be made under section 5(10) is the total proceeds of the lottery, less any cash prizes. The com- pany must account for one-ninth of the net amount as GST in its return period that includes the date of the first draw. The company may deduct the GST content of any non-cash prizes it has purchased, using the general time of sup- ply rule under section 9(1), provided the tax invoice requirements of section 24 have been met. Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 ACC employer premiums not payable by employees Section 101 - Premiums payable by employers: The employees of a small com- pany have been asked by their employer to agree to reimburse the company for the amounts of the employer premiums paid on their behalf. One of the employ- ees has asked Inland Revenue for details of the premiums, so she can be sure that she is paying no more than her employer has paid. Section 101(1) requires a basic premium to be paid by every employer, at a prescribed rate, on the amount of employees’ earnings paid by the employer. Section 101(2) states: No employer shall charge to any employee any premium payable by that employer or deduct from any payment to any employee any amount representing the amount of premium payable by that employer in respect of that employee under this Act; whether or not such charging or deduction is authorised by any contract between the employer and the employee. Section 101(3) goes on to say that an employer who breaches section 101(2) commits an offence, and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000. Section 101(2) reflects the fundamental intention of the legislation to place liabil- ity for the employer premium solely with the employer: the premium is to fund the cost of work-related accidents. We told the employee that she should not make payment of the employer pre- mium to her employer. Inland Revenue has contacted the employer’s manager and made him aware of the illegality of seeking reimbursement, or making a deduction, of the employer premium from employees. Even if the employees had agreed to reimburse the employer, the actions of the employer would still have been in breach of section 101(2). The Double Taxation Relief (China) Order 1986 Extension of New Zealand/China Double Taxation Agreement to Hong Kong A tax practitioner has asked if the double taxation agreement (DTA) between New Zealand and China will extend to Hong Kong when it is handed over to China in 1997. from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) On 1 July 1997 Hong Kong will be handed back to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The relations between the PRC and Hong Kong after the hand- over are framed by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and by the Basic Law on Hong Kong, the latter being legislation promulgated by the PRC which becomes effective on 1 July 1997. The Joint Declaration established the concept of “one country, two systems”, and guarantees maintenance of local rule for 50 years after the hand-over. Under the Basic Law on Hong Kong, Hong Kong will be a “special administra- tive district” of the PRC, and the laws of the PRC will not apply to Hong Kong for a period of 50 years following the 1997 hand-over. The DTA defines “China” as meaning the People’s Republic of China and in- cludes the territory of the PRC in which the Chinese laws relating to taxation apply. Under the Basic Law on Hong Kong the Chinese taxation laws will not apply to Hong Kong, so the DTA between New Zealand and China will not be extended to include Hong Kong. Tax Administration Act 1994 The binding rulings provisions have been in effect since 1 April 1995, and a number of technical issues have been encountered in connection with their operation. In this and subsequent editions of the Tax Information Bulletin, we will publish a series of questions and answers on the binding rulings process. These will include questions raised at the 1995 Tax Conference of the New Zealand Society of Accountants, and other questions and issues referred to us. “Taxation law” covered by a binding ruling Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: A taxpayer wants to know whether a sale of shares is taxable as a sale of personal property under section BB 4 (c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 65(2)(e), Income Tax Act 1976). She drafts a private ruling to the effect that the sale is not taxable under that section, and forwards it to Inland Revenue to obtain a private binding ruling. Inland Revenue issues the ruling as drafted. The taxpayer follows it, and the Commissioner is, therefore, bound by it. Two years later Inland Revenue audits the taxpayer and issues an assessment taxing the profits on the transac- tion under section BB 4 (a) (section 65(2)(a)). The taxpayer has asked if Inland Revenue can do this. Section 91E requires the Commissioner, on application by a person, to make a private ruling on how a taxation law applies to that person. “Taxation law” is defined in section 91B as a “provision” contained in the various revenue Acts specified in section 91C (1). These Acts include the Income Tax Act 1994. Inland Revenue’s view is that a “provision” is any operative section, subsection, paragraph or subparagraph (as the case may be) of the relevant Act, as referred to in the ruling. In this case the taxation law on which the Commissioner has ruled is paragraph (c) of section BB 4. He can therefore assess under section BB 4 (a) as this provision is not the taxation law on which he gave his ruling. Inland Revenue will ensure that the information provided in a ruling it gives will be as clear as possible as to the specific taxation law to which the ruling relates. In some cases, Inland Revenue may seek to raise with an applicant taxation laws (or provisions) relevant to an arrangement that are not identified in an applica- tion. However, the scope of a ruling is the concern of the applicant and Inland Revenue cannot guarantee to point out potentially relevant provisions in any particular case. Applicants should therefore identify carefully which provisions they wish the ruling to cover. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Application for a private ruling by a company whose taxation affairs are handled by Inland Revenue’s Corporates Unit Section 91EC - Applying for a private ruling: A company is a “client” of Inland Revenue’s Corporates Unit, and wishes to apply for a private ruling. Its repre- sentative has asked whether it should apply directly to the Rulings Directorate or liaise through its account manager at the Corporates Unit. On page 3 of TIB Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995), in an item Binding rulings series, we stated that taxpayers who are clients of Inland Revenue’s Corporates Unit should deal with their account manager who will liaise with Rulings. After seeking comments from companies and tax practitioners, we have reviewed this statement. As Rulings Directorate handles all applications for binding rulings, the Corporates’ client should send its application direct to Rulings, who will liaise with the Corporates Unit, and send them a copy of the application. Estimates of fees to be charged for binding rulings Section 91I - Regulations: Inland Revenue charges $105 per hour (GST inclu- sive) for providing private and product rulings. A company has applied for a ruling and is meeting with Rulings’ staff to discuss the matter. Inland Revenue is represented at the meeting by three Rulings’ staff and two staff from the Corporates Unit. The company assumes that it is paying $525 per hour (i.e., $105 per hour for each of the five staff members) for the service and wonders whether that represents value for money. Inland Revenue must provide an applicant for a binding ruling with an estimate of the fees payable. If Inland Revenue later considers that an original estimate is incorrect, it must provide another estimate as soon as practicable. Additionally, Inland Revenue is required to ensure that every effort is made, within reason, to minimise the fees payable. These requirements are set out in regulations 3 and 4 of the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1995. In the above case, the taxpayer should have been provided with an estimate of the fees payable and of any subsequent revised estimate prior to the meeting. The attendance of Corporates’ staff at such a meeting would not ordinarily be charged for by Inland Revenue, unless they were involved in providing special- ist input (as distinct from keeping Corporates informed on the progress of the ruling application). Furthermore, if any Rulings’ staff are attending for training or experience purposes, their time would not be charged to the applicant. Inland Revenue is always mindful of the requirement to keep fees to a minimum when deciding on the number of staff to use in producing a ruling. When expenditure falls within the period specified in the ruling Section 91DC - Application of a public ruling: A public ruling is issued that states: “This ruling applies to any person who incurs the (specified) expenditure from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1998”. In January 1998, a company acquires goods and incurs expenditure of the type referred to in the ruling. However, under the accrual expenditure provisions of section EF 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 104A, Income Tax Act 1976), the company is required to defer the deduction for a portion of that expenditure until the year ended March 1999. Also, in February 1998, the company signs a 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) contract to purchase a certain quantity of goods over the next two years. The company’s manager has asked whether the public ruling applies to expenditure the company will be required to defer (for deduction purposes) until after 31 March 1998. The expenditure incurred by the company in January 1998 falls within the pe- riod covered by the public ruling as the ruling refers to the time the person “incurs” the expenditure. The expenditure is “initially” deductible in the 1998 year. The accrual expenditure provision requires the unexpired portion of the accrual expenditure to be added back as assessable income in that year, but the effect of the ruling will apply to the deduction of that unexpired portion in the subsequent income year. The same principle applies to the 1998 contract, subject to Inland Revenue being satisfied as to when the expenditure in relation to the contract is originally “incurred” for income tax purposes. When income derived progressively falls within the period specified in a ruling Section 91DC - Application of a public ruling: A public ruling is issued that states: “This ruling applies to arrangements entered into between 1 April 1995 and 31 March 1998 and to income derived during the period 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1998 from such arrangements”. In December 1995, a company enters into an arrangement of the type specified in the ruling. The income derived from the arrangement will arise progressively over five years. A company representative has asked whether the ruling applies to the entire income flow. The ruling applies only to income derived up until 31 March 1998. Income derived after this date, even though it results from an arrangement entered into before 31 March, is not covered by the ruling. When goods purchased fall within the period specified in a GST public binding ruling Section 91DC - Application of a public ruling: A public ruling that deals with GST input tax deduction claims on the purchase of goods states: “This ruling applies to purchases of the (specified) goods made during the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1998.” In March 1998, a GST registered company enters into a conditional contract for the purchase of such goods. A non-refundable deposit is paid on that day. The contract becomes unconditional on 1 April 1998 and settlement takes place in May of that year. The company’s manager has asked whether, in line with the ruling, the company can claim an input tax deduction for the goods acquired under the contract. The company is entitled to an input tax deduction for goods under this contract in accordance with the terms of the ruling. The ruling is in respect of a GST matter and the time of supply rules will apply to the transaction. Under section 9(1) of the GST Act 1985, the time of supply will be triggered by the payment of the deposit, i.e., March 1998. If the company is on the invoice basis of accounting for GST, it will be entitled to an input tax deduction for the total contract price in the taxable period in which the deposit was paid. If the company is on the pay- ments basis of accounting, the input tax deduction available in the taxable period in which the deposit was paid is in respect of that deposit only (section 20(3) of continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) the GST Act 1985). In the latter case, payments made after the expiry of the application period are also covered by the ruling, as it is considered (for the purposes of the public ruling) that the purchase of the relevant goods occurred before 1 April 1998. In the normal course, however, a ruling pertaining to GST would be likely to refer to the time of supply rather than purchase. Product ruling sought by person who does not intend to be a party to the arrangement Section 91FC - Applying for a product ruling: A professional adviser wants to obtain a product ruling for a generic type of arrangement that may be entered into by, or recommended to, his clients or potential clients. He has requested a ruling, and included a form of document with his application. The Commissioner will decline to rule on such an application. In the context of the binding rulings provisions, an “arrangement” is any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried out. (“Arrangement” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as incorporated into the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994 through section 3(2) of that Act.) Each of these notions requires the involvement of a party to it - either an existing party, or one who is consider- ing entering into such an arrangement. Further, under section 91F (4)(b) the Commissioner may decline to issue a prod- uct ruling where the arrangement is “not seriously contemplated by the appli- cant”. The words of this paragraph mean that a ruling may be declined when an applicant is not genuinely considering becoming a party to the “arrangement” referred to: a conclusion that is supported by the use of the word “seriously” and particularly reinforced by the fact that identical words are used in section 91E (4)(b) in the context of private rulings. (Section 91E clearly anticipates that the applicant for a private ruling will or may be “entering into” the relevant arrangement). These conclusions are consistent with the purpose of the binding rulings provi- sions, stated in section 91A, to provide taxpayers (rather than advisers or unin- volved promoters) with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply the taxation laws so as to help them meet their taxation obligations. Accordingly, Inland Revenue will only consider requests for private or product rulings when the applicant is a party, or is seriously contemplating becoming a party, to the actual or proposed “arrangement”. Thus, a taxpayer company intending to market an “arrangement” to its customers (when it will enter into the same arrangement with a range of persons whose identity would not affect the operation of the taxation law upon the arrangement) may seek and obtain a product ruling regarding its position under such “arrangements”. Of course, a taxpayer’s application for a binding ruling may be made directly, or through a professional adviser who is acting as agent for that applicant. When an arrangement is “entered into” Section 91E (5) - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: A taxpayer executed a conditional contract with a development company for the sale of one of her commercial properties. She then made an application for a binding ruling on whether the profit from the proposed sale would be assessable income under section CD 1 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 67(4), Income Tax Act 1976). from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) The Commissioner declined to give a ruling under section 91E (5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on the grounds that this was an arrangement “entered into” before he received the application for the ruling. Under section 91E (5), the Commissioner is precluded from making a private ruling before 1 April 1996 on an arrangement entered into before he received the ruling application. It is the Commissioner’s view that a conditional contract is an “arrangement” and is “entered into” when executed. The definition of an “arrangement” includes: any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), includ- ing all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. The wide definition means that there need not be a legally enforceable commit- ment before an arrangement is seen to have come into existence. This reasoning is reinforced by the definition referring to “all steps and transactions”, which means that the existence of an “arrangement” does not require a completed transaction. A conditional contract is a “contract” nevertheless, and this ap- proach is consistent with one of the initial purposes of the binding rulings sys- tem - namely, to provide tax certainty that would facilitate taxpayers’ decisions to embark upon commercial transactions and undertakings. Therefore, the Commissioner is currently unable to rule on conditional contracts as they are considered to be arrangements “entered into” by the taxpayer. The same criteria apply to the withdrawal provisions contained in section 91EI. Under these provisions, if the Commissioner withdraws a private ruling, the ruling does not apply if the arrangement was “entered into” after the date of withdrawal. There- fore, an unconditional contract/arrangement entered into before the Commis- sioner withdraws a private ruling, will be binding on him. 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

GST - supply of a going concern Rating:•• Case:Pine v Commissioner of Inland Revenue HC No. 32/94 (Auckland Registry) Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 11(1)(c) Keywords:going concern, supply of a taxable activity, output tax Summary:The High Court held that the taxable activity supplied, commercial leasing, ceased at the point either when the agreement for sale and purchase became unconditional or on settlement. As a consequence, there was no supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. Facts:A vendor entered into an agreement to sell a commercial property. A partner- ship between the purchaser and his father had leased that property for some years. The partnership lapsed during the term of the lease, and the purchaser had taken responsibility for the lease, holding it on trust for his father. The vendor was not aware of the termination of the partnership. The agreement provided that the purchase price was “inclusive of GST if any”, and subject to the existing tenancy. The purchaser requested, and the vendor had permitted, the alteration of the settlement statement to show a breakdown between the purchase price and GST. The purchaser believed he was entitled to an input tax deduction, while the vendor believed and intended that the transaction was zero-rated. The purchaser claimed and received an input tax deduction. Following an audit, the deduction was disallowed. The purchaser objected, and a case was stated to the Taxation Review Authority. The TRA held that the sale and purchase was not of a going concern, and the purchaser was entitled to the input tax deduc- tion. The Commissioner then stated a case to the High Court, requesting the Court to decide whether the Commissioner had acted correctly in assessing the vendor for output tax on the sale of the property. Decision:The issue was whether there was supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. The difficulty arose because the purchaser and the tenant were one and the same person. Consequently, the landlord/tenant relationship ceased as soon as the 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) purchaser acquired the property. If the purchaser had been someone else, the supply would have been zero-rated. The taxable activity supplied (as a going concern) ceased at the point either when the purchaser obtained an equitable interest in the fee simple (when the agreement for sale and purchase became unconditional), or when he obtained the estate in fee simple on settlement. At that point, there was no longer a going concern. The Court said that, in general, the test for whether there has been a supply of a going concern will be applied at the date of takeover, but there may be occasions when an earlier test date is appropriate The High Court agreed with the approach taken in Allen Yacht Charters Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270 that the business or undertaking must be “going” in the sense of actively operating at the time of its transfer to the new owner. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Whether value of land at end of year to be taken into account for tax purposes Rating:•••• Case:Garwen Holding Limited v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,396 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 85, 104 (Income Tax Act 1994 - section OB 1) Keywords:land, trading stock, accounting practice Summary:A dealer in land was entitled to a deduction under section 104 for the cost price of each parcel of land in the year of purchase. However, in calculating its assess- able income, it had to bring back into its accounts the value of any land that was unsold at the end of the income year. Facts:The Commissioner and the taxpayer company agreed that the taxpayer com- pany was a dealer in land for the purposes of section 67(4) and was entitled to a deduction under section 104 for the cost price of the land. The Commissioner contended that although the cost price of each parcel of land was deductible as expenditure in the year of purchase under section 104, the value of any land that was unsold at the end of an income year had to be brought back into the taxpay- er’s accounts for that year in calculating its assessable income. The Commis- sioner contended that although the legislation was silent on the precise formula for calculating profits or gains from the sale of land by a dealer in land, the Commissioner was entitled to use ordinary commercial methods of calculating profits or gains. The taxpayer maintained that in the case of trading stock falling outside section 85 it was entitled to a deduction and there was nothing else- where in the Act requiring an accounting for tax purposes on a basis analogous to that set out in section 85. Decision:Justice Blanchard held that the scheme of the Act had to be viewed against the general accounting background. He noted that section 85 (which deals with the valuation of trading stock) excluded land only for the purposes of that section. His Honour stated that he could see no general intention to prevent recognition of a dealer’s land as stock-in-trade. He pointed out that an existing practice may co-exist with a statutory provision consistent with that practice. To read section 85 as altering the long-standing practice regarding the accounting treatment of land as trading stock would be to create a glaring accounting anomaly. Justice Blanchard held that, where land of the taxpayer was purchased for the purpose of resale and was left unsold by the taxpayer at the end of the income year, the Commissioner was entitled to require that its value (equivalent to cost price) be brought back into its profit and loss account for that income year. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. Financial planning fees: income tax deductibility Public ruling - BR Pub 95/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections BB 7, BB 8, CB 1 - CB 15, EE 1, EF 1, and EH 1 - EH 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when taxpayers incur fees for financial planning services. “Fees for financial planning services” means planning fees, implementation fees, and monitoring fees for the purposes of this ruling. “Planning”, “implementation”, and “monitoring” services have the following meanings for the purpose of this ruling. Planning services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser plans an investor’s portfolio of investments. Planning services are often pro- vided at the outset of the portfolio’s establishment, but can also be provided as part of the adviser’s ongoing service. Implementation services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser implements an investor’s financial plan. Implementation services also include the services provided when a custodian implements the plan, and an adviser charges the investor a fee. However, if an adviser’s fee in such a situa- tion relates to monitoring services, the services are not implementation services. Monitoring services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser monitors and evaluates the performance of an investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include the collection of income from investments, and the exchanging of foreign currency. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to fees for financial planning services incurred within the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1999. The ruling Passive investors Passive investors are investors who are not speculative investors, nor in the business of investing. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Planning services Taxpayers who are passive investors cannot deduct fees paid to financial advis- ers for planning services. Fees paid for planning are capital expenses and not deductible because of the operation of section BB 8 (a). Fees paid for planning may also be not deductible for the further reason that they do not satisfy section BB 7. Implementation services Taxpayers who are passive investors cannot deduct fees paid to financial advis- ers for implementation services. Fees paid for implementation are capital ex- penses and not deductible because of the operation of section BB 8 (a). For passive investors the deductibility of implementation fees is subject to the qualified accrual rules in sections EH 1 to EH 9. Monitoring services Passive investors can deduct fees paid for monitoring investments under section BB 7 (a), when those fees are incurred. However, to the extent that monitoring fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure must be included in the assessable income of the passive investor for the income year. Business investors and speculative investors Speculative investors are investors who acquire an investment with the intention of selling it, or carry on or carry out an undertaking entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Persons are in the business of investing when the nature of their activity, and their intention in respect of the activity, is sufficient to amount to a business. Taxpayers in the business of investing and taxpayers who are speculative inves- tors can deduct all planning, implementation, and monitoring fees, when in- curred, under section BB 7. For speculative investors, the deductibility of implementation fees is subject to the qualified accrual rules in sections EH 1 to EH 9. For business investors, the deductibility of implementation fees is subject to the qualified accrual rules in sections EH 1 to EH 9, and where the qualified accrual rules do not apply, the trading stock provisions of section EE 1. To the extent that fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure must be included in the assessable income of the investor for the income year. Financial arrangement implementation fees For passive, speculative, and business investors, there is a special treatment for the deductibility of financial arrangement implementation fees. Such fees must be dealt with under the qualified accruals rules. For such fees the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is often no longer impor- tant as the deductibility of the fees is provided for by statute. There are, how- ever, some exceptions to the statutory deductibility of the fees where the distinc- tion between passive, speculative, and business investors is still important. Implementation fees that are part of the “acquisition price” of the financial arrangement will be allowed as a deduction against income earned from the financial arrangement either: • On the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement for cash basis holders; or from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) • Over the life of the financial arrangement for non-cash basis holders. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price of the financial ar- rangement include: • Contingent fees to the extent that they are provided in relation to the financial arrangement; and • Non-contingent fees to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price, and to the extent they are provided in relation to the financial arrange- ment. Non-contingent fees that are no more than 2% of the core acquisition price are deductible under the normal rules for deducting financial planning fees. In this case, the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is important. Fees incurred in producing non-assessable or exempt income No deduction is available to any type of investor for fees to the extent that the fees are incurred in the production of non-assessable or exempt income. This ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of December 1995. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 95/10 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. The subject matter of this ruling was previously con- tained in TIB Volume Five, No.10 (March 1994) at page 4. This ruling replaces that earlier item. All references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background What are financial planning fees? Financial advisers charge for services provided to their clients. In the ruling, these services are broken down into three components. Financial advisers may use different names for these component services. The tax treatment of the fees depends not on the name of the service, but on the nature of the service. To determine the correct tax treatment of a service, it is important to identify the exact service a financial adviser provides. In the ruling the following terms refer to the range of services discussed below: • Planning • Implementation • Monitoring. 1. Planning Planning occurs when the investor seeks detailed advice from an adviser. This service may be provided when the investor contacts the adviser for the first time. The investor and adviser meet to establish the investor’s investment requirements and ability to meet those requirements. The adviser assesses the investor’s current financial position, which may include assessment of investments, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. For corporate or trustee investors, factors assessed may differ. The adviser then prepares a plan including a range of investment proposals for the investor, and recommends how the investor’s goals can best be met. Planning services may also be provided as part of the financial adviser’s on-going service. Using information received from monitoring an investor’s portfolio, the financial adviser may recommend changes to the investor’s investments. The changes may be made to bring the investor’s portfolio into line with the inves- tor’s goals and risk profile, to take advantage of better or new opportunities, or to take into account a change in the investor’s requirements. Some financial advisers may call a fee for this service a monitoring fee. In this situation this service is better described as a planning fee. Calculation of the fee charged for planning services varies between advisers. Many advisers charge a flat fee, irrespective of the complexity of the plan. Others charge fees based on the complexity of the plan. The fee may be based on the amount of time spent by the adviser, or it may be a percentage of the funds invested. Some advisers only charge planning fees when the investor adopts the plan. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) • A passive investor • A speculative investor • In the business of investing. These types of investor are defined for the purposes of the ruling, and are discussed in more detail below. When is an investor a passive investor? Investors are passive investors when they are not speculative investors, or in the business of investing. Generally, investors are passive investors, as most investors are not in the business of investing and are not speculative investors. When is an investor a speculative investor? A speculative investor is someone who either: • Acquires an investment with the intention of selling it; or • Carries on or carries out an undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Profits derived or losses incurred in those circumstances are assessable under section BB 4 and deductible under section BB 7. Investors are not speculative investors simply because they would like to see their investment capital increase, or that they may sell their investment if the capital increases. Most passive investors fall within that description. An investor may be a speculative investor in relation to one investment, and not in relation to another. An example might be an investor who has a number of financial arrangements and investments in unit trusts, and decides as a single transaction to buy some listed shares with the intention of selling them in the next month or so. Planning and implementation fees related to the unit trusts would not be deductible, but any fees to the extent that they related to the shares would be deductible. (For the deductibility of the fees relating to the financial arrangements, see the discussion under the heading Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees.) When is an investor in business? Section OB 1 defines “business” to include: any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. Whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing is dependent on that taxpayer’s fact situation. The tests and criteria established by cases such as Grieve v CIR (1989) 6 NZTC 61,682 and CIR v Stockwell (1992) 14 NZTC 9,191 are relevant to this question. The leading “business” case in New Zealand is that of Grieve. In that case the Court of Appeal concluded that there are two aspects to the concept of a business: • The nature of the activity; and • The intention with which the taxpayer undertakes the activity. from page 3 2. Implementation Implementation is the service provided when an adviser places investments. Implementation may occur when a financial plan is first implemented, and when invest- ments are later bought and sold. Often financial advisers use another organisation (a “custodian”) to place investments. Advisers pass on the custodian’s implementation charge to the investor, either within their fee, or separately as a disbursement. Sometimes financial advisers charge investors for initial investments, but not for any later changes to the invest- ments. Other financial advisers do not charge separately for later implementation fees, and instead include charges for changes to investments in a global monitor- ing fee. If so, the fee paid for implementation will need to be separately identified for tax purposes. Without separately identifying the implementation fee included in the global fee, it will not be possible to calculate the deductible and non-deductible portions of the global fee. Implementation fees include fees payable to investment fund managers for entry into the investment. Some financial advisers charge a large fee when an investment is first made, which equates to the value of a commission otherwise payable to the financial adviser by the fund manager of the investment. The financial adviser may prefer to recover fees from investors rather than through commission from fund managers to remain impartial. The tax treatment of such a charge depends on what services the financial adviser provides. A financial adviser may provide monitoring services for the fee, or simply charge the amount that would other- wise have been received by way of commission as an initial cost. If no services are provided, and the fee is an initial cost, the fee is for implementation services. 3. Monitoring Monitoring involves the adviser monitoring and evalu- ating the performance of the investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include collecting data on the investor’s investments, and events and research material that have implications for the investor; and reporting to the investor on this data. The financial adviser may also evaluate performance of the investment portfolio (which includes performance of fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the inves- tor’s goals, and relay this information to the investor. Monitoring may include arranging the collection of income from investments and exchanging currency. Monitoring fees are usually charged as a percentage of the investment funds under the adviser’s management. For passive investors, monitoring is typically on an annual or semi-annual basis. For business investors, monitoring may be more regular. Types of investor The income tax treatment of planning, implementation, and monitoring services differs, depending on whether the investor is: 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) This approach was followed in Stockwell. The decision in Stockwell is useful in determining whether an individual is in the business of investing. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal discussed, as obiter dicta, the question of when a taxpayer is in business. The Court observed that the question of whether a taxpayer was in business for tax purposes depended on whether the activities undertaken by the taxpayer were sufficiently continuous and extensive to constitute being a business. That is a question of fact and degree and is dependent upon the taxpayer’s particular fact situation. In Grieve, Richardson J set out some factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business. They were: • The nature of the taxpayer’s activities; and • The period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity; and • The scope of the taxpayer’s operations; and • The volume of transactions undertaken; and • The commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer; and • The pattern of activity; and • The financial results achieved by the activity. These factors were reiterated by the Court of Appeal in Stockwell. The Court commented that the test is objec- tive rather than subjective. Taxpayers’ intentions are, therefore, evidenced by their activities (the extent and continuity), not by their own personal view of their activities. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal also pro- vided some observations or guidelines regarding the extent and continuity of activity required to constitute a business: • The fact that a taxpayer’s activity is sufficient to render his or her returns assessable under section 65(2)(e) (now section BB 4 (c)) does not mean that their activity is a business. • Where the taxpayer’s activity is merely a means of supplementing an already adequate income, the taxpayer is unlikely to be in the business from which that supplementary income is derived. • If the taxpayer is in full-time employment and engages in a spare-time activity, the presumption will be against that spare-time activity being a business. • If the taxpayer is either unemployed or retired and is only engaged in moderate (investment) activity, the presumption is against that activity being a business. Ultimately, whether a person is in the business of investing will be a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing, the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve and Stockwell decisions.

Section BB 7 which is the general deductibility section, states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it - (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year - may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Prohibition on deductibility Section BB 8 qualifies the general deductibility test in section BB 7. Section BB 8 (a) prohibits the deduction of capital. It denies a deduction for: Investment, expenditure, loss, or withdrawal of capital; money used or intended to be used as capital; money used in the improvement of premises occupied; interest which might have been made on any such capital or money if laid out as interest; the acquisition price of any financial arrangement to which the qualified accruals rules apply: Provided that this paragraph shall not deny a deduction in respect of any amount of expenditure deemed to be expendi- ture under the qualified accruals rules. Section BB 8 (c) prohibits a deduction where the expense relates to exempt income. It denies a deduction for: Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in gaining or producing income which is exempt from income tax. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) they examine various tests to decide whether expendi- ture has the features of capital, although they emphasise that tests are merely a guide and the particular facts of each situation will determine the matter. Also, a number of the tests have been developed to analyse the capital/ revenue distinction in the context of a business. The tests that examine business expenditure are not neces- sarily applicable to passive and speculative investors. Nonetheless, the tests serve to distinguish between expenditure connected with the profit-making structure and regular out-goings incurred as part of the normal operation of that structure, so are of some relevance. A passive investor’s financial assets are capital assets of the investor. Any gain or loss of the investor, being the difference between the price the investor paid and the amount received on disposal, is not assessable because it is capital, not income. The assets are capital in nature because they are the investor’s structure from which income is derived. In deciding whether planning fees are capital or income, the question is whether the fees are incurred in relation to the capital assets, or in relation to the income that an investor derives from those assets. The Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209, cited with approval in various judgments of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, followed the ap- proach of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337, who said that there were three matters to consider when determining whether expenditure is capital or income: • The character of the advantage sought • The manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, (and in this and the preceding factor recur- rence may be relevant) • The means adopted to enjoy it. In BP Australia Ltd the Privy Council analysed the character of the advantage sought by the expenditure using a number of tests. The Privy Council considered: • The need or occasion which calls for the expenditure • Whether the payments were paid out of fixed or circulating capital • Whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which are of an enduring benefit • How the sum in question would be treated on ordinary accounting principles • Whether the sums were expended on the structure within which the profits were to be earned or as part of the income-earning process. The approach adopted by the Privy Council was to consider what the expenditure was calculated to effect. The first test mentioned in Sun Newspapers, and examined in BP Australia Ltd, was the character of the advantage sought. In the context of financial planning Assessability Section BB 4 is the general assessability provision. It specifically provides that certain types of income are assessable. Section CE 1 further defines income. The following income types are relevant to this item: • Business profits - section BB 4 (a). • Personal property sales - section BB 4 (c). • Interest, dividends, and annuities - section CE 1 (1)(a). • Benefits from money advanced - section CE 1 (1)(b). • Accruals income - section CE 1 (1)(c). Qualified accruals rules The qualified accruals rules in part EH provide rules for the timing and recognition of income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of financial arrange- ments. The “core acquisition price” needs to be deter- mined at the end of the life of a financial arrangement to determine the amount of income or expenditure arising from the financial arrangement that has not already been returned. The “acquisition price” is defined in section OB 1 to include any consideration provided “in relation to a financial arrangement”. Trading stock Under section EE 1 (8), the value of trading stock at the end of the income year is included in a taxpayer’s assessable income, and under section EE 1 (9), the value of trading stock at the beginning of the year is allowed as a deduction in calculating a taxpayer’s assessable income for that income year. Under section EE 1 (3), the value of trading stock is, at the taxpayer’s option, cost, market value, or replace- ment value. Application of legislation Passive investors - deductibility of fees Planning fees Planning fees are not deductible to passive investors because they are capital expenditure. In some situations, planning fees are not deductible for the further reasons that they are not deductible under the general deduct- ibility section, or because they relate to non-assessable or exempt income. The general deductibility section is section BB 7. Section BB 7 (a) applies to passive investors, specula- tive investors, and business investors if the planning expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing assess- able income. Section BB 7 (b) does not apply to passive investors or speculative investors because it only applies to expendi- ture incurred in carrying on a business. Section BB 7 is subject to section BB 8. Section BB 8 (a) prohibits the deduction of capital expenditure. “Capital” is not defined. The Courts have had to decide whether expenditure is capital in numerous cases. Often from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) fees, the effect the investor wishes to achieve is a plan or strategy for investing his or her financial assets to achieve investment goals. The need or occasion for the expenditure is the investor’s decision to examine his or her financial assets, and to receive advice on whether these assets should be retained or disposed of for new assets. The investor incurs a planning fee for advice on whether assets should be sold, and which new assets or type of assets should be obtained. The advice received relates to the investor’s capital assets. An investor does not receive planning advice directly to increase assessable income. The direct purpose of planning advice is to obtain advice on the best mix of investments to achieve the investor’s investment goals. The result the investor wishes to achieve may be to derive more income from his or her investments, or it may be another result. The investor may wish to reduce or increase the risk of a portfolio, or may wish to change investments to produce tax-paid returns on retirement. He or she may wish to change from intangible assets to property investments. Planning advice relates to the investor’s capital assets, which are the investor’s profit- earning structure, rather than to the profit-making process. Analysis of whether planning advice is capital or income may be similar to analysing whether fees for legal and other professional advice are capital or income. It may not always be possible to point to an enduring asset. As with professional advice, the test is to determine whether the expenditure is incurred in relation to the profit-earning structure, or the profit- making process. In Foley Bros Pty Ltd v FC of T (1965) 13 ATD 562, the full High Court of Australia held that in examining the matter to which legal fees related, “the true contrast is between altering the framework within which income producing activities are for the future to be carried on and taking a step as part of those activities within the framework”. The expenditure is incurred to achieve an enduring advantage. This test of capital is not whether expendi- ture results in a permanent, tangible asset (Kemball v C of T \[1932\] NZLR 1305, John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd v FC of T (1959) 101 CLR 30). The test is whether the expenditure is incurred to obtain an advantage or something of lasting value. The financial adviser provides a plan that becomes the investment framework for the investor. The plan is of continuing benefit to the investor because it forms the investor’s strategy. Using the investor’s goals, the adviser provides an approach to investment that takes into account those goals, and may identify particular investments that will enable those goals to be achieved. Over time, particular investments may no longer serve the purpose of achieving the investor’s goals, and the adviser may recommend new investments. When that happens, the adviser’s new advice also relates to bringing into effect the investment strategy. The time that a plan is of value to an investor will vary. It will be unusual for a plan to be developed each year. Although aspects of the plan may change as the per- formance of a particular investment changes, or if the investor’s goals change, the plan is nonetheless some- thing of lasting value, rather than something that is a regular, recurring expense incurred in deriving invest- ment income. The test that examines whether expenditure relates to fixed or circulating capital is not usually relevant to a passive investor. “Fixed capital” and “circulating capital” are relevant terms to a business that has fixed plant and circulating capital that is turned over while making profits. They may also be terms relevant to a speculative investor who buys and sells assets that are circulated to derive a profit. A passive investor will usually retain investments for a reasonable period, and not turn them over to realise the gain in the investment. Usually, it will not be of much assistance to determine how the expenditure is treated on ordinary accounting principles. A passive investor will often not keep accounts in the way a business will. The other two considerations mentioned in Sun Newspa- pers are the manner in which the benefit obtained by the expense is used, relied upon, or enjoyed, and the method of payment. The benefit will be used as the investor’s on-going investment strategy. The advice forms the basis for investment of the investor’s capital assets. The method of payment is usually a one-off payment when a plan is first prepared. Further payments may also be made for planning advice if the adviser suggests modifications to the investor’s portfolio, or if the investor’s goals change. The method of payment suggests that planning fees are not regular payments for expenses related to the investor’s income. The discussion so far has focused on the prohibition for deduction of capital expenditure in section BB 8 (a). For passive investors, fees for financial plans may also not be deductible because they fail the general deductibility test under section BB 7. The fees may not have the requisite connection with assessable income to satisfy the test for deductibility under section BB 7 (a). When the plan is developed, the investor may not have decided whether to implement the plan. The investor may have received other advice, and see the plan as a possible method of capital asset reorganisation. There may not be a direct link between the plan and deriving assessable income from investments taken out on the advice contained in the plan. If the investor has already put a plan in place, and receives further advice from an adviser to achieve new goals, then the necessary connec- tion with assessable income may be present. However, as discussed above, the fees will not be deductible because they are capital in nature. The link between assessable income and planning fees also will not be present when investments taken out on the advice in a plan are tax-paid investments, e.g., insurance bonds. Fees paid for investments that do not lead to assessable income are not deductible for any investor, even if the investor is in the business of continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure shall be included in the assessable income of the passive investor for the income year. Example 1 Investor A is an investment adviser employed by Bank. He spends most of his day advising investors of their investment opportunities and implementing investments for them. Investor A and his wife have a young family and have recently bought a larger house. The extent of their personal investments is minimal. Besides Investor A’s membership of a superannuation scheme operated by Bank, Investor A and his wife have a few thousand dollars invested as a lump sum in a managed fund. They approached a financial adviser for advice on which fund to invest in. The continuity and extent of Investor A’s invest- ment activities make it unlikely that he is in the business of investing. His employment activities of investment advice do not have any bearing on his personal activities. They must be viewed separately. Investor A is a passive investor; only the monitor- ing fees are deductible. Example 2 Investor B is a retired bank manager. Throughout his professional career he has acquired a number of investments from which he has continued to derive both income and capital growth. Investor B uses the services of a financial adviser in managing his investments. While Investor B takes an interest in the performance of his investments, he leaves the majority of the work to his financial adviser. Investor B only undertakes a minimal amount of buying and selling. Except for some superannuation entitlements, Investor B derives all his income from these investments. Investor B is not in the business of investing. Although the investments represent the majority of his income, his activities lack sufficient extent and continuity to constitute a business of investing. Cooke P in Stockwell considered there would be a presumption against a taxpayer being in the busi- ness of investing where a retired person undertook merely modest investment activity. The fact that the investments represent a taxpayer’s primary source of income does not automatically make the activity the taxpayer’s business. Investor B is a passive investor; only the monitoring fees are deductible. Speculative investors Planning fees, implementation fees, and monitoring fees Speculative investors can deduct planning fees, imple- mentation fees, and monitoring fees under section BB 7 (a). Like investors in the business of investing, investment or is a speculative investor. This point is discussed below under Fees incurred in gaining or producing non-assessable or exempt income. Implementation fees Implementation fees are capital expenditure and not deductible by passive investors. Implementation fees are directly related to changing the structure of the investor’s income earning structure, and are not related to the income earning process. The effect achieved is that the investor obtains a new capital asset. The investment asset obtained as a result of the investor incurring an implementation fee will endure, because a passive investor does not buy and sell financial assets frequently and will hold the asset for a time. Implemen- tation fees are not regular or recurring expenses. In Case U53 87 ATC 351 the taxpayer paid a fee called a service fee that was calculated as a percentage of the value of units the investor bought in a unit trust. (The same unit trust was involved in Case U160 87 ATC 935.) The investment document stated that the service fee was for payment in advance for services to be rendered throughout the life of the fund. There was no description of the nature of the services outlined in the prospectus of the unit trust. The Tribunal in both cases held that the charges on the basis of a percentage of funds invested indicates that if any services were to be rendered, they would not be in the nature of manage- ment services, which were provided for elsewhere in the investment documents. The Tribunal in both cases held that the service fee was in reality part of the cost of the units and was a capital cost. On the basis of Case U53 and Case U160, fees that are an entry cost are non-deductible implementation fees. It will be a question of fact in each case whether fees are paid for monitoring services, or whether the fees are an implementation cost. An exception to the general position that implementa- tion fees are not deductible to passive investors relates to implementation fees that are part of the cost of “financial arrangements”. This exception is discussed under Qualified accruals rules. Monitoring fees Monitoring fees are deductible by passive investors under section BB 7 (a). These fees are paid for the adviser to monitor the performance of the investor’s investments, and to provide administrative services such as collection of income. These are management services that are part of the process of the investor earning assessable income from investments. The services relate more to the returns from the investments than the investments themselves. Monitoring fees are often regular, on-going expenses. The investor does not receive an enduring advantage as a result of monitoring. To the extent that monitoring fees are “accrual expendi- ture”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is assessable income or a deductible loss to speculative investors. Their investments are trading assets not capital assets. Therefore, fees incurred in relation to speculators’ investments are not incurred in relation to their capital structure. The timing of deductions for implementation fees for speculative investors is subject to the qualified accruals rules (discussed below). To the extent that fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure shall be included in the assessable income of the speculative investor for the income year. Investors in the business of investing - deductibility of fees Planning fees, implementation fees, and monitoring fees Investors in the business of investing can deduct planning fees, implementation fees, and monitoring fees under section BB 7 (a) or section BB 7 (b). If an investor is in the business of investing, any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is assessable income or a deductible loss. The investments are trading assets and not capital assets of the investor. Therefore, fees do not fail the test of deductibility for the reason that they relate to the investor’s capital profit- making structure. To the extent that fees are “accrual expenditure”, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Thus the unexpired portion of any such expenditure shall be included in the assessable income of the business investor for the income year. Planning fees For business investors planning fees are deductible under section BB 7 (a) or (b) as they have the necessary connection with assessable income. Implementation fees The timing of deductions for implementation fees for business investors is subject to either the qualified accruals rules (discussed below), or the trading stock provisions. If the accruals rules apply, they take prec- edence over the rules applying to trading stock. Implementation fees that are part of the cost of an investment, such as the services in Case U53 discussed under Passive investors- implementation fees, form part of the cost of the investment for trading stock purposes. Unless the accruals rules take precedence, these imple- mentation fees are deductible when incurred pursuant to section BB 7 (b). If the relevant investment is still on hand at year end and the taxpayer, when complying with section EE 1 (3), elects to value at cost price, the implementation fees form part of that cost. Effectively, then the implementation fees are included in assessable income at the end of the year. Example 3 Investor C is an accountant, employed part-time by a major corporate. Three years ago Investor C inherited a substantial sum of money, which she has put into a wide range of investments. She actively participates in managing her investments. She uses her tax knowledge and accounting expertise to analyse her investments’ performances on a regular basis. She engages the service of a financial adviser so that she can obtain independent, objective, third party advice (and to implement her investment strategies). Although Investor C derives a significant income from her employment as an accountant, the extent and continuity of her investment activities (and her active participation) should be sufficient for Inves- tor C to be considered to be in the business of investing. Investor C is a business investor and all fees are deductible. Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees Some investments are subject to the qualified accruals rules. The qualified accruals rules take precedence over any other rules in the Income Tax Act. The qualified accruals rules have specific provisions for the treatment of implementation fees. These provisions apply to all investors: passive, speculative, and business investors. The accruals rules apply to financial arrangements. “Financial arrangement” is a defined term in the Income Tax Act. Broadly, it includes debt instruments, and does not include shares or interests in unit trusts. Contingent implementation fees Where implementation fees are contingent on the financial arrangement being implemented, the fees are part of the “acquisition price” of the financial arrange- ment and as such are subject to the accruals rules. The “acquisition price” is defined to include “the value of all consideration provided by \[the investor\] in relation to the financial arrangement”. Implementation fees paid to financial advisers or other organisations for their services in implementing financial arrangements are provided “in relation to the financial arrangement”. See TIB Volume 3, No. 4 (December 1991) at pages 5 and 6. Category 1: cash basis holders A cash basis holder is a natural person for whom either the total value of all financial arrangements held by that person will not exceed $600,000, or the income derived in the year by the person from financial arrangements will not exceed $70,000. A further requirement is that the difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules, and the income returned as a cash basis holder, does not exceed $20,000. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) • If the non-contingent fees are no more than two percent (2%) of the “core acquisition price”, they are excluded from the accruals rules calculations, and their deductibility is tested under normal income tax rules. • If the non-contingent fees are greater than two percent (2%) of the “core acquisition price”, they are included within the accruals rules calculations to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price. The remaining amount of fees (that is equal to 2% of the core acquisition price) is deductible or otherwise under normal income tax rules. Thus for non-contingent fees amounting to 2% or less of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, the distinction between passive, business, and specula- tive investors is important as the normal income tax rules of deductibility are again important. For non-contingent fees, to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial ar- rangement, the discussion above relating to contingent fees is relevant. Example 4 Investor D is a cash basis holder who has invested in a number of financial arrangements on the advice of her financial adviser. Investor D is a passive investor. She paid a fee of 2% of the cost of the financial arrangements as a commission to her adviser. The fee was contingent on the financial arrangements being purchased. Investor D may not initially deduct the fee. The fee is a contingent fee, and included in the “acquisition price” of the financial arrangement as a direct cost of the investment. As a contingent fee, it is not deductible until a cash base price adjustment is made on the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement. At that time it will be allowed as an amount provided by the investor, to be offset against amounts received. If the fee charged was a non-contingent fee, then, to the extent that it was no more than 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, it would be excluded from the accruals rules and tested according to normal principles. As such it would be non-deductible as Investor D is a passive investor. Fees incurred in gaining or producing non-assessable or exempt income Returns from investments are not assessable to the investor if the investment is taxed before receiving payment from the investment. An example is insurance bonds. Tax is paid on income earned on an insurance bond by the insurance bond fund. The other situation when returns from investments are not assessable to the investor is where the return is exempt income. Exempt income is provided for in An investor who is a cash basis holder returns income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements as and when the income is derived and expenditure incurred. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price, however, cannot be taken as a deduc- tion in the year they are incurred. Instead, when the investment matures, is remitted, or is sold the investor will get credit for the fees when he or she performs a “cash base price adjustment”. The cash base price adjustment compares all amounts received by the investor in respect of the investment, with all amounts provided by the investor in relation to the investment. The amounts provided by the investor are the “acquisition price”. This calculation will usually mean a comparison of the amount returned at the end of the investment and interest received, with the amounts provided and any direct costs of the investment. If the cash base price adjustment results in a positive amount, the amount is income to the investor. If the cash base price adjustment results in a negative amount, the amount is an allowable deduction. Because implementation fees are part of the acquisition price, they can be offset against income received from the financial arrangement. This has the effect of allow- ing a deduction for the fees on the maturity, remission, or sale of a financial arrangement. Accordingly, if an investor is a “cash basis holder”, he or she may deduct implementation fees, irrespective of whether the investor is a passive investor, in the busi- ness of investing, or a speculative investor. Category 2: non-cash basis holders Where an investor is not a cash basis holder, he or she must return income and expenditure according to the rules set out in section EH 1. Section EH 1 (1) requires that for the purposes of calculating income and expendi- ture under sections EH 1 (2) to (6), regard must be had to the amount of consideration provided by the person. The accruals rules spread the difference between amounts received by the person and amounts provided by the person over the life of the financial arrangement. Where implementation fees are part of the acquisition price of the arrangement, they will be one of the amounts provided by the person that is spread over the life of the arrangement. It is not technically accurate to say that the investor gets a deduction for implementation fees, spread over the life of the financial arrangement. Instead, allowing for implementation fees means the investor returns less income over the life of the financial arrangement. This has the same effect as a deduction spread over the life of the financial arrangement. Non-contingent implementation fees It is most likely that implementation fees will be contingent on the implementation of a financial plan. However, where implementation fees are not contingent on the implementation of the plan they are covered by specific rules: from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) sections CB 1 - CB 15. It will be unusual for investors to derive exempt income from investments. No deduction is available to the extent to which fees are incurred in the production of non-assessable or exempt income. Section BB 7 only allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in the production of assessable income, or for expenditure necessarily incurred in the carrying on of a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Also, section BB 8 (c) denies a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining exempt income. Therefore, where expenditure on financial planning fees produces non-assessable or exempt income, the fees cannot be deducted. Example 5 As part of her retirement savings, Investor E makes monthly contributions to a fund manager. The contributions are invested in two funds. One is a tax paid growth fund, that is, no profits or gains are paid to investors. Instead, gains are retained and accumulated until the investor reaches a given age. The other fund returns tax paid receipts to the investor. That is, the fund pays tax on the accumu- lated income. Investor E receives no assessable income from her investment. Section BB 8 (c) prohibits the deduc- tion of expenditure or loss incurred in producing exempt income. Therefore, none of the fees incurred are deductible.

Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections 3 and 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to supplies of financial planning services by registered per- sons. “Financial planning services” means planning services, implementation services, and monitoring services for the purposes of this ruling. “Planning”, “implementation”, and “monitoring” services have the following meaning for the purpose of this ruling. Planning services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser plans an investor’s portfolio of investments. Planning services are often pro- vided at the outset of the portfolio’s establishment, but can also be provided as part of the adviser’s ongoing service. Implementation services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser implements an investor’s financial plan. Implementation services also includes the services provided when a custodian implements the plan, and an adviser charges the investor a fee. However, if an adviser’s fee in such a situa- tion relates to monitoring services, the services are not implementation services. Monitoring services are the services provided by an adviser when the adviser monitors and evaluates the performance of an investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include the collection of income from investments, and the exchanging of foreign currency. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background What are financial planning fees? Financial advisers charge their clients for services provided to those clients. In the ruling we have broken down these services into three components. Financial advisers may use different names for these component services. The tax treatment of the fees does not depend on the name of the service, but on the nature of the service. To determine the correct tax treatment of a service, it is important to identify the exact service a financial adviser provides. In the ruling and analysis we use the following terms to refer to the range of services discussed below: •Planning •Implementation •Monitoring. 1. Planning Planning occurs when the investor seeks detailed advice from the adviser. This service may be provided when the investor contacts the adviser for the first time. The investor and adviser meet to establish the investor’s investment requirements and the investor’s ability to meet those requirements. The adviser assesses the investor’s current financial position, which may include assessment of investments, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. For corporate or trustee investors, factors assessed may differ. The adviser then prepares a plan including a range of investment proposals for the investor, and recommends how the investor’s goals can best be met. Planning services may also be provided as part of the financial adviser’s on-going service. Using information The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to those supplies of financial planning services with a time of supply between period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1999. The ruling Planning services Planning services supplied in relation to investments are subject to GST. These services are not “financial services” under section 3(1) and 14(a). Because these services are the provision of advice, they are specifically excluded from the definition of “financial services” by section 3(1)(l). Monitoring services Monitoring services supplied in relation to investments are subject to GST. These services are not “financial services” under section 3(1) and 14(a). Because these services involve advice, they are specifically excluded from the definition of “financial services” by section 3(1)(l). However, to the extent that a monitoring service involves the collection of income from investments within section 3(1)(ka), or the exchange of currency within section 3(1)(a), the service is an exempt supply of a financial service under sections 3(1) and 14(a). Implementation services Implementation services are financial services under section 3(1) and are exempt supplies of financial services under section 14(a). When a custodian implements the plan on the instruction of a financial adviser, any implementation fee charged by the adviser will be exempt under section 3(1)(l) as the arranging of one of the activities in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). This ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of December 1995. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 95/11 from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) received from monitoring an investor’s portfolio, the financial adviser may recommend changes to the client’s investments. The changes may be made to bring the investor’s portfolio into line with the client’s goals and risk profile, to take advantage of better or new opportunities, or to take into account a change in the investor’s requirements. Some financial advisers may call a fee for this service a monitoring fee. However, in this situation this service is better described as a plan- ning fee. Calculation of the fee charged for planning services varies between advisers. Many advisers charge a flat fee, irrespective of the complexity of the plan. Others charge fees based on the complexity of the plan. The fee may be based on the amount of time spent by the adviser, or it may be a percentage of the funds invested. Some advisers only charge planning fees when the investor adopts the plan. 2. Implementation Implementation is the service provided when an adviser places investments. Implementation may occur when a financial plan is first implemented, and when invest- ments are later bought and sold. Often financial advisers use another organisation (a “custodian”) to place investments. Advisers will pass on the custodian’s implementation charge to the investor, either within their fee, or separately as a disbursement. Sometimes financial advisers charge investors for initial investments, but not for any later changes to the invest- ments. Other financial advisers do not charge separately for later implementation fees, and instead include charges for changes to investments in a global monitor- ing fee. A fee is paid for implementation even if it is included in a global fee, and will need to be separately identified for GST purposes. Implementation fees include fees payable to investment fund managers for entry into the investment. Some financial advisers charge a large fee when an investment is first made, which equates to the value of a commission otherwise payable to the financial adviser by the fund manager of the investment. The financial adviser may prefer to recover fees from clients rather than through commission from fund managers to remain impartial. The GST treatment of such a charge depends on what services the financial adviser provides. A financial adviser may provide monitoring services for the fee, or may provide implementation services and simply charge the amount he or she would otherwise have received by way of commission as an initial cost. 3. Monitoring Monitoring involves the adviser monitoring and evalu- ating the performance of the investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include collecting data on the client’s investments, events, and research material that have implications for the investor, and reporting to the investor on this data. The financial adviser may also evaluate performance of the investment portfolio (which includes performance of fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the inves- tor’s goals, and relay this information to the investor. Monitoring may include arranging the collection of income from investments and exchanging currency. Monitoring fees are usually charged as a percentage of the investment funds under the adviser’s management. For passive investors, monitoring is typically on an annual or semi-annual basis. For business investors, monitoring may be more regular. Legislation GST is imposed on the supply of goods and services in New Zealand (not being an exempt supply) by a regis- tered person in the course of furtherance of a taxable activity, by section 8. Section 14 provides some specific exemptions from GST, including supplies of financial services. Section 3(1) defines the term “financial services” to include: (a)The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): ... (c)The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d) The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: ... (ka)The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l)Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. GST implications of financial planning services The GST implications of the services provided by financial advisers are as follows. 1. Planning Planning services are subject to GST. They do not constitute financial services under section 3(1) as these services do not involve the adviser making any invest- ments on the taxpayer’s behalf within section 3(1)(c) or (d). The service merely involves the adviser in advising the taxpayer on a range of investment opportunities and is, therefore, specifically excluded from the definition of a financial service in section 3(1)(l). 2. Implementation Implementation services are exempt from GST. The services are provided in relation to the placement of continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Examples These examples do not form part of the ruling. Example 1 Financial Adviser prepares a plan for Investor. Financial Adviser charges Investor $2,000 for the plan. Investor decides to implement the plan and asks Financial Adviser to arrange with Custodian to implement the plan. Financial Adviser asks, on Investor’s behalf and as Investor’s agent, for Custodian to implement the plan. Custodian’s fee is charged to Investor by an invoice sent to Financial Adviser. Financial Adviser passes the invoice on to Investor. Custodian’s fee is $1,500, which is in addition to the $2,000 charged by Financial Ad- viser. The $2,000 Financial Adviser charges Investor is for a taxable supply of planning services. The advice falls within the advising exclusion in paragraph (l) of the definition of “financial serv- ices”. Financial Adviser must account for GST output tax on the supply. There are no GST implications for Financial Adviser for passing on Custodian’s invoice to Investor, because Financial Adviser is simply the agent of Investor. Custodian’s services are exempt supplies of implementation services and no GST output tax needs to be returned by Custodian. Example 2 Six months after implementing the plan, Financial Adviser passes on to Investor dividend income collected on Investor’s behalf. Financial Adviser also conducts a review of the investment portfolio. Financial Adviser charges a small commission of $50 for collecting the dividend income and $250 for the review. Both sums are invoiced as monitoring services. The $50 charge for collecting dividends is consid- eration for an exempt supply under section 3(1)(ka). Financial Adviser does not need to return GST on the amount. The $250 for the plan review is a monitoring service and as such is subject to GST. Financial Adviser must return GST output tax on this amount. investments, which are separate and distinct from monitoring services. The implementation services constitute financial services in terms of section 3(1)(c), (d), and/or (l) and are, therefore, exempt supplies. In situations where a custodian implements the plan on the instruction of the financial adviser, the fees charged by the adviser to the investor are for an exempt supply of arranging financial services under section 3(1)(l). If the adviser uses a custodian to place investments and passes on any charges received to the investor as a disbursement, there will be no GST consequences for the adviser if the adviser is acting as the investor’s agent. For more discussion on the GST consequences of disbursements refer to Disbursements by professional firms on behalf of clients - GST on page 5 of TIB Volume Six, No. 1 (July 1994). As discussed above under “Background”, a financial adviser may charge a large fee when an investment is first implemented. This fee may equate to the value of a commission otherwise payable to the financial adviser by the fund manager of the investment. This fee was described as an implementation fee. The label given to such a supply is not necessarily determinative of the nature of the supply. It is a question of fact what services are provided for the fee, and the services provided will determine the GST treatment. Where an implementation fee is included as part of an overall supply of monitoring services, the implementa- tion fee is a separate supply which is exempt from GST. 3. Monitoring Monitoring services are subject to GST, except to the extent discussed below. They do not constitute a finan- cial service under section 3(1). This service involves the adviser evaluating data relating to the investments, evaluating the performance of those investments, and advising the client of the performance. This advice is specifically excluded from the financial services defini- tion by section 3(1)(l). However, to the extent that the monitoring service involves the collection of income from investments, or the exchanging of currency, or the arranging of the same, the service is an exempt supply under section 3(1)(a), (ka), and/or (l). Therefore, the fee will be partly exempt and partly taxable. Section 10(18) requires an apportionment of the fee between taxable and exempt supplies: CIR v Smiths City Group Limited (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) GST: importers and input tax deductions Public Ruling - BR Pub 95/9 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section 20 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when registered persons seek to claim input tax deductions for GST levied by New Zealand Customs on goods they have imported into New Zealand for the purposes of making taxable supplies. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to claims for input tax deductions for GST levied by New Zealand Customs on goods imported into New Zealand between 1 February 1996 and 31 January 1999. The ruling A registered person may use either a Customs Import Entry Form or a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement to support a claim for a GST input tax deduction under section 20 for GST levied by New Zealand Customs on goods imported into New Zealand. This ruling is signed by me on the thirteenth day of December 1995. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 95/9 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. The subject matter of this ruling was previously consid- ered at page 7 of TIB Volume 4, No.1 (August 1992) in an item GST and Non-Resident Importers. This ruling replaces the part of that item titled Documentation Required by an Importer to Support an Input Tax Deduction, pp. 8-9. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background The Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Holding Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,163 considered when a registered person could claim an input tax deduction on receiving both an Import Entry Form and a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement. It concluded that an Import Entry Form was an “invoice” for the purposes of the GST Act and that a person may use that document to support a claim for an input tax deduction, even when the person had also received a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement. Legislation Section 2 “Invoice” means: ... a document notifying an obligation to make payment. “Input tax” in relation to a registered person means: ... (b) Tax levied under section 12(1) or section 13(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs Act 1966 by that person: Section 12 (1) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a tax to be known as good and services tax shall be levied, collected, and paid in accordance with the provisions of this section at the rate of 12.5 percent on the importation of goods (not being fine metal) into New Zealand, being goods that are - (a)Entered therein, or delivered, for home consumption on or after the 1st day of October 1986 under the Customs Act 1966; or (aa)Entered for delivery to a manufacturing area under the Customs Act 1966; or continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) The New Zealand Customs Department also operates an optional deferred payment scheme for importers, under which it issues a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement for the duty owed by importers on all the goods they have imported during that month. The Deferred Pay- ment of Duty Statement is created from the information contained in the Customs Import Entry Forms. The Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Holding Co Ltd v CIR considered the issue of when an importer could claim an input tax deduction for the GST levied on goods imported into New Zealand. It concluded that the Customs Import Entry Form notified the importer of an obligation to make payment, as it stated the total duty, total GST, and total payable. Therefore, the Customs Import Entry Form fell within the GST definition of “invoice”. The Shell decision confirms that an importer may use a Customs Import Entry Form to support a claim for a GST input tax deduction. Example This example does not form part of the ruling. Mary imports and sells European cars. She is registered for GST, accounts for tax payable on an invoice basis, and files GST returns on a two- monthly basis. Mary imports cars worth $300,000 on 28 September. She completes an Import Entry Form listing the cars she has imported and their values. The Import Entry Form also states the total duty, total GST, and total amount payable on the importation of those cars. The New Zealand Cus- toms Department signs and stamps the Import Entry Form on 28 September. Mary receives a Deferred Payment Statement on 23 November. This statement lists all the goods she has imported for the period 23 September to 23 November, and states the total amount of duty and GST that she has to pay. Mary’s taxable period ends on the last day of September. She is required to furnish her GST return for the months of August and September, stating the amount of tax she has to pay for those two months. Mary will include in her GST return for that taxable period the GST levied on the imported cars. Mary only needs an invoice to substantiate her claim for an input tax deduction for the GST that New Zealand Customs has levied on the imported cars. Mary may claim the input deduction in the taxable period ending in September because the Import Entry Form contains all the necessary details to be an invoice for the purposes of the GST Act. (b) Before their entry, or delivery, for home consumption or, as the case may be, entry for delivery to a manufacturing area under the Customs Act 1966, dealt with on or after the 1st day of October 1986 in breach of any provision of any of the Customs Acts, - by reference to the value of the goods as determined under subsection (2) of this section. ... (3) Subject to this section, tax levied under subsection (1) of this section shall be collected and paid as if it were Customs duty levied on the importation of goods under the Customs Act 1966, and as if all goods imported into New Zealand were liable to Customs duty. Section 20(3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period - (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - ... (ii)Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 or section 13 of this Act during that taxable period. Provided that where any registered person is entitled, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, to deduct any amount in respect of any taxable period from the amount of output tax attributable to that taxable period, the registered person may deduct that amount from the amount of output tax attributable to any later taxable period to the extent that it has not previously been deducted from the output tax of that registered person. Application of legislation The Act permits importers to claim an input tax deduc- tion for the GST levied by the New Zealand Customs Department on goods imported into New Zealand. Unlike other claims for input tax deductions, the Act only requires the importers to hold invoices to support their claims rather than tax invoices. This is because the New Zealand Customs Department does not make any supplies when it is levying GST on goods imported into New Zealand. It is, therefore, not required to issue tax invoices under section 24. The question then arises as to which documents (the Deferred Payment of Duty Statement or the Customs Import Entry Form) issued by the New Zealand Customs Department are “invoices” for the purposes of the GST Act. The New Zealand Customs Department issues a Cus- toms Import Entry Form at the time that the goods are imported into New Zealand. This document names the importer, describes the goods imported, and quantifies the amount of duty and GST due. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) GST and supplies paid for in foreign currency Public Ruling - BR Pub 95/12 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (definition of “money”), 3(1) (defi- nition of “financial services”), 10(2), 14(a), and 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a registered person accepts payment for a taxable supply of goods or services in a foreign currency, where that supply is made in New Zealand. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to taxable supplies of goods and services where payment is made in foreign currency, where the time of supply occurs within the period from 1 March 1996 to 28 February 1999. The ruling When the consideration for a taxable supply of goods and services is paid in foreign currency, the value of the taxable supply is the amount of foreign cur- rency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. The Commissioner will accept as the appropriate exchange rate the rate offered by registered banks or bureaux de change. This ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of December 1995. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 95/12 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Background A number of registered persons, particularly those involved in tourism, accept foreign currency as payment for supplies of goods and services. Often a registered person will offer the customer an “in-house” exchange rate. This exchange rate is less favourable to the cus- tomer than other exchange rates. That is, the customer gets less New Zealand currency for the foreign currency than that obtainable at a bank or a bureau de change. The registered supplier will exchange the foreign currency at a bank and receive New Zealand currency. Because the bank exchange rate is better than the exchange rate the registered person gave the customer, the registered person will make a profit on the conver- sion of the foreign currency. The Commissioner has been asked to consider the GST treatment of such a profit. In particular, the Commissioner has been asked whether the profit is consideration for an exempt supply, or whether the profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply. Legislation Section 2(1) defines “money”: “Money” includes- (a) Bank notes and other currency, being any negotiable instruments used or circulated, or intended for use or circulation, as currency; and (b) Postal notes and money orders; and (c) Promissory notes and bills of exchange,- whether of New Zealand or any other country, but does not include a collector’s piece, investment article, or item of numismatic interest. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Value of supply When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer, the value of supply is determined using the rules in section 10. Under section 10(2)(a), when consideration for the supply is an amount of money, the value of supply is the amount of money. “Money” is defined in section 2(1) and includes foreign currency. Therefore, when a customer tenders foreign currency as consideration for a supply, the value of supply is the amount of foreign currency. However, section 77 requires all amounts of money tendered in consideration of a supply to be “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply”. “Expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” There are three possible interpretations of the phrase “all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency”. It could mean that: • The parties must state their transaction, or document it, in New Zealand currency and the supplier return that amount for GST purposes; or • The supplier must convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the current market exchange rate and return that amount for GST purposes; or • The supplier may convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the rate agreed between the parties and return that amount for GST purposes. The first interpretation does not require any type of conversion, whereas the second and third do. The Income Tax Act 1994 uses the phrase (or variants) at least twice. Section CF 2 (12)(a)(i) states: For the purposes of subsection (11), in respect of determining whether and the extent to which the making available of any property (being a loan) by any person (in this subsection referred to as the “company’’) to any person (in this subsec- tion referred to as the “shareholder’’) gives rise to a dividend- (a) In relation to any quarter the rate of interest specified shall be- (i) In the case of any loan where all amounts payable to the company in relation to the loan are ex- pressed in New Zealand currency and- \[Empha- sis added.\] This provision does not assist in interpreting section 77 as the reference is clearly to a factual state of affairs, namely whether or not a loan is in New Zealand currency or not. Section KF 2 (5) (definition of “effective rate of domes- tic income tax”) states: “Effective rate of domestic income tax”, in relation to a company that is not resident in New Zealand and to an accounting year of that company, means the rate ascertained in accordance with the following formula: a b where- ais the total income tax (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange in force on the last day of that accounting year) payable by that company Section 3(1) defines “financial services”. Under para- graph (a): For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a) The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise)... Section 14(a) exempts supplies of financial services from GST. Section 10 is the section providing for the value of supply. Section 10(2) states: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,- (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: Section 77 states: For the purposes of this Act, all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency, and in any case where and to the extent that such amount is consideration in money for a supply, that amount shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply. Application of legislation Number of supplies When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer who pays in foreign currency, there is only one supply. That supply is the supply of goods and services. There has been some confusion over the classification of supplies in these circumstances, and a suggestion that there are two supplies. The first supply being a supply of goods and services and the second supply being an exempt supply of the exchange of currency (under section 3(1)(a) and section 14(a)). It will be a question of fact in each case whether there are one or two supplies. In the ordinary commercial situa- tion there will be no reconstruction of the transaction to recharacterise two supplies as one or vice versa, nor is it appropriate to apply principles of economic equivalence to achieve similar results between one supply and two supply situations. When a registered person accepts foreign currency in payment for supplies, there is no exempt supply of the exchange of currency. To be an exchange of currency under section 3(1)(a) one currency must be exchanged for another. Section 3(1)(a) does not cover the situation when currency is exchanged for goods and services. The fact that the registered person will later exchange the currency with a bank or bureau de change does not alter this. The transaction between the registered person and the bank or bureau de change involves an exempt supply of the exchange of currency by the bank or bureau de change to the registered person. There is no such exempt supply from the registered person to the cus- tomer. In situations where there is only one supply, a supply of goods and services, the value of supply is important, particularly since the registered person usually makes a profit from the low exchange rate. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) in the country or territory in which it is resident, in respect of the total income derived by it in that accounting year, being the total income upon which the total income tax is levied; and bis that total income (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange in force on the last day of that accounting year): \[Emphasis added.\] This definition is an equivalent use of the phrase in section 77, and supports the interpretation that the phrase requires some type of conversion. Accordingly, there is support for the second and third interpretations, but not the first. The words in section 77 are exactly equivalent to those in section 20(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assess- ment Act 1936. Section 20(1) has been accepted as embodying the decision of the Privy Council in Payne v Deputy FCT \[1936\] 2 All ER 793 (see, for example, Dixon J in Adelaide Electric Supply Co Ltd v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 557). In the Payne decision, Lord Russell said at page 796 of the judgment: ...the assessable income of the taxpayer must, whatever be the currency in which he derives it, all be expressed in terms of Australian currency; in other words if any portion of his assessable income is derived by him in French or Belgian currency, it must before he can be properly assessed to Australian income tax be converted into its equivalent, at the time it was derived, in Australian currency. In exactly the same way, any income derived by him in British currency must be converted into its equivalent in Australian currency. In short when an Australian statute tells the taxpayer to state his derived income in order that a fraction thereof (i.e., so many pence in the pound of derived income) may be taken as tax, this can only mean that his derived income is to be stated and dealt with in terms of Australian currency. From this it would accordingly follow that the commissioner was right in including the amount of £1,097 in the appellant’s assessment. \[Emphasis added.\] Lord Russell was using the words subsequently adopted in section 20(1) in the sense described above in the second interpretation. Accordingly, the second interpre- tation of the phrase in section 77 is to be preferred to the first and third interpretations. That is, the phrase “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” in section 77 requires the amount of foreign currency tendered as consideration for a supply to be converted into an amount of New Zealand currency at the ex- change rate applying at the time of supply. The Com- missioner will accept the exchange rates offered by a registered bank or a bureau de change. The Commissioner will accept the bank exchange rates of ASB Bank, ANZ/Postbank, BNZ, Countrywide, National Bank, Trustbank, or Westpac. The Commis- sioner will accept the bureau de change exchange rates of Thomas Cook or American Express. The value of supply is not the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration exchanged at the registered person’s low exchange rate. Instead, it is the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration converted at the exchange rate determined by the registered banks and bureaux de change operating in the foreign ex- change markets. Examples These examples do not form part of the ruling. Example 1 Hotel Guest wishes to exchange some foreign currency for New Zealand currency. Hotel offers him a low exchange rate which he accepts. Hotel exchanges the foreign currency at a bank and makes a small profit. The profit is consideration for an exempt supply, being the exempt supply of an exchange of cur- rency. Hotel has exchanged New Zealand currency for foreign currency. The consideration for the supply is the difference between the exchange rate Hotel receives from the bank, and the exchange rate Hotel gave Hotel Guest. For example: ApprovedNZ$1 = Foreign$3 or exchange rate:Foreign$1 = NZ$0.33 HotelNZ$1=Foreign$4 or exchange rate:Foreign$1=NZ$0.25 Hotel Guest exchanges Foreign$300 at Hotel exchange rate, and receives NZ$75. Hotel ex- changes the Foreign$300 at the bank for the approved exchange rate and receives NZ$100. The NZ$25 profit is consideration for an exempt supply and is not subject to GST. Example 2 Hotel Guest checks out of Hotel and settles his bill using Foreign currency. Again Hotel offers him a low exchange rate which he accepts. Hotel ex- changes the money at a bank and makes a small profit. The profit on the currency exchange at the bank is part of the consideration for the taxable supply of goods and services by Hotel to Hotel Guest. The value of supply is the amount of foreign currency tendered in consideration for the supply. As the amount of money is foreign currency, it needs to be expressed in amounts of New Zealand currency. That change to New Zealand currency should take place at the approved exchange rate. That means the profit on the currency exchange is part of the consideration for the taxable supply Hotel makes. For example: Exchange rates as above. Bill of NZ$1,000. Hotel Guest tenders Foreign$4,000 to pay the bill. Hotel accepts the Foreign$4,000 in full payment of the bill, at Hotel’s exchange rate. Hotel then exchanges the Foreign$4,000 at the bank for the approved exchange rate and receives NZ$1,333, making a profit of $333 on the currency. This profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply and is subject to GST. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. FBT - prescribed interest rate remains at 10.6% The prescribed interest rate used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment- related loans remains at 10.6% for the quarter that started on 1 October 1995. This rate will also apply to subsequent quarters until any further adjustment is made.

Student Loan scheme - interest rates and repayment threshold for 1996-97 On 6 December 1995 the Minister of Education announced the interest rates and the repayment threshold for the Student Loan scheme for the year starting on 1 April 1996. The total interest rate will be 8.4 percent. This is made up of the base interest rate of 6.2 percent and the interest adjustment rate of 2.2 percent. The repayment threshold for the 1996-97 income year will be $14,300 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Policy statements This section of the TIB contains policy statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. Reopening income tax assessments Summary This item discusses section MD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the reopening of income tax assessments. Some taxpayers have suggested that the Commissioner can use section MD 1 to reopen income tax assessments. This is not correct. Section 113 of the Tax Administra- tion Act 1994 is the correct provision under which the Commissioner may reopen an income tax assessment. Section MD 1 is merely an administrative provision which provides for the payment of refunds, and which imposes an eight-year time limit for income tax refunds following the reopening of an assessment. All legislative references in this item are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 MD 1409 Tax AdministrationIncome Tax Act 1976 Act 1994 10825 11323 Section MD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides for refunds of overpaid tax. Under the proviso to section MD 1 (1), in most cases payment of a refund must be made within eight years after the end of the year in which the assessment was made, unless written applica- tion for the refund is made by or on behalf of the taxpayer before the expiration of the eight-year period. Section MD 1 (1) states: Subject to sections MD 2, MD 3, and NH 4, in any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that tax has been paid in excess of the amount properly payable, the Commissioner shall refund the amount paid in excess: Provided that, subject to subsection (2), no refund shall be made under this section after the expiration of the period of 8 years immediately after the end of the year in which the assessment was made or, in any case where the original assessment has been altered (whether once or more than once), after the end of the year in which the original assess- ment was made, unless written application for the refund is made by or on behalf of the taxpayer before the expiration of that period. Section MD 1 (2) deals with the situation when exces- sive tax has been paid as the result of the alteration of an assessment. The Commissioner may alter assessments to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid. Section 113 states that: (1) The Commissioner may from time to time and at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid. (2) If any such alteration or addition has the effect of impos- ing any fresh liability or increasing any existing liability, notice of it shall be given by the Commissioner to the taxpayer affected. The Commissioner’s power to amend assessments is limited by section 108 which states that: (1) When any person has made returns and has been assessed for income tax for any year, it shall not be lawful for the Commissioner to alter the assessment so as to increase its amount after the expiration of 4 years from the end of the year in which the notice of original assessment was issued. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), in any case where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the returns so made are fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omit all mention of income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and in respect of which a return is required to be made, it shall be lawful for the Commis- sioner to alter the assessment (being an assessment made on or after 1 April 1958) at any time so as to increase the amount of the assessment. Application of legislation Assessments may be reopened under section 113. Section 108 limits this power so that assessments cannot be increased after four years from the end of the year in which the Commissioner issued the notice of original assessment. However, if the returns were fraudulent, wilfully misleading, or omitted all mention of income of a particular nature or from a particular source, the Commissioner can alter the assessments at any time. Section MD 1 of the Income Tax Act relates to the refund of overpaid tax. It does not provide a means of reopening an assessment. However, if the Commissioner alters an assessment under section 113, the Commis- sioner would pay any refund pursuant to section MD 1. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Introduction This item sets out the penalties an employer can be liable for under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), for failing to make or failing to account for PAYE and earner premium deductions. All legislative references in this item are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background Section NC 2 (1) of the ITA requires employers to make tax deductions from source deduction payments that they make to employees. Employers are also required under section 115 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 (ARCI Act) to collect earner premiums on behalf of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation, by deducting earner premiums from any source deduction payment made to an em- ployee. Earner premiums have been incorporated into the PAYE deduction tables and are deducted along with the tax deduction required to be made under the PAYE rules. The TAA draws a distinction between: • an employer failing to make combined tax and earner premium deductions; and • an employer failing to account for combined tax and earner premium deductions. Failing to deduct tax and earner premium This occurs when an employer pays the gross amount of salary or wages to an employee without making the proper combined tax and earner premium deduction. An employer can fail to deduct either all or part of the required deduction. Examples of failure to deduct are: • making no deductions at all • making a partial deduction • using the wrong tax rate. Failing to account for tax and earner premium deductions This occurs when an employer pays the net amount of the source deduction payment to an employee, but fails to pay the combined tax and earner premium deduction to Inland Revenue by the due dates prescribed in section NC 15 of the ITA. Examples of failure to account are: • tax and earner premium deduction payment not received by Inland Revenue • tax and earner premium deduction received by Inland Revenue late • tax and earner premium deduction received on time but cheque dishonoured. If the due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, no penalty is levied if payment is made on the next busi- ness day.

Section OB 1 of the ITA defines a “combined tax and earner premium deduction” for any source deduction payment, as the total of: (a) The tax deduction required to be made under the PAYE rules from the source deduction payment; and (b) The deduction required to be made from that source deduction payment under section 115 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 on account of the earner’s premium payable by employees under that Act. An employer who fails to make combined tax and earner premium deductions is liable for a 10% late payment penalty under section 140. It may also be liable for the following: • prosecution in the District Court under section 206 • penal tax of up to treble the amount in default under section 194 • publication of name in the Gazette. Imposition of 10% penalty Under sections 140(1)(d) - (f), employers who fail to make or fail to account for combined tax and earner PAYE and earner premium deductions - penalties for failure to make or account for deductions 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) premium deductions are liable to pay a 10% penalty calculated on the amount of the unpaid tax and earner premium. Section 140(1) states: (d) 10% of the amount in respect of which default has been made (that amount being referred to in this subsection as the “amount in default”); and (e) 10% of the amount of so much, if any, of the amount in default and the penalty added to that amount in accord- ance with paragraph (d) as remains unpaid at the expiry of the day on which there expires the period of 6 months immediately following the day on which the failure occurred; and (f) 10% of the amount of so much, if any, of the amount in default and the penalty added to that amount in accord- ance with paragraphs (d) and (e), and of the penalty, if any, previously added in accordance with this paragraph, as remains unpaid at the expiry of any of the periods of 6 months that, consecutively, succeed the period of 6 months referred to in paragraph (e). An employer is liable to pay a 10% penalty even though it is not convicted of the offences of failing to make a deduction or failing to account under section 206. Under section 182(1), after receiving a written applica- tion the Commissioner may remit or refund (if already paid) all or part of the 10% incremental penalty im- posed under section 140, if having regard to the circum- stances of the case, he thinks it would be equitable to do so. The Commissioner’s policy when considering applications made under section 182(1) is set out in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Seven, No.5 (November 1995). Fines payable if convicted of an offence under section 206 It is an offence under section 206 for an employer to fail to make a deduction or to fail to account for combined tax and earner premium deductions. Any prosecution action taken by the Commissioner will be in the District Court. Under section 206(2), an employer is deemed to have made a combined tax and earner premium deduction if and when the employer makes a net source deduction payment. Section 206(2) also states that the amount of the deduction is deemed to have been applied for a purpose other than its payment to the Commissioner, if the payment of the deduction is not paid to the Commis- sioner within the prescribed time. However, under the proviso to section 206(2), an employer will not be convicted of an offence under section 206 if: ... the person satisfies the Court that the amount of the deduction has been accounted for, and that the person’s failure to account for it within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident, or other cause beyond the person’s control. Section 222(1) sets out the maximum fines or terms of imprisonment that may be levied for a conviction under section 206. It states: (a) On the first occasion on which that person is convicted of any such offence or more than one such offence, be liable, in respect of that offence or, as the case may be, each of those offences, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine not exceeding $15,000: (b) On every occasion, other than the occasion referred to in paragraph (a), on which that person is convicted of any such offence or more than one such offence, be liable, in respect of that offence or, as the case may be, each of those offences, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine not exceeding $25,000. Imposition of penal tax In addition to the above penalties, under section 194 penal tax of up to three times the amount of unpaid tax is chargeable. Publication of name in the Gazette Under section 223, the name of any person who has been convicted in court for tax evasion, failed to deduct or account for combined tax and earner premium deductions, or who has been charged penal tax, will be published in the Gazette. These names may also be published in local newspapers. However, the Commissioner has a discretion under section 223 to omit the name of any such person, if he is satisfied that the taxpayer in question voluntarily disclosed complete information and provided full particulars prior to any investigation or inquiry com- mencing. Example - Calculation of late payment penalty Ted Crossit Limited is an employer that must pay combined tax and earner premium deductions to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. A combined tax and earner premium deduction of $1,263.45 is due 20 July 1994. Ted Crossit Limited makes payment of $700 only on 4 August. Penalties are charged as follows: Combined tax and earner premium deduction due 20 July$1,263.45 Plus 10% penalty $ 126.34 $1,389.79 Less amount paid 4 August $ 700.00 Combined tax and earner premium deduction outstanding as at 20 Jan 1995 $ 689.79 Plus 10% penalty$ 68.97 $ 758.76 A further 10% penalty will be charged on the balance outstanding at the expiry of every consecu- tive six-monthly period. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Change to payment due date set under section 139(4), Tax Administration Act 1994 Summary Under section 139(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, when an assessment is made which increases tax payable after the due date for paying the tax, the Commissioner shall fix a new due date for paying that tax. The section does not apply if the taxpayer has been guilty of neglect or default in making due and complete returns. Section 139(4) does not specify when the new due date should be. Inland Revenue’s policy has been to set the date one month from the 7th of the month following the date of the assessment. We have now amended this policy. From 1 October 1995 the due date for payment is two months from the date of assessment, the date that coincides with the last date for making an objection. The change in policy applies to assessments of revenues which are subject to section 139(4), such as income tax, FBT etc. It does not include revenues which are subject to other provisions in other Acts such as GST and Child Support. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 sets a new due date one month from the date of assessment while the Child Support Act 1991 sets a new due date 30 days from the date of the assessment. The two month period applies to all revenues that are subject to section 139(4) excluding PAYE and Resident Withholding Tax for which work on the systems changes is continuing. We have made another policy change to make it clear that the objection period for all revenues collected under the Income Tax Act 1994 is two months from the date of the assessment. There was previously some confusion about some revenues such as FBT. Background Inland Revenue received a number of submissions about the due date for payment when tax has been reassessed and the charging of additional tax when we have received a competent objection. It was possible to be charged additional tax on what was to subsequently become deferrable tax because the due date for payment was before the last day for making an objection. Legislation Cross-reference Table Tax AdministrationIncome Tax Act 1976 Act 1994 139(4)398(5) Section 139(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states: In any case in which an assessment is not made until after the due date of the tax, or is increased after the due date of the tax, and the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has not been guilty of neglect or default in making due and complete returns for the purposes of that tax, the Commis- sioner shall in the Commissioner’s notice to the taxpayer of the assessment or amended assessment, or in any subsequent notice, fix a new due date for the payment of the tax or of the increase, and the date so fixed shall be deemed to be the due date of that tax or increase for the purposes of subsection (1) or subsection (3). Provided that this subsection shall not apply in relation to any assessment made under section EH 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment Before we extended the period in which to make an objection from one month to two months there was no problem with the due date for the payment of tax falling before the last day to make an objection. When setting a new due date it was set one month from the seventh of the month after the assessment was issued, which was always after the expiry of the time in which to make an objection. However with the change to the two month objection period this changed. We also considered that the system of setting due dates was not equitable. The time allowed to pay was depend- ent upon what day of the month the assessment was issued, and could be anywhere from one month plus one day to one month plus 30 days. Because of this factor we decided to change the due date for payment to two months from the date of assessment. There is also a compliance saving in that is that there is only one date for the taxpayer/agent to focus on rather than two. Policy From 1 October 1995 the due date for payment of tax set under section 139(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 when an assessment is issued will be two months from the date of that assessment, when the assessment is not made until after the original due date for payment of that tax. This will apply as long as the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has not been guilty of neglect or default in making due or complete returns and the tax assessed is more than that calculated by the taxpayer. As a matter of clarification the objection period for all revenues collected under the Income Tax Act 1994 is two months. This applies to all revenues that are subject to section 139(4) excluding PAYE and Resident Withholding Tax, for which work on the systems changes is continuing. Once these changes have been made the policy will be extended to these revenues. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Mining assets - deductibility/assessability Summary This item sets out the Commissioner’s current policy for the acquisition of an asset by a mining company, and its treatment under section DN 1. It appears that some taxpayers are under the impression that by not claiming a deduction under section DN 1 (7) they will not be assessed on the income from the sale of the asset under section DN 1 (11). The Commissioner considers that this is not correct. Although he has the discretion to allow a deduction, on the sale of that asset the sale proceeds will be treated as assessable income whether or not a deduction has been claimed. All references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DN 1 (1)216(1) DN 1 (2)216(2) DN 1 (7)216(8) DN 1 (11)216(12) DN 1 (12)216(13) OB 1 “specified mineral”215(1) Under section DN 1 (1), section DN 1 will apply notwithstanding anything in the Act. Under section DN 1 (2), the section is to apply to any New Zealand company (defined in section OB 1 as a company incorporated in New Zealand) as long as the Commissioner is satisfied that one of the following applies: • The company’s sole or principal source of income is the business of mining in New Zealand any specified mineral. • The company carries on, or proposes to carry on, in New Zealand, as its sole or principal undertaking, exploring or searching for or mining any specified mineral, or performing development work in relation to the exploring or searching or mining. This does not apply to activities carried on or proposed to be carried on as a service to any other person for reward, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the reward is solely or principally related to and dependent upon the production of that specified mineral or by way of participation in profits from the production of that specified mineral. Section OB 1 defines a “specified mineral” as being any one of the following minerals: (a) Alumina minerals (such as bauxite, gibbsite, diaspore, and corundum), aluminous refractory clays and fireclays containing in either case over 30% alumina in the fired state, andalusite, antimony, asbestos, barite, bentonite (other than bentonite mined in the county of Malvern), bituminous shale, chromite, copper, diatomite, dolomite, feldspar, fluorite, gold, halloysite, kaolin, kyanite, lead, magnesite, manganese, mercury, mica, molybdenite, nickel, perlite, phosphate, platinum group, pyrite, silica in lump form used only in the production of silicon carbide, silicon metal, or ferro silicon, silica in sand form used only in the production of silicon carbide, sillimanite, silver, sodium chloride, sulphur, talc, tin, titanium, titanomagnetite, tungsten, uranium, wollastonite, zeolite, zinc, or zircon: (b) Any other mineral which - (i) In the opinion of the Minister is or will be of importance - (A) In the industrial development of New Zealand; or (B) As a means of reducing the quantity of industrial minerals or industrial rock required to be imported into New Zealand; or (C) As an item of export from New Zealand; and (ii) Is declared by the Minister by notice in the Gazette to be a specified mineral for the purposes of this definition. Under section DN 1 (7), in a year that a mining com- pany has incurred any exploration or development expenditure, whether or not on the acquisition of an asset, the Commissioner may allow a deduction for that expenditure in that year. Under section DN 1 (11), when a mining company has acquired any asset as a result of any exploration ex- penditure or development expenditure and the company subsequently disposes of that asset, the amount received is deemed to be assessable income of the company in the year of disposal. Policy It appears that there is some confusion regarding the operation of section DN 1: specifically subsections (7) and (11). Section DN 1 provides taxation rules for mining companies, and contains express provisions on the tax treatment of exploration and developmental expendi- ture, including the acquisition of an asset and its subsequent disposal. For the purposes of this article it is assumed that the acquisition of an asset constitutes exploration or development expenditure as defined in section OB 1. Some taxpayers consider that there is a discretion whether to follow these rules, or alternatively to rely on the general provisions of the Act. They reason that if a deduction is not claimed on the acquisition of a mining asset, any proceeds on its sale are not assessable. The Commissioner does not agree with this reasoning. It could be argued that the words in section DN 1 (7) “the Commissioner may, subject to subsection (12), allow a deduction” denote that the taxpayer is under no continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) in nature by not claiming a deduction for them will not be effective, as the proceeds of any sale are assessable, regardless of whether or not a deduction was claimed on acquisition. The above treatment also applies to Resident Mining Operators (section DN 4) and Non - Resident Mining Operators (section DN 5). obligation to make a claim to deduct the cost of an asset acquired in an income year, (under subsection (11) the gross proceeds from the disposal of the asset are assess- able). However, subsection (11) applies whether or not the taxpayer has made a claim. Therefore, attempting to make any profits on the sale of assets that are “capital” from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 New Zealand soldiers in United Nations peacekeeping forces - tax status Section CB 11 (section 64, Income Tax Act 1976) - Exemption from tax of pay of service personnel in operational areas: A tax agent has asked whether the income earned by a New Zealand soldier who is currently serving in a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is exempt from tax. There are two sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 that provide a tax exemption for certain payments made to members of the Armed Forces serving in areas of unrest. Section CB 11 exempts from income tax the pay and allowances received from the New Zealand Government of any person engaged in any naval, military, or air force raised in New Zealand or in any other part of the Commonwealth for a period of service in an operational area. Under the section, a “special committee” comprising the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and the Minister of Finance is able to define any specified area to be an “operational area” for the purposes of the section. Section CB 9 (b) (section 61(16), Income Tax Act 1976) exempts income derived by any person from deferred pay. This relates to pay that meets both of these conditions: • It is for service as a member of the New Zealand armed forces in an area outside New Zealand declared to be an active service area by the Minister of Defence, by notice in the Gazette, given with the consent of the Minister of Finance; and • It is declared to be deferred pay by the Minister of Defence, by notice in the Gazette, given with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance. Bosnia has not been declared an “operational area” or an “active service area” for the purposes of the 1994 Income Tax Act 1994. We therefore advised the tax agent that New Zealand troops currently serving in Bosnia as part of the United Nations peacekeeping force are treated as New Zealand residents for taxation purposes. Their pay is not tax exempt. Riding school horses - valuation Section EL 1 (section 86, Income Tax Act 1976) - Valuation of livestock gener- ally: A taxpayer intends setting up a riding school. The cost of purchasing horses for the school will be substantial as there will be quality horses for the more experienced riders, as well as learner mounts. The horses will be used for breeding, and there could be some buying and selling of horses. The taxpayer has asked what the correct method is for valuing the horses. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Under section EE 1 (1) (section 85, Income Tax Act 1976), any taxpayer carrying on a business must take into account the value of any trading stock, including livestock, at the beginning and end of each financial year in determining whether any assessable income has been derived. The livestock values published by Inland Revenue each year are for specified livestock. The horses in this case are not specified livestock. They are an asset of the riding school. Section EE 1 (4) sets out the method for determining the value of livestock that is not specified livestock. Such animals are valued according to section EL 1 (1)(c) using one of the following: • market value • replacement value • cost price • standard value. The taxpayer can elect to value the horses using any of the above methods. Reasonable wages - payments to a spouse Section GD 3 (section 97, Income Tax Act 1976) - Payment of excessive salary or wages, or allocation of excessive share of profits or losses, to relative em- ployed by or in partnership with taxpayer: A taxpayer has set up a home based business, and intends paying his wife for clerical services. He has asked for details of the criteria used by Inland Revenue to determine what is a “reason- able” payment in this situation. Under section GD 4 (section 106(1)(d), Income Tax Act 1976), a taxpayer who wishes to pay wages to a spouse is required to obtain the Commissioner’s per- mission before a deduction will be allowed. The Commissioner needs to be satisfied that the payment is for services rendered or is otherwise a bona fide payment incurred in the production of assessable income by the taxpayer, for the income year. Before a deduction will be allowed the Commissioner must be satisfied that the services have been rendered by the spouse, and that the deduction will be claimed in the tax return that covers the income year in which the services were performed. If he considers that the salary or wage paid to a taxpayer’s relative is excessive, section GD 3 allows the Commissioner to set what he considers to be a reason- able payment for the services rendered. If payment is made above this level, he will allocate the income based on the level set, i.e., the Commissioner may disal- low a deduction for any amount paid above that level. To determine what is a reasonable payment for the services rendered, the Com- missioner will consider the following criteria: • the nature of the services and the circumstances in which they will be or are performed • the knowledge and skills required to carry out the services, including any particular qualifications • the amount of payment that the person carrying out the duties would be paid by another independent employer for like services • the locality where the duties are being performed • the amount the taxpayer would be prepared to pay an arm’s length employee undertaking similar duties. from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Deductibility of expenditure in a consolidated group Section HB 2 (1)(c) (section 191M(1)(c), Income Tax Act 1976) - Items to be included in group return of income: Co A and Co B are members of a consoli- dated group. Co A derives assessable income, and Co B derives no assessable income. Co B has been invoiced by third party Y and has made payment. Co A reimburses Co B for the expenditure. A group spokesperson has asked whether the reimbursement creates an “arrangement” between the companies that in some way prevents Co B claiming a deduction for the expenditure. Section HB 2 sets out the types of income and expenditure that must or must not be taken into account when calculating the assessable income of a company that is a member of a consolidated group. This section ensures that a consolidated group is generally liable for income tax as if it were a single company. Assuming the expenditure is expenditure that would otherwise be deductible, under section HB 2 (1)(c) Co B can claim a deduction for the payment made to third party Y as long as all of the following criteria are met: • The expenditure does not fall within section HB 2 (1)(b). • The expenditure would not, but for section HB 2 (1)(c), have been deductible in calculating Co B’s assessable income - section HB 2 (1)(c)(i). • The expenditure would be deductible if the consolidated group were one company because a nexus can be shown between the expenditure incurred and the assessable income of another member of the consolidated group - section HB 2 (1)(c)(ii). Co B’s payment to third party Y does not fall within section HB 2 (1)(b) because: • It was not incurred by virtue of a payment or disposition to, or other transac- tion or arrangement with, another member of the consolidated group - section HB 2 (1)(b)(i). • It would be a deductible expense if Co B and Co A were one company, be- cause it would have been incurred in deriving assessable income - section HB 2 (1)(b)(ii). The payment by Co B to third party Y would not ordinarily be deductible under section BB 7 as Co B derives no assessable income. The reimbursement by Co A is ignored when ascertaining whether Co B derives any assessable income, because under section HB 2 (1) the following types of assessable income derived by Co B are not taken into account: • assessable income derived from a transaction or other arrangement with any other company that is a member of the same consolidated group - section HB 2 (1)(a)(i) • assessable income which would not be assessable income if the company and the other company were one company - section HB 2 (1)(a)(ii). Co B’s “reimbursement” by Co A does not prevent Co B claiming a deduction for the expenditure incurred in paying third party Y. Co A may not claim a deduction for the expenditure it incurs when reimbursing Co B. Such a “reimbursement” is an intra-group expense which is not deductible under section HB 2 (1)(b) because: • It was incurred by virtue of a payment to another member of the consolidated group - section HB 2 (1)(b)(i). • It would not be deductible if Co A and Co B were one company because payments paid by a taxpayer to itself are not deductible - section HB 2 (1)(b)(ii). However, section HB 2 (1)(b) does not deny Co B a deduction for the payment it made to a third party. 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Earliest date at which a newly incorporated company can become a QC or LAQC Section HG 3 (section 393C, Income Tax Act 1976) - Director elections, and revocation of director elections: A taxpayer advised that she is a director of a newly formed company incorporated on 20 June 1995. She has asked for details of the earliest date at which the company can become a qualifying company (QC) and a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC). The company has a 31 March balance date. Under section HG 3 (3), a newly formed company may elect to be a QC from the first day of the company’s first income year. Following on from this, under section HG 14 (c) (section 393N(c), Income Tax Act 1976), a newly formed com- pany may also elect to become an LAQC from the first day of the company’s first income year. In both cases the company must give the Commissioner a notice of election within the time allowed under section 37 of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994 (section 17, Income Tax Act 1976) for the company to file its income tax return for its first income year. The notices of election (IR 4PE for a QC and IR 4PL for an LAQC) must be made in writing to the Commissioner. Under section HG 3 (1), QC elections must be made by all the directors of the company. Under section HG 4 (1) (section 393D(1), Income Tax Act 1976), QC elections must also be made by all sharehold- ers of legal capacity. (Limited exceptions apply) For the company to become an LAQC, all of its shareholders and directors at the time of the election who are of legal capacity must complete a notice of election for the company to be an LAQC (section HG 14 (c)(i)). If the company in this case meets the QC rules, the earliest it could become a QC and an LAQC is the date of incorporation - 20 June 1995. For a full policy statement on the time limits for new companies to make QC elections, see page 4 of TIB Volume Six, No. 13 (May 1995). Imputation credits and trust losses Section LB 2 (section 394ZE, Income Tax Act 1976) - Credit of tax for imputa- tion credit: A trustee has received dividend income with imputation credits attached. The dividends are retained as trustee income, but the imputation credits exceed the trustee tax liability. The trustee has asked how the remaining credits may be utilised. A trustee is taxed as an individual taxpayer. When dividends are assessed as trustee income, they form part of the total trust income and are assessed accord- ingly. When a dividend received by a trustee as trustee income has an imputa- tion credit attached, the trustee is subject to tax on that dividend, including the amount of any attached imputation credits. Tax is paid on trustee income at the fixed rate of 33%, and no individual rebates are available. Under section LB 2 (1), when the trustee’s assessable income includes any impu- tation credit, the trustee can claim a tax credit for the amount of the imputation credit. Under section LB 2 (2), the tax credit can only be used to meet income tax liabilities on trustee income. To the extent that tax credits cannot be used by a trustee, they are deemed to be a loss and may be carried forward to succeeding income years. The amount of the loss to be carried forward is calculated using the formula set out in section LB 2 (3). When the trust is ultimately wound up, unused credits that have been converted to losses and not used are lost. The converted losses may not be reconverted into credits in later years, nor may they be passed over to beneficiaries. 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Special tax code (STC) certificates and rental loses Section NC 14 (section 351, Income Tax Act 1976) - Special tax code certificates: An employee owns a rental investment property. From the expenses incurred this year, she has calculated that she will incur a tax lose on the property in the 1996 income year. She has asked if she can have a special tax code (STC) to reduce her PAYE deductions to reflect the anticipated loss. An STC applies when an employee expects the amount of tax deductions made from salary or wages during the year to exceed or to be less than the end of year tax liability if the deductions are made at ordinary tax rates. Section NC 14 (1) states: Where the Commissioner in any case thinks fit (whether by reason of the employee being em- ployed on 2 or more employments, or being entitled to have any loss carried forward under section IE 1, or by reason of any reduction under section NC 13, or for any other reason), the Commissioner may issue to an employee a special tax code certificate under this section. In this employee’s case, at this stage the loss is an anticipated loss. In order for an STC to be issued for anticipated deductible losses, it is the Commissioner’s policy that an application for a certificate should be supported with a detailed budget of proposed income and expenditure. The issue of an STC does not mean that the Commissioner accepts that there will be a loss. This will only be determined when the employee files her tax return and all the facts giving rise to the loss have been fully considered from the details supplied in the return. After-hours payments to midwives - tax treatment Section OB 1 (section 2, Income Tax Act 1976) - Definitions of “ monetary remuneration” and “salary or wages”: A Crown Health Enterprise (CHE) em- ploys a number of midwives. The CHE has offered the midwives additional money for making after-hour calls. The midwives will be paid a fixed fee plus generous mileage allowance. A midwife has asked what the income tax and GST implications will be for each of these payments. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” as: ... any salary, wage allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer; and includes - ... Section OB 1 defines “salary or wages” as: in relation to any person, means salary, wages, or allowances including all sums received or receivable by way of overtime pay, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, commission, or other remunera- tion of any kind, in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person; and includes- ... The income received constitutes monetary remuneration as defined in section OB 1, and as such is subject to PAYE. Under the former section CB 12 (section 73, Income Tax Act 1976), the Commis- sioner could determine to what extent any allowance was a reimbursement of expenditure incurred in earning assessable income. To the extent that the allow- ance was a reimbursement as required, the allowance was exempt from income tax. From 1 April 1995, sections CB 12 and CB 13 (section 73A, Income Tax Act 1976) were repealed and a new section CB 12 substituted. From that date, an employer can pay a tax free allowance to an employee without obtaining the Commissioner’s permission. continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) The mileage allowance has been described as “generous”. On page 1 of TIB Volume Seven, No.1 (July 1995), the Commissioner has issued motor vehicle rates that are acceptable to Inland Revenue. If the allowance paid to the mid- wives exceeds these rates, the excess becomes a taxable allowance. The taxable allowance must be treated as part of the salary or wages, and PAYE deducted accordingly. There are no GST implications with either payment, because contracts of service are excluded from the definition of a “taxable activity”. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Part-time tutoring - whether a taxable activity Section 6 - Meaning of term “Taxable activity”: A GST registered horticulturist has had an offer to do some part-time tutoring at her local polytechnic. A con- tract for her services is being drawn up, and she has asked if GST should be included in the proposed hourly rate. If the horticulturist is engaged by the local polytechnic as an employee, rather than as self-employed, under section 6(3)(b) she cannot be carrying on a taxable activity for her tutoring and the tutoring income will not include GST. Section 6(3)(b) excludes from the definition of taxable activity: Any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company. If the horticulturist is employed under a contract for services, and is self-em- ployed, those services would be considered to be a taxable activity. As she is already registered for GST, that registration covers all taxable activities that she undertakes. In this case, it has been determined that she is self-employed and that the part- time tutoring is a taxable activity. Accordingly, we advised her that as her GST registration also covers her tutoring services, she should include GST in the proposed hourly rate. Land sold for residential purposes - GST Section 8 - Imposition of goods and services tax on supply: A GST registered golf club is planning to build a new clubhouse. As a means of raising funds, it is going to subdivide a 1,000 square metre block of land off from the golf course and sell it as a residential section. The club’s secretary believes that the sale of land is not part of the club’s taxable activity, and that the proposed residential status of the block would in any event make the sale exempt from GST. She has asked for Inland Revenue’s view. Section 8(1) imposes goods and services tax at the rate of 12.5 percent: ...on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. The sale of the block of land is the supply of an asset of the club, and is a supply made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The fact that the club is not in the business of selling land does not affect its liability to account for GST on the supply of one of its assets. As to whether the proposed residential status of the block affects the nature of the supply - exempt or taxable - it is necessary to refer to section 14 which gives from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) details of supplies exempt from tax. The supply by way of sale of unimproved land is not included in section 14 and so it is a supply subject to section 8. The use to which purchasers may put the land is not relevant. The club must account for GST at 12.5 percent on the sale of the land. It can claim input tax deductions for expenses incurred in making the sale, provided the tax invoice requirements of section 24 are met. Child Support Act 1991 Deductions when liable parent ceases employment Section 163 - Payment of deductions to the Commissioner: An employer who runs a small business has advised Inland Revenue that her sole employee has left without giving notice. She was deducting Child Support payments along with PAYE on behalf of the employee, and has asked what she should do. Under section 163, an employer who has made a deduction for Child Support from any money payable to a liable person must, by the 20th of the following month: (a) Pay to the Commissioner every sum so deducted to the credit of the liable person; and (b) Supply to the Commissioner, in the approved form, the particulars required by the form. Under section 163 an employer must notify Inland Revenue of the amount of Child Support deducted each pay by completing the IR 66S or IR 66C deduction schedules. The IR 66C schedule is used by employers with 6 or more employees who have Child Support or Student Loan repayments deducted. Normally, the information does not vary, but if any of the following reasons for change exist they must be noted by a “variation code” on the form: • Payments have been made in advance - Code A. • Employment has ceased - Code C. • The amount has already been deducted - Code D. • Earnings are protected (this means that an employer cannot deduct more than 40% of an employee’s net salary as child support deductions) - Code P. • There are short-term absences in the employee’s employment - Code S. In this case, the employer must deduct Child Support payments from the last pay, including any holiday pay due to the employee. She must enter the varia- tion code “C” on the IR 66S form to notify Inland Revenue that the employee has left her employ. When Inland Revenue is advised that an employee has left, we will issue a cessation notice to the employer and employee. Tax Administration Act 1994 This is the second in a series of questions and answers on the binding rulings process. They include questions raised at the 1995 Tax Conference of the New Zealand Society of Accountants and other questions and issues referred to us. Disclosure of “propositions of law” in binding ruling application Section 91ED - Disclosure requirements: A taxpayer is drafting a private ruling for submission to Inland Revenue. She has located several cases from New continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Zealand and Australia, plus a Privy Council case out of Hong Kong, which support her stance. She has made reference to these in her submissions. She is also aware of a case which goes against her and has asked whether she is re- quired to cite this case in her application. She has also asked whether it would make any difference if the latter case is a New Zealand case or one from another Commonwealth jurisdiction. Under section 91ED (1)(d) an application for a private ruling “must state the propositions of law (if any) relevant to the issues raised in the application.” The applicant must provide any legal reasons and arguments supporting the pre- ferred interpretation. Inland Revenue requires legal propositions based on statutory wording, case law, and/or established legal principles, and not merely assertions that a particular interpretation applies. This will often involve both quoting potentially relevant cases and demonstrating a linkage between the case and the matter being ruled on. The applicant must provide all the material needed for the Commissioner to arrive at a correct decision. The test is a combination of relevance and materiality. Section 91EB(2)(b) provides that a ruling will not apply to a particu- lar arrangement if there was “a material omission or misrepresentation in, or in connection with, the application”. If significant authorities exist which are con- trary to the applicant’s interpretation, and which have not been referred to in the application, then the Commissioner may consider whether the fact that reference was not made to these authorities effectively amounted to a material omission. In the above example, the case which contradicts her view, presuming the facts are similar to her own or the legal principles are directly on point, could well be relevant to the issue she has raised. The fact that the case is from another jurisdiction will influence the relative significance of the authority. For example, some Courts and jurisdictions are more persuasive to New Zealand Courts than others. In the case of the Privy Council, its position in New Zealand’s court structure is even more likely to make its decisions highly relevant in this country. In any event, it would ordinarily be in an applicant’s interest to refer to contrary authorities in the application, so as to present the arguments countering their application (rather than finding later on that the Commissioner is seeking to rely upon them in his ruling). Non-disclosure of names of those who may be party to the arrangement Section 91ED - Disclosure requirements: On 2 April 1996, a taxpayer applies for a private ruling on a completed transaction. The documents relating to the transaction include the name of the other party to the transaction. The other party has expressly requested that they not be named in any approach to Inland Revenue. Can Inland Revenue give a ruling on this basis? Ordinarily, Inland Revenue requires names of all parties to an arrangement to be identified. In exceptional cases, when this requirement will give rise to particular difficul- ties, beyond such matters as commercial sensitivity or contractual secrecy obliga- tions, Inland Revenue may accept an application without the disclosure of all parties. However, the Commissioner must be satisfied that there is a specific arrangement (between actual parties) that is seriously contemplated (in the case of prospective transactions), and all material attributes of the undisclosed party must be provided. In these cases, we recommend that the applicant contact the from page 33 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Rulings division prior to application outlining the precise reasons for the desire to omit one party’s name from the application. If Rulings indicates that an application could be made without disclosure of all parties’ identities, the rea- sons for non-disclosure should be confirmed in detail in the rulings application. Disclosure of the applicant’s details is always required. Whether a ruling can be made when the applicant company has not been formed Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: Three con- struction firms intend forming a company for the purpose of building a retail shopping complex. The firms have applied for a binding ruling on a deductibil- ity aspect of the proposed development project and Inland Revenue’s response to the application will depend on whether the new company is brought into existence. Is Inland Revenue prevented from ruling on the application for a binding ruling because there is technically no applicant? To help taxpayers in entering into developments such as this one, Inland Rev- enue will accept applications for rulings on matters which by necessity must be decided prior to incorporation. In this example, we would provide a draft ruling to the soon-to-be-incorporated company if its agent applied for one. However, the agent must give Inland Revenue an undertaking dealing with the application that it will fulfil all obligations required of it as if it were an applicant for a bind- ing ruling (particularly including the payment of fees). Also, care must be taken to ensure that the underlying parties are seriously contemplating the proposed “arrangement”. Once the company is incorporated Inland Revenue will issue a final ruling. Whether Inland Revenue can rule when we are required to consider criteria under another Act Section 91C - Taxation laws in respect of which binding rulings may be made: On 2 April 1996 a commercial passenger aircraft operator applies for a ruling on whether the fares it charges passengers who are in New Zealand as part of a round the world package can be zero-rated for GST purposes. The taxpayer’s agent has referred to section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act 1985. Section 11(2)(aa) provides zero-rating for services comprising the transport by air of passengers within New Zealand if the transport constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the Carriage by Air Act 1967. Section 91C(1) of the Tax Administration Act specifies the provisions which comprise “taxation law”. The issue is whether Inland Revenue can rule when it must consider criteria under another Act which is not “taxation law”. Inland Revenue will rule in these circumstances. Section 91 E(1) requires the Commissioner to rule, on application, on how any taxation law applies to a particular arrangement. Inland Revenue accepts there is an “arrangement” in the above example. “Taxation law” is defined and includes any provision of the GST Act 1985, except sections 12 and 13. In the course of ruling on how the “taxation law” (i.e., section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act) applies to the arrangement the Com- missioner will need to be satisfied as to the status of the applicant’s activities under the Carriage by Air Act 1967. The Commissioner is therefore required to interpret this latter Act for the purpose of ruling on how the taxation law applies to the arrangement in question. 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Ruling on questions of fact Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: A taxpayer has a two hectare block of land which he is looking at developing and dividing into lots for future resale. He is aware that any profit he makes on the undertaking will be assessable income under section CD 1(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and has applied for a private ruling on the market value of the land as at the proposed start of the undertaking in terms of section CD 1(9). Can the Commis- sioner rule on this matter? The Commissioner is required under section 91 E(1) to rule, on application, on how any taxation law applies to a particular arrangement. However, under section 91 E(4)(a) he cannot rule if it would require him to determine questions of fact. Therefore, because the application involves ruling on the market value of an asset (which is a matter of fact, not law), the Commissioner cannot rule due to his having to determine a question of fact. Correction - when an arrangement is “entered into” We have noted that the last sentence in one of the items in last month’s Tax Information Bulletin was somewhat confusing. The item, When an arrangement is “entered into”, appears on pages 28 and 29. The last sentence on page 29 should read: “Therefore, a ruling given on a conditional or unconditional contract/arrange- ment entered into before the Commissioner withdraws a private ruling, will be binding on him”.

Business purchase - deductibility of lease and depreciation Rating:• Case:TRA 95/50 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 11(1)(c) Income Tax Act 1976 - section 108 (Income Tax Act 1994 - section EG 1) Keywords:going concern, depreciation Summary:The Authority held that the Commissioner acted correctly in disallowing the deductions claimed for lease amortisation. There was a purchase of a business as a going concern and not the buying of a lease. The Authority also held that there was no factual basis on which the Commissioner could allow the claim for depreciation of assets. Facts:The objector owned and operated a real estate business. It entered into an agree- ment for sale and purchase on 14 June 1989 to purchase the premises of a rival real estate agent. The agreement was on the Standard Real Estate Institute of New Zealand and Auckland District Law Society form. The transaction was zero-rated. The Authority highlighted a number of important events: • On 9 August 1989 the objector gave a receipt to the vendor for entries in their tenancy register dated from 18 April 1988 through to 13 July 1989 in compli- ance with the agreement. • On 11 August 1989 the objector wrote to all clients of the vendor’s business informing them that the objector had purchased the business of the vendor. • On 6 September 1989 the objector’s solicitor wrote to the vendor requesting the vendor to account to the objector for all files, computer tapes, documents and other business records and to direct all former clients of the vendor to return to the objector’s business. The objector sought to deduct what it claimed to be lease payments from assess- able income in the years 1990 to 1993. The Commissioner considered that the continued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) evidence showed the purchase of a business as a going concern and not merely the buying of a lease. The Commissioner declined to allow the claim to deduct the purchase price as being a premium paid for the lease. The objector also sought to deduct an amount representing depreciation on obsolete assets taken over when entering into the lease. The Commissioner contended that there was no allowable depreciation claim. Decision:The Authority held that the documentary evidence of the transaction and the actions of the objector following settlement pointed overwhelmingly to the purchase of a business as a going concern. The Commissioner was correct in disallowing the objector’s claim to amortise the purchase price of the business as a lease premium payment and deduct it in the relevant year. With respect to the objector’s claim to deduct as depreciation the value of the assets purchased, the objector had the onus of showing that the Commissioner was wrong in fact or law in not allowing the depreciation claim. The only evi- dence about the disposition of assets came from a chartered accountant who said all the assets in question were scrapped shortly after the purchase. The Author- ity held that such sparse evidence did not satisfy the onus of proof. There was no factual basis on which the Authority could further deal with this aspect of the objection and the objector failed. Comment:We do not yet know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Film expenditure and royalty payments - deductibility Rating:••• Case:DB Productions Ltd v CIR M 577/94 DB Group Limited v CIR M 576/94 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 2, 224A(1), (5), (6), 224D(1), (3) and (6) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections OB 1, EO 3(4), (5), (9), EO 4(1) and (4)) Keywords:deductibility of film expenditure, feature film, royalty payments Summary:The High Court held in favour of the objector and its subsidiary, DB Group Ltd. The Court found that in the case stated for DB Productions Ltd (“the objector”) the Commissioner had acted incorrectly in disallowing expenditure incurred in relation to the film “The Navigator”. It held that expenditure incurred in acquir- ing the film or any right in the film was deductible under section 224A(6) and that payments made for the production of the film constituted film production expenditure and were therefore deductible under section 224D(6). Also, the Court found that the payment for the right to market, distribute and sell the film was not a payment in the nature of a royalty. It was a payment for the absolute assignment and ownership of the right. In the case of DB Group Ltd, the Court held that having regard to the judgment given in relation to DB Productions Ltd the Commissioner had incorrectly amended the subvention payments or the losses to DB Group Ltd. Facts:The objector incurred expenditure in acquiring certain rights in relation to the film “The Navigator”. The objector entered into three interlocking agreements under which payments were made for the production of the film (“investment agreement”), for a licence to market, distribute and sell the film (“licence agree- ment”) and for certain ancillary rights relating to the outright purchase of the film (“acquisition agreement”). from page 37 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) The objector claimed a deduction for the payments on the basis that the film was not a feature film and part of the expenditure was film production expenditure. The Commissioner disallowed the expenditure on the basis that the film was a feature film and that the production expenditure had not been incurred. In addition, the Commissioner contended that, in substance if not in form, the payment under the acquisition agreement constituted a payment in the nature of a royalty in terms of the extended definition of a royalty under section 2. Ac- cordingly, the Commissioner assessed the objector for non-resident withholding tax on the acquisition agreement. As a consequence of adjusting the objector’s losses a secondary issue arose regarding the amount of losses available to be transferred to its subsidiary, DB Group Ltd. The Commissioner amended the subvention payments or the loss offsets to DB Group Ltd for the years in question. Decision:Justice Doogue considered the following three issues: (i) whether the film was a feature film; (ii) whether the amount paid under the acquisition agreement was a royalty attracting non-resident withholding tax; and (iii) whether the sum paid under the investment agreement represented film production expenditure. On the first issue, Justice Doogue found that the film “The Navigator” was not a feature film. The film was not produced primarily and principally for exhibition in a cinema. The principal revenue and viewing markets were television and video screening. Accordingly, the expenditure incurred in acquiring the film or any right in the film was deductible under section 224A(6). The next question was whether the payment under the acquisition agreement was a royalty payment. Justice Doogue did not accept the Commissioner’s argument that the rights being acquired under the acquisition agreement could be enjoyed only by the use of or by exercising the right to use them. He held that in this case the payment under the acquisition agreement was for the outright purchase of the rights. On this basis the amount paid under the acquisition agreement was not a royalty payment. In reaching his decision, Justice Doogue considered that the rights purchased do not have to be used, rather they may be purchased simply to prevent someone else obtaining them. Even if the rights were used, he considered that there was nothing that equated the sum paid for the outright purchase of the rights with the payment of a royalty. On the third issue, Justice Doogue found that the payments made under the investment agreement were payments which constituted film production ex- penditure under section 224D(1) and accordingly the expenditure was deduct- ible under section 224D (6). In terms of the agreements to which the objector was a party, it had proven to the Court’s satisfaction that the objector was a direct contributor to the film and that payments made under the investment agreement were film production expenditure. Although there was no direct evidence that the film production expenditure had been incurred, the completion of the film and the fact that the objector contributed directly to the cost of producing “The Navigator” were sufficient to show that the costs had been incurred. In the case of DB Group Ltd, Justice Doogue did not give independent consid- eration to whether the Commissioner had acted correctly in amending the sub- vention payments or the loss offsets. He held that, in finding that the Commis- sioner had acted incorrectly in disallowing the expenditure incurred by the objector, the assessments for DB Group Ltd were also incorrect. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Company in liquidation - whether former receiver and tax agent’s objection and case stated request valid Rating:•••• Case:TRA No. 94/159 Act:Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1974 - Regulation 5 Companies Act 1955 - section 226, 240(1) and (3) Companies Act 1993 - section 248(1)(c) Keywords:invalid case stated request, invalid objection, company in liquidation, objection process Summary:An objection to a GST assessment and a request for a case stated made on behalf of a company in liquidation were found to be invalid. The objection and request for a case had been lodged by the company’s tax agent who had earlier ceased to act as the receiver and manager of the company. The current liquidator neither wished to object to the assessment nor had authorised the tax agent to do so. Facts:(a) In June 1990 a winding up order was made against the company by the High Court and the Official Assignee was appointed provisional liquidator. The tax agent had been receiver and manager of the company since 1988 under a debenture dated November 1986. (b) In July 1992 the tax agent notified the Companies Office that he had ceased to act as receiver and manager of the company on 20 July 1992. (c) In July 1993 the Commissioner made a GST assessment for the company’s April 1987 taxable period. The GST return for that period had been filed by the tax agent in July 1991. (d) In August 1993 the tax agent objected to the assessment on behalf of the company. In December 1993, following advice that the objection had been disallowed, he requested a case be stated for determination by the Taxation Review Authority. (e) In July 1994 the Commissioner wrote to the tax agent explaining in detail why it was not possible to state such a case. (f) In December 1994 an application was made to the Taxation Review Author- ity on behalf of the company, seeking to have the objection to the GST as- sessment allowed. This was on the grounds that the Commissioner had failed to file a case stated within the six month period provided under Regu- lation 5 of the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1974. Decision:The Authority confirmed that from 20 July 1992 the tax agent had ceased to act as receiver and manager of the taxpayer company. The Authority also held that the question of any objection to the GST assessment was a matter for the Official Assignee as liquidator of the company to raise if so desired. In giving his decision the Authority referred to provisions of the Companies Act 1955 and Companies Act 1993 and in particular sections 226 and 240 of the 1955 Act and section 248(1)(c) of the 1993 Act. These provisions make it clear that on a liquidation all proceedings involving a company are frozen and can only be reactivated, continued, commenced, or otherwise dealt with by the liquidator, with the consent of the High Court if necessary. An affidavit filed on behalf of the Official Assignee stated that the Official As- signee had no wish to object to the assessment nor had he authorised the tax agent to do so. The objection and subsequent case stated request lodged by the tax agent were therefore invalid and the Authority ruled the Commissioner was accordingly under no obligation to file a case stated for determination by the Taxation Review Authority. Comment:The taxpayer is appealing this decision. 41 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Trading profit received upon settlement - whether assessable income Rating:•••• Case:GPO Holdings Limited v CIR M1126/94 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - 64B, 65(2), 65(2)(a), 65(2)(l) and 65(2)(jb) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections OB 1, BB 4, BB 4(a), (d) and CE 1 (1)(c)). Keywords:assessability of pre-acquisition profits, sale of government assets Summary:Trading profit of $7,641,000 had accumulated over the period of five months between the execution of a sale and purchase agreement and its settlement. This profit was payable to the objector on settlement, and the issue was whether it was assessable in the hands of the objector. The High Court held that some of the $7,641,000 trading profit was not assess- able. The High Court found that until the “nomination agreement” of 27 June 1990 the objector did not have a legally enforceable right to receive trading profits. Accordingly, of the $7,641,000 received by the objector on settlement only $102,564, which represented income derived by the business from 27 June 1990 to settlement on 29 June 1990, was assessable income. Facts:In the late 1980s the NZ Government (“Crown”) decided to sell the business of Government Printing Office (“GPO”) as a going concern. Rank Group Limited (“Rank”) tendered for the business and in December 1989 the Crown accepted its tender. Before the signing of the formal sale and purchase agreement, Rank informally advised the Crown that the purchase would be completed through its subsidiary, GPO Holdings Limited (“the objector”). On 24 January 1990, the Crown entered into an agreement with Rank (or a nominee of Rank) for the sale of the business of GPO (“the business”) for $23,000,000 subject to an adjustment for revaluation of assets. A condition of the agreement for the sale and purchase (“the agreement”) was that Rank was entitled to “the benefit of the business” in the event that the settlement date was later than the audit date of 31 January 1990. In return, Rank was required to pay interest to the Crown based on the purchase price. On 7 March 1990, the Crown and Rank entered into a variation agreement. This agreement cancelled Rank’s obligation to pay interest pending settlement and clarified in greater detail clause 2.5 of the original agreement. In particular, the variation agreement provided that Rank was entitled to the cash generated by the business from the audit date to the possession date. The broad effect was that Rank would receive the result of trading and asset realisation between the date of the agreement and settlement. On 27 June 1990, Rank entered into a “deed of nomination and covenant” (“nomination agreement”) nominating the objector to complete the purchase of and take transfer of assets and liabilities from the business. The agreement was settled on 29 June 1990 and during the delay between execution of the agree- ment and its settlement the business made a trading profit of $7,641,000. The Commissioner initially issued a nil assessment for the year ended 31 March 1990, but later issued amended assessments for the years ended 31 March 1990 and 31 March 1991 which assessed trading profits of $7,641,000 between these two years. The objector objected to the amended assessments issued, on the grounds that it was not a party to the original agreement with the Crown, and that the agreement remained conditional until settlement on 29 June 1990. The Commissioner disallowed the objection and a case was stated. Decision:Preliminary considerations - the objector’s legal rights to accumulated trading profit Before considering whether the trading profit of $7,641,000 received by the objector on settlement represented assessable income, Justice Fisher addressed continued on page 42 42 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) two preliminary issues put forward by the objector. These issues were aimed at establishing whether the objector had a legal right to accumulated trading prof- its. (i) Whether the party to the original agreement for sale and purchase with the Crown was Rank and not the objector. Justice Fisher found that the objector was not a party to the original agreement for sale and purchase with the Crown. Although, at the time of the execution of the agreement it was clear that the Crown, Rank and the objector contemplated that upon settlement the business would be conveyed by Rank to the objector. Until the “nomination agreement” of 27 June 1990, the objector had not acquired an assignment of Rank’s rights as purchaser with respect to the agreement. (ii) To what extent was the agreement for sale and purchase conditional Justice Fisher considered that until the settlement date of 29 June 1990 the con- tract was fully conditional in the conventional legal sense. However, by 27 June 1990, when the objector acquired rights pursuant to the “nomination agree- ment”, there was a high probability that the agreement would become uncondi- tional. Bases for assessing the objector on trading profits Once the Court determined that the objector had acquired a legal right to accu- mulating trading profits of $7,641,000, from the “nomination agreement” of 27 June 1990, Justice Fisher then considered the bases for assessing tax. Justice Fisher rejected the Commissioner’s argument that the entire $7,641,000 should be taxed under section 65(2) and 65(2)(l) on the basis that that amount did not have the character of income. Rather, Justice Fisher considered that the $7,641,000 received on settlement represented the purchase price of assets pur- chased in a single capital transaction. He held that there was no necessary con- nection between the character a payment had in relation to the payer and its character as a receipt by the payee. However, Justice Fisher found that trading profits of $102,564, derived by the business over the two days between assignment and settlement, should be treated differently. His Honour found, on general accounting principles, that the objector had a legally enforceable right to receipt of trading profits accruing after 27 June 1990. Therefore, of the $7,641,000 accumulated trading profits received by the objector on settlement, only $102,564 represented its assessable income derived in the tax year ended 30 June 1991. The Commissioner further submitted that the accumulated trading profits of $7,641,000 represented the objector’s assessable income (i) as compensation for lost profits (section 65(2)), (ii) a business contract entered into for the purpose of making a profit (section 65(2)(a)) and (iii) under the accruals regime (section 65(2)(jb)). Justice Fisher found that these arguments added nothing of conse- quence to the conclusion already reached that according to general principles no tax was payable beyond that payable for the last two days prior to settlement. In addition, Justice Fisher specifically rejected the argument for assessability under the accruals rules. In particular, he considered that the objector was not a party to the agreement for sale and purchase of 24 January 1990, and conse- quently there was not a “promise”, by the Crown to provide the business of GPO, sufficient to support a “financial arrangement” for the purposes of section 64B. Comment:We do not yet know whether either party will be appealing this decision. from page 41 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Medical Council of New Zealand - whether exempt from income tax Rating:•••• Case:CIR v Medical Council of New Zealand AP 4/95 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 2, 61(2) and 61(25) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections CB 3, CB 4(1)(c) and OB 1) Keywords:public authority, charity, charitable purposes, exempt income Summary:The High Court dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal against the decision of the Taxation Review Authority reported as Case Q50 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,264. Justice McGechan confirmed that the Medical Council of New Zealand was both: (i) A “public authority” and therefore exempt from income tax under section 61(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976; and (ii)Established exclusively for charitable purposes and exempt from income tax under section 61(25) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Facts:The Medical Council of New Zealand is a statutory body created and governed by the Medical Practitioners Act 1968. Its primary functions are to maintain a formal register of medical practitioners; maintain discipline within the medical profession; oversee the undergraduate and postgraduate education of medical practitioners; identify and suspend or rehabilitate impaired medical practition- ers; and advise, provide statistical information and administrative services to the Minister of Health as required. The Council derives interest income from the investment of annual fees levied from medical practitioners. The case related to the assessment of this interest income for the 1989 and 1990 income years. The Taxation Review Authority ruled that the Council was a “public authority” as defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976, and thus exempt under section 61(2); and was established exclusively for charitable purposes, and thus exempt under section 61(25). On appeal, the Commissioner argued that the Council: (i) did not come within the statutory definition of “public authority” because the Council was not “part” of nor an “instrument of” the Executive Government. It was submitted that it did not have sufficient agency relationship with Executive Government; and (ii)was not established “exclusively for charitable purposes” because the Coun- cil’s main function was the registration of medical practitioners. It was sub- mitted that the functions of the Council were not materially distinguishable from those in General Medical Council v IRC (1928) 13 TC 819 and General Nursing Council v St Marylebone Corporation (1959) AC 540 both of which ruled against charitable status. Submissions for the Council contended that: (i) Using a “plain meaning” approach the Council was an instrument of Execu- tive Government. Additionally, the submissions looked at the wider term “public authority” and drew a comparison with State Owned Enterprises. If State Owned Enterprises could be regarded as within the meaning of that term thus requiring specific exclusion in section 61(2), the Council should be regarded likewise. (ii)In relation to the charitable purposes question, the approach taken in the General Medical Council case was not consistent with the approach in recent decisions in New Zealand leading to ultimate benefit to the public. continued on page 44 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Decision:Justice McGechan did not accept the Commissioner’s arguments, and found for the Council on both questions: (i) “Instrument of the Executive Government of New Zealand” The Judge considered that the Council fitted within the obviously broad Parlia- mentary intention that bodies set up to discharge functions of government, not involving commercial operations, should be exempt. “If one adds together constitution by statute, majority appointments at the instance of the Minister, and delegated exercise of regulatory controls which are a proper function of government, there can be no sensible doubt the Council is within the particular statutory scope of an ‘instrument of the Executive Government of New Zea- land’”. The Council therefore came within the term “public authority” as defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and was exempted from income tax by section 61(2) accordingly. (ii)Institution established exclusively for charitable purposes Justice McGechan held that registration of medical practitioners was not “the main function” of the Council although it was a main function, and the original function. The Judge acknowledged that the 1928 General Medical Council case which found against charitable status could not be distinguished on its facts. However, he considered that the law has moved on since that case from focusing on “immediate object” to “wider purpose”. When benefit to the profession and the public benefit are intertwined, the professional benefit need not disqualify the institution from having an exclusively charitable purpose. Justice McGechan concluded that the Council’s registration, disciplinary, educa- tional, disability and advisory functions had as their main object public protec- tion (“beneficial to the community”). Benefits to medical practitioners of registra- tion and from these other functions were no more than ancillary, secondary, subordinate, or incidental to that public protection purpose. The Council was therefore an institution established for exclusively charitable purposes and exempt from tax under section 61(25) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Land purchase - GST input tax credit claim Rating:••• Case:TRA No. 94/156 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 2(1), 9(1) and 20 Keywords:input tax, payment, time of supply Summary:The taxpayer could claim a GST input tax deduction on the purchase of land when the full amount of GST and a deposit were paid at the time of signing the contract, but the balance of the purchase price was not payable until a later date. Facts:The taxpayer (purchaser) entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of a block of land in October 1993. Both the vendor and purchaser were registered for GST. The purchaser accounted for GST on a payments basis while the vendor accounted for GST on an invoice basis. On the invoice basis of accounting for GST the vendor was required to account to the Commissioner for GST on the sale of the block of land in the GST payment period immediately following the signing of the contract. The parties agreed that the purchaser would pay a de- posit and the full amount of GST to the vendor on signing the agreement. The from page 43 45 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) balance of the purchase price was to be paid approximately 12 months later. The taxpayer sought to deduct the GST payment as an input tax in its GST return of 31 October 1993. The Commissioner contended that the taxpayer could only deduct 1/9 of the amount paid for the supply of the goods and services in the relevant tax period as input tax. The Commissioner considered that the input tax should be limited to the extent of the deposit paid in October 1993 and could not extend to the balance of the purchase price to be paid in a future GST period. This assessment was made on the grounds that section 20(3)(b)(i) limits the deduction of input tax “to the extent that a payment has been made during the taxable period.” The taxpayer objected and a case was stated. Decision:Judge Willy held that the taxpayer was entitled to deduct the total amount of GST paid on the purchase price of the property as an input tax in the GST period immediately following the signing of the contract and the payment of the de- posit and the full amount of GST. He considered that the payment of GST at the time of signing the contract was clearly “a payment” within the plain meaning of section 9(1). The time of supply contemplated by section 9(1) was the date the agreement was made and equitable title passed to the purchaser. Judge Willy rejected the Commissioner’s contention that the taxpayer could only deduct 1/9 of the deposit paid as an input tax because this would lead to unjust and absurd results. Judge Willy cited the approach to the interpretation of taxing statutes in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175. Following this approach, he said that Parliament could not have intended the arbitrary result that a taxpayer registered to pay GST on an invoice basis may deduct the allowable input in the period in which the output is paid, but the payments based taxpayer may not. Judge Willy also noted that if the Commissioner’s contention was accepted there was no mechanism for the taxpayer to deduct the remaining 8/9 of the GST paid. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. 46 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.7 (January 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. Dispositions where the transferor reserves a benefit or advantage in real property - gift duty implications Public ruling BR Pub 96/1 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections 2(2) (definition of “gift” and “disposi- tion of property”), 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, and 70, of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a taxpayer disposes of real property and keeps or reserves a benefit or advantage in that property. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. The ruling All legislative references in this ruling are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Link between section 70(2) and the definition of “gift” A gift is defined in section 2(2) as a disposition of property without fully ad- equate consideration. Section 61 imposes gift duty on a dutiable gift. Where there is a dutiable gift, section 70(2) may apply to affect the value of the gift. Where there is, prima facie, no gift, section 70(2) may apply to create a gift. That is, it is sometimes necessary to refer to section 70(2) to determine whether there is a gift for the purposes of section 2(2). Section 70(2) prevents reductions in the value of dutiable gifts where there is a disposition of property with a reservation of a benefit or advantage to the transferor of the property. Section 70(2) requires the definition of “gift” to be read so that the value of any reserved benefit or advantage is not part of the consideration for the disposition of property. This means that the value of any benefit or advantage reserved to the transferor is ignored when considering whether the disposition of property is a gift, that is, whether the disposition is made for fully adequate consideration. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Application of section 70(2) Where a transferor grants an interest in property to himself or herself, and later transfers the remainder or reversion to another person (including the trustees of a trust), the interest kept by the transferor is not a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) and the section does not apply. Where the transferor grants an interest in property to himself or herself, and simultaneously transfers the re- mainder or reversion to another person, the interest kept by the transferor will not be a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) as long as the transferor is owner of the interest kept by him or her at all times during the transfers. (That is, the transferee does not at any time take ownership of the interest kept by the transferor.) When transferors keep or reserve an interest in the property they may keep or reserve an equitable or a legal interest. It is not necessary to keep or reserve a legal interest using the provisions of the Land Transfer Act 1952. Where a transferor transfers property to another person, subject to the other person granting an interest back to the transferor, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her for the purposes of section 70(2). If the transferor has reduced the price of the property transferred because of the interest granted back by the transferee, section 70(2) will apply. In particular: • Where a transferor grants a life interest (including a lease for life) to himself or herself, and then transfers the remainder interest to another person, there is no reservation of interest and section 70(2) will not apply. • Where a transferor grants a lease for a term of years to himself or herself, and then transfers the reversion interest to another person, there is no reservation of interest and section 70(2) will not apply. • Where a transferor transfers property to another person with a reduction in the price of the property because the other person grants a life interest (in- cluding a lease for life) back to the transferor, section 70(2) will apply. • Where a transferor transfers property to another person with a reduction in the price of the property because the other person grants a lease for a term of years back to the transferor, section 70(2) will apply. • Where a transferor transfers property to another person with a reduction in the price of the property because the other person grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor, section 70(2) will apply. It is not possible for a transferor to grant himself or herself a licence to occupy. A transferor who purports to do so, and reduces the price of the property in reli- ance on such a grant, is either subject to section 70(2) if the transferee grants the licence to occupy back to the transferor, or subject to gift duty more generally if the transferee has no obligation to grant the licence back, yet still only pays the reduced price for the property. Sliding value clauses Frequently, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commis- sioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. The Commis- sioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Valuation of retained interests Section 66 requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift, and section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued. When valuing the amount attributable to the interest the transferor has kept, the transferor may use an actuary, valuer, or the Tables in the Second Schedule. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or lease for lives, the value of the right should take account of the longest remain- ing life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. This ruling is signed by me on the 23rd day of January 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/1 Different treatment of similar transac- tions under section 70(2) • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to himself or herself, and later sells the remainder or reversion to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants himself or herself a life estate or a lease for life, and then disposes of the remainder of his or her interest to another person. As the life estate or lease for life is, in law, a distinct item of property separate from the remainder, gift duty is concerned with the remainder which was transferred, not the life estate or lease for life which the transferor kept throughout; but • Where a transferor transfers property to another person free of encumbrances, subject to the other person granting an interest back to the transferor, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her for the purposes of section 70(2). Accordingly, the sale of a fee simple to another person conditional on the other person granting a life estate, lease, or licence to occupy to the transferor, is a reservation by the transferor of that life estate, lease, or licence to occupy. The transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of any dutiable gift, because of section 70(2). Included in the first category above is the case where the transferor keeps an interest and simultaneously grants the remainder to the transferee. The interest kept by the transferor will not be a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) as long as the transferor is owner of the interest kept by him or her at all times during the transfers. (That is, the transferee does not at any time take ownership of the interest kept by the transferor.) Support for this comes from the decision in Ingram v IRC \[1995\] BTC 8,010 discussed below. It is important to distinguish between a grant of a lease and the grant of a licence to occupy. A licence to occupy This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 unless otherwise stated. Summary Section 70(2) prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. Those benefits or advantages are not taken into account when determining whether there was a gift in the first place. Section 70(2) only applies where there is a dutiable gift (a disposition of property for an inadequate considera- tion). To determine whether there has been a dutiable gift, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, or does the transferor transfer all of the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor? • Identify the value of the property sold to the trans- feree. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (excluding the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the section 2(2) defini- tion of “gift” is triggered, and assuming the require- ments of section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. Because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, the first of the three steps is for that reason very important, and can lead to quite different treatment of apparently similar transactions. This analysis particularly focuses on that first step. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) 4. Transferor transfers the property to another person, subject to the other person granting him or her a lease for a term of years, which the other person does. 5. Transferor transfers the property to another person, subject to the other person granting him or her a licence to occupy, which the other person does. The gift duty implications of these structures are discussed below. Legislation Gift duty is imposed by part IV of the Act. Some of the key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes- ... Therefore, for there to be a gift there must be a disposi- tion of property without fully adequate consideration. There is a gift only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68 and 69. Section 70 states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether- (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or can only be granted by one person to another. A transferor can not grant himself or herself a licence to occupy, and must receive the grant of such a licence from another person, such as the trustees of a family trust. Therefore, licences to occupy will always amount to reservations for the purposes of section 70(2), as they cannot be separated and retained by a transferor prior to a transfer. It is also important to distinguish between a grant of a life estate and a licence to occupy. A transferor may grant himself or herself a life estate, but cannot grant himself or herself a licence to occupy (unless it amounts to a lease). “Licence to occupy” is often used as a cover- all term for the types of disposition discussed below. When considering gift duty it is the precise legal meaning of phrases such as “life estate”, “lease for life”, and “licence to occupy” that must be considered. Section 70(2) The concept underlying section 70(2) is that where there has been a gift, the value of the gift is not reduced by any advantage that the person making the gift might retain. So, for example, a person might gift her house and agree with the recipient that the equivalent of rent will be paid by the recipient to her until she dies. The transferor would then say that the value of the gift is not the value of the house - as the value of the house is offset by a substantial commitment to the transferor. The net value of the gift would then depend on how long the transferor could be expected to live and receive rent. However, section 70(2) requires that any benefit being reserved out of a gift in this way is disregarded for gift duty purposes. Accordingly, for gift duty purposes the value of the gift is simply the value of the house, and no account is taken of the commitment to pay the equivalent of rent. This analysis sets out the application of section 70(2) by referring to five arrangements. The application of section CE 1 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is the subject of public binding ruling BR Pub 96/2. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) apparently minor differences in arrangements can have major effects on the legal consequences. This analysis sets out the gift duty treatment of the following arrangements: 1. Transferor grants a life estate (including a lease for life) to himself or herself, and then transfers the remainder interest to another person. 2. Transferor grants a lease for a term of years to himself or herself, and then transfers the reversion interest to another person. 3. Transferor transfers the property to another person, subject to the other person granting him or her a life estate (including a lease for life), which the other person does. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;- but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment- (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition- (i)By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land com- prised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,- in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a x c b where- ais the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and bis the value of the original gift; and cis the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Link between section 70(2) and the definition of “Gift” The value of any benefit or advantage reserved by a transferor within section 70(2) is not consideration from the transferee for the disposition of property by the transferor. This means that when deciding whether there is a “gift” (a disposition of property at an under- value), the value of the reserved benefit or advantage is not part of the consideration given by the transferee. For example, if a transferor sold his or her fee simple estate to another person, subject to the other person granting a life interest back, the value of the life interest is not consideration from the transferee to the transferor. If this were not the case, and the transferee paid full value for the rest of the “gift”, section 70(2) would have no effect. Every reserved benefit or advantage would also be consideration from the transferee for the transferor’s disposition of property. There would be no disposition of property without fully adequate considera- tion, and therefore no gift. To avoid section 70(2) being ineffectual, there must be limits on the forms of consideration that are effective in the section 2(2) definition of a gift (see for example Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA)). In Finch the issue of a predecessor to section 70(2) being ineffectual was considered and rejected by the court in the following terms: (per Edwards J at page 532) For these reasons certain classes of monetary consideration are excluded by the statute in the determination of what is and what is not a gift for taxation purposes (per Chapman J at page 533) If a donor reserves to himself any benefit or advantage in the same or any other property gift duty has nevertheless to be paid without any deduction in respect of what is reserved, and great care has been used in drafting the Act to make this provision effective. This is also the view of Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed, 1978, Wellington, Butterworths): Section 70 is difficult to reconcile with the definition of “gift” in section 2. It appears to be framed on the assumption that when a disposition is made for inadequate consideration the dutiable value of the gift is ascertained by deducting the value of the inadequate consideration from the value of the disposi- tion. Thus section 70 prohibits the “deduction or allowance” of certain types of benefit “in calculating the value of a dutiable gift”. But the definition of “gift” does not provide for the deduction of an inadequate consideration from the “value” of a gift. Under the scheme of the definition a disposition is a gift only to the extent of the inadequacy of any consideration given for it. Consider the following example: continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) whole value of the land, arguing the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. In the words of Justice Denniston, at page 525: ...I think it is clear that the donor has retained nothing. He has created separate estates or interests in the land, each of which is as capable of being separately dealt with as would be separate parcels of the land itself. It might as reasonably be said that a conveyance of a part of the land would involve a retention of the remainder. Stout CJ and Chapman J also held that a benefit or advantage had to be reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. There are a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases that discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. In Nichols v IRC \[1975\] 2 All ER 120 (CA) the transferor sold his property to his son, on condition that the son leased the property back to the transferor, and that the son executed a covenant to repair. The son granted the lease and covenant as required. The Com- missioners assessed death duty on the property, claim- ing that the transferor had not been entirely excluded from the gift. The Court concluded (pages 126 to 127) that the sale of the fee simple, subject to the lease back, was a grant of the whole fee simple with something reserved out of it. It was not a gift of a partial interest with the transferor retaining various interests by holding them back from the disposition of property. Although obiter dicta, the Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL); and Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC). A number of cases have found that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children: the partnership farming the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commis- sioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (page 188 of the All ER Rep judgment): A gives B $100 in return for B’s promise to repay $75. This is not a gift of $100 from which $75 is deducted in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. There is merely a gift of $25, that being the inadequacy of the consideration. If a “benefit or advantage” within the meaning of section 70 constitutes a “consideration” for the purposes of the definition of “gift” it does not form part of the gift and section 70(2) does not apply to it. Since it appears that every “benefit or advantage” is also “consideration” it could be argued that section 70 has no effect. This possibility was adverted to by two of the judges in \[Finch\] (Edwards J at p532 and Stout CJ at p524). To give section 70 the effect obviously intended by the Legislature it must be taken as limiting the types of benefit or advantage that may constitute a “consideration” within the meaning of the definition of “gift”. This appears to have been the approach adopted in the cases: see for example \[Finch, 533\]. Difference between keeping an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage Section 70(2) applies where there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage. The cases discussed below estab- lish that: • If a transferor sells property free of encumbrances, for example a fee simple estate, subject to the transferee granting an interest back to the transferor, there is a reservation. • If a transferor transfers a property in which the transferor has an interest referable to a prior inde- pendent transaction, and after disposal the transferor still has an interest referable to that prior independent transaction, there is no reservation. In the Court of Appeal case, Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Justice Richardson stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision relating to estate duty), at page 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on the predecessor to section 70(2), Chapman J drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. In Finch the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (½ share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, then the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and...the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not...a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This is consistent with Finch; Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Where the transferor keeps an interest and simultane- ously transfers an interest to the transferee, there will not be a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) as long as the transferor is owner of the interest kept by him or her at all times during the transfers. (That is, the transferee does not at any time take ownership of the interest kept by the transferor.) This is supported by the decision in Ingram. The transferor’s interest was acquired by her simultaneously with the interests granted to the transferee. In finding that there was no reservation the court said: Unless it could be said that there had been a period or point of time at which the trustees and beneficiaries had had a more extensive interest out of which the leasehold interests had been carved, the subject matter of the gift made by Lady Ingram was the property shorn of those leasehold inter- ests. \[Emphasis added.\] In summary, an interest that the transferor grants to himself or herself (before gifting the remainder or reversion) does not amount to a reservation, whereas an interest that the transferor gives will be a reservation if he or she later receives a grant back of that interest. There will be a reservation even where the original gift is conditional on the interest being granted back. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Distinguishing leases from licences, and life estates from licences A practical issue is whether the arrangement employed involves a lease or a licence. If it is a lease, a transferor can grant it to himself or herself. However, if it is merely a licence, the transferor cannot grant it to himself or herself, and must receive a grant back from another person. It is not easy to distinguish the two. However, the gift duty treatment of the arrangements discussed below varies considerably depending on the precise method used. It is important for precise lan- guage to be used. The term “licence to occupy” is not a catch-all term for life estates and leases. Instead, a “licence to occupy” is merely a personal permission to occupy land. Many so-called “licences to occupy” may be leases (for life or otherwise), or life estates. A further issue from case law is whether the right granted by the transferor to himself or herself or by another person to the transferor is a life estate or a right of personal residence (a licence to occupy). Again this is important. If the grant is a grant of a life estate, the transferor can grant it to himself or herself. If the grant is a licence, the transferor cannot grant it to himself or herself, and must receive a grant back from another person. A line of cases establishes that a life estate is created by words showing an intention to do so; see for example Holden v Allen, Goodbehere & Allen (1903) 6 GLR 87, Holland v McKenzie \[1932\] NZLR 1153. If the words clearly grant less than a life estate, there will only be a licence to occupy, as in Re Edwards \[1950\] NZLR 516 and Re Denton \[1956\] NZLR 104. No requirement for the interest to be a legal interest With all the methods discussed below, when transferors keep or reserve an interest in the property they may keep or reserve an equitable or a legal interest. It is not necessary to keep or reserve a legal interest using the provisions of the Land Transfer Act 1952. 1. Transferor grants a life interest (including a lease for life) to himself or herself, and then transfers the remainder interest to another person This arrangement does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. If the separation of the life interest occurs before the sale to the other person, the subsequent sale is treated as the sale of one interest while keeping another. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly whether duty is payable, and if so how much, will be determined on the value of the remainder estate. The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to himself or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to himself or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to himself or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then sells the remainder interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The sale price for the remainder is $115,000. The sale price is outstand- ing as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A for gift duty on the $60,000 that the trust does not pay for the property. The trust gave full value for the remainder interest by agreeing to pay A the $115,000. Accord- ingly, there is no question of gift duty on the $115,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to the trustees. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) There is no legal impediment to a transferor granting property to another person, and the other person granting a life estate, lease, or licence to occupy back to the transferor. When the other person receives the unencumbered fee simple, that person has the power to grant an interest of a life estate, a lease for life, or a licence to occupy back to the transferor. The formalities of any lease or life estate in such circumstances are discussed above under methods one and two. It is clear from case law (Earl Grey, Nichols, Oakes) that these arrangements involve reservations from the disposition of property, notwithstanding that the transferor’s original sale may be conditional on the grant back of a particular interest. Example 3 D has decided to sell her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life. She sells the property to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the sale is that the trustees grant D a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The property has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The sale price of the property is $150,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The Commissioner will assess D for gift duty. Section 70(2) applies to deny a deduction (for the value of the licence to occupy) from the value of the gift. Therefore, the property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 c.f. $200,000). There is a gift, and gift duty will be charged taking into account the normal exemptions. The Commissioner would still assess D for gift duty if, instead of using a licence to occupy, she had requested and received a life estate or a lease for life or a lease for a term of years. Transferor purports to grant a licence to occupy to himself or herself, and then transfers the remainder interest to another person It is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to himself or herself. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton-Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906, a licence is an authority that prevents the grantee from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Without comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a land owner cannot licence himself or herself to be a licensee. Accordingly, a transferor who purports to grant himself or herself a licence to occupy is treated in either of the following ways: 2. Transferor grants lease for a term of years to himself or herself, and then transfers the reversion interest to another person This arrangement does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. If the transferor’s separation of the lease occurs before the sale of the reversion to the other person, the transaction is treated as the sale of one interest with no reservation of the other. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly whether duty is payable, and if so how much, will be determined on the value of the remainder estate. A transferor can grant a lease to himself or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to himself or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property there was merger of the interests, and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Clearly, when a person creates a lease and grants it to himself or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her favour over her property, and simultaneously sells the reversion interest to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The sale price for the reversion is $150,000. The sale price is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. The Commissioner will not assess B for gift duty on the $100,000 that C does not pay for the property. C gave full value for the reversion interest by agreeing to pay B the $150,000. Accordingly, there is no question of gift duty on the $150,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. 3, 4, and 5. Transferor transfers the property to another person, subject to the other person grant- ing him or her an interest (life estate, lease, or licence to occupy), which the other person does Section 70(2) will apply if there is a dutiable gift. The value of the property sold will include the value of the reserved interest. If the other person only pays for the remainder interest (that is, the value of the fee simple less the value of the life estate, lease or licence) there will not be fully adequate consideration. (As discussed above, the value of the life estate, lease, or licence is not treated as consideration for the sale of property.) There will be a dutiable gift. Section 70(2) will apply and deny a deduction for the value of the benefit or advantage reserved to the transferor. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) • Where the transferor deducts an amount from the value of the property disposed of, but the transferee has no obligation to grant a licence back, the transferor is liable to gift duty as the property is transferred to the other person for less than fully adequate consideration. • Where the transferor deducts an amount from the value of the property disposed of, and the transferee has an obligation to grant a licence back, the treat- ment discussed above for cases 3, 4, and 5 applies and section 70(2) is invoked. Example 4 E purports to grant to himself a licence to occupy over a property, and purports to sell the remainder interest to his three children. There is no obligation expressed in the documents for the children to grant a licence back to C. C’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the licence to occupy is estimated to be $60,000. The sale price for the remainder is $115,000. The sale price is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the children to C. The Commissioner will assess C for gift duty on the $60,000 that the children do not pay for the prop- erty. It is not possible for C to grant himself a licence to occupy. Therefore, C is selling the children the fee simple of the property. The children only pay C $115,000 for a property worth $175,000. Accordingly, there is gift duty on the $60,000. If C gets a licence to occupy from the children, Example 3 above sets out the gift duty treatment and the application of section 70(2) to such a grant to C. Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. The Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, that gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift, and section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued. Under sections 68 and 69, when valuing the amount attributable to the interest the transferor has kept, the transferor may use an actuary, valuer, or the Tables in the Second Schedule. (The Commissioner may review use of the Tables in the future. If so, any new method will have application only from the date of publication of any change in policy.) When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or lease for lives, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupa- tion until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the reservation or benefit or any part of it is subject to an amount calculated using the formula given in section 76. The section 76 formula is: a x c b where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 5 Assume original gift valued at: Inadequacy $12,000 Reservation$30,000 $42,000 Gift duty on $42,000 = $1,050 Proportion borne = $30,000 x $1,050 = $750 by reservation$42,000 Therefore, the limit of allowances under section 76 is $750. If there is a subsequent gift of the reserva- tion of $30,000 the treatment is as follows. Gift duty on $30,000 is $150. The allowance calculated above is $750. Accordingly, the duty payable is nil. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Dispositions where the transferor reserves a benefit or advantage in real property - income tax implications Public ruling - BR Pub 96/2 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections CE 1 (1)(e), EB 1 (1), EB 2, and OB 1 (definition of “lease” and “leasehold estate”) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a taxpayer (transferor) disposes of real property and another taxpayer (transferee) receives the property either subject to an interest still held by the transferor or subject to an obligation to grant an interest back to the transferor. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. The ruling Section CE 1 (1)(e) includes within a person’s assessable income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • Any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • The grant of a right to take profits from the land. Where a transferor grants an interest in property to himself or herself, and later grants the remainder or reversion to another person (including the trustees of a trust), the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute assessable income under section CE 1 (1)(e). Where a transferor grants a property interest to another person, subject to the transferee granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee may have assessable income under section CE 1 (1)(e). The transferee will have assessable income where: • The transferee is indebted to the transferor and the value of the interest granted by the transferee is deducted from that indebtedness; or • The price the transferee pays for the property is reduced by netting off from the market value of the property the value of the obligation to grant an inter- est to the transferor; or • The transferor otherwise pays the transferee for the grant. The assessable income will be equal to the reduction in indebtedness, the reduc- tion in price, or the amount otherwise paid. If the value of interest granted by the transferee is not paid for, or is not used to reduce the price the transferee pays or the transferee’s indebtedness, the trans- feree does not have assessable income from the grant. Where a transferor grants a property interest to another person, and the trans- feree grants a freehold interest to the transferor, such as a life estate or lease for 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) life, section CE 1 (1)(e) does not apply. A freehold interest does not come within section CE 1 (1)(e)’s requirement that there be a lease, licence, easement, or profit. This ruling is signed by me on the 23rd day of January 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/2 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background This analysis sets out the application of section CE 1 (1)(e) when a taxpayer disposes of real property and keeps or reserves interests in that property. The gift duty implications of such transactions are the subject of public binding ruling BR Pub 96/1. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 CE 165 EB 175 EB 280 OB 12 Under section CE 1 (1)(e), a person’s assessable income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. Application of legislation Section CE 1 (1)(e) deems a person’s assessable income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • Any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • The grant of a right to take profits from the land. No income tax implications where an interest is kept Where the transferor effectively keeps an interest in land prior to a disposition of the remainder to another person, section CE 1 (1)(e) does not apply. The owner of land (the transferor) has not derived a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profit; instead the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. The transferee has also derived no income as he or she never owned the interest that the transferor kept. A transferor can grant himself or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the remainder or reversion to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to himself or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the remainder interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The sale price for the remainder is $175,000 less the $60,000. The sale price is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A for income tax under section CE 1 (1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the life estate. Section CE 1 (1)(e) has no applica- tion when a property owner keeps some part of his or her own property. Income tax implications when an interest is reserved Where the transferor reserves an interest by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1 (1)(e) generally applies. There are three parts to section CE 1 (1)(e): • There must be either a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease, licence, easement, or profit. When the transferee is granting an interest to a transferor, the transferee is the land owner. Accord- ingly, it is the transferee who is at risk of being subject to income tax. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) or behalf. A reduction of indebtedness is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. An- other example, is a netting off of obligations. Income derived from lease, licence, easement, or profit Where the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence to occupy, and there is a sum attributable to that grant, the grant satisfies the requirement that the income is derived from any lease, licence, easement, or profit. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the sum attribut- able to the grant. Example 2 B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life. She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the sale is that the trustees grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The sale price of the house is $200,000, which is reduced by $50,000 to $150,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $150,000 is left owing by D as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has assessable income under section CE 1 (1)(e) for the value of the licence to occupy. However, where the lease is a lease for life, the trans- feree is not subject to income tax. Section OB 1 defines “lease” as any disposition by which a leasehold estate is created. “Leasehold estate” is also defined in section OB 1: it does not include a freehold estate. As a lease for life is a freehold estate, it is not a “lease” for the pur- poses of section CE 1 (1)(e). Where the transferee grants a life estate to the transferor, the grant is not a lease, licence, easement, or profit. Instead, it is a grant of a freehold estate in land. Accordingly, the transferee is not subject to income tax. Example 3 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives. They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the sale is that the trustees grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The sale price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have assessable income under section CE 1 (1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or profit. Income that is “premiums or other revenues” For section CE 1 (1)(e) to apply there must be income from granting an interest back to the transferor. Where a grant back to the transferor is for no consideration section CE 1 (1)(e) will not apply (there may, however, be a gift duty effect). Where: • The transferee is indebted to the transferor and the value of the interest granted by the transferee is deducted from that indebtedness; or • The price the transferee pays for the property is reduced by netting off from the market value of the property the value of the obligation to grant an interest to the transferor; or • The transferor otherwise pays the transferee for the grant, the transferee may have assessable income if the other requirements (discussed below) of section CE 1 (1)(e) are met. The assessable income will be equal to the reduction in indebtedness, the reduction in price, or the amount otherwise paid. Under section CE 1 (1)(e), the value attributed to the interest granted by the transferee to the transferor is either a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. A payment for the grant of a licence to occupy, or a lease, is included within the term “premiums, or other rev- enues”. The Court of Appeal in Romanos Motels Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435 found that an amount paid for goodwill and a lease of a motel was included within the term “premiums, or other rev- enues”, notwithstanding that such a sum would nor- mally be considered a capital sum. In Capel v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,195 the High Court found that a goodwill payment was a capital sum, yet the payment was still assessable under the then equivalent to section CE 1 (1)(e). A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. Derivation of premiums or other revenues The premium or other revenue is “derived” by the transferee (the land owner). Where there is a grant to the transferor of the licence to occupy or lease, this results in a reduction of the debt owing by the transferee to the transferor. The reduction comes about because the licence to occupy or lease has value to the transferor and the transferee, and the amount the transferor should pay for the licence or lease is credited against the debt owing to the transferor. The reduction is an amount equal to the value of the interest granted to the owner. Although the transferee does not actually receive an amount of cash from the transferor, he or she does derive the income. Under section EB 1 (1), a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) If the lease is not a lease for life, section CE 1 (1)(e) will apply in the same way as would occur with the grant of a licence, see example 2 above. Spreading of income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1 (1)(e), section EB 2 (1) allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years. Bad debts - writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes Public ruling - BR Pub 96/3 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section DJ 1 (a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 26(1)(c) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies when a person claims to have written off a debt (or part of a debt) as a bad debt and seeks an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax for the debt (or part thereof). The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to income tax deductions and deductions from GST output tax claimed in the period 1 March 1996 to 28 February 1999. The ruling A debt (or part of a debt) must be both bad and written off before any person can claim an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax (assum- ing that other legislative requirements in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Income Tax Act 1994 are also satisfied). Debt must be “bad” Whether or not a debt (or part of a debt) is bad is a question to be determined objectively rather than a question to be determined by the subjective opinion of any particular individual. The objective test that any person should ask himself or herself in deciding whether or not a debt is bad, is whether the facts would indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probabilities, it is unlikely that the debt will be paid. If the facts indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probabilities, it is unlikely that the debt will be paid, then the debt is bad at that point in time. The debt may then be written off. Events following the writing-off may result in additional information which could indicate that a debt (or part of a debt) previously written off as bad is no longer bad. However, this does not mean that the debt was not bad at the time of the writing-off, and does not require any change to the income tax return or GST return in which the bad debt deduction was claimed. Of course, any recovery of any part of the debt previously claimed as a bad debt deduction must be returned in the period recovered. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) At the time of deciding whether a debt is bad, a person will need to have suffi- cient information to enable a reasonable and prudent business person to form the view that it is unlikely that the debt will be paid. The facts that need to be gathered depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. While no factor is decisive in itself, factors that are likely to be relevant in most cases are: • The length of time a debt is outstanding - the longer a debt is outstanding, the more likely it is that a reasonable and prudent business person would con- sider the debt to be bad. • The efforts that a taxpayer has taken to collect a debt - the greater the extent to which a person has tried (unsuccessfully) to collect a debt, the more likely it is that a reasonable and prudent person would consider the debt to be bad. • Other information obtained by a creditor - a creditor may have obtained particular information about a debtor, e.g. through business or personal networks, that would be a factor in leading a reasonable and prudent busi- ness person to conclude that a debt is bad. For example, a creditor may know that the debtor is in financial difficulties and has defaulted on debts owed to other creditors. A debtor does not need to be insolvent for a debt to be bad (although this will often be the case). A debt may still be bad even though a person is taking action to recover the debt. Recovery action may be taken for a number of reasons, even though a reasonable and prudent business person would think it unlikely that the debt will be recovered. A person cannot make a deduction by way of a provision for doubtful debts (being an estimate of the amount of debts that will become bad in the future). Bad debts are individually identifiable debts rather than a general provision. Debt must be “written off” A bad debt must be written off by authorised persons in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by a taxpayer. In all cases the records kept by a taxpayer must comply with the record keeping require- ments contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. In cases where a taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger, the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. An entry in a general ledger recognising the debt as bad does not also have to be made for the debt to be written off for income tax and GST purposes. In cases where debtors ledgers are not maintained, action must be taken that shows that the business accounting system treats the debt as bad. Particular examples where the Commissioner accepts that a debt has been written off are: • Where a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices issued; plac- ing the invoice in a “bad debts” file indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad is sufficient. • If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices and copies of statements of account issued from a duplicate account book, marking the copy of the final statement sent out “bad debt” (indicating the amount of the debt that is bad) is sufficient. Alternatively, it would also be sufficient for the taxpayer to place the relevant invoice in a “bad debts” file indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Merely claiming a deduction from output tax in a GST return does not amount to the writing-off of a bad debt. In all cases, the taxpayer must cease to recognise the debt as an asset for ac- counting purposes. There is no requirement that a debt must be written off and claimed as a bad debt deduction in the income year or GST taxable period in which the debt becomes bad. However, when a bad debt deduction is claimed, the necessary accounting entries must physically have been made, or necessary action taken as the case may be, before the end of the income year or GST taxable period in which the bad debt is claimed. Writing-off cannot be backdated. This ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of January 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/3 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are cited as references to the GST Act. All other legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allow deductions for bad debts for taxpayers and/or registered persons if certain criteria are met. Criteria common to both Acts are the requirements that a debt must be both bad and written off before any deduction can be made. The ruling sets out the test to apply when deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is a sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt. Legislation - Income Tax Act 1994 Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 7104 CE 1 (1)(d)65(2)(jc) DJ 1 (a)106(1)(b) EH 164C EH 3 (3)64D(3) EH 464F EH 564G EH 664I OB 12 OD 78 In calculating the assessable income derived by any person, section BB 7 allows a deduction, except as otherwise provided in the Act, for any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any year or is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any year. However, notwithstanding section BB 7, section DJ 1 (a) prohibits the deduction of bad debts, except when and to the extent that a number of criteria are satisfied. Section DJ 1 (a)(iii) sets out one of these criteria, namely that the debt must be proved, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. Other section DJ 1 (a) criteria (in summary form) that must also be satisfied are: •If the debt is an amount owing in respect of a financial arrangement and the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer for the financial arrangement, the deduction must be permitted under section EH 5 (see below); and •If the debt is not an amount owing in respect of a financial arrangement where the accruals rules apply, the bad debt must not be a loss of capital subject to section BB 8 (a); and •Where: -The taxpayer is a company; and -The debt is owed by a company (“the debtor”); and -The amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a loss (“the resultant loss”) incurred by the debtor or any other com- pany funded (directly or indirectly) by the debtor; and -Any one or more amounts have been allowed under section IG 2 or section 191A of the Income Tax Act 1976 as a deduction to the taxpayer (or to any other company which is at any time in the continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) •The person carries on a business which comprises holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and the person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off (see section OD 7 for test of association); or •The financial arrangement is a trade credit and the person carries on the business of dealing in the goods or services for which the trade credit is a debt. “Trade credit” is defined in section OB 1 to mean any debt for goods and services, other than a short term trade credit. Security payments Under section EH 5 (3), when a person receives a security payment for a loss and a deduction is not otherwise allowable for the loss, the person is permitted a deduction for the loss up to the amount of the security payment. Bad debts recovered Under section CE 1 (1)(d), amounts received on account of a bad debt for which a deduction has previously been allowed must be included as items of assessable income. Legislation - Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 26 of the GST Act is the main provision applying to bad debts for GST purposes. Section 26 applies to registered persons who account for GST on an invoice or hybrid basis. It also applies to registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis when the relevant supply is by way of a hire purchase sale or a door to door sale. Section 26 allows a registered person to make a deduc- tion from output tax for that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to a supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply. To claim the deduction, the registered person must satisfy a number of criteria. Section 26(1)(c) sets out one of these criteria, namely that the registered person must have written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The other criteria (in summary form) that must also be satisfied are that the registered person must have: •Made a taxable supply for consideration in money (from which the bad debt arose); and •Furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable, and properly accounted for the output tax on the supply. A proviso is effective if goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement to which the Hire Purchase Act 1971 applies. In this case the registered person makes a deduction from output tax of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. income year in which the resultant loss is incurred in the same group of companies as the taxpayer), in any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1993 and preceding the income year in which the bad debt is written off, in respect of the resultant loss, - the loss must exceed the aggregate of the amounts so allowed as a deduction. Section EH 5 Section EH 5 deals with amounts written off as bad debts in respect of financial arrangements. The main type of arrangement, in relation to bad debts, that is excluded from the definition of “financial arrangement” in section OB 1, is a short term trade credit. This is not a financial arrangement because it is an “excepted financial arrangement” (see paragraph (d) of the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” in section OB 1). “Short term trade credit” is defined in section OB 1 as: ...any debt for goods or services where payment is required by the vendor within 63 days after the supply of the goods or services: Arrangements entered into before the introduction of the accruals rules are also excluded from the definition of “financial arrangement”. Revenue bad debts Section EH 5 (1) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement. Section EH 5 (1) will only apply in limited circumstances to a cash basis holder. This is because section EH 5 (1) only applies when and to the extent that: •A person derives income in respect of the financial arrangement under: -Section EH 1 - one of the methods of calculating accrual income; or -Section EH 3 (3) - the adjustment required in any year when a person ceases to be a cash basis holder; or -Section EH 4 - the base price adjustment calcu- lated in the year a financial arrangement matures or is transferred; or -Section EH 6 - the post facto adjustment for financial arrangements which have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the accrual regime; and •The amount written off is attributable to that in- come. Capital bad debts Section EH 5 (2) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangement in certain circumstances. Section EH 5 (2) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 5 (1)) when: from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) There is also a special provision for registered persons who supply contracts of insurance relating to earth- quakes, wars, and fires (see section 26(1A)). Bad debts recovered Under section 26(2), when any amount for which a deduction from output tax has properly been made is wholly or partly recovered, output tax must be returned on that amount (to the extent of the recovery) in the taxable period in which it is wholly or partly recovered. Application of legislation - Debt must be “bad” A debt must be “bad” before it can be written off and before any deduction can be claimed for that debt. The question of whether a debt is bad is a question of fact. In evaluating the facts, the Commissioner will apply an objective test. The objective test that will be applied is whether the facts would indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of prob- abilities, it is unlikely that the debt will be paid. This objective test was outlined by Barber DJ in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541 on page 3,548: Naturally, the debts in question must be “bad” to be written off as bad in terms of s. 106(1)(b). This is a question of fact. Generally, an application of that criterion will not be difficult as the debtor will be insolvent. However, the debtor does not need to be insolvent for the debt to be bad. It is only necessary that there be a bona fide assessment that the debtor is unlikely to make payment of the debt. If there is a clear understanding or arrangement that there be long term credit, and if the taxpayer believes that the terms of the credit will be met, then the debt cannot be treated as bad because it is merely a situation of deferred payment. In my view, as well as the need for the writing off to be made bona fide, the circumstances must indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered. This is an objective test. The creditor taxpayer may, of course still hope for recovery and is quite entitled to institute recovery procedures. It is not necessary to have taken recovery or legal steps. ... It does not follow from the taxpayer hoping for or seeking recovery that a debt is not bad. However, usually, when a debt is assessed as bad, in terms of the type of criteria I have outlined, hopes or efforts of recovery will be futile. The test was cited with approval by Justice Doogue in the High Court decision of Graham v CIR, Edwards Graham Ltd & Edwards v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107, 12,111. A similar test to that outlined by Barber DJ was outlined by Justice Tompkins in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263, 12,269: The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. It, therefore, should be given its normal commercial meaning. It is a question of fact to be determined objectively. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by someone else either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise. Taxpayer’s opinion A debt is a bad debt if a reasonable and prudent busi- ness person would think that the debt is bad. A taxpayer in business is, in all likelihood, a reasonable and prudent business person. In most instances, the taxpay- er’s opinion will suffice. However, the Commissioner also recognises that taxpayers have a financial interest in claiming that a debt is bad. Writing off a debt as bad entitles a taxpayer to: •A deduction in calculating income for income tax purposes, worth up to 33 percent of the debt: •A GST deduction from output tax of the tax fraction of the debt. Because of this, the Commissioner may inquire into the decision to treat a debt as bad in the course of tax audits. Taxpayers may, therefore, wish to document and retain evidence in relation to their decisions to treat debts as bad to show that they made reasonable decisions. Documentation may include noting down the informa- tion from which the decision was made that the debt was bad, and keeping copies of any correspondence relating to the debt. Information required The amount of information required to decide whether a debt is bad depends on the particular circumstances of each case. If the amount involved is small, a reasonable and prudent business person is likely to make limited enquiries and take limited recovery action. Particular knowledge or information obtained by a taxpayer may also reduce the need for enquiry. Recovery action A creditor is likely to have taken recovery action in most cases before a deduction for a bad debt is made. It is through taking recovery action that most creditors will form an opinion as to whether a debt is bad. While recovery action is being taken, a debt can only be considered bad to the extent that a reasonable and prudent business person would consider, on the balance of probabilities, it unlikely that the debt will be paid. In some instances, taking recovery action may carry with it the reasonable expectation of recovery of some part of the amount involved. However, this will not always be the case. The decision to take recovery action and the extent of that action will depend on the circum- stances surrounding any particular case. In some cases, the creditor may take only limited recovery action because enough information is held to form a reasonable view that the debt is bad. The amount of information needed depends on the circumstances. Conversely, the creditor may take recovery action even when a reasonable view has been formed that the debt is bad. There are a number of reasons why the creditor might take recovery action, even when it is believed that it is unlikely that the debt will be recovered. This may be the case, for example, when the creditor has a policy continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) assumed that the money is unlikely to be recovered. It is a bad debt. However, if the sum involved was larger, it may be reasonable to expect the dairy to make some further enquiry. Example 4 A solicitor has done work for Mr O and billed him for $1,700. The solicitor is on the Board of Trustees of the school attended by Mr O’s children. Further- more, several of the solicitor’s other clients and business associates deal with Mr O on a regular basis. The solicitor has sent out a number of reminder bills because the bill is four months overdue, but has had no response. Several of the solicitor’s friends and associates have mentioned that Mr O is in financial difficulty and has had one of his vehicles repossessed. The solicitor’s office clerk has noted that Mr O’s name has been cited in the Gazette several times over recent months in respect of Court action for unpaid debts. It is reasonable for the solicitor to characterise Mr O’s debt as a bad debt. Example 5 A debtor of Mr F is a company in liquidation. Mr F has given the liquidator notice of a debt of $10,000 owed for goods and services supplied. Mr F is an unsecured creditor. The liquidator has held a meeting of creditors. Mr F attended the meeting and received formal notice of the outcome of the meet- ing. The liquidator has stated that unsecured creditors will probably receive something between 45 and 50 cents in the dollar. It is reasonable for Mr F to assume that $5,500 of the total debt is bad. Mr F is entitled to write off that part of the debt that is bad and claim a deduc- tion for income tax and GST purposes. At a later date, Mr F receives a letter from the liquidator, who advises that the estimate of the likely recovery has been revised. It is now expected that unsecured creditors will be paid between 70 and 75 cents in the dollar. This does not affect the answer given above. Also, it has no effect on Mr F’s GST return or income tax return if Mr F has claimed a deduction for the bad debt. If at any stage Mr F receives payment of any part of the 55 cents in the dollar written off, Mr F must: • Include it as income in the income tax return for the year in which it is received (this will give rise to an income tax liability unless there are losses to offset against it, and may give rise to a provi- sional tax liability, depending on the taxpayer’s circumstances); and • Account for GST on the amount recovered in the same proportion as Mr F was allowed a deduction from output tax when the bad debt was written off. of pursuing debtors to a certain extent to discourage customers defaulting on debt. Provision for doubtful debts Persons in business who provide credit often find it prudent to make some provision for the likelihood that some of their debtors will not pay. This allowance is generally calculated by estimating a percentage on the basis of past history, and applying that percentage to the total amount of debts owed to the business at balance date. Bad debts are individually identifiable debts that are unlikely to be recovered (in practical terms). The provision for doubtful debts is an estimate of the amount that will become bad debts in the future. The Income Tax Act and the GST Act do not allow any deduction for provisions for doubtful debts. Debts which are partially bad In some cases there may be no reasonable expectation that the debt will be fully recovered, but there may be a reasonable expectation of partial recovery. In this case the part that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of recovering is a bad debt. Examples of when a debt is/is not bad Example 1 A supplier has supplied goods on credit to Mr B. Mr B owes the supplier $2,000 for the goods. The supplier knows that Mr B has left town, and that mail addressed to him is returned marked “Gone No Address”. In this case it is reasonable to assume that the debt will not be recovered. The money owed by Mr B is a bad debt. Example 2 C owes $100,000 to a company. The credit control- ler for the company has considered the likelihood of default on every loan currently owing to the com- pany. The credit controller has estimated the likelihood of default for C to be five percent and wants to know if the company can consider $5,000 of that loan (5% of the $100,000 owing) to be a bad debt. Making an estimate of the likelihood of default on debts is not sufficient for a debt (or a percentage thereof) to be bad. It is not reasonable to assume that the debt is bad. Example 3 A local dairy has supplied $10 worth of bread and cigarettes to Mrs D on credit. Mrs D used to call into the shop every other day, but has not called into the shop for eight weeks and the $10 is still owing. Given the small amount owing, it is reasonable for the dairy to make no further enquiries. On the basis of the information that the dairy has, it can be from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Application of legislation - Debt must be “written off” The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons deductions for bad debts written off. It is not enough that a debt is bad, the bad debt must also be written off. Writing off the bad debt is important because this will fix the time at which the deduction can be made. Note that there is no require- ment that a debt be written off in the year it becomes bad. As Justice Tompkins in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (supra) on page 12,271 stated: A debt is not normally deductible. It does not become a deductible debt if and when it becomes a bad debt. It becomes a deductible debt, if it has been incurred in the production of assessable income, when it is written off. It is the writing off that converts the debt into a deductible debt. It follows that the crucial time is the time of the writing off, not the time the debt becomes a bad debt. It also follows that the income year referred to in s 106(1)(b) is not the year the debt became bad. In my view, the income year referred to is the year during which the bad debt was “actually written off”. There is no provision in the Act that requires the bad debt to be written off in the year the debt became bad. Had that been the intention of the legislature, it would have said so ... Barber DJ in the Taxation Review Authority discussed the requirement to write off bad debts in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541. Barber DJ said on page 3,547: I consider it elementary that the writing off of a debt as bad requires something more than the mere recognition by the taxpayer, or one or more of its executives, that a debt is unlikely to be paid. It could be reasoned that only a decision of the taxpayer to write off a debt is needed, subject to the debt being bad. However, I consider that, in terms of sec 106(1)(b), book-keeping steps must also be taken to record that the debt has been written off. Desirably, the steps would comprise a directors’ resolution, if the taxpayer is a corporate, and appropriate book-keeping entries. However, it would be adequate for a responsible officer or executive of a corporate or business to merely make the appropriate book-keeping entries if he or she has that authority. An unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business would not, of course, have a directorate so that book entries by the trader or his or her manager will suffice. In my view, it is not possible to write off a debt as bad without the making of authorised journal entries in the books of account of the business. In all cases, taxpayers must be able to clearly show that a bad debt has been written off. In cases where debtors ledgers are maintained, the writing-off will be able to be clearly shown by the appropriate book-keeping entries having been made in the debtors ledger by authorised persons. In cases where debtors ledgers are not main- tained (generally where the business operations are small and the accounting systems unsophisticated), other action must be taken that shows that the business systems treat the debt as bad. In all cases the business records kept by the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 75 of the GST Act. The necessary writing-off must take place before the end of the income year or GST taxable period in which the bad debt deduction is claimed. Sometimes it may be difficult from a practical point of view to make all the necessary accounting entries before the end of the income year or GST taxable period. It is, therefore, important to review all debts before the end of an income year or GST taxable period to ensure that any bad debts can be deducted in that year or GST taxable period. Writing-off cannot be back dated. The writing- off must be in the income year or GST taxable period for which the bad debt is claimed. Accounts kept by taxpayers Most taxpayers in business keep double-entry accounts. If a person keeps double-entry accounting records, the bad debt must be struck out of the records on which the double-entry accounts are based. Generally, this means that the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. In cases where a taxpayer does not keep double-entry accounting records and/or does not keep a debtors ledger, the person must write the debt off according to the form of records used. This means that however the person records the debt owing, the record showing the amount owed by the bad debtor must illustrate that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of getting payment for the amount of the bad debt. For example, if the only record of debtors is a copy invoice book, it is acceptable to write across the copy invoice “BAD DEBT”, with the date and a brief note of the reason (e.g. “Bankruptcy notice in newspaper”). Keeping records for credit control or other purposes For a variety of reasons, a creditor may keep a separate record of bad debts written off. For example, the records may be necessary if the creditor should ever have the opportunity of collecting the debt in the future, or the creditor may want to keep a record of problem custom- ers to avoid future difficulties. As long as these records are quite separate from the accounting base records they will not affect the write- off. If the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. More than one set of accounts Some businesses have more than one set of accounts. For example, a company may prepare: • Financial accounts for financial reporting purposes to satisfy the requirements of the Companies Act 1955 or 1993; and • Management accounts as a basis for management decision-making and control. The sets of accounts may be prepared in quite different ways. For example, there are statutory requirements set continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Example 3 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is registered for GST. There is no indication on her underlying debtor records to show the status of the debt. She has claimed a deduction from output tax for the bad debt in her GST return for the taxable period ending 31 January 1996. That return was prepared in February 1996. The taxpayer is not entitled to the deduction from GST output tax. She is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the income year ending 31 March 1996. Claiming the deduction from output tax for GST purposes is not a sufficient writing-off of the bad debt. Example 4 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The taxpayer’s only records of debts owing to her are copies of invoices she has issued. She has placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file marked “BAD DEBTS” in February 1996. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the year ending 31 March 1996. Example 5 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. She wrote up the debtors ledger on 31 March 1995. The entries written up include a journal entry writing off a bad debt. The taxpayer’s accountant prepares her accounts in June 1995. In the course of preparing the accounts, the accountant makes a general ledger entry recognising the bad debt as a result of the debtors ledger entry made by the taxpayer on 31 March 1995. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1995. That is because the underlying accounting record of the debt was altered to recog- nise the bad debt on 31 March 1995. Example 6 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. Her only records of debts owing are copies of invoices issued. On 15 March 1995 she placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file marked “BAD DEBTS”. The amount of trade creditors in the taxpayer’s balance sheet as at 31 March 1996 includes the bad debt. The taxpayer’s profit and loss statement for the year ending 31 March 1996 includes as income the sale that has become a bad debt. The profit and loss statement does not recognise any expense for bad or doubtful debts. The taxpayer’s income tax return for the year ending 31 March 1996 includes the profit and loss statement and a “tax reconciliation statement” showing the difference between the accounting out in the Financial Reporting Act 1993 for preparing financial reports that are not required when preparing management accounts; and management accounts may be prepared on the basis of estimates for some elements in order to provide very quick reports. When the different sets of accounts rely on the same underlying debtor records, there is no problem. As long as the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. However, if the debt is still recognised as an asset in the underlying records, it is not written off. If the different sets of accounts rely on different underly- ing debtor records (which is very rare), the creditor should refer to the accounts that are relied on to repre- sent the firm’s financial position. For a company, these will be the accounts that are used to satisfy the compa- ny’s financial reporting obligations under the relevant Companies Act. Examples of when a bad debt is/is not written off These examples do not form part of the ruling. General facts The following facts apply to all the examples: • The taxpayer’s income tax balance date is 31 March. • The only question relates to whether a debt has been written off. All other criteria are satisfied. • The debt is for goods and services supplied for money. • The supply has been included in the taxpayer’s assessable income for income tax purposes. In the examples where the taxpayer is registered for GST purposes, the following additional facts apply: • The taxpayer files GST returns on a two-monthly invoice basis. • The supply has been included in a GST return. Example 1 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 31 March 1995. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1995. Example 2 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 1 April 1995. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1996. from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) income and the amount she believes to be income for income tax purposes. The tax reconciliation statement includes a deduction for the bad debt. The taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt. Although the debt has been written off in the underlying accounting records, she has not ceased to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes. Example 7 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. His only records of debts owing are copies of invoices and statements issued. In February 1996 the taxpayer became aware that a debt was bad. He stopped sending out state- ments for the debt and took no other action on it. In particular, he sent out no statements on the account in February and March 1996. The taxpayer contin- ued to send out statements on all the other debts owing, including overdue accounts. The taxpayer keeps carbon copies of the statements of account in the duplicate account book from which the state- ments for issue are prepared. The taxpayer has tagged the final statement sent out in respect of the debt, marking it “bad debt”. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the year ending 31 March 1996. The cessation of statements of account, recorded by their absence in the duplicate account book, and the tagging of the final statement amounts to writing off the debt in his accounting system.

Background A ruling has been sought on the assessability of benefits and the deductibility of premiums under National Insurance Life & Health Limited’s Agreed Value Contract. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 465(2) BB 7104 BB 8 (c)106(1)(k) CB 5 (1)(h)61(40) Without in any way limiting the meaning of the term, section BB 4 deems a number of items to be assessable income unless expressly excluded by the Act. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Section BB 7 states that: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it- (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Section BB 8 provides that notwithstanding anything in section BB 7, no deduction (except as expressly pro- vided in the Act) can be made in respect of: (c) Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in gaining or producing income which is exempt from income tax: Section CB 5 (1)(h) exempts from tax: Income derived by any person, in respect of any period of incapacity for work, from any payment received by that person by way of a benefit under a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance, not being a payment calculated according to loss of earnings or profits: Agreed Value Contract (where no optional benefits are contracted for) Monthly Benefit A benefit received under a personal sickness or accident (“PSA”) policy is exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h), and premiums paid for a PSA policy are non-deductible under section BB 8 (c). A PSA policy is a policy that provides for payment of a sum or sums specified in the insurance policy and which is payable if the insured person is incapacitated as a result of an accident or sickness. National Insurance Life & Health Limited’s Monthly Benefit is specified in the Policy Summary and is not calculated according to loss of earnings or profits (“LOE”). Therefore, the Agreed Value Contract is a PSA policy of insurance. The benefits payable under the policy (the Monthly Benefit, Hospital Benefit, Recurrent Disability Benefit, and Inflation Protection Benefit) are PSA benefits. Partial Disability Benefit A LOE benefit is calculated with reference to income lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation. National Insurance Life & Health Limited’s Partial Disability Benefit is calculated with reference to the Insured Person’s pre-disability monthly income. The Partial Disability Benefit is calculated with reference to earnings or profits lost by the Insured Person. There- fore, the Partial Disability Benefit is a LOE benefit and is assessable income in the hands of the Insured Person under section BB 4. The premiums paid by the Insured Person for the Partial Disability Benefit will be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 7. Waiver of Premium Benefit The Commissioner’s policy Personal sickness or accident insurance policies and loss of earnings insurance policies (individual policies only) in TIB Volume Six, No. 4 (October 1994) states that an insurance policy may provide that premiums do not have to be paid during incapacity. The Commissioner’s policy is that this benefit does not have income tax consequences. It is simply a reduction of a private expense and does not give rise to income. Agreed Value Contract Optional Benefits Lump Sum Benefit The Lump Sum Benefit is the payment of the Monthly Benefit. As discussed above the Monthly Benefit is a PSA benefit. Therefore, the Lump Sum Benefit is a PSA benefit. Any benefit received by way of the Lump Sum Benefit will be exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h). The portion of premium paid for the Lump Sum Benefit will not be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 8 (c). Serious Care Benefit The Serious Care Benefit is the payment of the Monthly Benefit shown in the Policy Schedule. The Monthly Benefit shown in the Policy Schedule is a PSA benefit. Therefore, the Serious Care Benefit is a PSA benefit. Any benefit received by way of the Serious Care Benefit will be exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h). The portion of premium paid for the Serious Care Benefit will not be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 8 (c). Business Expenses Benefit The Business Expenses Benefit is paid where the Insured Person is unable to work in his or her usual occupation due to Illness. The Business Expenses Benefit is a monthly benefit paid in respect of Business Expenses, the proof of which or payment of which has been supplied to National Insurance Life & Health Limited to its satisfaction. The total amount of Business Expenses that National Insurance Life & Health Lim- ited will be liable for in any month will not exceed the amount specified in the Policy Schedule. Where the Agreed Value Contract is taken out by an individual and provides cover for that individual, the Business Expenses Benefit is derived in respect of a period of incapacity for work and the payment is not calculated according to loss of earnings or profits. Therefore, the Business Expenses Benefit is a PSA benefit which is exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h). The premiums paid for the Business Expense Benefit will not be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 8 (c). continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Redundancy Benefit National Insurance Life & Health Limited’s Redun- dancy Benefit is calculated with reference to the Insured Person’s pre-disability monthly income. The Redun- dancy Benefit is calculated with reference to earnings or profits lost by the Insured Person. Therefore, the Redundancy Benefit is a LOE benefit and is assessable income in the hands of the Insured Person under section BB 4. The premiums paid by the Insured Person for the Redundancy Benefit will be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 7.

Premium Payback Benefit The Premium Payback Benefit is not assessable income in the hands of the Insured Person under section BB 4. The Premium Payback Benefit is not income according to ordinary concepts and usages. Whether or not a particular receipt is income depends on its quality in the hands of the recipient (see Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 at 5,183).

Section BB 7 states that: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it- (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Section BB 8 provides that notwithstanding anything in section BB 7, no deduction (except as expressly pro- vided in the Act) can be made in respect of: (c) Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in gaining or producing income which is exempt from income tax: Section CB 5 (1)(h) exempts from tax: Income derived by any person, in respect of any period of incapacity for work, from any payment received by that person continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Where the Indemnity Value Contract is taken out by an individual and provides cover for that individual, the Business Expenses Benefit is derived in respect of a period of incapacity for work and the payment is not calculated according to loss of earnings or profits. To the extent that the benefit is income, the Business Expenses Benefit is a personal sickness or accident benefit which is exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h). The premiums paid for the Business Expenses Benefit will not be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 8 (c). Premium Payback Benefit The Premium Payback Benefit is not assessable income in the hands of the Insured Person under section BB 4. The Premium Payback Benefit is not income according to ordinary concepts and usages. Whether or not a particular receipt is income depends on its quality in the hands of the recipient (see Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 at 5,183). The Premium Payback Benefit does not have the character of income in the hands of the Insured Person. The portion of premium paid for the Premium Payback Benefit will not be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 7. Waiver of Premium Benefit The Commissioner’s policy on Personal sickness or accident insurance policies and loss of earnings insurance policies (individual policies only) in TIB Volume Six, No. 4 (October 1994) states that an insurance policy may provide that premiums do not have to be paid during incapacity. This benefit does not have income tax consequences. It is simply a reduction of a private expense and does not give rise to income, i.e., the benefit is not assessable income and the portion of premium paid for the Waiver of Premium Benefit is not deductible. by way of a benefit under a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance, not being a payment calculated according to loss of earnings or profits: Indemnity Value Contract Lump Sum Benefit Income received under a loss of earnings (“LOE”) policy is assessable and the premiums are deductible. LOE policies are policies which provide for benefits calculated with reference to income lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation. National Insurance Life & Health Limited’s Monthly Benefit is calculated with reference to earnings or profits lost by the Insured Person. Therefore, the Monthly Benefit is a LOE benefit. The Lump Sum Benefit is the payment of 100 times the Monthly Benefit. The Lump Sum Benefit indemnifies the Insured Person for loss of earnings or profits. The benefit is calculated with reference to the income lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation. Any benefit received by way of the Lump Sum Benefit will be assessable in the hands of the Insured Person under section BB 4. The portion of premium paid for the Lump Sum Benefit will be deductible from the income of the Insured Person under section BB 7. Business Expenses Benefit The Business Expenses Benefit is paid where the Insured Person is unable to work in his or her usual occupation due to illness. The Business Expenses Benefit is a monthly benefit paid in respect of Business Expenses, the proof of which or payment of which has been supplied to National Insurance Life & Health Limited to their satisfaction. The total amount of Business Expenses that National Insurance Life & Health Limited will be liable for in any month will not exceed the amount specified in the Policy Schedule. from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Policy statements This section of the TIB contains policy statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. Motor vehicle reimbursing rates This item reproduces an item that appeared in the February 1996 issue of “Tax Update”, the Employers’ Newsletter, and also contains additional information under the heading “Further comment”. Inland Revenue mileage rates In our July 1995 issue of “Tax Update” we introduced the new motor vehicle reimbursing rates that employers could use to reimburse employees for the work related use of private motor vehicles. These rates were to apply from 1 August 1995. However, in our September issue we told you that certain employers could delay using the rates until 1 April 1996. Since then we have received a number of comments and suggestions on the rates. After considering these and consulting various organisations we have agreed to amend them. They now include an interest component based on a loan at 50% of the average purchase price of a motor car, being the estimated amount borrowed for motor vehicle purchases. The term of the loan is for a period of three years at the FBT interest rate (currently 10.6%). The following rates will apply from 1 April 1996. Shareholder-employees and self-employed people can use these rates up to a maximum of 5,000 km of work related travel per year. Standard rates These rates are the Inland Revenue mileage rates introduced in August 1995 with the new interest component added. Motor vehicles annual work related kms 1 to 3,000 km62 cents per km (previously 56 cents) 3,001 km19 cents for each km over 3,000 and over(running costs - same as previously) Motor vehicles28 cents per km (previously 26 cents) - flat rate Motor cycles annual work related kms 1 to 3,000 km31 cents per km (previously 28 cents) 3,001 km10 cents for each km over 3,000 and over(running costs - same as previously) Motor cycles14.5 cents per km (previously 14 cents) - flat rate Flat rate formula The rates for motor cars are based on an average total running of 15,000 kilometres per annum (12,000 private running and 3,000 kms work related). The flat rate of 28 cents per kilometre has been calculated as follows: 3,000 kms x 62 cents =$1,860 12,000 kms x 19 cents =$2,280 $4,140 ÷ 15,000 kms = 27.6 cents Rounded to 28 cents per kilometre You can use average rates with this formula to suit your particular circumstances. That way you won’t have to keep accumulative records for each employee. Example A number of employees travel close to 10,000 work related kilometres per year on average. The flat rate their employer could use for all those employees would be: 3,000 kms x 62 cents =$1,860 7,000 kms x 19 cents =$1,330 $3,190 ÷ 10,000 kms = 31.9 cents Rounded to 32 cents per kilometre Individual special rates Many people felt that the standard rates did not ad- equately compensate those employees who used their vehicles almost exclusively for work purposes or who travel considerable distances each year. To take these continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Averaging You can calculate average individual special rates to suit groups of employees rather than calculate a special rate for each employee. The special rates can be differ- ent for separate groups of employees of the same employer. Example Office staff of an employer could be reimbursed using the standard rate. The sales staff could be reimbursed using a special rate calculated as in the above examples, but using the average annual travel of the salespersons instead of the individual annual kilometres. Employees can also be grouped according to the simi- larities of the work related distances they travel, e.g. rural and urban salespersons can have separate rates. Periodic changes to adjusted flat rates and special rates From time to time circumstances will change that will affect the reimbursement rates being made to employ- ees. These rates will be relatively simple to adjust as these changes occur. There will be some risk in making estimates at the beginning of each income year, but as the year progresses the kilometres travelled can be monitored and changes made as necessary. However, once a rate has been set for an individual or group, that rate can continue as long as there are no significant changes in expenditure or circumstances in which the vehicle(s) are used. Reimbursing actual expenditure Instead of using any of the three alternatives discussed above, an employee’s actual expenditure can be reim- bursed. If you do this you must make sure that both you and your employee keep accurate records, including details of private and work related expenditure to justify the reimbursements. If you want to know more about these rates contact your local Inland Revenue office. Further comment This is to clarify the paragraph in the item on periodic changes to any of the rates. Regardless of whether the employer uses the adjusted flat rates, the individual special rates, or reimburses using actual expenditure, we do not expect the employer to change those rates unless there are significant changes either in expenditure or in the circumstances under which the rates were set in the first instance. This will be especially so where the rate applies to a group of employees. We accept that some costs or expenditure in the initial years of car ownership reduce over a period of time, but these are offset by increases in other costs. For example, depreciation and interest charges decrease while repairs employees into account we have developed the indi- vidual special rate formula. This method allows fixed costs such as depreciation, interest, insurance, and registration to be better apportioned to work related travel. The data used to calculate the standard rates were split into the Automobile Association’s cc rating bands in order to calculate the individual special rate. The appropriate average fixed costs are divided by the total estimated annual travel (both work related and private) and the result is added to the running costs. As with the new rules on allowances which came into effect from 1 April 1995, you do not need our prior approval if you want to calculate reimbursement using the individual special rates. The fixed and running costs are as follows: Fixed costsRunning costs cc rating(total)(cents per km) Up to 1,300 cc$4,21416.7c 1,301 - 1,600 cc$4,50717.2c 1,601 - 2,000 cc$5,47519.1c over 2,000 cc$6,30822.2c The calculation of an individual special rate would be as follows. Example 1 An employee uses a 2,500 cc car, and travels on average 52,000 kms per annum for both work related and private running. Annual running: Fixed costs of $6,308 = 12.13 cents per km 52,000 km Plus running costs22.20 cents per km Individual special rate= 34.33 cents per km Rounded to 35 cents for each kilometre of work related travel. The advantage of using this method is that you only use the flat rate for work related travel. It also benefits those who use a vehicle almost exclusively for work purposes. Example 2 A pizza delivery driver uses his own 1,500 cc car entirely for the job. The only private running is from home to place of work which amounts to 1,000 km per year. He estimates that the work related travel will amount to 12,000 km for the year. The calculation of the individual special rate is: Annual running: Fixed costs of $4,507 = 34.66 cents per km 13,000 km Plus running costs17.02 cents per km Individual special rate= 51.68 cents per km The employee can be reimbursed at a rate of 52 cents for each work related kilometre. from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) and maintenance costs increase. Changes to these costs are not considered to be “significant” in the context of the above paragraph. Significant change could be the reduction in total annual distance travelled by an individual employee. For example, if a salesperson is promoted to sales manager and the travel for work related purposes reduces considerably. In this case we would expect the rates to be recalculated or the employee to move to the standard rate. Review of rates Inland Revenue intends to monitor motor vehicle rates on an annual basis, but we will publish changes to the rates only when there is a significant change in costs. It may well be that the rates announced in the February 1996 “Tax Update” will not be changed for a number of years. We do not expect to announce new rates every year. Vehicle logbooks - required content and quality Summary This item explains the required content and quality of logbooks kept to establish the business use of a motor vehicle. It is an expansion of the commentary in TIB Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994). Taxpayers who use a vehicle for both business and private purposes can keep a logbook to establish the proportion of business use. The logbook is generally kept for a 90 day test period every three years. Inland Revenue has noted that logbooks maintained by many taxpayers do not record the required details or are of poor quality. If a logbook does not record the required details or is of poor quality the Commissioner may ask for a new logbook to be kept. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Background Taxpayers who use a vehicle for business and private purposes usually record details of vehicle use in a logbook. The logbook establishes the proportion of business to private use. This proportion may be used for these purposes: • to apportion vehicle running costs and depreciation for income tax • to determine whether a vehicle is used principally in the making of taxable supplies for GST • to calculate private use adjustments for GST • in some cases, to determine the number of days each quarter the vehicle is available for private use and enjoyment for FBT purposes. Logbooks are maintained for a three month test period. The proportion of business use established during that test period is then applied for three years, the logbook application period. TIB Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) discusses these aspects of logbooks in more detail. Inland Revenue has noted that many taxpayers, al- though maintaining a logbook, do not record the required details. In addition many logbooks are illegible or incomplete. When reviewing a logbook the Commissioner must be satisfied that the business use proportion established by the logbook during the three month logbook test period is representative of the three year logbook application period. If the logbook is incomplete, illegible or does not record the required details the Commissioner cannot form such an opinion. In these circumstances the Commissioner has the discretion to either require another logbook to be maintained for another 90 day period; or to deem the taxpayer not to have maintained a logbook for the three year logbook application period. The effects of not maintaining an adequate logbook could include: • being required to maintain another logbook for three months • having income tax deductions for running costs and depreciation limited to 25% • having GST input tax claims for the purchase of motor vehicles disallowed or delayed for three months • having FBT assessed as if the vehicle was available for private use and enjoyment on every day. Minimum logbook requirements Section DH 3 (2) requires that a logbook meets these conditions: • It is kept for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days • It records complete and accurate details of the reasons for and the distance of journeys undertaken for business purposes, and such other details as required by the Commissioner. • It records the total distance travelled by the motor vehicle during the period the logbook is maintained. continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Alternatively logbooks can record all journeys (business and private), whether the journey was business or private and just record the starting or ending odometer reading for each journey rather than both. Example two at the end of this item is a partial logbook containing this information. Inland Revenue expects that most business journeys recorded in logbooks can be cross referenced to other records, such as diaries, appointment books, quotes, invoices etc. Cross references of this type allow Inland Revenue to verify logbook entries. Inland Revenue does not require that logbooks be kept in any particular format. The examples in this item use a columnar format, but the required details could be recorded in a diary, in a daybook, on quote or order forms etc. Whatever format is used Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the records are complete and accurate and that the required details have been kept. At the end of the 90 day logbook test period the following calculation should be performed to determine the business use percentage for the vehicle: business use = total business distance travelled percentagetotal distance travelled Inland Revenue expects the totals used in this calcula- tion to be easily reconciled with the entries in the logbook.

Inland Revenue requires that the following information be recorded in a logbook, in a legible and understandable format: • the start date of the 90 day logbook test period • the odometer reading at the start of the 90 day logbook test period • the date of each business journey • the starting odometer reading for each business journey • the ending odometer reading for each business journey • the origin and destination of each business journey • the reason for each business journey • the time of each business journey when the use of the vehicle is subject to time constraints (for example under a business hours (sometimes known as a nine to five) lease); • the end date of the 90 day log book test period • the odometer reading at the end of the 90 day logbook test period.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Hotel licensee’s licence application - deductibility Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in the production of assessable income: A hotel licensee has asked whether a tax deduction is available for an unsuccessful application for a special licence. The licensee regularly applies for special “one-off” licences. In the past, a deduc- tion has been allowed for the costs incurred in making successful applications. Section BB 7 allows a deduction for expenses incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. Members of the liquor trade are required to make more or less regular appearances before the Licensing Control Commission, with legal representa- tion, to apply for such things as special licences (such as a licence to trade on a specific Sunday or a late licence). As such costs are incurred in the course of business, the legal expenses that the licensee incurs are tax deductible, whether or not the Commission’s decision on the application is favourable. The above applies to an existing licence holder who incurs costs as part of the ongoing running of his or her business. The expenses incurred by a new entrant to the licensed trade for a new liquor licence are not tax deductible. Such costs are a capital expense, and a tax deduction is prohibited by section BB 8 (a) (sec- tion 106(1)(a), Income Tax Act 1976). Farm lease payments - deduction for cottage Section DD 1 (a) (section 106(1)(e), Income Tax Act 1976) - Certain deductions not permitted - rents: A full-time farmer leases the farm that he works from another party. The lease includes the use of a cottage which he uses as his resi- dence. He has asked if a tax deduction is available for the whole lease payment. Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) allows a general deduction for expenditure that is: • incurred in gaining or producing assessable income; or • necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Section DD 1 (a) states: Notwithstanding anything in section BB 7, in calculating the assessable income derived by any person from any source, no deduction shall, except as expressly provided in this Act, be made in respect of the following sums or matters: (a) Rent of any dwellinghouse or domestic offices, save that, so far as any such dwellinghouse or offices are used in the production of the assessable income, the Commissioner may allow a deduction of such proportion of the rent as the Commissioner may think just and reasonable. Therefore, the Act restricts any deduction for domestic rent to the proportion (if any) that relates to the production of assessable income. 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) This means that the farmer must first apportion the rent he pays between the farm and the cottage. The farm rent is completely deductible, but the cottage rent is only deductible to the extent that it relates to the production of assessable income. Rather than requiring a calculation to be made, the Commissioner’s policy is to allow full-time farmers a deduction of 25% of the outgoings associ- ated with a domestic dwelling that is situated on the farm property. This means that the farmer is able to claim a deduction of 25% of the rent that he pays for the farm cottage. Depreciation - application fee for special economic rate Section DJ 5 (section 165, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure relating to deter- mination of liability to tax: A taxpayer who was charged a fee by Inland Rev- enue when she applied for a special economic rate of depreciation has asked if the fee is a deductible expense. Section DJ 5 states: ... the Commissioner shall allow a deduction in respect of any expenditure incurred by the taxpayer during that income year in connection with - (a) The calculation or determination of the assessable income of the taxpayer for any income year. The expenses covered by this section include legal fees and accounting fees. Inland Revenue considers that the taxpayer’s costs associated with applying for a special rate of depreciation have been incurred in determining her assessable income. We therefore told her that the fee was a deductible expense. Stockyard roof - depreciation Section DO 4 (section 127, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure on land im- provements used for farming or agriculture: A farmer has added a roof, built of permanent materials, to a portion of her stockyards. She has asked how this additional item is dealt with for depreciation purposes. Under section DO 4, a taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for expenditure in- curred on land improvements used for farming or agriculture, except in the year the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of the land. The deduction is on a di- minishing value basis at a rate set out in Part A of Schedule 7 (Thirteenth Sched- ule, Income Tax Act 1976). Under Part A of Schedule 7, the cost of construction on the land of structures for shelter purposes is deducted at a rate of 10 percent on the diminished value. However, under section DO 4 (3), the percentage of diminished value is deter- mined according to the year in which the expense is incurred. If the expense is incurred before the end of the 1995 tax year, the percentage of diminished value is 125 percent of the rate shown in Part A of Schedule 7, i.e. 12.5 percent. If the expense is incurred in the 1995-96 tax year, the percentage of diminished value is 120 percent of the rate shown, i.e. 12 percent. The increased rates are applied to the diminished value each year unless the farm is sold. Depreciation on buildings and chattels rented short-term Section EG 1 (section 108, Income Tax Act 1976) - Annual depreciation deduc- tion: A company looks after properties for people who go overseas for short periods of up to two years. It manages its clients’ properties, collects rents, and continued on page 33 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) files tax returns. The company has asked whether making a claim for deprecia- tion is mandatory when the property is only let for a short period, and, if not, if there is any alternative to claiming depreciation. Individuals renting out a property for a short period may not necessarily be in the business of providing rental accommodation. This means that returning rental income, particularly when a loss results, must be considered in the context of whether or not a business exists, and will be based on the facts of each case. Under section EG 1 (1), when a taxpayer owns depreciable property, deprecia- tion must be deducted from the total income in that year. Depreciation reflects the reduction in value of the asset that is occurring as the asset is used. The Commissioner does not have a discretionary power to exempt any taxpayer from claiming depreciation. However, to reduce the compliance cost of claiming depreciation on each of a number of small assets, under section EG 3 (1)(c) (section 108B, Income Tax Act 1976), a taxpayer may elect to use the pool method of depreciation. Broadly, this allows assets acquired for not more than the “maximum pooling value”, i.e., $2,000 or a greater amount set by the Com- missioner under section EG 11 (6) (section 108J, Income Tax Act 1976), (such as the chattels in this case) to be pooled and depreciated as one asset. Although the person owning the property is absent from New Zealand, it is probable that he or she will remain a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. Before filing the client’s tax return, the company must establish the client’s tax residence. If the person remains a resident, the return will have to include not only rental income but that person’s world-wide income. Child’s boarding expenses - whether housekeeper rebate can be claimed Section KC 4 (section 54, Income Tax Act 1976) - Rebate in certain cases for housekeeper: A taxpayer has had to place his eight-year old daughter in a boarding school so that he can earn a living. He is aware that he cannot claim the school attendance fees against his income tax, but wonders if the boarding fees could be subject to the housekeeper rebate. The boarding fees can be readily identified from those charged for tuition. Section KC 4 allows a rebate in certain circumstances for payments made for child care and/or home help for disabled persons. The circumstances in which the section applies are contained in the housekeeper definition in that section. The term “housekeeper” for the purposes of the rebate when the care and con- trol of a child is involved means any of the following: • a person who exercises that care and control in the home of the taxpayer • a person who does so elsewhere, outside of the home • an institution as defined. “Institution” means: ... any creche, day nursery, play centre, kindergarten, or similar body; but does not, in relation to the care and control of a child who is 5 years of age or over, include any institution which is, in any way, concerned with the education of the child. “Child” means: ... any child who is under the age of 18 years, or who is suffering from any mental or physical infirmity or disability affecting his or her ability to earn his or her living. In this case, the taxpayer is not eligible for the housekeeper rebate because his daughter’s boarding school is not included in the definition of an “institution” which specifically excludes any institution concerned with the education of a child who is 5 years old or over. from page 33 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Family Support - determining “family income” when Child Support paid or received Section KD 1 (section 374B, Income Tax Act 1976) - Determination of assess- able income: A taxpayer who is a liable parent for Child Support purposes has asked whether the Child Support payments he is required to make can be taken into account and deducted when calculating “family income “ for Family Sup- port purposes. Briefly, the answer to this question is “yes”, Child Support payments made by a liable parent can be deducted when calculating the family income for Family Support purposes. Section KD 1 (1) states: ...Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, for the purposes of this Subpart, in calculating under this Act the assessable income derived or in ascertaining the loss incurred by any person in any income year- (a) Income of any of the kinds referred to in sections CB 1 (a), CB 1 (d), CB 5 (f), CB 9 (a), and CB 9 (d), derived by the person in the income year, shall be deemed not to be exempt from tax; and (b) A deduction shall be allowed of - (i) The amount of any payment, made by the person during the income year, of the kind referred to in section CB 9 (a); and ... Section CB 9 (a) (section 61(15), Income Tax Act 1976) exempts from tax income derived by a person in the form of payments from alimony, maintenance, child support, or spousal maintenance. Therefore, for the purposes of calculating any family support entitlement, any payments of child support made are deductible from the income derived by the person. Similarly any payments of child support received are included as income derived by the person. In this case, the taxpayer was advised that he should deduct the child support payments he has made from the family income when he calculates his family support entitlement. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Properties sold by High Court rating sale - GST Section 5(2) - Goods sold in satisfaction of a debt: A local authority has brought High Court proceedings in order to conduct rating sales for the recovery of rates arrears. Of the properties concerned, two are dwellings on sections and two are sections only. A council representative has asked for the GST implication of these auction sales. Under section 5(2) when goods are taken by a creditor and sold to satisfy the debts of the former owner, the goods are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity conducted by the former owner who is deemed to be a registered person. GST is therefore payable by any purchaser of the goods, unless one of the following has occurred: • The person whose goods were sold (the debtor) has provided the creditor with a statement, in writing, to the effect that the sale would not have been a taxable supply if the sale had been conducted by the debtor, with the reasons why that is the case. For example, the debtor is not registered for GST and the sale is that of a private dwelling. continued on page 36 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) • The person who seized the goods (the creditor) has not been able to obtain the written statement above, but has determined from “reasonable information held” that the supply of those goods would not have been a taxable supply. In the Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Volume One, No.8 (January 1990), Inland Revenue determined “reasonable information held” to be: • Details of the customer’s or borrower’s GST status obtained by the retailer or financier from the person at the time he or she entered into the hire purchase agreement or loan, and whether the goods used as security form part of a taxable activity if the customer or borrower was registered. In addition, the documentation should also contain a covenant requiring the customer or borrower to advise the retailer or financier of any change in registration for GST. • Information from the accountant, solicitor, neighbour of the person whose goods are sold, gained at the time of exercising the power of sale. We advised the council representative that if the council was satisfied that the sales would not be a taxable supply, it need take no further action regarding GST. However, if any sale were subject to GST, under section 17(1) the person selling the goods, i.e., the council, would be responsible for charging GST on the sale and accounting for it to Inland Revenue. To do this, the council would need to file a special GST return (GST 121 - Goods and Services Tax Return for Goods Sold in Satisfaction of Debt) and send it to Inland Revenue, along with the pay- ment, by the last working day of the month following the month in which the sale was made. A separate return must be furnished for each person whose property is sold. GST on supplies between flat-owning company and land owner Section 14 - Exempt supplies: A GST registered flat-owning company collects maintenance and administration levies from residents, and passes on a high proportion of them as rent to the land owner. The company accounts for GST on the levies collected, but cannot claim input tax deductions on the portion paid out as rent. The company’s representative considers this situation to be unfair and has asked if it is correct. A flat-owning company is a company whose only significant asset is a residen- tial property, and whose shareholders are entitled to use or occupy the property. Flat-owning companies receive income from subscriptions or levies imposed upon shareholders. This income is used to meet administration and manage- ment costs, as well as depreciation, repairs and maintenance, and other outgo- ings on the property. If the income from these subscriptions exceeds, or is likely to exceed, $30,000 in any twelve-month period, the flat-owning company must register for GST. In this case, a large proportion of the levies collected by the flat-owning com- pany is used to pay rent to the land owner. Section 14(ca) exempts from GST: The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land. As the rent is an exempt supply, no GST is charged by the land owner. There- fore, no input tax deduction is available to the flat-owning company. from page 35 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Non-resident company - whether liable to register for GST Section 51 - Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be regis- tered: An Australian company operates a mail order service in Australia and plans to extend its operations in New Zealand. The company director has asked if the company will be required to register for GST purposes. All packaging of the products will be completed in Australia, and the products will be mailed direct from Australia. Under section 51(1), a taxpayer is required to register for GST in either of the following situations: • if the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and the previous 11 months has exceeded $30,000 • if the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and the next 11 months is likely to exceed $30,000. For a non-resident supplier, the key issue is whether the goods or services are supplied in New Zealand. Section 8(2) deems that goods and services are supplied in New Zealand if the supplier is resident in New Zealand. Goods and services are deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand if the supplier is not resident in New Zealand. In some circumstances, supplies made by a non-resident are deemed to be made in New Zealand and subject to GST if either of the following conditions apply: • the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply • the services are physically performed in New Zealand by any person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Under section 8(2)(b), a supply by a non-resident to a GST registered person in New Zealand is deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand, as long as the supply was for the New Zealand resident’s taxable activity. Such a supply will not be liable for GST unless both the supplier and the recipient agree that the supply takes place in New Zealand. In this case, the Australian company is not required to register for GST as the company’s operations and services are physically performed outside New Zealand. 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We have given each case a rating as a reader guide to its potential importance. •••••Important decision ••••Interesting issues considered •••Application of existing law ••Routine •Limited interest We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported.

Transitional tax allowance (income under $9,880 rebate) - Education Officer’s entitlement Rating:• Case:TRA No. 94/158 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 50C (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections KC 3 and OB 1) Keywords:fulltime earner, remunerative work Summary:The Taxation Review Authority found as a fact that the taxpayer had been paid for at least 20 hours of work per week and was therefore entitled to a rebate under section 50C. Facts:The taxpayer was a member of the Student Executive at a tertiary institution, where he was employed as an Education Officer. The taxpayer sought to claim the transitional tax allowance under section 50C for the income years 1992 and 1993. The Commissioner disputed that the taxpayer was entitled to the rebate on the grounds that the taxpayer did not work more than 20 hours per week in the relevant period. The factual issue in the case was whether the objector was paid for 20 hours of work or more per week. Decision:Judge Barber held that the objector was paid a lump sum each term for job performance as Education Officer on the basis of working at least 20 hours per week on the tasks and duties of that position. Accordingly, the objector was a fulltime earner and qualified for a rebate under section 50C. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Valuation of property for property speculation tax Rating:• Case:B J R Fox v CIR HC Auckland M 925/95 Act:Property Speculation Tax Act 1973 - sections 6(1) and 7 (Act repealed 1979) Keywords:valuation, property speculation tax Summary:The taxpayer appealed the decision of the Taxation Review Authority upholding the Commissioner’s assessment of the appellant for property speculation tax on the purchase and subsequent sale of a property. The appeal was rejected because the High Court declined to interfere with the TRA’s factual assessment of the valuations of the property and there was no evidence presented to make differ- ent valuations from the TRA. Facts:The appellant purchased property A in August 1975 for $30,000. In November 1975 the appellant entered into two agreements to swap property A for another property. Under one agreement, the appellant sold property A for $30,000 to a Mrs P. Under the second agreement, the appellant bought property B from Mrs P for $65,000. The Commissioner accepted the value of property A at the time of purchase was $30,000 but assessed the value of property A at the time of sale at $50,000. The taxpayer objected and a case was stated to the TRA. The TRA held that the appellant was liable for property speculation tax on the net profit made on the sale of property A as assessed by the Commissioner. The Court upheld the Commissioner’s assessment that the true value of property A at the time of sale was $50,000 and the value at the time of purchase was held to be $30,000. The basis for the valuation at the time of purchase was the value stated in the agreement for sale and purchase. The valuation at the time of sale was made by the TRA on the basis of evidence of other valuations which were different from the values in the agreements for sale and purchase. The taxpayer appealed the decision of the TRA to the High Court. The taxpayer had three arguments: • The Commissioner and the TRA had no power to adopt a higher valuation than the consideration actually received on the sale of the property. • The Commissioner was obliged to adopt the course of valuation provided for in section 6. • If the valuation by the Commissioner of property A at the time of sale at $50,000 was correct, then this valuation should have been applied to the purchase. Decision:The High Court rejected all three of the appellant’s arguments and held that the appellant was subject to property speculation tax as assessed by the Commis- sioner. In relation to the appellant’s first argument, the Court held that it could not interfere with the factual determination of the TRA as to the value of the property at the time of sale. The appellant’s second argument was regarded by the Court as untenable be- cause section 6(1) expressly states it is subject to section 7. The Court rejected the appellant’s third argument because there was no evi- dence presented to the Court to value the property at the time of purchase at other than the value of $30,000 assigned to the property in the agreement for sale and purchase. Comment:We do not yet know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) GST input tax deduction allowed on farm house built for homestay accommodation Rating:••• Case:TRA No. 92/176 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 2 Keywords:input tax, principal purpose, taxable activity Summary:The Taxation Review Authority found that the objector constructed a farmhouse for the principal purpose of providing farm homestay accommodation and was entitled to claim a GST input tax deduction for the construction costs of the building. Facts:The objector is a farming partnership comprising three family trusts. The objec- tor sought GST input tax deductions for the construction costs of a farmhouse built to provide farm homestay (holiday or tourist) accommodation. The objector was also developing the surrounding farm land to complement the farm homestay. The Commissioner contended that the principal purpose for building the farm- house was to provide private accommodation for the farmer and his family. The Commissioner also argued that the taxpayer was not conducting a taxable activity because there had been no actual homestay activity. Decision:Judge Barber held that full input tax deductions were available. The principal purpose of building the farmhouse was to establish a homestay business and not to provide a residential home. Judge Barber confirmed his observations in Case S16 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,123 relating to the “principal purpose test”: • In ascertaining the taxpayer’s principal purpose, the Court must make an overall assessment of what the taxpayer says was the intention at the relevant time, the evidence of the witnesses, and the so-called objective facts, particu- larly those relating to the use of the goods by the taxpayer. • It is useful, and possibly determinative, to consider the taxpayer’s use of the property in order to ascertain the principal purpose for which the taxpayer acquired the supply. “Purpose” and “use” are not the same concepts, but an objective consideration of “use” will help ascertain whether a good was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. • In ascertaining what is the principal use of real property, it is relevant to consider an area breakdown of the property - identifying the private, taxable (for making taxable supplies), and common purpose areas. Judge Barber found that the farmhouse was built primarily to establish a farm homestay business and that more than 50 per cent of the building was available to the homestay business. This finding was made on the basis of attributing 50 percent of common areas to the homestay activity. The size, design and layout of the farmhouse were also related to the homestay purpose. Although the farmer and his family needed to live somewhere and a substantial reason for building the house was to accommodate them, on the facts this pur- pose was consequential to the nature of the farming and farm homestay enter- prises. Judge Barber rejected the Commissioner’s contention that the taxpayer had not commenced a taxable activity. In planning strategies for the homestay operation, preparing advertising material, and constructing accommodation, the objector may have commenced the taxable activity. In any event, the construction activity forms part of the objector’s overall farming activity. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. 41 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) GST - whether issuing a discount card is a financial service Rating:•••• Case:TRA No. 95/11 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 3(1)(c), 3(1)(ka) and 6 Keywords:financial services, debt security, input tax Summary:The objector’s act of issuing a card that entitles the card holder to discounted meals at certain restaurants was not the supply of a financial service and there- fore was not an exempt supply. Accordingly, the objector was entitled to register for GST and receive input tax deductions. Facts:The objector company sells a card to members that enables the card holder to obtain a 50 per cent discount on the price of meals at certain restaurants. In return for the card, the card holder members pay the objector a fee plus 25 per- cent of the cost of meals eaten by members. The card holders are required to own a pre-arranged credit card and must agree to allow the objector to immedi- ately debit the credit card with the cost of the meal incurred plus 25 per cent of that cost. The company also contracts to make payments of agreed sums of money to the restaurants involved in the scheme. While the restaurants receive only half the retail value of their meals, the restaurants benefit in receiving an advance payment for meals, they are left with no bad debts, and there is a pros- pect of enhanced business. The Commissioner contended that the objector did not have a “taxable activity” as defined by section 6 because the objector is supplying financial services which are exempt from GST under sections 3(1)(c) and 3(1)(ka). The Commissioner contended that the objector was therefore not entitled to receive input tax deduc- tions. Decision:The TRA held that the objector was not supplying “financial services” to the card holders or the restaurants. Judge Willy first considered whether the arrangements between the objector and the restaurants amounted to the supply of financial services in the form of a debt security. He looked at the analogous definition of a “debt security” in the Securi- ties Act 1978. Judge Willy held that the arrangements in this case were in the nature of a “debt security” but nevertheless did not amount to the supply of “financial services” under section 3(1)(c). The scheme was within the definition of a “debt security” because the objector had “a right to be paid money that is owing by any person.” However, there were no “financial services” supplied because section 3(1)(c) is intended to refer to transactions such as the issue of stock or a debenture, and shares which can be negotiated, and did not apply to the simple debtor and creditor relationship that existed between the objector and the restaurants. Section 3(1)(ka) did not apply either because there was no debt security. Judge Willy also considered whether the objector supplied financial services to the card holders. Judge Willy held that the transaction was not in the nature of a debt security because there was no loan between the objector and the card holder. Payments by the card holder to the objector were not payments under a loan but were payments for services provided by a third party to the contract. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. 42 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Whether activity constitutes “carrying on a business” Rating:••• Case:J L Slater and Others v CIR HC Auckland M 611/94 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 104(b) and 112(2)(a) (Income Tax Act 1994 - section BB 7) Keywords:carrying on a business, purpose, deduction, depreciation Summary:The Court upheld the Commissioner’s assessment that the activities of the objector partnership did not have the requisite operational nature to constitute a “business” for two of the three income years in question. Facts:The objectors are members of a die-owning partnership scheme operated by Lemmington Holdings Ltd. The way in which the scheme was intended to operate was that Lemmington Holding Ltd would manufacture a die or set of dies and sell it to the partnership, guaranteeing their repurchase at a much- reduced book value after three years. The die would be used by Lemmington’s subsidiary, Dina Plastics Ltd, to mass produce plastic consumer items. Lemmington Holdings Ltd was to organise the export sale of the products on behalf of the partnership and then account to the partnership for the proceeds after commission. Lemmington Holdings Ltd advertised the advantages of the scheme as being that the partnership would be entitled to a number of export and development allowances. The partnership would also be able to make allowances for deprecia- tion on the dies. However, the scheme did not operate as it was intended. The dies were not capable of any production runs and there was never any production using the partnership’s dies. The objectors claimed a series of deductions for the income years 1981 to 1983. The Commissioner disallowed all the claimed general deductions on the basis that the partnership had not been carrying on a business within the meaning of section 104(b). The Commissioner also disallowed the first year depreciation on the dies because the partnership had not been engaged in any business to satisfy section 112(2)(a). The members of the partnership objected and a case was stated to the High Court. There were two issues: (i) whether the partnership was “carrying on a business” within the meaning of section 104(b). (ii)whether the partnership was “engaged in any business” within the meaning of section 112(2)(a). Decision:Justice Fisher held that the partnership had carried on a business for one of the income years claimed but not in the other years. His Honour examined the meaning of business. He did not see any material difference in the phrases “carrying on a business” in section 104(b) and “engaged in any business” in section 112(2)(a). Justice Fisher applied the test for business used in Grieve v CIR \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA). As it was accepted that the objectors had a subjective profit purpose, the sole question was whether the activity which accompanied that purpose was sufficient to amount to a commercial activity for the purposes of a “business.” 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) Justice Fisher said that although there was no minimum period for carrying on a business, the activity must have continuity and be more than mere preparation to be a business. Setting up a business structure, purchasing plant, or organising the decision-making structures would not suffice because this was not “carrying on a business” in an operational sense but “setting up a business.” Justice Fisher said the focus should be on the taxpayer’s activities, not the activi- ties of others. He found that there was no operational activity conducted on behalf of the partnership in the 1981 income year, the activities being merely preliminary steps to set up the partnership. However, in the 1982 income year the requisite business activity was present in attempts by the partnership to gain production orders. Justice Fisher could not find similar activities in the 1983 income year which would constitute carrying on a business because the activities in that year were restricted to trying to extricate the partners from the agreement with Lemmington Holdings Ltd. On the issue of depreciation of the dies, Justice Fisher held that depreciation was allowable for the 1982 income year because in that year the dies had been used to produce samples. Justice Fisher held that there could be no allowance for depreciation in 1981 and 1983 because the partnership was not engaged in any business in those income years. Comment:Neither Inland Revenue or the taxpayers are appealing this decision. Company arrangement held not to be a tax avoidance scheme Rating:•••• Case:TRA No. 95/33 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 99 and 104 (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections BB 9 and BB 7) Keywords:tax avoidance, personal exertions rule, deductibility, financial advice Summary:The TRA found that an arrangement where the objector who was employed by a company as a chiropractor in which he owned 50 percent of the shares was an arrangement to avoid tax when the company set off the income from the chiro- practic business against accumulated losses. However, there was no tax advan- tage to the objector that needed to be counteracted. On a second issue relating to other income years, the TRA held that the profits made by the company could not be deemed to be the income of the objector. The TRA rejected the Commissioner’s contention that the profits from the chiroprac- tic business should be treated as being derived from the personal exertions of the objector. Facts:The objector had practised in business on his own account as a chiropractor since 1984. In 1987 he purchased 50 percent of the shares in a company which had been established to operate a garage business. The remaining 50 percent of the shares were sold to the objector in 1992. The company had losses of approxi- mately $130,000 to be carried forward. In 1987 the objector sold his chiropractor business to the company for a nominal consideration. He began working for the company as a chiropractor and was paid a salary. All advertisements for the chiropractic services were made in the name of the objector not the company. The company returned profits from the chiropractic business which were set off against the company’s accumulated losses. The Commissioner invoked section 99 against the objector for the 1987 income year, contending that the off setting of profits against the losses of the company was an arrangement to avoid tax. continued on page 44 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.8 (February 1996) For the income years 1988 to 1992 the Commissioner made an assessment in which he deemed the profits made by the company to be the income of the objector. The objector was assessed for tax on those earnings. Relying on the principle in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,106 PC, the Commissioner contended that the objector continued to derive the income that resulted from his personal exertions and was therefore subject to tax on those earnings. The Commissioner also disallowed the deduction of a payment of $24,000 made by the objector to his professional advisers for advice on the arrangement he entered into. The taxpayer objected and a case was stated. Decision:Judge Willy held that there was an arrangement to avoid tax under section 99 in this case. However, he held that there was no tax advantage to the objector from the arrangement that needed to be counteracted under section 99. This was because once section 99 had been applied to disallow the offset of the company’s income against its losses, the company would have paid more tax than the objector individuals if the scheme had not been entered into. That is, the com- pany would have paid tax at the flat rate for companies of 48 per cent which would be a greater amount than the objector would have paid under the three stage progressive scale applying to individuals. In relation to the assessment of the income years 1988 to 1992, Judge Willy held that the Commissioner had acted incorrectly in treating the profits from the chiropractic business as being derived from the personal exertions of the objec- tor. The decision of the Court in Hadlee did not apply in this case because it was concerned with fundamentally different arrangements. In the present case, the objector was employed by the company and, in the absence of a sham or the application of section 99, there were no other grounds on which to uphold the Commissioner’s assessment. Judge Willy held that a deduction of $20,000 could be made for professional financial advice pursuant to section 104 (a) and (b) but a $4000 management fee was not deductible.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Income tax rates for 1995-96 Section BB 2, Income Tax Act 1994 The income tax rates for the 1994-95 income year will continue to apply for the 1995-96 income year. Trust selling domestic dwelling Section CD 1 (3)(b), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Section CD 1 (3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to exempt from income tax the sale proceeds of trust-owned family homes in which trust beneficiaries reside. Background Section CD 1(3)(b) provides an exemption from the taxing of profits or gains from land transactions. The exemption applies to the sale of a dwelling house acquired, or erected, and occupied primarily as a residence for the taxpayer and family. The amendment concerns the transfer of a family home to a family trust by a developer or builder. A conse- quence of the amendment to the definition of “associ- ated persons” in section OD 8 (4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 was that in these situations the trustees of the family trust would be associated with the developer or builder, yet the exemption under section CD 1 (3)(b) would not apply. This would mean that the proceeds of sale of the family home by the trustees would be assess- able. The amendment of section CD 1 (3)(b) to include family homes owned by trusts ensures that these pro- ceeds are not subject to unwarranted tax exposure. Key features The amendment provides for an exemption when a dwelling house meets both of these conditions: • It is acquired or erected by a trust, primarily and principally as a residence for the beneficiaries of the trust. • It is occupied by some or all of the beneficiaries primarily and principally as a residence. The provision of the exemption is subject to the already existing proviso under section CD 1 (3), that the exemption does not apply if a regular pattern of acquisi- tion or erection and subsequent sale or disposition has emerged. Application date The amendment applies from 17 August 1995, the date of the bill’s introduction. Flat-owning companies Section CF 2 (1) Income Tax Act 1994/Section 4(1)(e) Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The deemed dividend provisions have been amended so that shareholders in flat-owning companies will not be affected by a provision which deems the value of the use of company property by shareholders to be a dividend. Section CF 2 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is amended to provide a specific exemption to these shareholders. An equivalent amendment has been made to section 4(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Flat-owning companies are set up for non-business reasons. Shares in the company entitle the owners to the use of residential property, and the company is merely a vehicle for the ownership of the property. There should, therefore, be no tax implications arising from the creation of a genuine flat-owning company. Before the introduction of the qualifying company rules in 1992, the deemed dividend provision applied when a shareholder enjoyed a benefit from the use of company property if the making available of the property was virtually a distribution of a dividend. In practice, this provision was not applied to flat-owning companies unless they had revenue reserves (undistributed funds arising from taxable income derived by the company). With the introduction of the qualifying company rules, the deemed dividend provision was redrafted. It applies where any company property is made available for the use of a shareholder, and the consideration provided by the shareholder is less than the value of the benefit enjoyed. It was recognised when the deemed dividend provisions were redrafted that flat-owning companies would be affected by the change. The solution for flat-owning companies lay in their eligibility to become qualifying 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) • Its governing instrument provides for the entitlement for each shareholder to the use of residential property. • Its assets are restricted to residential property and funds reserved for maintenance and other outgoings on the property. Shareholders who are natural persons, trustees of trusts or limited liability companies can qualify for the exemp- tion. Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively from 1 Octo- ber 1988, the date of the last amendment to the deemed dividend provision before the introduction of the quali- fying company regime. companies. As dividends from qualifying companies are either fully imputed or exempt in the shareholder’s hands, no further tax liability would arise to sharehold- ers in flat-owning companies in respect of any deemed dividends. However, the compliance costs of becoming a qualify- ing company have proved to be a deterrent for flat- owning companies. Therefore a specific exemption is provided. Key features The exemption from the deemed dividend provision in section CF 2 (1)(e) will apply to shareholders of any company that meets both of these conditions: Low-interest loans - taxable benefit for dividend purposes Section CF 2 (11)(c), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment provides that the interest or income in each quarter from a low-interest loan is measured on an accruals basis for the purposes of calculating the taxable benefit for dividend purposes. This amendment ensures consistency with the method used for fringe benefit tax (FBT) purposes. Background The taxable benefit from a low-interest loan is the difference between these two amounts: • the amount that is payable as interest under the terms of the loan • the amount that would be payable at the prescribed rate of interest. The taxable benefit is determined on a quarterly basis. While the same definition of loan is used for FBT and dividend purposes, the mechanism used to determine the amount payable under such loans for each quarter was technically different. Now the treatment has been aligned. Key features The amount deemed to accrue as interest under the terms of a low-interest loan for dividend purposes is determined on a quarterly basis. The amount calculated will be one of these amounts: • the amount of interest that has accrued during that period under the loan • where appropriate, the amount of income that would have accrued during that period if the income from the loan (being a financial arrangement) were calculated using the yield to maturity basis. Example A company provides a loan of $10, 000 to a share- holder on 1 April 1996. The interest rate is 5% calculated on the daily balance of the loan, payable annually on 1 April. The shareholder makes no repayments of principal during the 1996-97 year. The first interest payment, due on 1 April 1997, is therefore $500. Assume that the prescribed rate of interest for the year is 10%. Under section CF 2(11), a dividend of $125 will arise in each quarter of the 1996-97 year. Application date The amendment applies with respect to dividends arising on or after 1 January 1996. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Statutory producer boards and co-operative companies - basis for making tax-free distributions, and notification requirements Sections CF 3 (1)(i), (ia), (j), CF 3 (4), HF 1 (9), ME 30 (2), ME 30 (4), ME 33 (3)(b), I.T. Act 1994 Introduction The basis on which tax-free cash distributions by statutory producer boards and co-operative companies are made has been clarified. Tax-free cash distributions in respect of notional distributions will be made on the basis of the trading activity that occurs in the year to which the cash distribution relates. An amendment has also been made to align the time at which statutory producer boards notify the Commis- sioner of the payment of deemed dividends with the requirements applying to companies. Background Statutory producer boards may attach imputation credits to cash distributions paid to their members. They may also elect to attach imputation credits to notional distributions paid to their members. Cash distributions are analogous to dividends that are paid by an ordinary company, while notional distributions are analogous to the treatment of taxable bonus issues. A board that makes a notional distribution is subse- quently allowed to distribute a tax-free cash distribution based on the value of the notional amount. These rules also apply to co-operative companies that make distributions to their shareholders based on each shareholder’s produce activity. The law was unclear whether a tax-free cash distribu- tion had to be allocated to members or shareholders based on produce activity in the year to which that cash distribution related, or whether it had to be allocated on the basis of produce activity in the year to which the notional distribution related. This uncertainty is re- moved by the amendments. Statutory producer boards were also only permitted to attach imputation credits to a cash distribution if they had notified the Commissioner that the distribution would be treated as non-deductible for tax purposes. This requirement has been amended to align the notification provision with that applying to companies distributing dividends. Key features Sections CF 3 (1)(i) and CF 3 (1)(j) have been amended to enable statutory producer boards and co-operative companies to allocate tax-free cash distributions on the basis of the current-year’s trading activity with their members and shareholders. Section ME 30 (2) has also been amended to enable statutory producer boards, when they file their income tax returns, to provide written notification to the Commissioner that deemed dividends have been paid out to their members. Example A statutory producer board has four members for the 1995 trading year. In 1995 it makes a taxable notional distribution to its members of $100,000, which is fully imputed. Members’ shares of the distribution are based on their proportion of total produce activity with the board for the year. The board subsequently distributes a tax-free cash distribution of $67,000 to its members (representing the net amount of the notional distribution) for the 1997 trading year. That distribution must be allocated to its members based on their produce activity for that year, as shown in the table below. -------------1995 trading year------------------1997 trading year----- ProduceNotionalProduceTax-free cash Supplieractivitydistributionactivitydistribution A20 %20,00025 %16,750 B25 %25,00025 %16, 750 C25 %25,00025 %16,750 D30 %30,00025 %16,750 Application date The amendments will take effect from the 1995-96 income year. Employee share purchases - reassessments Section CH 2 (4), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment extends the grounds for reassessment if benefits from an employee share purchase agreement have been reduced or extinguished. Background When an employer provides shares to employees at less than market price the Commissioner values the differ- ence between market price and consideration as a 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) taxable benefit to those employees. Restrictive provi- sions often apply to the retention or ownership of the shares. Generally, those restrictions are taken into account when valuing the benefit to be assessed. Section CH 2 (4) makes provision for a reassessment of the value of the benefit if certain conditions are met. To qualify for a reassessment, a taxpayer must have been assessed without the Commissioner having taken into account the restrictive provisions, have disposed of the shares during the restrictive period, and been adversely affected by the restrictive provisions. This can be inequitable when a taxpayer has been assessed on a benefit that is subsequently reduced or extinguished, which could occur as a result of an employee terminating employment or retiring. Key features The amendment to section CH 2 (4) extends the Com- missioner’s powers to reassess reduced or extinguished benefits if either of the following apply: • The employee must pay additional consideration to retain shares acquired under the share purchase agreement. • The shares are reacquired by the employer for a consideration less than or equal to the original purchase price. Application date The amendment will apply to taxable benefits reduced or extinguished on or after 12 December 1995. Superannuation contributions that are not subject to SSCWT Section CL 1, Income Tax Act 1994/Section 226(9A), Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction An amendment corrects an anomaly in the Income Tax Act 1994 which made employer contributions which were not subject to specified superannuation contribu- tion withholding tax (SSCWT) subject to both income tax and fringe benefit tax. Background A 1991 amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976 trust rules had an inadvertent effect upon the taxation of superannuation schemes, exposing employer superan- nuation contributions which were not subject to SSCWT to double taxation. This has now been corrected. Key issues Section CL 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 226(9A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 have been amended to ensure that employer contributions which are not subject to SSCWT are subject only to fringe benefit tax. Application date The amendment applies from 31 March 1991, the date that the provision exposing the contributions to double taxation took effect. Life insurance: value of actuarial reserves on transfer of business Section CM 15 (1), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The policyholder base formula has been amended to allow life insurance companies to take into account the value of their actuarial reserves at the date of transfer of a life insurance business. The value of the actuarial reserves at that date will form the closing and opening values of the reserves for the purposes of calculating policyholder income and losses for the transferor and transferee respectively. Background Life insurers are taxed on policyholder income as a proxy for policyholders. Section CM 15 (1) provides a formula for calculating the amount of policyholder base income or loss. The reserves are measured at the end of each income year, with the closing balance becoming the opening balance for the following income year. Changes in the actuarial reserves during the income year represent income or loss at the policyholder base. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Any increase or decrease in actuarial reserves is calcu- lated as (v1 - v0) where: v1 = aggregate of actuarial reserves at year end; and v0 = aggregate actuarial reserves at the start of the year. If a life insurance company transfers its life insurance business to another insurer during an income year then, under current rules, the value of the reserves at the end of the transferor’s income year, v1, will be nil. The calculation (v1 -v0) gives rise to a loss of an amount equal to the opening value of those reserves. At the end of the transferee’s income year, the value of its reserves, v1, are increased by the amount of the reserves transferred. This gives income equal to the transferred reserves, rather than the amount of any change in the reserves from the date of acquisition of the business. The policyholder loss arising to the transferor cannot be offset against other income of the transferor, even when the transfer occurs within the same group. Correct treatment is achieved by requiring a valuation of the actuarial reserves at the time of transfer, with that value being used as the closing value for the transferor and opening value for the transferee. In practice, it is expected that any transfers would be done at the end of the transferor’s income year, when the transferor is required to calculate the value of the actuarial reserves. Note that these provision do not remove any income tax consequences arising on the realisation of any assets and liabilities transferred to the transferee. Key features The policyholder base formula in section CM 15 (1) has been amended to allow life insurance companies transferring 100% of a life insurance business within a wholly-owned group to take into account the value of their actuarial reserves at the date of transfer of the life insurance business. This amendment will be subject to: • 100% of the life insurance business being transferred within a wholly-owned group, or, if the transferor is not resident in New Zealand, all of the policies of life insurance offered or entered into in New Zealand that are held by the transferor; • the Commissioner of Inland Revenue being satisfied that the transfer is being undertaken for genuine commercial reasons and that no undue tax advantage will arise either to the transferor or the transferee as a result of the transfer; and • the Government Actuary being satisfied that 100% of the life insurance business has been transferred and that policyholders subject to the transfer will not be disadvantaged as a result of the transfer. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. Life insurance: policyholder base losses on transfer of business Section II 2, Income Tax Act 1994 Summary of proposed amendment An amendment allows policyholder losses to be trans- ferred to the transferee life insurer if a life insurance business is transferred. Background Previously, policyholder losses existing at the time of a transfer of a life insurance business would remain the transferor’s losses and could only be used to offset policyholder income deemed to be derived by that insurer. This meant that to use these losses the transferor had to remain in business in New Zealand as a life insurer (or recommence such a business). The policy intent is that policyholder income or losses should be either assessable income or allowable losses to those policyholders on whose behalf the income was derived or losses incurred, and should transfer with them, rather than being left with the transferor insurer. Therefore it is inappropriate that the transferor be able to use these losses, as they would then be used by a group of policyholders different from those in respect of whom the losses were incurred. Key features Section II 2 (1) has been amended to allow current year losses and losses carried forward to the current income year to be treated as a policyholder loss incurred by the transferee insurer. This amendment will be subject to: • 100% of the life insurance business being transferred within a wholly-owned group, or, if the transferor is not resident in New Zealand, all of the policies of life insurance offered or entered into in New Zealand that are held by the transferor; • the Commissioner of Inland Revenue being satisfied that the transfer is being undertaken for genuine commercial reasons and that no undue tax advantage will arise either to the transferor or the transferee as a result of the transfer; • the Government Actuary being satisfied that 100% of the life insurance business has been transferred and that policyholders subject to the transfer will not be disadvantaged as a result of the transfer. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) If these conditions are met, the transferor life insurer is required to elect that the losses be transferred to the transferee life insurer. For this purpose the Commis- sioner will accept the election as being notified if appropriate entries are made in the relevant returns of income of the transferor and transferee that cover the income year of the transfer of the life insurance business. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. Life insurance: policyholder credit account balance and transfer of business Sections ME 18, 19A and 23, Income Tax Act 1994 Summary Amendments allow a credit balance in the policyholder credit account (PCA) of a transferor life insurer, at the date of transfer of the life insurer’s life business, to be transferred to the transferee life insurer’s PCA. They apply to both resident and non-resident insurers. Background All resident life insurers are required to maintain a PCA which records transfers of tax credits between the life and policyholder tax bases. Imputation credits can be transferred to the PCA and used to satisfy any tax liability arising in the policyholder tax base. Non- resident insurers cannot maintain an imputation credit account (ICA), but they can elect to maintain a PCA. Rather than remain with the transferor when a life insurance business is transferred, any credits available in the insurer’s PCA should be transferred to the transferee insurer’s PCA. This is in keeping with policy intent that the credits remain available to the policy- holders on whose behalf the tax that gave rise to the credits was paid. Key features Sections ME 18 and ME 23 have been amended and a new section ME 19A inserted, to allow any credit balance remaining in the PCA of a transferor life insurer to be transferred to the transferee life insurer on the transfer of a life insurance business. Under section CM 15 (4), the amendments will be subject to: • 100% of the life insurance business being transferred within a wholly-owned group, or, if the transferor is not resident in New Zealand, all of the policies of life insurance offered or entered into in New Zealand that are held by the transferor; • the Commissioner of Inland Revenue being satisfied that the transfer is being undertaken for genuine commercial reasons and that no undue tax advantage would arise either to the transferor or the transferee as a result of the transfer; • the Government Actuary being satisfied that 100% of the life insurance business has been transferred and that policyholders subject to the transfer will not be disadvantaged as a result of the transfer. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. Demutualisation: continuity of losses and tax credits Section OD 5A, Income Tax Act 1994 Summary An amendment deems the voting and market value interests held by shareholders in a company formed to take over the business of an existing mutual association to be held continuously throughout the period of demutualisation. The provision will apply only if at least 49% (for losses) or 66% (for imputation credits) of the voting and market value interests in the new com- pany are held by persons who were policyholders immediately before the demutualisation process began. Background Special continuity rules have been developed for entities, such as life insurance funds, which do not issue shares. An entity is deemed to have issued shares, and the members (or appointed directors) of the entity are deemed to hold all the shares as though they were a single notional person. Under the process of demutualisation, members gener- ally exchange the rights they hold in the mutual associa- tion for rights as shareholders in a company. As soon as 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) shares are issued, shareholding continuity for the carry forward of losses and imputation credits is breached because the shareholding changes from a single notional person to actual policyholders. Any losses and imputa- tion credits existing at the date shares in the mutual association are issued, are lost. Where there is merely an exchange of rights, there is no policy reason why losses and imputation credits should be forfeited upon demutualisation. Accordingly, this amendment allows losses and imputation credits of mutual associations undergoing demutualisation to be maintained in the new company, provided the minimum voting and market value tests are met. When a demutualisation involves establishing a holding company and shares in the holding company are issued to former policyholders of the mutual, the provisions will apply to the indirect interests held by the former policyholder members. Where, under section OD 5 (5) a notional single person exists, the legislation will apply to the notional single person as though that person held interests in the mutual immediately prior to the demutualisation. Key feature A new section, OD 5A has been inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 which provides for continuity of ownership of voting and market value interests of certain demutualisations. This will allow losses and imputation credits of certain mutual associations demutualising to be carried forward. This is subject to existing policyholders continuing to hold, directly or indirectly, the minimum voting and market value interest required for any company to carry forward losses or imputation credits. Application date The amendment applies from 1 August 1995. Unit trusts and group investment funds - tax treatment Sections CF 3, CZ 4, ME 41 and OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction These amendments introduce permanent rules for the taxation of the proceeds received on the redemption of units in widely-held unit trusts, and group investment funds to the extent they are taxed as companies. References to unit trusts in this item refer both to unit trusts and group investment funds (GIFs) in respect of their category A income. Background Since 1960 unit trusts have been subject to tax as though they were companies. GIFs have been subject to tax as companies on their category A income only, from the income year beginning 1 April 1984. Unlisted unit trusts differ from companies in the manner in which investors purchase and dispose of their units. Because there is no established market for units in an unlisted unit trust, the units are (in most cases) purchased and redeemed by the unit trust manager. Previously, the redemption of a unit gave rise to a dividend to the extent that the amount distributed exceeded the returned capital amount or, following the changes made to the taxation of share repurchases which applied from 1 July 1994, the available sub- scribed capital per share. Therefore when the manager redeemed units purchased from investors, the manager would, in the absence of the inter-corporate dividend exemption, have received a taxable dividend. When the inter-corporate dividend exemption was removed in 1991 section CZ 4 (1) (formerly section 63(2H)) was introduced to provide a temporary exemp- tion from tax on dividends paid by unit trusts to the manager. Retaining the dividend exemption for unit trusts was an interim measure pending the outcome of discussions between the Investment Funds Association and the Government on the correct tax treatment of unit trusts. With the introduction of the permanent rules, the temporary dividend exemption in section CZ 4 (1) will lapse. Key features • Unit trusts continue to be taxed as companies. • The temporary exemption for dividends paid to unit trust managers under section CZ 4 (1) will lapse. • Unit redemptions may be funded first from available subscribed capital (the “ordering rule”), but unit trusts may also offer units which will be redeemed under the “slice rule”. • Following the redemption of units by the manager, an amount equal to the greater of the imputation and withholding payment credits attached to dividends received by unit trust managers or the amount of income tax paid by the unit trust manager in relation to the dividends, will be debited to the manager’s imputation credit account. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 1996. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Detailed analysis Redemption of units Subject to the rules of the unit trust, investors holding units in a widely-held unit trust can dispose of their units by either directly redeeming the units with the trustee of the unit trust (provided the trust deed allows for this) or selling to the unit trust manager, who may then redeem the units with the trustee of the unit trust. Under the previous rules, the amount distributed on the redemption of a unit was treated as coming proportion- ately from paid-up capital and other reserves that relate to the same class of unit as the unit being redeemed. This is commonly referred to as the “slice” rule. In practical terms, if a unit trust manager elected to treat the units issued to each different unit holder as “shares of the same class” the returned capital amount on those units would equal the amount contributed for the purchase of the units. Under the new rules unit trusts can issue units that can be redeemed under the “ordering” rule and/or units that can be redeemed under the “slice” rule. These rules have quite separate tax consequences as explained below. The ordering rule The ordering rule that will apply to unit trust redemptions is the same rule that applies to the redemptions of shares in ordinary companies. It pro- vides that the proceeds of the redemption are taken first from the available subscribed capital of the particular class of units being redeemed. This means that, to the extent that there is sufficient available subscribed capital for the class of units being redeemed, the proceeds of the redemption will not be a taxable divi- dend. In legislative terms, the ordering rule is provided for by section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(B) which states that the distribu- tion will be excluded from the definition of a dividend to the extent to which the distribution does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. The available subscribed capital per share cancelled is defined in section OB 1 and is an amount calculated by dividing the available subscribed capital of a particular class by the number of shares of that class redeemed. Example 1 This example illustrates the operation of the ordering rule when an investor disposes of units by selling to a unit trust manager. On 1 September 1996 a unit trust is formed. The unit trust issues 100,000 units at $1 per unit. The units are taken up in equal shares by 200 investors, that is 500 units per investor. Entry to the unit trust is closed after this date. The unit trust does not issue any shares on such terms that their redemption is subject to section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(A) (the “slice” rule). On 18 May 1997 the units have risen in value to $1.75. On that day 50 investors notify the manager that they wish to sell their 500 units. The manager purchases the units from the investors and redeems them with the unit trust on that same day. The available subscribed capital per share cancelled will be 100,000/25,000, which is $4 per unit. No dividend arises to the manager as the amount distributed to the investors ($1.75 per unit) does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled ($4 per unit). The available subscribed capital of the unit trust is now reduced to $56,250 ($100,000 - $43,750) as per item c of the definition of available subscribed capital in section OB 1. If there is insufficient available subscribed capital a dividend will arise to the unit trust manager, as the following example illustrates. Example 2 Continuing on from the example above, the fund performs extremely well and the value of the units rises to $2.50 per unit. An additional 100 unit holders decide to take their profits out of the unit trust. The available subscribed capital per share cancelled will be $56,250/50,000, which is $1.125 per unit. Investors will each receive the full $2.50 for their units. However, the distribution is only excluded from the definition of a dividend to the extent of the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. In this case, the manager will derive a dividend of $1.375 per unit when the units are redeemed with the unit trust. Subject to the maximum imputation credit ratio permitted and the benchmark imputation ratio rules, this dividend can be imputed as with any other dividend. The manager of the unit trust can use any imputation or withholding payment credits to offset its own tax liability on the dividend, but for no other purpose. This is discussed below. The slice rule Some investors may prefer to hold units subject to the slice rule. The slice rule is achieved by section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(A), which excludes from tax that part of the distribution that does not exceed the “available subscribed capital per share”, as distinguished from the “available sub- scribed capital per share cancelled” (see above). Therefore, that portion of the redemption proceeds that exceeds the available subscribed capital per share will represent a taxable dividend which may be imputed. If investors hold their units on revenue account there is the potential for double taxation. This is avoided by the operation of section CF 2 (15) which reduces the assessable proceeds received on redemption by the amount of the dividend. Imputation credits may then be available to shelter the tax on the dividend element, 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) leaving only the balance of the redemption proceeds assessable. The following example illustrates the operation of the slice rule when units are redeemed directly by an investor. Example 3 On 1 July 1996 a unit trust is formed. The unit trust issued 20 million units at $2 per unit. The perform- ance of the unit trust has been outstanding. The value of the units as at 30 September 1997, when the trust’s financial results for the year were announced, was $5 per unit. All units in the unit trust are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(A), that is, the slice rule. A Co, having held units since the start of the unit trust, decides to redeem its unit holding of 2000 units. The units are redeemed directly with the trustee of the unit trust. The available subscribed capital per share is $2 as all units issued at the time the trust was formed went into the one class in accordance with para- graph (c)(iii) of the definition of “shares of the same class” Upon redemption A Co received $10, 000 which is comprised of available subscribed capital of $4,000 and a dividend of $6,000. The dividend was fully imputed and carried imputation credits of $2,940. Because A Co held the shares on revenue account, the profit on redemption is also assessable under section BB 4(c). To avoid double taxation of the redemption pro- ceeds section CF 2 (15) applies. A Co calculated the assessable income in relation to the redemption as follows. Dividend= $6,000 Section BB 4(c) income, taking section CF 2(15) adjustment into account: ($10,000 - $6000) - $4000 = $ 0 Total income= $6,000 Example 4 B Co purchased 10,000 units at a cost of $5.50 per unit in November 1997. Unit prices then fall to $3.50 per unit. B Co decides to dispose of the units and redeems the entire holding. B Co, who is a dealer in equities, held the units on revenue account. Upon redemption B Co received $35,000. This amount is excluded from the definition of dividend by section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(A) as the amount returned upon redemption does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share. The loss of $20,000 will be determined in the usual way. Note that, even though all units in the example are issued under the slice rule and assuming the rules of the unit trust permit, an investor in that unit trust could still have sold the slice rule units back to the unit trust manager. In that case the investor’s tax liability would be determined by the rules applicable to the sale of personal property and the manager would have been responsible for any tax obligations arising on the redemption of the unit. Imputation credits and manager redemptions Most widely-held unit trusts will offer manager buy- back facilities. This means that investors can sell their units to the manager, rather than redeeming the units directly with the trustee of the unit trust. This transac- tion, from the investors’ point of view, is merely a sale of an asset which will generally only be taxable if the units were held on revenue account. The manager, having acquired the units, will either on- sell them, or redeem them. If the units are redeemed, the same rules apply to the manager as apply to other investors on redemption, so the manager may receive a taxable dividend if, for example, the unit trust has run out of available subscribed capital, or those units were redeemed under the slice rule. The tax paid by the manager on, and any imputation credits attached to, dividends received from the unit trust give rise to a credit in the manager’s imputation credit account. However, the manager of the unit trust should not be able pass those imputation credits on to other companies in the manager’s group. Special rules have been developed for this purpose. New section ME 41 provides for a debit to the ICA of the manager, or a consolidated group of which the manager is a member, if both of these conditions are met: • The manager acquires units in the unit trust from unit holders. • The manager acquires them in the ordinary course of the manager’s activities in respect of the unit trust - that is, the purchasing and subsequent redemption of units in accordance with the terms upon which the units were offered to potential unit holders. Continuity Concessionary continuity provisions are contained in sections OD 5 (5) and OD 5 (6). Section OD 5 (8) removes the benefit of these concessions if the directors of a company that is listed on a recognised exchange know or could reasonably be expected to know that the continuity provisions would not have been satisfied but for those concessions. Section OD 5 (8) acknowledges that it is not practicable for the directors of a listed company to follow all changes in shareholding. The same considerations apply in the case of widely held unit trusts. Therefore section 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) OD 5 (8)(b) has been amended so that the concessions are still available if the breach in continuity is solely due to the redemption of units in a widely-held unit trust, including redemptions by the manager in the normal course of the manager’s activities in relation to that unit trust. The amendment only extends to those widely-held unit trusts referred to in subparagraphs (b)(i) and (ii) of the definition of widely-held trust in section CF 3 (14). Subparagraph (iii) of the definition refers to unit trusts which are used as investment vehicles by other widely- held vehicles for direct investment. The same considera- tions do not arise for these unit trusts and therefore it is not appropriate to include them in the definition of widely-held trust for these purposes. Note that section OD 5 (8)(b) specifically refers to unit trusts. GIFs are excluded from this amendment as they are special corporate entities which are not subject to the general continuity rules. Brightline tests A pro-rata cancellation (other than an on-market acquisition) on the repurchase of a share within certain thresholds is automatically treated as a dividend. These thresholds are known as the brightline tests, and they apply when a unit trust makes a pro rata cancellation of units. Under the previous rules the brightline tests did not apply to unit trust redemptions. However, because unit trust redemptions are now taxed in a similar manner to company share repurchases, it is appropriate that the brightline tests apply to all unlisted unit trusts in respect of pro-rata cancellations. Section CF 3 (1)(b)(i)(D) has been amended accordingly. For a full explanation of the brightline tests and pro-rata cancellations see TIB Volume Six, No. 6. Transitional rules All units in unlisted unit trusts are currently subject to the slice rule. For unit trusts intending to use the ordering rule some transitional rules have been put in place. The transitional rules are contained in new sections CZ 4 (3), (4) and (5). Section CZ 4 (3) deems all units on issue on 1 April 1996 not to have been issued on terms such that their redemption will be subject to section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(A) (the slice rule). They will, therefore, all become subject to the ordering rule as from 1 April 1996. Section CZ 4 (4) provides that if an election to treat any units as a separate class has been made under paragraph (c) of the definition of “shares of the same class”, from 1 April 1996 those units are all collapsed into one class and will be subject to the ordering rule within that class. Those investors wanting to retain the slice rule will be able to do so by notifying the manager of the relevant unit trust, who in turn will notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In that case neither section CZ 4 (3) or CZ 4 (4) will apply. The Commissioner must receive this notification on or before 31 March 1996 (section CZ 4(5)). Redemption of units in a unit trust that is not resident in New Zealand Currently, section CF 3 (2)(c) provides that if a person has units in an unlisted widely-held trust and is unable to obtain sufficient information to calculate the available subscribed capital per share, it is deemed to equal the amount paid to the trust in respect of the units re- deemed. This rule has been preserved, by deeming the units to have been issued on the basis that they are to be re- deemed under the slice rule. This provision does not apply to interests in a foreign investment fund. In that case the FIF rules apply. Miscellaneous unit trust issues Streaming of imputation credits All company shareholders have in effect borne a share of the company’s tax. Therefore imputation credits should ideally be allocated among the shareholders on a pro rata basis. Streaming of imputation credits occurs when companies attach imputation credits to dividends paid to those shareholders best able to utilise them in preference to other shareholders. For example, it would be more beneficial to taxpaying shareholders who are able to use them to receive imputation credits than it would to tax-exempt shareholders. Section GC 22 is an anti-avoidance provision designed to attack arrangements to obtain an advantage from the use of imputation credits. Although the section is very broad in its application, the relevant part that is of concern for these purposes is section GC 22 (1)(b). The holders of slice rule units will receive dividends and, therefore, imputation credits earlier than the holders of ordering rule units, who will not receive dividends (nor, therefore, imputation credits) until all available subscribed capital has run out. Inland Revenue considers that this in itself is not streaming. However, whether imputation credits have been streamed or not will depend on all the facts of each case, and although imputing the dividend element of any slice rule redemp- tion proceeds will not necessarily constitute streaming, section GC 22 is not precluded from applying. Any concerns about equity between those unit holders using the ‘slice’ rule and those using the ‘ordering’ rule would be met by the manager’s fiduciary duties to unit holders. Thus if the pool of imputation credits were depleted as a result of redemptions to slice rule unit holders, the trust could meet its fiduciary obligations to other unit holders by imputing dividends paid to them at the same ratio. This would give rise to a debit to the ICA of the trust, and the trust would have to pay the required tax to meet that debit at the end of the relevant year. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Definition of unit trust The unit trust definition is intended to include trusts used as investment vehicles for settlors, but is not intended to include family trust arrangements in which one family member settles property in trust for other family members who are not contributors to the corpus of the trust. In public ruling BR Pub 95/5 published in TIB Volume Seven, No. 5 (November 1995), it was ruled that qualifying trusts (which would include most family trusts) that also meet the definition of a unit trust will be regarded as unit trusts. Concern has been expressed that the definition of unit trust is too wide and that it could potentially catch family trust arrangements. The current definition of unit trust for tax purposes is found in section OB 1, which states: Unit trust means any scheme or arrangement, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for the participation, as beneficiaries under a trust, by subscribers, purchasers, or contributors, in income and gains ... arising from the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trust... Thus the beneficiaries of a trust must participate as subscribers, purchasers or contributors before the trust is a unit trust for tax purposes. Inland Revenue believes that most family trusts can be distinguished in that the beneficiaries of a family trust would not, in most cases, initiate the investment into the trust. This view is consistent with the interpretation of the definition of unit trust set out in public ruling BR Pub 95/5. However, there may be times when beneficiaries of a trust established within the family context contribute to the property of the trust in such a way that the trust is a unit trust. In this situation it will be a question of fact as to whether the trust is a unit trust or not. Dividend stripping Section GB 1 (3) applies, broadly, if a taxpayer disposes of shares in return for consideration, which considera- tion would have been a dividend had an avoidance arrangement (of the kind referred to in section BB 9) not been entered into. The unit trust industry is concerned that the way units are “traded” by redemption through unit trust managers falls within the section. In other words, had the redemp- tion been effected directly between the unitholder and the unit trust, instead of through the manager, a divi- dend may have arisen. In TIB Volume One, No. 8, February 1990 (page 14 of Appendix C) it was stated that a precondition for the application of section GB 1 (3) is that the arrangement satisfy the criteria of section BB 9. As a result, the normal sale of shares (not having a tax avoidance purpose) will not be caught by the section. The Commissioner continues to hold this view in relation to the sale of units to a unit trust manager and the subse- quent redemption of those units by the manager. If the sale and subsequent redemption are made in the ordinary course of the manager’s activities as such, section GB 1 (3) will not apply. However, as stated in the policy statement quoted above, Inland Revenue reserves the right to rely on section GB 1 (3) when tax avoidance is involved. Section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii) also contains a specific anti- dividend stripping test that must be met before any amount distributed on the cancellation of any shares is to be excluded from the dividend definition. The relevant factors to be taken into account in determining whether the cancellation was made in lieu of the payment of dividends are listed in subsubparagraphs (A) to (D) of that section. Share dealing Section FC 3 applies to purchases and sales of shares in circumstances in which any profit or loss on the sale of shares is taken into account for income tax purposes. That is, if the taxpayer is in the business of dealing in shares or has acquired shares for the purposes of selling or otherwise disposing of them. One of the primary functions of the section was to stop taxpayers stripping taxable profits out of companies by way of dividends, if the tax payable on the dividend is sheltered by a deductible loss on the eventual sale of the shares. The unit trust industry is concerned that the section will apply in the case of normal day to day manager redemptions once the temporary dividend exemption in section CZ 4 lapses. However, Inland Revenue’s view is that unless the unit trust manager is redeeming units in such a manner so as to strip reserves from the unit trust tax free in a manner contemplated by the provisions of section FC 3, the Commissioner will not be seeking to apply section FC 3 to redemption of units in the ordinary course of a manager’s day to day activities. Outdated reference to category 1,2 and 3 superannuation schemes. The outdated references to category 1, 2 and 3 superan- nuation schemes in sections HE 2 (3), HK 24 (3) and OE 4 (I) have been replaced. The reference in section HE 2 (3) to category 1 and 2 superannuation schemes is replaced by reference to superannuation funds, which are defined in the 1994 Act (section OB 1) as any superannuation scheme which is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. References in sections HK 24 (3) and OE 4 (1)(i) to category 1,2 and 3 superannuation schemes have been replaced by reference to superannuation schemes, which term is also defined in section OB 1 of the 1994 Act. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Inflation-indexed bonds Sections EB 4 and EB 5, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment ensures that both the coupon and any inflation-indexed amount accruing on inflation-indexed bonds (IIBs) are taxed on an annual basis. Background Section CB 1 (1) was amended with effect from 1 April 1995 to remove the tax exemption for premiums payable upon the redemption of IIBs. Following this, a review of the tax treatment of IIBs generally was undertaken. The Government announced on budget night that it would be issuing IIBs. Although these Government bonds are issued on such terms that they are already covered by existing legislation, legislation was consid- ered necessary to deal with IIBs generally, since the Government does not have a monopoly on them. Key features • Sections EB 4 and EB 5 have been introduced into the Income Tax Act 1994. • These sections apply when the taxpayer is a cash basis holder. Non-cash basis holders will be subject to the accrual rules. A new determination has been prepared for indexed bonds generally, and will be released in February 1996. • Holders of IIBs are deemed to derive the inflation- indexed return annually. • The inflation-indexed amount is subject to the resi- dent withholding tax rules when it is deemed to be credited in account. Resident withholding tax and income tax treatment of the inflation-indexed amount For income tax purposes, the inflation-indexed return or premium on an IIB is interest. This is because it is a return on “money lent”. Where the conditions in section EB 4 (2) are satisfied and the difference in the accrued indexed amount is an increase, section EB 4(3) treats the difference as having been credited in account and capitalised by the bor- rower for the benefit of the lender on the day following the day on which the level of the relevant index at the end of the current income year becomes public knowl- edge. The wording of section EB 4 (3) relates back directly to the definitions of “paid” and the meaning of the term “derived”. This ensures that the inflation-indexed amount is subject to both resident withholding tax (RWT) and income tax. Section EB 4(4) provides that if and to the extent that an amount on account of the increase has previously been paid to the lender or credited to the lender or otherwise dealt with in the lender’s interest, section EB 4 (3) will not apply to deem the increase to be credited. This will cover the situation when, for exam- ple in the case of Government IIBs, the inflation- indexed amount is actually credited during the income year. Section EB 4 (4) also applies when the money lent has previously been repaid. This covers the situation when all of the conditions in section EB 4 (2) are met, although an amount is actually credited after such time as the bond has been redeemed or otherwise disposed of. In that case a base price adjustment would calculate any balance of income or loss to be taken into account. Increases in inflation-indexed amounts that represent recoveries of previous decreases Section EB 4 (3) contains no provision in relation to losses corresponding to a reduction in the value of the inflation-indexed amount. This means that if, over a period, there is overall deflation, no loss will be allow- able. Instead the taxpayer will have to wait until the bond is redeemed or otherwise disposed of and a base price adjustment is undertaken in terms of section EH 4. However, two provisions have been inserted which treat any increase in accrued indexed amount as not having been credited or deemed to be credited when the in- crease represents a recovery of a previous decrease. These are sections EB 4 (5) and EB 5. Section EB 4 (5) This section provides that an increase in an accrued indexed amount will not be treated as credited in account to the extent that, over a previous income year, there was a decrease in the accrued indexed amount, and the increase simply represents a recovery of that decrease. Section EB 5 Section EB 5 (1) is a similar provision to section EB 4 (5) except that it applies when the amount that represents an increase in the indexed amount has been actually credited to the account of the lender by the borrower. This differs from the situation to which section EB 4 (5) applies, in which the increase in the indexed amount is (or would be, apart from that section) deemed to be credited by section EB 4 (3). Section EB 5 states that the amount of the increase actually credited will not be treated as an amount of income for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section EB 5 (2) clarifies the interpretation of the base price adjustment formula if an increase in the accrued indexed amount has been treated by section EB 5 (1) as not being income. In other words, for the purposes of the base price adjustment provisions, the inflation amount that represents a recovery of a prior decrease will still be income. However, it is not necessary to have 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) a similar provision for section EB 4 (5) as in that case no income was either actually or deemed to be derived and, hence, there will be no confusion on this point when undertaking the base price adjustment. Index not published at end of income year Section EB 4 (6) is designed to ensure that section EB 4 still works if the level of the relevant index is not published as at the end of the year, but at a time during the income year. For example, if the index is published annually on 30 June and a taxpayer holding a bond indexed to that index has a balance date of 30 Septem- ber, the level of the index as at 30 June will be appropri- ate to measure the inflation-indexed amount for the purposes of calculating the taxpayer’s income tax on income derived to 30 September. Application date The amendments will apply to money lent on or after 1 October 1995. Property transactions and the accrual rules Sections EH 1, EH 8, EZ 10, OB 1 and OB 7, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction A series of amendments deals with issues raised by the recent Dewavrin case, in the area of agreements for the sale and purchase of property (ASAPs). They give effect to the Government’s intention to align the law with the underlying policy intent of the accrual rules by provid- ing that the tax treatment of financial arrangements throughout the life of the arrangement is aligned with the tax treatment on maturity. They also provide that in the case of foreign currency denominated ASAPs, exchange gains and losses are brought to tax from the time the ASAP is entered into. The legislation provides two methods for converting the cost price of the foreign currency denominated transac- tions into New Zealand dollars, and gives the Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue the power to issue determina- tions to approve a different method in certain circum- stances. Background The calculation of income and expenditure from financial arrangements for tax purposes is covered by the accrual rules. In the case of deferred settlement ASAPs, a lending or borrowing component exists when payment for the goods takes place some time after delivery. The intent of the rules was to treat any lending or borrowing component within the contract as a financial arrangement. A deferred settlement ASAP denominated in a foreign currency is the economic equivalent of an ASAP denominated in New Zealand dollars plus two separate financial arrangements: • A foreign exchange (FX) contract, in which one party agrees to exchange a foreign currency for New Zealand dollars at a future time. This is for the period between the date of entering into the ASAP and date of delivery of the property. • A foreign currency denominated loan for the period between the date of delivery of the property and payment. Therefore, the tax treatment of an ASAP denominated in a foreign currency should, as far as practical, be consistent with the tax treatment of these other financial arrangements. In the Dewavrin case, the taxpayer made a foreign currency gain on the FX contract matched by a foreign currency loss on the ASAP. The Court of Appeal concluded that the foreign currency loss was deductible and the foreign currency gain on the FX contract was assessable. Issues dealt with by the Court were: • The Court found that foreign exchange gains and losses on ASAPs start from the date the contract is signed. • The Court accepted that changes in the underlying value of the property (the wool as valued in NZ currency in this case) before delivery were not in- cluded in the base price adjustment, which takes place on maturity of the financial arrangement. However, the Court held that the law required such changes to be accounted for during the life of the ASAP. This result goes against the policy intent of the rules and appears to require that taxpayers revalue to market price all unfilled orders at each balance date. • The case has highlighted uncertainty as to the New Zealand dollar cost price of property if the ASAP is denominated in a foreign currency. Key features •Consistency between interim and final calculations under the accrual rules: Section EH 1 (1) clarifies the tax treatment of foreign currency exchange gains and losses. It achieves consistency with the final calculations on the treatment of changes in the value of the property subject to an ASAP, by now reflecting the language used in section EH 4. Thus items that are later “reversed out” in the base price adjustment will not be included as income over the life of the financial arrangement. •Determining the cost price: A new section OB 7 provides two methods that may be used in the calcula- tion of the cost price. These are: 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) -the forward exchange rate to delivery date; and -the forward exchange rate to settlement date. •Determinations: A new paragraph (k) of section 90(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the power to issue determinations prescribing alternative methods in certain circumstances. It is proposed that a low compliance cost method will be available for taxpay- ers with gross income of less than $2.5 million, and that methods that are consistent with accounting standards will be available for ASAPs concerning certain trading stock items. •Gains and losses taxable from the date of contract: A new section OB 7 requires the cost price to be determined using a rate set on the day on which the financial arrangement is entered into. •Acquisition price: Section EH 8 (2) has been amended to clarify that the acquisition price, deter- mined in accordance with the accrual rules, is the price at which the property is deemed to have been transferred for other purposes of the Act. Determining the cost price The acquisition price (called the “cost price”) in an ASAP establishes the level of accrual income and expenditure for the purposes of the accrual rules, being the difference between the cost price, and the price in New Zealand dollars actually paid for the property. The cost price also establishes the basis for depreciation of capital property and the base for calculating the profit made on the sale of revenue property. The two methods which the legislation will allow are as follows: The forward exchange rate to delivery date Under this method the cost price is converted into New Zealand dollars at the forward rate to the expected delivery date prevailing at the time the contract was signed. This exchange rate is the market’s best estimate, at the time the contract is signed, of the New Zealand dollar value that is equivalent to the foreign currency denominated price at the time of delivery. The forward exchange rate to settlement date Under this method the cost price is converted using the forward rate to the expected settlement date. This method uses information normally required for account- ing purposes. An important advantage of this method is that it determines the foreign currency gain or loss on the ASAP by using the same rate as that used to deter- mine the foreign currency gain or loss under the FX contract. This is because the gain or loss on a forward currency contract is also determined using the forward rate to settlement. If the full amount of the foreign exchange exposure is hedged, under this method there would be no foreign currency income or expenditure arising from exchange rate movements. Methods proposed to be approved by determination The amendment to section 90(1)(k) of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994 gives the Commissioner power to issue determinations prescribing alternative methods in certain circumstances. The Commissioner proposes that the following methods will be approved. Low compliance cost method A low compliance cost method will be available to taxpayers who are not “large” entities, that is, entities with gross income of less than $2.5 million. This method uses the spot rate at settlement date, and therefore does not include any foreign currency gain or loss that may be derived from the ASAP. The Commissioner proposes that eligible taxpayers may elect to use the low compliance cost method on their foreign currency denominated ASAPs by making a tax return for that income year on that basis. Any ASAPs returned under the low compliance cost method would receive this treatment for the life of those contracts, regardless of whether or not the taxpayer remained eligible for this method in later income years. Methods consistent with accounting standards The Commissioner also proposes to issue a determina- tion allowing a different method to be used if that method is consistent with accounting practice, and if the property which is the subject of the ASAP is trading stock of the taxpayer. For these purposes trading stock will not include land or excepted financial arrange- ments. New Zealand accounting standards currently allow the use of a spot rate at delivery date, and interna- tional accounting standards currently allow the spot rate at contract date to be used. Application date The amendments will apply to contracts entered into after the beginning of the 1996-97 income year. How- ever, if in previous years a taxpayer has used a method that conforms with the new rules, and applied that method consistently to that financial arrangement, this will be accepted. This provision is contained in the new section EZ 10. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Amalgamations and land sales - transfer of land held on capital account Section FE 6, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment has been made to prevent pre-amalga- mation tax-free capital gains becoming potentially taxable. Background Section FE 6 (1) provides that land will be deemed to be acquired by the amalgamated company on the same date it was acquired by the amalgamating company and for consideration that is equal to that paid by the amalga- mating company. This has potential for the amalga- mated company to be taxed on pre-amalgamation tax free gains. Key features The amendment deals with land held on capital account by an amalgamating company, but subject to section CD 1 of the 1994 Act (section 67 of the 1976 Act) in the amalgamated company. It will deem land to be trans- ferred on the qualifying amalgamation at market value, but the ten-year period will run from the date of the amalgamation. Application date The amendment applies from 1 July 1994 to coincide with the introduction of the recent company law re- forms. Amalgamations and land sales - application of ten year rule Section FE 6, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment has been made to take account of the ten-year rule on amalgamation. Background Section FE 6 (3) provides that land which is “revenue account property” of the amalgamating company, but is not revenue account property of the amalgamated company, is transferred on amalgamation at market value. The land is deemed to have been acquired by the amalgamated company at the time of amalgamation. When land subject to the ten year rule is deemed to be disposed of at the time of amalgamation, and the amalgamation takes place before the expiry of the ten year period, the amalgamating company is taxed on the deemed disposition. Key features The amendment provides that the ten-year rule under section CD 1 of the 1994 Act (section 67 of the 1976 Act) which applies to the amalgamating company before amalgamation, continues to apply to the amalgamated company, notwithstanding the deemed disposition of the land on amalgamation by the amalgamating company. Consequently, when the ten-year rule applies to the amalgamating company it will not be subject to income tax only because of the deemed disposition of the land on amalgamation. However, it will be taxed on any subsequent disposition of the land if the land is sold within ten years of the amalgamating company’s acquisition of the land. Application date The amendment applies from 1 July 1994 to coincide with the introduction of the recent company law re- forms. Qualifying companies - shareholder deductions Section HG 9 (3), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The qualifying company shareholder provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 state that a shareholder of a qualifying company is denied a deduction for interest incurred on money borrowed to purchase shares in the company to the extent of the amount of any non-cash dividends received by the shareholder. An amendment has been made extending this rule to include non-cash dividends received by persons associated with the shareholder. Background Section HG 9 (3) of the Act ensures that a shareholder of a qualifying company cannot use the qualifying 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) company rules to obtain a deduction for interest in- curred on private or domestic expenditure. The amend- ment extends this provision to cover private or domestic expenditure incurred on behalf of a person associated with the shareholder. Key features Section HG 9 (3) has been amended to ensure that a shareholder of a qualifying company is denied a deduc- tion for interest incurred on money borrowed to pur- chase shares in the company to the extent of the amount of any non-cash dividends received by persons associ- ated with the shareholder. The amendment also provides for apportionment when more than one shareholder is associated with the same person. The amount of any non-cash dividends received by the associated person is to be apportioned among the associated shareholders, in proportion to the effective interest in the company held by each of the associated shareholders in that income year. Each shareholder is denied a deduction to the extent of the amount appor- tioned to that shareholder. Application date The amendment applies from 17 August 1995, the date of the bill’s introduction. Charitable organisations - addition Section KC 5 (1), Income Tax Act 1994 The Nelson Mandela Trust (New Zealand) has been granted charitable donee status. From the 1996-97 income year, donations made to the Trust entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1 / 3 percent of the amount donated. The maximum rebate for all donations is $500 per annum. A company (other than a closely held company) is entitled to a deduction from assessable income up to the amounts prescribed by section DJ 4. Government Superannuation Fund - consequential amendment Section HJ 1 Introduction A consequential amendment replaces references to the “Board” of the Government Superannuation Fund with references to the “custodian” in the Income Tax Act 1994. The equivalent amendment in the Income Tax Act 1976 has been repealed. Background The Government Superannuation Fund Amendment Act 1995 (GSFA) changed the role and structure of the Government Superannuation Fund and, in particular, transferred the control of the Fund from the Board to a custodian. A consequential amendment was made to the 1976 Act which replaced references to the Board with references to the custodian. No equivalent amendment was made to the 1994 Act. Key feature Section HJ 1 has been amended to duplicate the change in the 1994 Act. The amendment to the 1976 Act has been repealed. Application date The amendment to the 1994 Act will apply from 1 October 1995, the application date of the Government Superannuation Fund Amendment Act 1995. As the amendment to the 1994 Act will apply from 1 October 1995 and the 1994 Act applies to the income tax year commencing 1 April 1995, the GSFA amend- ment to the 1976 Act has been repealed, as from the date of enactment. 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) change made from 10 April 1995 which ensures continuity in the payment of Family Support for benefi- ciaries moving off an income-tested benefit. The details of that change are set out in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No. 12, page 20. Key features Inland Revenue will be able to pay arrears of GMFI back to the date that the Department of Social Welfare ceases payment of a beneficiary’s main benefit. Application date The change applies from the date of assent, 12 Decem- ber 1995. Introduction The amendment is designed to assist beneficiaries leave the benefit system by allowing their guaranteed mini- mum family income (GMFI) to be backdated to the date that their main benefit ceased. When beneficiaries move into the workforce there can be a gap of several weeks before they receive their first GMFI payment. This gap has meant that some benefici- aries could not afford to move off the benefit. Background The change arises from an Employment Task Force recommendation and is designed to assist beneficiaries to move off income-tested benefits. It follows a similar Guaranteed minimum family income Section KD 7, Income Tax Act 1994 Overpaid tax applied to other tax liabilities - implications for imputation, consolidation and DWP rules Various sections, Income tax Act 1994 and Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The imputation, consolidation and dividend withhold- ing payment (DWP) rules have been amended to provide for situations when the Commissioner does not refund overpaid tax to corporate taxpayers but applies it to other tax liabilities. Background When tax is overpaid, that tax can either be refunded to a taxpayer or credited by the Commissioner towards another tax liability of the taxpayer. In the case of corporate taxpayers, if a refund is made, a debit arises in the memorandum account. However, the imputation, consolidation, and DWP rules previously allowed an extra “windfall” credit to arise when the Commissioner applied overpaid income tax or foreign dividend withholding payments in satisfaction of other tax liabilities, rather than refunding them. There are three sets of circumstances in which this situation can typically arise: • when overpaid income tax cannot be refunded to a corporate taxpayer because of an insufficient credit balance in its memorandum account (section MD 2(1)) • when the income tax has been applied by the Com- missioner towards other outstanding tax liabilities of the corporate taxpayer that were due and payable (section MD 1) • when the taxpayer has asked the Commissioner to retain tax that is refundable and apply it towards an expected tax liability. To ensure that the rules are robust, the amendments provide that windfall credits will not be available when income tax is overpaid and subsequently applied to satisfy either of the following: • other income tax liabilities • tax liabilities (apart from income tax). The relevant sections affected by these amendments are: • sections MD 4, ME 5 (1)(l), (m), (n), ME 5 (2)(k), ME 12 (1)(l), (m), ME 12 (2)(k), MG 5 (1)(k), MG 5 (2)(i), MG 15 (1)(l), MG 15 (2)(j), MZ 1, MZ 2, MZ 3 (Income Tax Act 1994); • sections 180(1)(c), 181(1)(c) (Tax Administration Act 1994); • sections 191SB(1)(l), (m), 191SB(2)(k), 191UB(1)(l), 191UB(2)(j), 394E(1)(k), (l), (m), 394E(2)(j), 394ZJA, 394ZJB, 394ZW(1)(h), 394ZW(2)(h) (Income Tax Act 1976). Key features The imputation rules have been amended to ensure that: • A windfall credit will not arise in a company’s memorandum account when the Commissioner applies overpaid income tax in satisfaction of other income tax liabilities. • A debit will arise when the Commissioner applies overpaid income tax in satisfaction of tax liabilities other than income tax, (unless the company previ- ously experienced a breach in shareholder continuity). • A debit will also arise when the Commissioner applies overpaid income tax towards outstanding income tax 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) liabilities that arose before the imputation rules came into force (unless the company previously experienced a breach in shareholder continuity). • The Commissioner will also be able to remit imputa- tion penalty tax and DWP penalty tax in prescribed circumstances. Identical amendments have been made to the DWP rules to ensure that the same result occurs in the case of overpaid DWP. These amendments apply to companies or consolidated groups that operate either imputation credit or DWP accounts. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 1988. However, they will not apply to companies that have done either of the following before 17 August 1995: • recorded windfall credits in their accounts and neutralised those credits before 17 August 1995 • recorded credits in their accounts for payments of income tax or DWP, and with the approval of the Commissioner, treated their account as debited when the payment was applied to another income tax or DWP liability respectively. For the purposes of determining whether windfall credits have been neutralised before 17 August 1995, the amendments include an ordering rule that requires credits to have been neutralised in the order in which they arose. These same points apply to windfall credits recorded in a company’s ICA that were transferred from that company’s DWP account.

Intervening shareholder continuity breaches Under the imputation and DWP rules, if shareholding in a company changes by more than the threshold specified in the shareholder continuity rules, credits that arose before the change and have not been utilised will be neutralised by a debit. However, corporate taxpayers in this situation who have overpaid their tax will not be subject to another debit if the overpayment is applied to either pre-imputation income tax liabilities, or non-income tax liabilities. This is because the taxpayer will have already lost the credit in its account as a result of the breach in shareholder continuity. Example Z Ltd - ICA Imputation Year TransactionICA Entry 1995End of year tax payment$12,000 Cr Shareholder continuity breached$12,000 Dr 1994 Reassessment - $500 income tax overpaid. GST liability outstanding ($500) Commissioner offsets incomeNo tax overpayment against GST.debit entry 1995End of year tax payment$ 0 A debit will not arise in Z Ltd’s ICA when the overpaid income tax is applied towards the GST liability. This is because the credits that arose from the overpayment of tax were cancelled when shareholder continuity was breached. Remission of imputation and DWP penalties Corporate taxpayers that carry debit balances in either their ICAs or DWP accounts at the end of the imputa- tion year (31 March) are subject to a liability for further income tax (FIT) equal to the debit balance (section 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) ME 9). Imputation penalty tax set at 10% of the FIT liability is also payable by the taxpayers (section 153 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Now that a debit arises when the Commissioner applies overpaid income tax against non-income tax liabilities, there is a potential for taxpayers to be subject to tax penalties. This would particularly happen if the following se- quence occurs: 1. A corporate taxpayer overpays its income tax. 2. The taxpayer credits its ICA and subsequently attaches the credit to a dividend payment (thus debiting the account). 3. The Commissioner subsequently credits the overpay- ment against other tax liabilities close to the end of the imputation year. 4. As a result of the Commissioner’s action, the taxpayer is required to make a debit entry in the ICA. 5. The taxpayer does not have sufficient time to clear the debit balance before the end of the year, and is thus subject to FIT and imputation penalty tax for failing to clear the account. Section 180 of the Tax Administration Act has been amended to provide that the liability for FIT will be remitted when the Commissioner is satisfied that these two conditions are met: • Liability for imputation penalty tax arose because the Commissioner applied income tax towards non- income tax or pre-imputation penalty tax liabilities. • The taxpayer did not become aware in sufficient time that the debit arose to its ICA to allow it to clear the debit balance before the end of the imputation year. Section 181 of that Act has also been amended to remit DWP penalty tax in similar situations for corporate taxpayers that maintain DWP accounts. Qualifying companies and further income tax Sections ME 9 (1), ME 9 (3) and ME 9 (7), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The qualifying company (QC) rules contain an anti- credit streaming rule that deems companies to have attached imputation credits to dividends paid during an imputation year to the fullest extent possible in accord- ance with credits in their imputation credit accounts (ICAs). Strict compliance with this rule has created further tax burdens and penalties for companies receiving a refund in a subsequent year. The tax refund can give rise to a debit balance in a company’s account which, if left uncleared at the end of the year, would subject the company to further income tax (FIT) obligations and penalties. These amendments relieve QCs from the liability to pay FIT in respect of a debit balance that remains uncleared at the end of an imputation year if the debit balance is attributable to refunds of income tax. Background Refunds of overpaid income tax can be paid to QCs regardless of the credit balance existing in their ICAs unless the tax was overpaid as part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage (section MD 2 (7)). Combined with the anti-credit streaming rule, this provision creates further tax burdens and penalties for companies which are in an overall loss position or are just breaking even. The further tax burden and associated penalties arise when the following sequence occurs: 1. Tax (for example, provisional tax or resident withholding tax) has been paid during an imputation year, giving rise to credits in a QC’s ICA. 2. At the end of the imputation year, all credits in the QC’s ICA are deemed to have been imputed to dividends paid during that year, thus either reducing or eliminating the credit balance. 3. In a subsequent imputation year the QC receives a refund for the tax previously paid, thus causing its ICA to move into debit balance. The debit balance would need to be removed by way of the company making a voluntary tax payment by the end of the imputation year, or a FIT liability would be imposed to balance the ICA. Imputation penalty tax set at 10% of the FIT liability would also be imposed on the company. Key features The imputation regime has been amended so that: • QCs with debit balances in their ICAs created by income tax refunds will not be subject to the imposi- tion of FIT at the end of the imputation year, and • debit balances that are attributable to tax refunds will remain in the ICA and be carried over into future imputation years to be offset by credits that arise in the account as the company meets its future tax obligations. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Application date These amendments apply to any income tax refund paid to a QC during the imputation year beginning on 1 April 1995 or any subsequent year. Detailed analysis FIT liability neutralised The relief from imposition of FIT is achieved by application of the formula: a - b In this formula: a is the sum of all such income tax refunds paid to the QC on or before the date on which the relevant debit balance giving rise to the liability for FIT is deter- mined. b is the sum of any credits arising in accordance with sections ME 3 (2)(b)(i) and ME 4 (1) in the compa- ny’s ICA during the imputation year in which the amount of any such refund first arose as a debit and during any subsequent imputation year. QCs that are found to have debit balances in their accounts at the end of an imputation year will be able to aggregate the following amounts from the time the relevant debit balance is determined: • all debits arising from refunds of income tax (variable “a”) • all credits that arose in the QC’s ICA during the year in which the debits associated with refunds of income tax first arose and subsequent years (variable “b”). Under this formula, any amount of FIT liability arising from an end of year debit balance will be offset by an amount equal to the debits that remain in excess of the credits. The debit balance will not be cancelled by the formula but will continue to roll-over into subsequent imputation years until the debits are offset by credits that arise in the QC’s account. This formula is identical to the formula previously contained in section 394L(4A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 ( see Tax Information Bulletin Volume Seven, No. 4 (October 1995)). Example 1 QC X Ltd - ICA Imputation YearTransactionICA Entry 1995Provisional tax payment$4,000 Cr Allocation to dividends $4,000 Dr 1995Closing Balance$ 0 1996Tax refund (QC in loss)$4,000 Dr No tax payments $ 0 1996Closing Balance$4,000 Dr Under section ME 9(1), a FIT liability would ordinarily arise at the end of the 1996 imputation year. However, under section ME 9 (7), the FIT liability will be reduced by the formula a - b, in which: a is $4,000 b is nil. Therefore the FIT liability of $4000 arising on the QC’s debit balance would be reduced by $4000 ((a) - (b)). However, the actual debit balance will remain in the company’s account and continue to roll-over into future years. Example 2 QC Y Ltd - ICA Imputation YearTransactionICA Entry 1998Debit (tax refunds rolled over from previous years)$10,000 Dr Provisional tax payment $ 3,000 Cr 1998Closing Balance$ 7,000 Dr The FIT liability of $7000 would be reduced by the formula a - b, in which: a is $10,000 b is $3,000. Therefore at the end of the imputation year, the FIT liability of $7,000 arising from the QC’s debit balance would be reduced by $7,000 ((a) - (b)). The actual debit balance will remain in the compa- ny’s account and continue to roll-over into future years. Qualifying Companies that cease to be ICA companies Section ME 9 (3) has been amended to relieve a QC that ceases to be an ICA company from the obligation to pay FIT if the debit balance in its ICA is attributable to refunds of income tax. The obligation to pay FIT under section ME 9 (3) will be cancelled through the applica- tion of the formula discussed above. Example QC Z Ltd - ICA Imputation YearTransactionICA Entry 1997Opening balance (tax refunds rolled-over from previous years)$20,000 Dr No tax payments $ 0 Cr 14 Aug 1997QC Z Ltd ceases to be an ICA company$20,000 Dr Under section ME 9 (3), a liability for FIT of $20,000 would ordinarily arise . However, liability under this provision is subject to the operation of the formula in section ME 9 (7). Therefore the FIT liability of $20,000 will be reduced by $20,000 ((a) - (b)) to nil. QC Z Ltd will not be subject to an FIT liability when it ceases to be an ICA company. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Aligning BETA provisions - consolidated groups Sections ME 11, ME 12, MF 8, MF 9 and MF 10, Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 191SA, 191SB, 191VA, 191VB and 191VC, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Amendments align the branch equivalent tax account (BETA) provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 which apply to consolidated companies with those applying to individual companies. Background During the reorganisation of the Income Tax Acts it was found that a number of required amendments to the consolidated group BETA provisions were not made when the BETA rules were amended in 1993. These amendments have now been made. Key features The amendments modify the various BETA rules for consolidated groups to achieve these results: • Credit balances may satisfy foreign dividend with- holding payment liabilities. • Debit balances may satisfy controlled foreign com- pany income tax liabilities. • Controlled foreign company income tax liabilities will credit a BETA account. • Foreign dividend withholding payment liabilities will debit the BETA account. Application date The amendments apply from 28 September 1993, the date the BETA rules were amended. NRWT integration into FIRST computer system Sections NG 11, NG 13, NG 16, NG 16A and OB 1 Income Tax Act 1994 Section 49, Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Amendments have been made to the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, in order to facilitate the integration of the NRWT system into Inland Revenue’s FIRST computer system. Background The NRWT system was integrated into Inland Rev- enue’s FIRST system from 1 April 1995. The amend- ments facilitate this integration, and also provide for changes that reduce compliance costs, such as the change from monthly statements to annual reconcilia- tion, bi-annual payments in certain circumstances and simplified refund procedures. Key features • Payers of non-resident withholding income now only have to file a NRWT reconciliation statement annu- ally, instead of filing monthly statements. • NRWT payers can make payments bi-annually if their total deductions are less than $500 per annum. • There are new procedures for collecting and refunding NRWT. • There are requirements concerning non-resident withholding income payers’ obligations to file a reconciliation when they stop a taxable activity in relation to which NRWT deductions have been made. Application date The amendments apply from the date of the bill’s enactment, 12 December 1995 Depreciation review Sections OB 1, EG 11, EG 17, EG 19 and Schedule 17, Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 107A, 108J, 111, 117 and Schedule 22, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Several amendments have been made to the depreciation rules. The amendments arise out of the post-implemen- tation review of the depreciation legislation and there- fore focus on remedying defects identified in the legislation. Background As part of its Generic Tax Policy Process, the Govern- ment will conduct a review of legislation after enact- ment to ensure that the legislation is effective, given the intents and objectives of the policy. The depreciation regime, which came into effect in the 1993-94 income 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) year, is the first legislation to be reviewed in this way. The Government has received submissions outlining defects in the legislation, or suggesting improvements to it. The review is continuing and it may result in further amendments in the future. Key features • The depreciation rules have been amended to exclude primary sector land improvements purchased by a taxpayer if the costs of making the improvements were immediately deductible to a previous owner. This applies from the 1993-94 income year except in relation to depreciation claimed before 19 July 1995. • A limitation has been made on the amount of assess- able income derived on the sale of assets in a pool that consists only of assets previously depreciated under the globo method. This applies from the date of enactment of the legislation, 12 December 1995. • Schedule 17 (which lists intangible depreciable property) has been expanded to include the following items: -management and licence rightsissued under the Radiocommunications Act 1989, and acquired after 1 April 1993; -fixed-life consents granted, in or after the 1996-97 income year, under the Resource Management Act 1991. • An amendment has been made to the associated persons provision (section EG 17) to ensure that when intangible depreciable property is transferred to an associate, and the proceeds of sale are not assessable to the transferor, the property is transferred at the lesser of cost to the vendor or consideration paid by the purchaser. • Several minor technical amendments have also been made. Detailed analysis Deductible primary sector land improvements The definition of “depreciable property” in section OB 1 has been amended to correct a technical error in relation to the depreciation of primary sector land improvements purchased since 1993. The new depreciation rules were not intended to apply to primary sector land improve- ments as the Act contains specific provisions that provide for the deduction and amortisation of expendi- ture on such improvements (sections DL 2, DO 3, DO 4 and DO 5). However, arguably the legislation did not reflect that intent and certain primary sector land improvements that are listed in Schedule 16 and that were immediately deductible to one farmer may have been depreciable to a subsequent owner of the farm. The amendment corrects this. If expenditure on a land improvement is now, or was prior to 1987, immediately deductible to a farmer, forester or aquaculturalist and that taxpayer sells the property, the new owner will not be able to depreciate the land improvement. As there is no clawback of the expenditure on sale of the property, to permit the new owner to depreciate the improvement allows a double deduction of the expenditure. Application date The amendment will generally apply from the 1993-94 income year. The amendment is retroactive not only because it achieves the policy intent of the legislation, but also because those in the primary sector who have purchased improvements since 1993 have not in general claimed depreciation on such land improvements under Schedule 16. As it is now mandatory to claim deprecia- tion, a prospective application date would require those taxpayers to value the improvements, claim depreciation on them and recalculate their tax for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 years. However, section 5(4) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1976 provides that the amendment will not apply retrospectively to depreciation deductions already claimed by taxpayers in tax returns filed for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 years by 18 July 1995 (the date on which the Minister announced the proposed amendment). If taxpayers have claimed depreciation by that date, section EG 19, which provides for clawback of deprecia- tion and loss on sale on the disposal of property, will not apply on sale of the land improvement. This is effected by excluding the land improvements from the definition of depreciable property from the 1993-94 income year so that there is no disposal of depreciable property to which section EG 19 can apply. Sale of pooled assets previously depreci- ated under the globo method Section EG 11 has been amended to provide that assessable income arising on the sale of assets in a pool that consists only of assets that were previously depreci- ated under the globo method will be limited to: • depreciation claimed in relation to the pool (including depreciation claimed under the globo method), less • any amounts of depreciation previously recovered. The amendment addresses a problem faced by electricity and gas distribution industries which became liable to tax from 1 April 1987. The asset records kept by those entities were limited and, in many cases, although they knew the total cost of assets, they could not practically identify when an individual asset was acquired nor its cost price. Therefore, when these entities became taxable the Commissioner allowed them to use the globo method in order to calculate depreciation. The globo method was similar to the pooling method that is currently available but did not tax capital gains on sale. When the new depreciation provisions were introduced, the globo method was replaced with the pool method of depreciation. Under that method, when pooled property is sold, sale proceeds are debited against the pool 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) balance, and if the balance becomes negative, the negative balance is deemed to be assessable income. This taxes any capital gains that might arise on the sale of pooled assets. This was considered to be an accept- able cost compared to the benefits of pooling, and generally taxpayers who consider that capital gains would be derived on the sale of certain assets can exclude them from a pool. Although generally pooled property must have a value of $2,000 or less, an exception was made for property depreciated under globo - it has no maximum. There- fore the energy distribution industries pooled property the market value of which amounted to millions of dollars. The market value of the pooled assets is signifi- cantly higher than their historical cost. Therefore, when the whole of the assets are to be disposed of, the differ- ence between the adjusted tax value of the pool and its market value will be assessable income. This is of concern to those companies in view of the current interest in mergers, amalgamations and takeovers in the industry. The amendment will limit assessable income to depre- ciation claimed, including depreciation allowed while the assets were depreciated under the globo method, less depreciation previously recovered. Example Energy Co has a pool of assets with a market value of $20 million. The assets were previously depreci- ated under the globo method. The adjusted tax value of the pool is $5 million, with $10 million in depreciation claimed since 1987 - either under globo or under pool. Energy Co sells one half of its pool for $10 million. This reduces the adjusted tax value to negative $5 million, all of which is assessable income to the company. Under section EG 11 (4) the adjusted tax value of the pool is then deemed to be nil. Shortly after, the balance of the pool is sold for $10 million, reducing the adjusted tax value to negative $10 mil- lion. Assessable income is limited to $5 million, being depreciation claimed less depreciation previously recovered. This amendment only applies if all assets in the pool were previously depreciated using the globo method. Inland Revenue is not aware of any companies that have added other assets to an ex globo pool. However, if it transpires that taxpayers have done so, this issue may be revisited with a view to considering whether it is feasible to permit a one-off removal of such assets into a separate pool. If such a mechanism is required and feasible, Inland Revenue would consider recommending to Government an amendment retrospective to the date of enactment of the substantive provision. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment of the legislation, 12 December 1995. Additions to Schedule 17 Schedule 17 lists intangible property that is depreciable. To be added to Schedule 17, an item must have these two properties: • It must have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition. • It must have a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes. Two new items have been added to Schedule 17; radiospectrum rights granted under the Radiocommun- ications Act 1989 and fixed-life resource management consents. Radiospectrum management and licence rights A management right is primarily the right to issue licences to transmit radio waves on frequencies under the manager’s control. The Crown has retained certain management rights, while others have been sold for a fixed period of a maximum of 20 years. The principal licence right is the right to transmit radio waves on a specified frequency. Licence rights in relation to a frequency are issued by the holder of the management right for that frequency for a fixed term within the life of the management right. At present a company to whom management rights are granted generally issues licences to itself or associates, although they may be issued to third parties. The manager may charge whatever is considered appropriate (including nothing) for issue of the licence. The Gov- ernment is concerned to ensure that taxpayers holding a management right in relation to a frequency cannot inflate the depreciation deductions available by issuing licences to an associate (which would be depreciable to it) for a lump sum cost. Presumably, the management rightholder would do this only if there were some argument to be made that the proceeds of issue would be non-assessable. Example A Co buys the management right for certain frequencies for $10 million. The management right will be depreciable. A Co issues a licence to B Co (its subsidiary) to transmit on a frequency for a $2 million lump sum which it considers is not assessable. Depreciation would be claimable on a cost of $12 million, yet the economic cost of the radiospectrum rights to the group is $10 million. As noted above, this is a problem only if the licence is issued for a lump sum and there is some argument to be made that the payment is not assessable income to the management rightholder. Presumably, if that lump sum is assessable, the licence will be issued at no cost, or for a regular, deductible, payment made by the licence holder (which will be assessable to the management rightholder). 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Section EG 17 has been amended to provide that, for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, the cost of a licence is nil if the licence is issued to a taxpayer by an associate holding the management right in relation to the frequencies allocated in the licence. Radiospectrum rights will be depreciable if they are acquired after 1 April 1993. Resource management consents The following resource management consents have a fixed legal life of a maximum of 35 years and are added to Schedule 17: • coastal permits (except for reclamation) • land use consents that relate to the bed of a river or lake (except for reclamation) • water permits • discharge permits. These consents are depreciable if they were granted in or after the 1996-97 income year. Section 122 of the Resource Management Act states that a resource consent is neither real nor personal property. Therefore the definition of “property” in section OB 1 has been amended to include, for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, resource consents. Intangible assets transferred between associates Section EG 17 limits the depreciation deductions that may be claimed by a taxpayer on purchase of property from an associate. Although the provision is poorly drafted, its intent is to ensure that, for depreciation purposes, property is transferred at the lesser of the cost to the transferor or price paid by the transferee. Subsec- tion (2) provides that the limitation does not apply if the Commissioner considers that depreciation should be based on the actual price paid. The section has been amended to remove the Commis- sioner’s discretion in relation to the transfer of intangi- ble property, when the proceeds of the sale of the property are not assessable to the vendor. The amendment reflects the Government’s concern about the transfer of intangible assets between associ- ated taxpayers in order to increase depreciation deduc- tions. First, to the extent that such assets are difficult to value, there is an opportunity to transfer them to an associate at an inflated value. This exposes the tax base to some risk and is likely to give rise to IRD/taxpayer disputes. Secondly, the market value of an intangible asset, in particular, may well exceed the adjusted tax value of the asset - because, for instance, the costs of creating the asset have in part been deducted. Sale of intangible assets to third party Section EG 19 (7) requires the Commissioner to deem property transferred to have been disposed of for market value, or if that cannot be ascertained, for a considera- tion specified by the Commissioner. In the case of intangible assets which may be difficult to value, this power may be used to deem transfer to occur at adjusted tax value. Although it makes no substantive difference, section EG 19 (7) has been amended to refer specifically to the Commissioner’s ability to deem transfer of property to occur at adjusted tax value if no market value can be established. Amendment to item 2, Schedule 17 Item 2 of Schedule 17 enables depreciation of “the right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property right”. The bill inserts the word “or” between “property” and “right”. Item 2 is taken from paragraph (a) of the royalty definition and the word was omitted in error. The amendment takes effect from the 1993-94 income year. Maximum pooling value is GST exclusive The word “consideration” in the definition of “poolable property” in section OB 1 has been replaced by “cost”. This provides a link to section ED 4(4) (which deals with the relationship between GST and income tax) and clarifies that the $2,000 maximum pooling value excludes GST for a GST registered person. The amend- ment applies from the 1993-94 income year. Transfer of assets into a pool Section EG 11 has been amended to provide that, when an asset that has previously been depreciated separately by a taxpayer is transferred into a pool, the value of the asset is included in the opening value of the pool for the year in which the transfer occurs. In this way the taxpayer receives the full 12 months’ depreciation claim on the asset for that year. The taxpayer cannot receive more than this by transferring property into a pool mid- year because an asset can be depreciated in any income year under only one method - straight line, diminishing value or pool. The amendment applies from the 1993-94 income year. In specie distributions The definition of “disposal” in section EG 19 has been amended to include the distribution of property. It is intended that in specie distributions of property to a shareholder be disposals. The amendment takes effect from the 1993-94 income year. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Income tax - associated persons Sections OB 1, OD 8 (1) and OD 8 (4), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The “associated persons” and “relative” definitions in the Income Tax Act 1994 have been amended to include certain trustee-beneficiary relationships. Background One of the Act’s “associated persons” definitions, and the definition of “relative”, referred to a trustee-benefi- ciary relationship in terms of a person being a “trustee for” another. Another of the “associated persons” definitions referred to “a trustee of a trust and a benefi- ciary of that trust”. These were not sufficient where the beneficiary was a discretionary beneficiary only. Follow- ing the case of D H Cook Ltd v CIR (1973) 1 NZTC 61,104, a person was not a trustee “for” another person where there were other persons who may also have been discretionary beneficiaries. The amendments ensure that discretionary beneficiaries are included in the defini- tions. Key features The amendments have changed the associated persons definitions in subsections (1) and (4) of section OD 8, and the definition of “relative” in section OB 1, to ensure that discretionary beneficiaries are included within these provisions. The amendment to subsection (1) of section OD 8 provides that any two persons are associated for the purposes of that subsection, when one is the trustee of a trust under which the other has benefited or is eligible to benefit. The amendment to subsection (4) of section OD 8 provides that a company and a person (other than a company) are associated for the purposes of that subsec- tion, when a trustee of a trust under which that person or that person’s spouse or infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit, has a voting interest in the com- pany equal to or exceeding 25% or, in any case where a market value circumstance exists in respect of that company, a market value interest in the company equal to or exceeding 25%. The amendment to subsection (4) of section OD 8 also provides that any two persons are associated for the purposes of that subsection, when one is the trustee of a trust under which the spouse or infant child of the other has benefited or is eligible to benefit. The amendment to the definition of “relative” in section OB 1 provides that “relative” includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit. A person is “eligible to benefit” when he or she is either: • named by the trust deed as a potential beneficiary; or • designated as a member of a class of potential benefi- ciaries, for example, “the children of ...”. When trustees have a general power of appointment, persons not already appointed as beneficiaries under the power are excluded from the definition. Application date The amendments apply from 17 August 1995, the date of the bill’s introduction. In relation to the amendments’ application to section CD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which deals with the taxation of profits or gains from land transactions, the amendments apply to acquisitions of land on or after 17 August 1995. Livestock adverse event income equalisation scheme - calculation of maximum deposit Section OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment clarifies how to calculate the maximum amount that can be deposited into the adverse event income equalisation scheme in circumstances which previously caused difficulty. Background The adverse event income equalisation scheme allows farmers who are forced to sell livestock because of an adverse event to deposit the assessable income from the forced sale into the scheme. The amount deposited will not become taxable until the year in which it is with- drawn. The “maximum deposit” into the scheme is determined by subtracting the “cost” of the stock sold from the livestock sale proceeds. The cost is deemed to be the preceding year’s livestock value of the class the live- stock sold would have been at the end of the current year had it not been sold. A problem arises if a farmer did not have such livestock on hand at the end of the 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) previous year. In these cases, there will be no cost value attributable to the livestock sold. Key features An amendment to the definition of maximum deposit in section OB 1 clarifies what to do when this problem arises. Under the amended legislation the cost of livestock sold will be: • if all livestock of the class sold were on hand at the beginning of the year, the opening book value (deter- mined as if section EL 5(2) did not apply) of that livestock in the income year of sale; • if all livestock of the class sold were purchased in the same year, the average purchase price of the livestock purchased before the forced sale; • if livestock of the class sold were both on hand at the beginning of the year and purchased during the year, the weighted average of the opening book value (determined as if section EL 5(2) did not apply) in the income year of sale and the average purchase price of livestock of that class purchased before the forced sale. Example At the end of the 1995-96 year a farmer has rising one-year steers on hand which are sold as a result of an adverse event in the 1996-97 year. As the cattle would have been rising two-year steers at the end of the 1996-97 year, the farmer must apply the 1995-96 rising two-year value to the number of steers sold to determine their cost. However, if the farmer did not have rising two-year steers at the end of the 1995-96 year there will be no cost value to attribute to the livestock sold. The amendment prescribes the method to be used to determine cost in this eventuality. Assume that the farmer has 10 steers of a class at the beginning of a year with an opening value per head of $180, and purchases a further 20 at $400 per head before the adverse event occurred. The farmer then sells 10 steers of this class because of the adverse event. On a weighted average basis, the cost of the stock sold would be $327 per head for the purposes of determining the maximum deposit. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. Definition amendments - shares of the same class Section OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment deletes the term “specified class” in the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and “transitional capital amount” definitions and replaces it with references to “shares of the same class as the share”. It also extends the application of the definition “shares of the same class” to section OB 1 itself. Background As a result of the reordering of the Income Tax Act 1976 the term “specified class” was left undefined in the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and “transitional capital amount” definitions. The term “shares of the same class” is defined in section OB 1 for the purposes of sections CF 2 to CF 5 and FC 4. However, it is also used in the definition of “available subscribed capital per share” in section OB 1. Key features The term “specified class” in the “available subscribed capital per share cancelled” and “transitional capital amount” definitions has been deleted and replaced with the phrase “shares of the same class as the share”. The application of the “shares of the same class” definition has been extended to section OB 1 itself. Application date These amendments apply retrospectively from the enactment date of the Income Tax Act 1994, 1 April 1995. 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Qualifying companies - trustee shareholders Section OB 3, Income Tax Act 1994/Section 393B, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction An amendment provides that a qualifying company will not lose its qualifying company status if all dividend income is not vested or paid as beneficiary income. Background The intention of the qualifying company rules is to treat small, closely-held companies in a similar way as partnerships. The main effects are: • Capital gains can be distributed tax-free. • Losses incurred by a qualifying company can be passed through to shareholders, as long as certain conditions are met. To ensure that the rules are open only to closely-held companies, entry is limited to companies with five or fewer shareholders, with family members being counted as one shareholder. If a trustee of a trust owns shares in a qualifying company, it is the beneficiaries of the trust, not the trustees, which “count” as shareholders when determin- ing whether the company has five or fewer sharehold- ers. The mechanism used for ensuring the qualifying company rules are not undermined is the requirement that any trustee shareholder pays or vests dividends received from the qualifying company as beneficiary income. Beneficiaries receiving that beneficiary income are then deemed to be shareholders of the qualifying company. The Government recently became aware of cases where a company having already gained qualifying company status can lose that status because a trustee shareholder is unable under general trust law to vest or pay dividend income as beneficiary income. The amendment ad- dresses this difficulty. Key features Changes have been made to the qualifying company rules so that: • qualifying companies, subject to the rule below, will not be excluded from the rules if the trust pays or vests as much of the dividend income as is allowed under general trust law; and • the dispensation will apply only if dividends have been paid or vested as beneficiary income since the company became a qualifying company. Under the new rules, circumstances may arise where no dividends are paid or vested as beneficiary income. In those cases, dividends vested or paid as beneficiary income in previous years will be the base for determin- ing the shareholder count for the company. No amend- ment is required to achieve this treatment. If dividend income is retained by the trustee because it cannot be distributed under general trust law (for example, when the trust has losses to carry forward) those dividends will be either fully imputed or exempt - in line with normal qualifying company rules. No amendment is required to achieve this treatment. The amendment does not relax the “entry” requirement for qualifying companies. In other words, it will not allow companies to become qualifying companies if a trustee shareholder is unable to meet the paying or vesting of income requirements. Application date The amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year, the year the qualifying company rules were introduced, and to the extent that any dividend or amount is paid by a qualifying company to a person in that person’s 1991-92 income year, the 1991-92 income year. Provisional tax: consistent treatment of provisional taxpayers Section MB 2 (3)(c), Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction An amendment ensures that provisional taxpayers benefiting from an extension of time for filing their income tax returns through an agent (and who do not estimate their provisional tax) are required to pay their third instalment of provisional tax based on 105% of the residual income tax for the immediately preceding income year. This applies whether or not that tax return has been filed by the due date of that instalment. Background Taxpayers who have not estimated and have not filed a tax return for the immediately preceding income year can pay their first two provisional tax instalments based on 110% of the residual income tax for the income year before the immediately preceding income year. However, they must base their third instalment of provisional tax on their previous year’s income (plus the 105% uplift factor), whether or not the tax return for 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) that income year has been filed by the due date for the third provisional tax instalment. This has always been the policy intent, but it was not correctly reflected in the law. Previously, this requirement only applied to cases when taxpayers were required to file income tax returns “on or before the relevant instalment date”. It did not apply to cases where taxpayers were entitled to file income tax returns after the “relevant instalment date” because of extension of time arrangements a taxpayer’s agent may have. The amendment ensures that the third provisional tax instalment is based on 105 percent of the taxpayer’s residual income tax for the immediately preceding income year. If no return is filed at that date, the taxpayer should make an estimate of the amount due on that date and pay on that basis. Key features Section MB 2 (3)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been repealed and substituted with a new section MB 2 (3)(c). The new section makes it clear that if a taxpayer has not filed a tax return for the immediately preceding income year on or before the due date for the third instalment of provisional tax, whether by reason of an extension of time or failure to file, the third provi- sional tax instalment is to be based on 105% of the residual income tax of the immediately preceding income year. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. Provisional tax: treatment of natural person trustees Section 121(4), Tax Administration Act Introduction An amendment clarifies that natural person trustees with residual income tax of less than $30,000 are required to pay use of money interest from their third provisional tax instalment date. Background Use of money interest is paid by: • all provisional taxpayers who are not natural persons; • all provisional taxpayers who are natural persons whose residual income tax is greater than $30,000, or who have estimated their income for provisional tax purposes or held a resident withholding tax certificate of exemption at any time during the income year; • any natural person in that person’s capacity as a trustee, but only in respect of trustee income. For provisional tax purposes, natural person trustees, in respect of trustee income, are treated in the same way as corporate trustees. Subsections 121(3) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide the dates from which use of money interest is payable for each category of provisional taxpayer. Section 121(4) does not mention natural person trustees. This effectively omits natural person trustees from the use of money interest rules if the residual income tax payable on the trustee income is less than $30,000 and they have paid on the basis of the previous year’s residual income tax. Key features Section 121(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to specifically refer to natural person trustees whose residual income tax is equal to or less than $30,000. A corresponding amendment has been made to section 398A of the Income Tax Act 1976. Application date The amendment first applies to tax on income derived in the 1994-95 income year and subsequent years. Provisional tax: remission provisions Section 121(7), Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction An amendment clarifies the provisional tax use of money interest remission provisions to ensure they cannot be used to provide relief from any changes in the use of money interest rates. Background Under section 121(7) the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is in some instances required to remit provi- sional tax use of money interest. This applies to interest payable from a provisional tax due date if that interest is 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) attributable to any Amendment Act, Order in Council or change in a public ruling by the Commissioner “relating to income tax” that takes effect on or after the first day of the month preceding the month in which an instal- ment of provisional is due. This provision was designed to provide specific relief from use of money interest if an increase in the underly- ing tax liability could not reasonably have been foreseen by the taxpayer before the instalment was due. It was not designed to provide relief from increases in the rate of use of money interest (authorised by an Order in Council) if the rate change is introduced in the month immediately prior to the month in which an instalment of provisional tax is due. Key features Section 121(7) has been amended to exclude the application of any Order in Council promulgated under section 121(10) of the Tax Administration Act (which relates to provisional tax use of money interest rates and the threshold at which interest is paid). Application date The amendment from the date of enactment, 12 Decem- ber 1995. Provisional tax- reference corrections Section HG 12 (1)(a), Income Tax Act 1994 Section HG 12 (1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 links the due date for paying qualifying company election tax with the due date for paying terminal tax. Sections MC 1 (2) and MC 2 (2) provide the due dates for paying terminal tax. Section HG 12 (1)(a) incor- rectly refers to sections MB 10 (2) and MC 2 (2) instead of sections MC 1 (2) and MC 2 (2). Section HG 12 (1)(a) has been amended to correctly refer to section MC 1 (2). Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. Section 121, Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 121 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 charges provisional tax use of money interest. Section 121(2) refers to the amount of income tax “due and payable under this section”. Income tax is imposed by section BB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and is paid in accordance with Part M of that Act, not under section 121 of the Tax Administration Act. Section 121 has been amended to refer to the amount of income tax treated as due and payable for the purposes of section 121. A corresponding amendment has been made to section 398A of the Income Tax Act 1976. Application date The amendment first applies with respect to tax on income derived in the 1994-95 income year and subse- quent years. Section 178(4), Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 144 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes additional tax for underestimation. Taxpayers seeking relief from the underestimation penalty must qualify under section 178. Because specific remission provisions are provided in section 178, taxpayers are precluded from using the general remission provisions of section 182. Although section 178(4) attempted to do this, it refers to addi- tional tax payable “under this section”, when it is clearly payable under section 144. Section 178(4) and been repealed. Section 144(3) has been repealed and substituted with a new section which correctly reflects the policy. Corresponding amendments have been made to sections 385 and 386 of the Income Tax Act 1976 Application date The amendment first applies with respect to provisional tax payable on income derived in the 1994-95 income year and subsequent years. Section 121(10), Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 121(10) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains the authority to promulgate regulations for the purposes of setting provisional tax use of money interest rates and determining thresholds for whether or not use of money interest is payable. Section 121(10)(b) contains incorrect cross-references. It has been amended so that it applies for the purposes of sections 121 and 122 of the Tax Administration Act generally. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) International tax rules - excluded countries Schedule 3, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction Norway has been added to Part A of Schedule 3 (the “grey list”), which lists countries not subject to the provisions of the international tax rules. Canadian non- resident owned investment corporations have been added to Part B of Schedule 3, which sets out disqualifying features of the taxation law of grey list countries. Background The grey list exempts New Zealand residents from the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign invest- ment fund (FIF) rules in respect of income earned from companies resident in a grey list country. A country is placed on the grey list if it imposes taxes of a similar amount that would be imposed if the income was derived in New Zealand. The Government announced in the 1992 Budget that a country would be included on the grey list if it met the following criteria: • It must have strong anti-avoidance rules, such as its own CFC rules. • It must impose on companies resident therein an average effective tax rate on their income that is not less than 85% of the average effective tax rate that is intended to be imposed by New Zealand tax law on New Zealand resident companies in any income year. • It must have a tax treaty with New Zealand. • It must have a tax base similar to that of New Zealand. • Its income and expense recognition rules should be no more favourable than that of New Zealand. • It should have few or no tax incentives, other than those that may be specified in Part B of Schedule 3. The Government has added Norway to the list as it now meets the criteria above. Part B of Schedule 3 lists preferences of countries on the “grey list”. If a CFC uses these preferences its New Zealand shareholders will be required to attribute income or loss of the CFC on a current basis, even though the CFC is located in a grey list country. The Government reviewed the tax rules of the countries currently on the grey list and decided that Canadian non-resident investment companies should be added to Part B of Schedule 3, as they offer a concessionary treatment for income derived in Canada. Taxpayers who have interests in these Canadian companies will not have the benefit of the grey list exemption. Key features Norway has been added to Part A of Schedule 3 (the “grey list”). Canadian non-resident owned investment corporations have been added to Part B of Schedule 3. Application date The amendments take effect from the beginning of the 1996-97 income year. Western Samoa tax credits now claimable in NZ Schedule 6, Income Tax Act 1994/Schedule 17A, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Western Samoa has been removed from Schedule 6, thereby allowing tax paid in Western Samoa to be claimed as a credit against New Zealand tax. Background In March 1993 the Government took action to stop New Zealand taxpayers taking advantage of a tax arrange- ment which was permitted under legislation which the Western Samoa Parliament had passed. Legislation was enacted in New Zealand with effect from 9 March 1993, which disallowed foreign tax credits for taxes paid in Western Samoa, other than tax credits relating to wages and salaries earned by New Zealand residents in Western Samoa. As a result of the New Zealand Government’s action, Western Samoa did not implement the arrangement. Now that Western Samoa has withdrawn the legislation New Zealand is removing Western Samoa from Schedule 6 to prevent innocent taxpayers being denied credits for tax they have paid in Western Samoa. Key features Western Samoa has been removed from Schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (and Schedule 17A of the Income Tax Act 1976). Schedule 6 specifies countries and taxes paid on types of income from those countries for which no tax may be claimed as a credit in New Zealand. Removing Western Samoa from Schedule 6 allows tax paid in Western Samoa to be claimed as a credit against New Zealand tax. Application date The amendment applies from 9 March 1993, the date Western Samoa was inserted in Schedule 17A of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now Schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) GST - double dipping Section 2(1), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction A loophole in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 that permits two input tax deductions to be claimed in respect of the same goods has been closed. If goods are supplied by an unregistered non-resident to a registered person (for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies), and the registered person enters the goods for home consumption, the only GST deduction allowable will be for the GST charged by New Zealand Customs on importation. Background The GST Act previously allowed two input tax deduc- tions to be claimed in respect of the same goods. This occurred when goods were supplied by a non-resident (who had not registered for GST purposes) to a regis- tered person, and at the time of importation the goods were owned by the non-resident. On importation, New Zealand Customs charges GST on the importer. If the importer is a registered person who has acquired the goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, the GST charged by Customs is allowable as an input tax deduction to that person. A second input tax deduction arose if the non-resident subsequently sold the goods, the second supply being the supply of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand. Key features Paragraph (c) of the definition of “input tax” has been amended to exclude secondhand goods that have previously been supplied by a non-resident to a regis- tered person who entered the goods for home consump- tion under the Customs Act 1966. Application date The change applies to supplies made on or after 21 June 1995, the date of the Minister of Revenue’s announce- ment. It also applies to supplies made before that date if the registered person had not filed a return before 21 June 1995 in which a claim had been made. Claims will be allowed if a registered person entered into an unconditional contract before 21 June 1995, if the return for the taxable period in which the unconditional contract was entered into had not, as at that date, been filed. GST - associated persons Section 2(1)(a), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction The “associated persons” definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been extended to include a trustee-beneficiary relationship. Background The definition of “associated persons” in the Act referred to a trustee-beneficiary relationship in terms of a person being a “trustee for” another. This was not sufficient when that other person was a discretionary beneficiary only. Following the case of D H Cook Ltd v CIR (1973) 1 NZTC 61,104, a person was not a trustee “for” another person when there were other persons who may also have been discretionary beneficiaries. This meant that taxable supplies involving discretionary trusts were not always subject to the usual rules con- cerning the amount of consideration that the Act deems to have been paid on supplies between associated persons. The amendment ensures that discretionary beneficiaries are included in the definition. Key features The amendment provides that any two persons are associated when one is the trustee of a trust under which the other has benefited or is eligible to benefit. A person is “eligible to benefit” when he or she is either: • named by the trust deed as a potential beneficiary; or • designated as a member of a class of potential benefi- ciaries (for example, “the children of ...”). When trustees have a general power of appointment, persons not already appointed as beneficiaries under the power are excluded from the definition. The amendment is structured to provide that the associated persons definition does not apply to supplies from charities and non-profit bodies to their beneficiar- ies, if the charities and non-profit bodies have wholly or principally charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes, and the supplies are being made in the carrying out of those purposes. This is to prevent these charities and non-profit bodies from having to account for output tax on supplies made to beneficiaries based upon the open market value of those supplies, even though they are made for no, or nominal, consid- eration. Application date The amendment applies to supplies made on or after 17 August 1995, the date of the bill’s introduction. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) GST - input tax credits for dwellings Sections 5, 10 and 21, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction An amendment ensures that an input tax deduction is not allowable for any dwelling acquired by a registered person principally for a private or exempt activity purpose. Background The amendment is a result of the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Coveney and others that overturned Inland Revenue’s long-standing policy that the supply of a dwelling does not give rise to an input tax deduc- tion unless the dwelling itself had been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The Coveney cases involved farm land acquired from a non-registered person; that is, the claims were for a secondhand goods input tax credit. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that there was one supply of secondhand goods and that the definition of “input tax” does not allow for apportionment of the consideration for that supply. Because the land on which the dwelling was situated was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, a secondhand goods input tax credit was allowable in respect of the full purchase price. Key features Section 5 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended so that when a supply of real property is of more than just a dwelling, the dwelling will be deemed to be supplied separately from the rest of the property. Although not specified in the Act, any land necessary for the use and enjoyment of the dwelling will be treated as included in the supply of the dwelling. The amendment applies to all supplies that include a dwelling, and not just to dwellings situated on farm land, as was the situation in the Coveney cases. Subject to a transitional measure, and a measure to ensure that double taxation cannot occur, which are discussed below, if an input tax deduction has been claimed for a dwelling, any future supply of that dwelling (or part thereof) will be a taxable supply. If an input tax deduction has only been claimed for a propor- tion of the dwelling, only that proportion will be a taxable supply when the dwelling is sold or otherwise supplied. A transitional measure has been enacted that allows registered persons who have claimed an input tax deduction for a dwelling which is being used predomi- nantly as a place of residence or abode of an individual to repay that deduction. Registered persons who wish to use this opportunity must apply in writing before 1 August 1996 to do so. Unless registered persons use this opportunity, any future supply of the dwelling will be a taxable supply. The consideration in money for the supply in these cases is deemed to be equal to the cost of the dwelling, including any input tax deduction claimed. (There have been consequential changes to sections 10(8)(a) and 21(5)(a) to ensure that similar wording is used in these sections.) The legislation deems any future supply of a dwelling to be a taxable supply. This could result in double taxation if a registered person who acquired a dwelling for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies subse- quently applies that dwelling exclusively to making exempt supplies or for private purposes and makes a one-off adjustment under section 21 of the Act and, at some future time, sells or otherwise supplies the dwell- ing. In such situations, provided there has been no subsequent re-application of the dwelling to the princi- pal purpose of making taxable supplies, the supply of the dwelling will not be a taxable supply. Application date The change applies to: • supplies made on or after 11 August 1995, the date of the Minister of Revenue’s announcement: • supplies made before 11 August 1995, if the regis- tered person had not filed a return before the date in which a claim had been made: • supplies made before 11 August 1995, if the regis- tered person had made a claim which the Commis- sioner had disallowed and, as at that date, the person did not have a live objection or appeal in respect of the disallowed claim. Claims will be allowed if a registered person entered into an unconditional contract before 11 August 1995, if the return for the taxable period in which the uncondi- tional contract was entered into had not, as at that date, been filed. 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) GST - zero-rating of going concerns Section 78E, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction Section 78E of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been redrafted to ensure that it achieves the purpose for which it was introduced. Background The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1995 contained changes in relation to the zero-rating of going concerns. One of these changes was the addition of section 78E, which was designed to cover the situation when a supplier and recipient have treated the supply as that of a going concern and the Commissioner subse- quently charges GST on the supply. The details of the changes to the zero-rating provisions are set out in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No. 12, at page 31. Key issues A registered person who has zero-rated the supply of a taxable activity (on the understanding that it was a going concern) will be able to increase the sale price by the standard rate of GST (currently 12.5 percent) if both of these conditions are met: • The supply was not of a taxable activity as a going concern. • The contract is silent on the issue of any change to the consideration, or if the contract does not allow GST charged at zero percent to be increased to the standard rate. The provision does not apply if the contract has been entered into on a GST inclusive basis. Application date The amendment applies from the date the original section 78E was enacted, 10 April 1995. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act- minor remedial amendments Sections 11(2)(d), 13(1)(da) and 14(1)(da) Paragraph 11(2)(d) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 referred to the repealed Rural Housing Act 1939. Paragraphs 13(1)(da) and 14(1)(da) referred to the repealed Liquid Fuels Trust Act 1978. An amendment has been made repealing these redundant references. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 12 December 1995. Section 17 Section 17 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 has been amended by adding paragraph (g). Paragraph (g) provides an exemption from conveyance duty for any instrument creating a right, privilege, or license enti- tling the grantee to enter on land, to use land, or to take timber, minerals, or other profit from land. The amendment clarifies a recent amendment to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act which was intended to exempt from stamp duty any instrument creating a right, privilege, or license entitling the grantee to enter on land, to use land, or to take timber, minerals, or other profit from land. The amendment exempted such instruments from lease duty but arguably not convey- ance duty. Application date The amendment will apply to all instruments executed on or after 1 July 1994. GST returns - electronic filing Sections 3(1), 36 and 110(2), Tax Administration Act 1994 An amendment extends electronic filing of returns to GST returns. Electronic filing of GST returns will come into effect when approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The change applies from the date of assent, 12 December 1995. 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Totalisator duty on betting profits - calculation Sections 3, 4 and 5, Gaming Duties Act 1971 Introduction The basis on which totalisator duty is calculated in relation to race betting and betting on sporting events provided by racing clubs and the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) has been changed. Totalisator duty is now calculated on betting profits, which effectively reduces the tax on betting profits. Background Totalisator duty was previously payable at these rates: • For race meetings conducted by a totalisator club: at 5.5% of the gross investments; • For race meetings conducted by a restricted totalisator club: at the rate of 5% of the amount (if any) by which the gross investments on a day’s races exceeded $300,000; and • All special investments: at the rate of 5.5%. A totalisator club was entitled to claim a deduction equal to 2.5 percent of the first $100,000 of gross investment each year. The previous duty was a tax on the turnover from racing. Following a review of the taxation of racing the Govern- ment decided that the taxation burden on racing should be reduced. The racing industry was concerned by what it saw as the heavy tax burden it bore in comparison with that of some other forms of gambling which are also subject to gaming duty. Key features Totalisator duty is now imposed at the rate of 20% of the betting profits. The previous exemption provided to restricted totalisa- tor clubs has been removed. The rebate provided to totalisator clubs has also been removed. Application date The changes apply to races held or a combination of races begun on or after 1 January 1996. They also apply to sporting events held or a combination of sporting events begun on or after 1 January 1996 following the enactment of sports betting provisions in the Racing Amendment Act. Detailed analysis The key amendment is to section 4 of the Gaming Duties Act 1971. Consequential amendments have also been made to sections 3 and 5. The amendments have introduced a 20% tax on “betting profits”. In general terms, betting profits equal the amount bet less the amount paid in dividends. However, two different methods have been prescribed in the legislation to arrive at the betting profits figure because of the difference in the way the Racing Act 1971 prescribes the calculation of dividends between totalisa- tor race betting on the one hand, and fixed-odds race betting and all sports betting on the other. Totalisator race betting In relation to totalisator race betting, the Racing Act prescribes that the pool available for distribution as dividends be the residual after subtracting totalisator duty, levies and commissions (payable to the New Zealand Racing Industry Board, the racing clubs and the TAB, as the case may be) from the total investment. In this situation the betting profit is computed as being the aggregate of these deductions. The betting profits of a racing club in respect of gross investments on a race or a combination of races will be an amount equal to the aggregate of the deductions (totalisator duty, levies and commissions) set out in sections 42(1)(a) to (g), 42(2)(a) to (g) and 61G(1)(a) to (h) of the Racing Act. The betting profits of the TAB in respect of special investments that are off-course betting, to which Part V of the Racing Act applies, will be an amount equal to the aggregate of the deductions set out in section 97(1)(a) to (f) of the Racing Act. If the betting profit is the aggregate of the deductions, the calculation requires the amount of totalisator duty payable to be taken into account. An alternative method for calculating the duty payable in this situation is to take 25 percent of deductions, exclusive of totalisator duty. This equates with 20% of the deductions, inclusive of totalisator duty. Fixed-odds betting and sports betting In relation to fixed-odds betting and sports betting, the Racing Act prescribes that the dividends payable should be deducted from the total investments, and the remain- ing profits distributed in accordance with the Act. In this situation the betting profit is computed by deduct- ing the amount of dividends paid from the total invest- ment. These are the amounts of the TAB’s betting profits from special investments: • For fixed-odds betting to which Part VA of the Racing Act applies, an amount (not being less than zero) equal to the total special investments less the divi- dends paid out. • For a sporting event or combination of sporting events, an amount (not being less than zero) equal to the total special investments less the dividends paid. 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) For fixed-odds race betting and fixed-odds sports betting, the TAB is able to carry forward losses that may arise from such betting. The losses are able to be offset against future fixed-odds race betting profits or fixed- odds sports betting profits as the case may be. Removal of exemptions and rebate The deductions included in the calculation of totalisator duty in section 4 have not been retained in the conver- sion to a tax on betting profits. The Government considered that the deductions were inconsistent with a betting profits tax, and unnecessarily complicated the tax legislation and the calculation of the tax. Other minor amendments The return filing requirement to deal with the introduc- tion of sports betting has also been amended. The amendments do not affect the taxation of gaming machine operators, lotteries or casinos. Racing - minor consequential amendments Sections CB 4 (1)(I), OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 Consequential amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 1994 following the passage of the Racing Amendment Act 1995. The names of the New Zealand Racing Authority and New Zealand Trotting Conference have been changed to the New Zealand Racing Industry Board and Harness Racing New Zealand respectively. Both bodies’ income is tax exempt under section CB 4 (1)(i). The definition of “excepted financial arrangement” in section OB 1 has been amended to include a bet on any sporting event under a sports-betting system established under Part VB of the Racing Act 1971. Application date The amendments apply from the date of assent of the Racing Amendment Act 1995, 15 December 1995. Sections 5(8), 5(8)(b), 10 (12) and 10(12A), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Consequential amendments have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 following passage of the Racing Amendment Act 1995. The definition of “supply” has been amended to include bets on any sporting event on any sports betting system under Part VB of the Racing Act 1971, as inserted by the Racing Amendment Act 1995. The value of supply of goods and services has been amended to include consideration given for fixed-odds race betting and sports betting. Application date The amendments apply from the date of assent of the Racing Amendment Act 1995, 15 December 1995. 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.9 (February 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. Investment Marketing Group Ltd’s Geared Equities Investment Product ruling - BR Prd 96/4 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section OB 1, and the “qualified accruals rules” as defined in section OZ 1 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangement to which this ruling applies The arrangement is an investment product known as Geared Equities Invest- ment (“GEI product”), which is issued in Australia by Macquarie Bank Limited (“Macquarie”), an Australian resident bank, and will be marketed by Investment Marketing Group Limited in New Zealand. The arrangement will be as follows: • Macquarie will offer to lend to persons who satisfy appropriate lending criteria (“investors”), 100% of the cost of acquiring shares, which are certain approved shares listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (“GEI loan”). • The “cost of acquiring shares” will include stamp duty, brokerage fees, and loan establishment fees. • The investor will have the option of requiring Macquarie to purchase any shares acquired by the investor under the GEI loan at the original cost of acquiring those shares (“GEI option”). The GEI option may be exercised at any time during the loan term by the investor. The proceeds from this sale are then able to be used by the investor to settle in full the GEI loan principal or an appropriate part thereof owing to Macquarie. • The investor may exercise the GEI option in respect of all shares held in one or more companies. • The terms of the GEI loan will be: - Macquarie will hold a mortgage over the shares acquired as security for the principal amount. - A Macquarie nominee company will hold all shares scrip as custodian for investors, but at all times the investor will remain the beneficial owner of the shares acquired. - The loan will be denominated in Australian dollars. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) - Interest only will be payable during the term of the loan. - The term will be fixed, with one to five-year terms, and the provision for investors to elect to rollover. • The investor as beneficial owner of the shares will receive all dividend income paid by the listed companies. • The investor will be free to select which shares to buy, how many shares, and when from a list of shares listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. • The investor will not be required to pay a separate fee for the GEI option. Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumptions that: 1. The investor will be a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes. 2. The investor will not be associated with Macquarie under the definition of “associated person” in section OB 1 (a) of the Act. The ruling GEI loan will be a “financial arrangement” The GEI loan will be a “financial arrangement” subject to the qualified accruals rules. Investor will be an “issuer” The investor will be an “issuer” under section OB 1 in respect of the GEI loan. “Maturity” of GEI loan Exercise of the GEI option resulting in full repayment of the balance of the GEI loan will involve “maturity” under section OB 1 requiring a base price adjust- ment under section EH 4 (1). Base price adjustment on full repayment of GEI loan Upon full repayment item ‘a’ of the investor’s base price adjustment on the GEI loan will equal the sum of: • all interest payments made under the GEI loan (converted from Australian dollars (“AUD”) to New Zealand dollars (“NZD”) at spot exchange rates prevailing at payment dates); and • the loan balance on the GEI loan repaid by Macquarie crediting the proceeds of exercise of the GEI option (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot ex- change rate on repayment). Item ‘b’ will be the AUD amount of the GEI loan from Macquarie to the investor (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate at the date of advance). Item ‘c’ will be the amounts of expenditure or income returned for income tax purposes from the GEI loan in previous years (reflecting interest payments and foreign exchange movements). Income or expense calculated under the base price adjustment will reflect: • interest payments (to the extent they have not been returned); and • foreign exchange gains and losses on the AUD denominated GEI loan principal. Income or expense arising under the base price adjustment will not reflect any deemed forgiveness of debt or discharge of the GEI loan, being a financial ar- from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) rangement, for an inadequate consideration where an investor exercises the GEI option. Part repayment of the GEI loan Part repayment of the GEI loan by exercise of the GEI option over some but not all of the shares will not involve “maturity” of the loan. It will not require a base price adjustment for the investor. A base price adjustment will be required when an investor’s GEI loan matures, is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred. A partial repayment (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate at the date of repayment) should be included in item ‘a’ when a base price adjustment is performed. That base price adjustment will apply the methodology set out above. Foreign exchange gains and losses GEI investors will be required to account for any foreign exchange gain or loss arising on the AUD denominated GEI loan under the accruals rules according to their own personal circumstances. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies for GEI loans entered into in the period from 1 January 1996 to 31 March 2001. Signed Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) Analysis of product ruling BR Prd 96/4 This analysis does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Background The arrangement is described under the heading “Arrangement to which this ruling applies” in the ruling. The ruling concerns the consequences upon an inves- tor’s base price adjustment under the accruals rules for the GEI loan. Specifically, it concerns the result of that base price adjustment where an investor exercises the GEI option to enable repayment of part (or all) of the GEI loan. Where the investor exercises the option, the investor sells shares to Macquarie at the cost of acquir- ing the shares, which is equivalent to the principal lent on the GEI loan to purchase those shares (in both cases in Australian dollars (“AUD”)). Definitions in legislation Under section OB 1, the expression “financial arrange- ment” includes “\[a\]ny debt or debt instrument”. The GEI loan is a financial arrangement subject to the accruals rules. Also under section OB 1, “excepted financial arrange- ment” means: (g) In relation to a holder or an issuer, ... an option ... to sell or otherwise dispose of shares ... On its own, the GEI option would accordingly be an excepted financial arrangement. “Holder”, for our purposes, under section OB 1: (a) Means- ... (iii) In relation to an option to sell or otherwise dispose of property, a person who is a grantee of the option: ... (v) In relation to any other financial arrangement, a person who, if the amount or amounts payable under the financial arrangement were due and payable at that time, would be entitled to receive, or would receive a pecuniary benefit from, payment of the amount or amounts so payable or any part of them;- “Issuer”, for our purposes, is defined in section OB 1 as: (a) In relation to a financial arrangement at any time, means a person who is a party to the financial arrangement and is not a holder in relation to the financial arrangement: ... continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) (ii) In the case of an issuer, all amounts of expenditure incurred in respect of the financial arrangement in all previous income years since the issue of the financial arrangement, less the aggregate of- (A) All amounts that are income deemed to be derived under section EH 1 or section EH 3 or section EH 6 by the person in respect of the financial arrange- ment in all previous income years since the issue of the financial arrangement; and ... Two approaches to GEI product In the Commissioner’s view, the GEI product could be viewed in two ways, namely: • purely as a loan (with an excepted financial arrange- ment option, that can be ignored for these purposes); or • as a composite financial arrangement being a loan with an option attached. Loan base price adjustment If the GEI product is viewed as a pure loan, and an investor is accordingly an issuer, the following will be the components of a base price adjustment calculation upon maturity. Item ‘a’ will equal the sum of: • all interest payments made under the GEI loan (converted from AUD to New Zealand dollars (“NZD”) at spot exchange rates prevailing at payment dates); and • the loan balance on the GEI loan repaid by Macquarie crediting the proceeds of exercise of the GEI option (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate on repayment). Item ‘b’ will be the “acquisition price” of the GEI loan. This will effectively be the “core acquisition price” under paragraph (e)(ii) of the section OB 1 definition of that term, namely: In relation to an issuer of the financial arrangement, the value of all consideration provided to the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement: Accordingly, the acquisition price of the GEI loan is the AUD amount of the loan from Macquarie to the investor (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate at the date of advance). Item ‘c’ will be the amounts of expenditure or income returned from the GEI loan in previous years (reflecting interest payments and foreign exchange movements). Income or expense calculated under the base price adjustment will reflect: • interest payments (to the extent they have not been returned); and • foreign exchange gains and losses on the AUD denominated loan principal. If an investor is viewed purely as a borrower under the GEI loan, it is an “issuer” under section OB 1 for accruals rules purposes. If the GEI loan were due and payable the investor would not be entitled to receive any pecuniary benefit from amounts payable. On this basis, Macquarie would be the “holder”. (Note that if the GEI option was a separate financial arrangement from the GEI loan an investor would be a holder in respect of it. An investor would be a grantee of the option). Maturity of GEI loan Section OB 1 also provides: ‘Maturity’, in relation to a financial arrangement, means the date on which the last payment contingent upon the financial arrangement is made ... Where the investor exercises the GEI option to repay all of the principal owing on the GEI loan, the investor will have made the last payment contingent on the GEI loan. Accordingly, there will be “maturity” of the GEI loan. Where the investor exercises the option to repay only part of the GEI loan, there will not be “maturity”. Maturity of a financial arrangement necessitates the investor performing a base price adjustment. Base price adjustment on maturity Section EH 4 (1) provides that a base price adjustment shall be calculated: ... where, in relation to any person, a financial arrangement matures ... in any income year, the amount of the base price adjustment in relation to that income year, that person, and that financial arrangement shall be an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - (b + c) where- ais- (i) In the case of a holder, the sum of- (A) The amount of all consideration that has been paid, and all further consideration that has or will become payable, to the person; and (B) Any amounts that have been remitted by the person and that are not included in subsubparagraph (A): (ii) In the case of an issuer, the amount of all considera- tion that has been paid, and all further consideration that has or will become payable, by the person- in relation to the financial arrangement; and bis the acquisition price of the financial arrangement in relation to the person; and cis- (i) In the case of a holder, all amounts that are income derived, less the aggregate of amounts of expenditure deemed to be incurred under section EH 1 or section EH 6 or deemed to be an allowable deduction under section EH 3 by the person in respect of the financial arrangement in all previous income years since the acquisition of the financial arrangement; and from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Income or expense arising under the base price adjust- ment will not reflect any deemed forgiveness of debt or discharge of the GEI loan for an inadequate considera- tion where an investor exercises the GEI option. Example 1: loan base price adjustment Assume that an investor is introduced by IMG to Macquarie and is lent AUD$100,000 by Macquarie. The AUD/NZD exchange rate is 1.1500 (and the NZD/AUD exchange rate is 0.8696). The investor applies this AUD$100,000 as follows: GEI loan establishment costs$ 700 Stamp duty$ 147 Brokerage$ 1,224 Value of shares purchased $ 97,929 Total AUD$100,000 Accordingly, the investor purchases AUD$97,929 worth of shares. Subsequently, the investor pays AUD$10,000 of interest. The AUD/NZD exchange rate at the date of payment is 1.1000. The value of the shares drops to AUD$80,000 and the investor exercises its option against Macquarie. The AUD/NZD exchange rate at the date of pay- ment is 1.0500. Assume that the investor has not yet returned any income or expense for income tax purposes under the GEI loan. The investor’s base price adjustment would accord- ingly be: a - (b + c) where: a = (100,000 x 1.0500) + (10,000 x 1.1000) b = 100,000 x 1.1500 c = 0 giving: 116,000 - (115,000 + 0) = NZD$1,000 (expenditure) Note that item ‘a’ is the amount of consideration paid by the investor. The first bracketed component is the NZD equivalent of AUD$100,000, the amount of the GEI loan repaid, not AUD$80,000, the market value of the shares put under the GEI option. This NZD$1,000 expenditure can be viewed as the sum of: • NZD$11,000 interest expense; and • NZD$10,000 foreign exchange gain on the GEI loan principal. The NZD$10,000 foreign exchange gain arises because AUD has depreciated. The investor has a reduced loan liability (in NZD) due to the deprecia- tion. The investor’s foreign exchange gain would have been accruals income, if there had been no interest payment. Composite financial arrangement base price adjustment Alternatively, the GEI product can be viewed as a composite financial arrangement involving both a loan and an option as one financial arrangement. The Commissioner considers that, in terms of the comments by Gault J in CIR v Dewavrin Segard (NZ) Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,048, 11,052, there is interaction or inter- dependence between the elements of the GEI product. The Commissioner has also considered the question of whether the listed Australian shares purchased with the GEI loan, and the dividends paid on them, could also be viewed as part of this composite financial arrangement. The Commissioner considers that the shares should not be so viewed, in this case. “Holder” As the GEI product arrangement is wider than “an option to sell or otherwise dispose of property”, the investor’s status as “holder” or “issuer” falls to be determined under paragraph (a)(v) of the “holder” definition in section OB 1. In the Commissioner’s view, in the situation envisaged in paragraph (a)(v), an investor would be entitled to receive a “pecuniary benefit” under the GEI product. The investor would accordingly be a holder of the composite financial arrangement. Base price adjustment calculation Exercise of the option to sell all of an investor’s shares would trigger “maturity” of the composite financial arrangement and a base price adjustment. In these circumstances, item ‘a’ of the investor’s base price adjustment will be the sum of: • the AUD amount of the loan from Macquarie to the investor (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate at the date of advance); and • the AUD amount applied by Macquarie to the inves- tor’s account, to repay the balance of the investor’s GEI loan, upon exercise of the GEI option (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate at the date of application). Item ‘b’, the investor’s acquisition price, will be the sum of: • all interest payments made under the GEI loan (converted from AUD to NZD at spot exchange rates prevailing at payment dates); and • the market value of the shares provided by the inves- tor to Macquarie upon exercise of the GEI option (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate at the date of exercise); and • the loan balance on the GEI loan repaid by Macquarie crediting the proceeds of exercise of the GEI option (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate on repayment). continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Consideration paid by the investor: • interest payment of AUD$10,000 @ 1.1000. • shares upon exercise of the put of AUD$80,000 @ 1.0500. • loan repayment of AUD$100,000 @ 1.0500. The investor’s base price adjustment would now be: a - (b + c) where: a = (100,000 x 1.1500) + (100,000 x 1.0500) b = (10,000 x 1.1000) + (80,000 x 1.0500) + (100,000 x 1.0500) c = 0 giving: 220,000 - (200,000 + 0) = NZD$20,000 (income) Breakdown of result This NZD$20,000 gain can be broken out as: 1. interest expense:(11,000) 2. effect of AUD depreciation on GEI loan principal (as in first base jprice adjustment):10,000 3. gain on GEI option (ignoring foreign exchange movement):23,000\* 4. effect of AUD depreciation on gain on GEI option: (2,000) † NZD$20,000 \* = (AUD$100,000 - AUD$80,000) x 1.1500. † = (AUD$20,000 x 1.0500) - (AUD$20,000 x 1.1500). Alternatively, items 3 and 4 could be combined and expressed as the net option gain of NZD$21,000. Items 1 and 2 are the same as in the simpler base price adjustment. Applying section EH 2, items 1 and 2 are expendi- ture or gains solely attributable to the loan element of the GEI product and properly subject to the accruals rules. In the Commissioner’s view, items 3 and 4 are however gains or losses solely attributable to the GEI option element of the wider GEI product. They must be excluded from accruals calculations, including the investor’s base price adjustment. Accordingly the investor’s accruals expenditure under this base price adjustment would be NZD$1,000. Commissioner’s view on base price adjustment methodology The Commissioner considers that it is appropriate to not treat the GEI product as a composite financial arrange- ment. Where it is necessary to produce the correct economic result, the Commissioner may choose to apply the Item ‘c’ will the amounts of income or expenditure returned from the composite financial arrangement in previous years (reflecting foreign exchange movements and interest payments). Total income or expense calculated under the base price adjustment will reflect: • interest payments (to the extent they have not been returned); and • foreign exchange gains and losses on the AUD denominated loan principal; and • the gain on exercise of the GEI option; and • foreign exchange gains and losses on the GEI option. Again, income or expense arising under the base price adjustment will not reflect any deemed forgiveness of debt or discharge of the GEI loan for an inadequate consideration where an investor exercises the GEI option. Section EH 2 Section EH 2 provides that: The amount of the income deemed to be derived or the expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in respect of a financial arrangement under the qualified accruals rules shall not include the amount of any income, gain or loss, or expenditure, that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement that is part of the financial arrangement. If the GEI product is a composite financial arrange- ment, then it is an arrangement with financial arrange- ment (loan) and excepted financial arrangement (op- tion) elements. Applying section EH 2, any income, gain, loss or expenditure that is solely attributable to the option must be excluded from income or expense under the accruals rules, including under a base price adjust- ment. The interest payments and foreign exchange gains and losses on the AUD denominated loan princi- pal are not attributable to the option and must be brought to account for accruals purposes. In the particu- lar facts of this case, the Commissioner considers that the gain on exercise of the GEI option and foreign exchange gains and losses on the GEI option are solely attributable to the option excepted financial arrange- ment and should be excluded from accruals income or expense. Example 2: composite financial arrangement base price adjustment The facts are as in Example 1 above. On the wider GEI product financial arrangement, the following consideration flows to and by the investor under our example: Consideration paid to the investor: • loan borrowed of AUD$100,000 @ 1.1500. • application of put option to the investor’s account of AUD$100,000 @ 1.0500. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) accruals rules to a wider, composite financial arrange- ment. The rules do not require this in this case as the simpler loan approach produces the correct economic, and a fair, result. Part repayment of the GEI loan Part repayment of the GEI loan by exercise of the GEI option over some but not all of the shares will not involve “maturity” of the loan. It will not trigger a base price adjustment for the investor. A base price adjustment will be required when an investor’s GEI loan matures, is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred. A partial repayment (converted from AUD to NZD at the spot exchange rate at the date of repayment) should be included in item ‘a’ when a base price adjustment is performed. That base price adjustment will apply the methodology set out earlier under the heading “Loan base price adjustment”. Norwich Union Life Insurance (NZ) Ltd’s Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) Product ruling - BR Prd 95/11 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections BB 4, BB 7, BB 8 (c) and CB 5 (1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangement to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to an insurance product known as an Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) issued by Norwich Union Life Insurance (NZ) Limited (“Norwich”). Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumptions that: • The Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) is taken out by an individual and provides cover for that individual. • The terms and conditions of the Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) are contained in the Income Protection Policy Document (Indemnity Cover). The Income Protection Policy Document (Indemnity Cover) contains defined terms. Where those defined terms are used in this ruling they have the same meanings.

Signed Simon Sherry Rulings Analysis of product ruling BR Prd 95/11 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise indicated. Background A ruling has been sought on the assessability of benefits and the deductibility of premiums under Norwich’s Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover). Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 465(2) BB 7104 BB 8 (c)106(1)(k) CB 5 (1)(h)61(40) Without in any way limiting the meaning of the term, section BB 4 deems a number of items to be assessable income unless expressly excluded by the Act. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Section BB 7 states that: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it- (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Section BB 8 provides that notwithstanding anything in section BB 7, no deduction (except as expressly pro- vided in the Act) can be made in respect of: (c) Any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in gaining or producing income which is exempt from income tax: Section CB 5 (1)(h) exempts from tax: Income derived by any person, in respect of any period of incapacity for work, from any payment received by that person by way of a benefit under a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance, not being a payment calculated according to loss of earnings or profits: Indemnity Cover Policy Total Disability Benefit and Partial Disability Benefit Income received under a loss of earnings (“LOE”) policy is assessable, and the premiums are deductible under section BB 7. A LOE policy is a policy which provides for benefits calculated with reference to income lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation. Norwich’s Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) Total Disability Benefit and Partial Disability Benefit are calculated with reference to the Life Insured’s Pre- Disability Earnings. Both benefits contain a maximum cap on the benefit that can be paid, the maximum cap being the amount of the Monthly Benefit specified in the Policy Summary. The Total Disability Benefit and Partial Disability Benefit are calculated with reference to earnings or profits lost by the Life Insured. Therefore, the Total Disability Benefit and the Partial Disability Benefit are LOE benefits and are assessable income. The existence of a cap does not change this. Rehabilitation Benefit and Long Term Care Benefit The Rehabilitation Benefit and the Long Term Care Benefit are payments of the Monthly Benefit which is an amount specified under the policy and payable during the period of incapacity. The amounts are not calculated with reference to loss of earnings or profit, and therefore are personal sickness or accident (“PSA”) benefits which are exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h). Mixed benefit policy Norwich’s Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) is a mixed benefit policy because it contains both PSA and LOE benefits. The Commissioner accepts that under some mixed policies, only a negligible amount of each premium may relate to a flat sum (PSA) benefit while the rest of the premium relates to benefits calcu- lated according to loss of earnings or profits. If the amount of the premium attributable to the flat sum benefits is 2 percent or less, the whole of each premium can be deducted. The amount of premium attributable to flat sum benefits under the Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) (where no optional benefits are contracted for) is 2 percent or less. Applying the Commissioner’s policy, the amount of premium attributable to flat sum benefits is 2 percent or less, therefore the whole of the premium is deductible under section BB 7. Even though the whole of the premium for the Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) is deductible, the PSA benefits (the Rehabilitation Benefit and Long Term Care Benefit) are still exempt under section CB 5 (1)(h) upon receipt by the Life Insured. These flat sum benefits are exempt, although the premiums relating to these benefits are deductible. Indemnity Cover Policy Optional Benefits Nursing Care Benefit The Nursing Care Benefit is a payment of an amount specified under the policy, and is payable during the period of incapacity. The amount is not calculated with reference to loss of earnings or profit, and therefore is a PSA benefit and is exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h). As discussed above, Norwich’s Income Protection Policy (Indemnity Cover) is a mixed benefit policy because it contains both PSA and LOE benefits. The Commissioner accepts that under some mixed policies, only a negligible amount of each premium may relate to a flat sum benefit while the rest of the premium relates to benefits calculated according to loss of earnings or profits. If the amount of the premium attributable to the flat sum benefits is 2 percent or less, the whole of each premium can be deducted. The Rehabilitation Benefit and the Long Term Care Benefit are PSA benefits. Where the Life Insured has also contracted for the optional Nursing Care Benefit, the portion of premium relating to flat sum benefits exceeds 2 percent, and therefore the premiums must be apportioned on the basis of the benefits payable. The amount of premium relating to exempt benefits is non- deductible, and any benefits received are non-assessable to the Life Insured. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) The portion of premium paid for the Child Care Benefit is non-deductible from the income of the Life Insured under section BB 7. Guaranteed Insurability Option The Guaranteed Insurability Option is an option to increase the Monthly Benefit on specified option dates without further medical evidence. This option has no income tax consequences.

Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections BB 4, BB 7, BB 8 (c) and CB 5 (1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangement to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to an insurance product known as an Income Protection Policy (Business Expenses) issued by Norwich Union Life Insurance (NZ) Lim- ited (“Norwich”). Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumption that the terms and conditions of the Income Protection Policy (Business Expenses) are contained in the Income Pro- tection Policy Document (Business Expenses). The Income Protection Policy Document (Business Expenses) contains defined terms. Where those defined terms are used in this ruling they have the same meaning. Section CB 5 (1)(h) exempts from tax: Income derived by any person, in respect of any period of incapacity for work, from any payment received by that person by way of a benefit under a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance, not being a payment calculated according to loss of earnings or profits: Agreed Value Cover Policy (where no optional benefits are contracted for) Monthly Benefit A benefit received under a personal sickness or accident (“PSA”) policy is exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h), and premiums paid for a PSA policy are non-deductible under section BB 8 (c). A PSA policy is a policy that provides for payment of a sum or sums specified in the insurance policy, and which is payable if the insured person is incapacitated as a result of an accident or sickness. Norwich’s Income Protection Policy (Agreed Value Cover) Monthly Benefit is specified in the Policy Summary as a fixed dollar amount. Therefore, the Income Protection Policy (Agreed Value Cover) is a PSA policy of insurance. The benefits payable under the policy (the Total Disability Benefit, Partial Disability Benefit, Long Term Care Benefit, and the Rehabilita- tion Benefit) are PSA benefits. from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies from 17 July 1995 to 17 July 1998.

Debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection Public ruling - BR Pub 96/4 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section EH 4 (6) of the Income Tax Act 1994. It also applies in respect of sections GD 11 and BB 9. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies where an amount owing under a debt is forgiven by a natu- ral person in consideration of natural love and affection. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to amounts of debts forgiven in the 1996, 1997, and 1998 income years, and applies to taxpayers with standard, early, or late balance dates for these years. The ruling This ruling concerns section EH 4 (6) which allows relief for debtors (issuers) from assessability under the accruals rules. Section EH 4 (6) allows relief when an amount under a debt is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection. It does not apply when an amount is forgiven by a company. Section CB 5 (1)(h) exempts from tax: Income derived by any person, in respect of any period of incapacity for work, from any payment received by that person by way of a benefit under a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance, not being a payment calculated according to loss of earnings or profits: When the Income Protection Policy (Business Expenses) is owned by the Life Insured Total Disability Benefit When the Life Insured under the Income Protection Policy (Business Expenses) is the same person as the Policyholder, the Total Disability Benefit is a personal sickness or accident (“PSA”) benefit and is exempt from income tax under section CB 5 (1)(h). The premiums paid for the Total Disability Benefit will not be deduct- ible from the income of the Life Insured under section BB 8 (c). The Total Disability Benefit is paid when the Life Insured is unable to work in his or her usual occupation solely due to Sickness or Injury. Therefore, the Life Insured derives the benefit in respect of a period of incapacity for work. The payment is not calculated according to loss of earnings or profits. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Section EH 4 (6) can apply to: • A debt forgiveness between near relatives, such as father and child, brother and sister, husband and wife, and de facto parents; and • A debt forgiveness by testamentary disposition; and • A debt forgiveness by a trust settlor or creditor to a family trust, being a fixed trust where the creditor has or would have had a relationship of natural love and affection with all of the trust beneficiaries, other than residual or default beneficiaries; and • A debt forgiveness by a trust settlor or creditor to a family trust, being a discretionary trust where the creditor has or would have had a relationship of natural love and affection with all, or all the primary, trust objects or potential beneficiaries; and • A partial debt forgiveness; and • A conditional debt forgiveness (where the debt is not forgiven until the condi- tions are fulfilled), provided that, in each case, the requirements of the section are satisfied. The Commissioner considers that the section does not apply to: • A debt forgiveness to a company (including a family company); or • A debt forgiveness by a trustee to the trust beneficiaries; or • A debt forgiveness that forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of a provision such as section GD 11 or section BB 9.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/4 This analysis of the ruling, including the examples, does not form part of the ruling. The subject matter of this ruling was previously consid- ered in PIB 170 (February 1988), page 1. This ruling replaces that earlier item. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background The relevant provisions of the accruals rules are sections EH 1 to EH 9. Base price adjustment calculations for financial ar- rangements are contained in section EH 4. The base price adjustment is effectively a “wash up” calculation of all income or expenditure under a financial arrange- ment upon the maturity, transfer, or remission of that arrangement. Generally, under section EH 4, any principal, interest, or other amount payable on a financial arrangement that is “remitted” is assessable income to the issuer. Where the debt is remitted, the issuer is the debtor. This is illustrated by the examples below. Example 1 Creditor lends Debtor $50,000 repayable in two years with $10,000 interest. In the second year of the loan, however, Debtor is in financial difficulties. Creditor agrees to accept $50,000 with no interest in full and final settlement of Debtor’s obligations. The $10,000 interest is accordingly remitted in the second year. Debtor, however, claimed an income tax deduction for $5,000 of the interest in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume Creditor is not a cash basis holder. Debtor’s base price adjustment in the second year effectively results in the recapture of her income tax deduction of $5,000. She has assessable income of $5,000. Her assessable income is calculated as follows: a + (b - c) =$50,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) =- $5,000 (income). (A negative result is income for an issuer). continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) affection, the amount forgiven shall, for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules, be deemed to have been paid when the amount is forgiven. Application of legislation Requirements of section EH 4 (6) In summary, for section EH 4 (6) to apply: • There must be an amount owing. • It must be owing under a debt. • It may include any amount accrued and unpaid. • It must be forgiven. • It must be forgiven by a natural person. • It must be forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection. The following discusses some of the requirements of the subsection. “Debt” Section EH 4 (6) only applies when there is “an amount owing under a debt”. It is not available for forgiveness of all types of “financial arrangement” that may be subject to the accruals rules. “Financial arrangement” as defined in section OB 1 is a very broad term. For example, it includes sell-back and buy-back arrange- ments, debt defeasances, and assignments of income. None of these is, in itself, a debt. “Debt” is not defined in the Act. Accordingly, the expression is given its ordinary or common meaning. In legal terms a “debt” is understood to be a liquidated money demand or something recoverable in court by action for debt. A debt is a certain sum due from one person to another, either by record (e.g., court judg- ment) or in writing. “Forgiven” An amount under a debt must be “forgiven” for section EH 4 (6) to apply. The expression “forgiven” does not necessarily mean the same thing as “remitted” (as defined for accruals rules purposes in section EH 4 (9)(c)). “Remitted” includes a wider range of events that are not necessarily forgiveness. These events could include when the issuer has been released from making payments by operation of statute (e.g., the Insolvency Act 1967) or lapse of time (e.g., become statute barred). “Forgiven” is not defined in the Act. The expression must be given its ordinary or common meaning. That is the giving up of any claim to restitution or remedy for an obligation. That forgiveness must be a positive act by the creditor (holder) as opposed to a consequence of the operation of statute or the lapse of time. Such forgiveness is normally evidenced by a deed or other document. Partial forgiveness The Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) can apply to a partial debt forgiveness. The subsection applies in broadly the same way as to a full debt forgive- For Creditor, the holder of the financial arrange- ment, a bad debt deduction for the $5,000 forgiven would be available if the requirements of section EH 5 (1) were satisfied prior to the remission. Example 2 Assume that Creditor made the loan under Exam- ple 1 and that Debtor had claimed an income tax deduction of $5,000 in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume, however, that after the first year, Debtor’s financial difficulties lead the parties to agree that only $40,000 of principal and $10,000 of interest would be repaid in the second year’s full and final settlement. If the balance of the interest ($5,000) were deductible by Debtor in the second year, she would be assessable on $5,000 under the base price adjustment. This is because the deduct- ible interest in that year would partly offset her assessable remission income of $10,000. Debtor’s base price adjustment would be: a - (b + c) =$40,000 + $10,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) =- $5,000 (income). Creditor could only claim a deduction for the remission under section EH 5 (2) if she satisfied the requirements of that subsection prior to the remis- sion. Creditor would only be entitled to a bad debt deduction if she carried on a business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and was not associated with Debtor. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 999 EH 4 (6)64F(7B) EH 464F EH 564G GD 1164J Section EH 4 (6) allows issuers relief from the assess- ability of remissions for certain intra-family and private debts. It replaces, without material amendment, the former section 64F(7B) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 64F(7B) applied to debt forgiveness from 1 October 1987. Before 1 October 1987, section 64F(7A) applied to forgiveness by testamentary disposition, and section 64F(7) applied to other forgiveness. The terms and effect of those two subsections differ from sections 64F(7B) and EH 4 (6). Section EH 4 (6) applies to both testamentary and other debt forgiveness. Section EH 4 (6) It states: Where an amount owing under a debt (including any amount accrued and unpaid at the time of the forgiveness) is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) ness. It deems the amount forgiven to be paid for the purposes of the base price adjustment calculation. A difference, however, is that a partial debt remission does not trigger a base price adjustment, unless it accompa- nies maturity or transfer of the financial arrangement. Conditional forgiveness If a forgiveness is conditional, it does not occur until the conditions are fulfilled. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that the amount conditionally forgiven is not deemed paid under section EH 4 (6) until the conditions are fulfilled. “Natural person” The person forgiving the debt (the creditor or holder) must be a “natural person”. The expression “natural person” is a legal term. Its meaning is not altered by the Act. It is a human being as opposed to an artificial person (such as a company): Pharmaceutical Society v London & Provincial Supply Assn. (1880) 5 A.C. 857, 869-870. This item sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of “natural person” for deceased persons and for trusts settled by natural persons. “In consideration of natural love and affection” This requirement of the subsection confines it to family and other private transactions. It does not apply to business or commercial arrangements. The phrase “in consideration of natural love and affection” is another legal concept. It is not further defined in the Act. Natural love and affection is generally considered to subsist between near relatives, such as parent and child, brother and sister, and husband and wife. The Commis- sioner considers that natural love and affection can equally subsist within families with married or de facto married parents. Except as discussed below in relation to trusts, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) requires that the natural love and affection exist between the creditor and the debtor. The Commissioner considers that in some cases it would be possible for natural love and affection to be present outside the strict married or de facto married family. For example it could be present between life- long friends (although not ordinary friends or col- leagues). Inland Revenue does not propose to publish detailed rules or guidelines on the degree of relationship neces- sary to establish natural love and affection. This ques- tion can only be considered on a case by case basis. A forgiveness to a company or other non-natural person is not in consideration of natural love and affection. Debt is deemed paid If the requirements of section EH 4 (6) are satisfied, the amount of the debt forgiven is deemed paid. This includes any amount accrued and unpaid on the debt. This consequence is deemed for all purposes within the qualified accruals rules. The main provisions when this deemed payment is relevant are sections EH 4 (base price adjustment) and EH 5 (bad debts). Broadly, the effect for the issuer or debtor is that no assessable remission arises on a base price adjustment. For the holder or creditor, no bad debt deduction is available under section EH 5 because the amount forgiven is deemed paid. Also, any interest or accruals income forgiven is assessable to the holder, for the same reason. Example 3 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 1. Assume, however, that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4 (6) are satisfied. Debtor has claimed a $5,000 interest deduction in the first year. In the second year, rather than $5,000 of assessable income as in Example 1, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000. This is the balance of the interest remitted that is deemed paid. Her calculation would be: a - (b + c) =($50,000 + $10,000) - ($50,000 + $5,000) =$5,000 (expenditure). (The amount deemed paid, $10,000, is added into item ‘a’). Creditor is required over the two years to return the $10,000 of interest remitted as assessable income under the accruals rules. No bad debt deduction is available for the remission as it is deemed paid. Example 4 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 2. Assume, however, that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4 (6) are satisfied. Rather than $5,000 of assessable income as in Example 2, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000. This is the balance of the interest paid. The $10,000 of debt remitted is not assessable to Debtor, as Debtor is deemed to have paid it. Debtor’s calculation would be: a - (b + c) =($50,000 + $10,000) - ($50,000 + $5,000) =$5,000 (expenditure). Creditor is assessed on the $10,000 interest re- ceived. She is not entitled to a bad debt deduction for the remission as it is deemed paid. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Family trusts with certain residual or default beneficiaries A related question is whether the subsection applies if a fixed trust has certain residual or default beneficiaries for which the settlor does not have natural love and affection. For example, it is common for family trusts to have charities and similar bodies as residual beneficiar- ies. The Commissioner considers that this would not preclude the subsection from applying. The Commis- sioner considers that it will usually be sufficient if the creditor has, or would have had, natural love and affection for the primary beneficiaries of the trust. Section EH 4 (6) will not apply when a charity or other person unrelated to the person forgiving is a primary beneficiary. Similarly, the subsection will not apply when family members are not the obvious focus of a discretionary trust deed. Inland Revenue does not propose to publish guidelines on the distinction between primary and minor beneficiaries. If necessary, this issue can be considered on a case by case basis. Example 5 Son owes Father a debt of $10,000. Father dies, and his will provides for the debt to be forgiven. Section EH 4 (6) applies and Son is deemed to have paid the debt to Father for accruals purposes. Example 6 Mother has established a trust, with her children as beneficiaries as to one-third each. The residual beneficiary, if the other beneficiaries pre-decease, is a charity for the promotion of musical education. Mother has sold her business assets to the trust for a debt back owed by the trust of $100,000. Mother forgives the $100,000 debt in consideration of natural love and affection of the beneficiaries. Section EH 4 (6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. The existence of the residual beneficiary does not prevent the subsection applying. Example 7 Prior to his death, the deceased established a family discretionary trust for his children. He lent the trust money to pay for an overseas trip by his children. His will provided for the loans to be forgiven. Section EH 4 (6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. Situations where section EH 4 (6) does not apply The Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) is not applicable when: • The party that owes the debt which is forgiven is a company. This includes a family company or close Testamentary dispositions and trusts Taxpayers and advisers have asked Inland Revenue to set out the Commissioner’s interpretation of section EH 4 (6) for testamentary dispositions and trusts. Testamentary dispositions The question has arisen as to whether a deceased taxpayer can be a “natural person” for section EH 4 (6) purposes. For example, can section EH 4 (6) apply to a debt forgiveness by will when the other requirements of that provision are present? The Commissioner considers that the deceased can be a “natural person” and that section EH 4 (6) can apply. This is because, under section 24 of the Wills Act 1837 (UK), in relation to the property of the deceased, a will speaks and takes effect from the time immediately prior to the deceased’s death. (The Wills Act 1837 (UK) has been incorporated into New Zealand law). Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4 (6) will apply to a testamentary debt when its requirements would have been satisfied immediately prior to the deceased’s death. Family fixed trusts The issue has also arisen of whether the forgiveness of debt to a trust may satisfy section EH 4 (6). The situa- tion envisaged is when a trust settlor or creditor is a natural person. He or she has natural love and affection for the trust beneficiaries. The trust is a fixed trust (i.e., the trust deed sets out the share or interest that each beneficiary is to take) for beneficiaries. The trust owes the settlor or creditor a debt. The creditor forgives the debt to the trust. The Commissioner considers that the subsection can apply, provided that all the requirements are satisfied. The Commissioner considers that it is necessary to “look through” the trust from the creditor to the benefi- ciaries in determining whether there is natural love and affection. The presence or absence of that state between the creditor and the trustee, in his or her private capac- ity, is irrelevant. Similarly, the presence or absence of that state between the trustee and the beneficiaries is irrelevant. The state must exist, or have existed, between the natural person creditor and all of the trust’s beneficiar- ies (subject to the comments below about certain residual or default beneficiaries). Family discretionary trusts The position is less clear for discretionary trusts when the class of beneficiaries includes persons for whom the settlor or other creditor has natural love or affection. For the reasons outlined above, the Commissioner considers that the subsection can apply when either all, or all of the primary, trust objects or potential benefici- aries are persons for whom the creditor has or would have had natural love and affection. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) company. In the Commissioner’s view, a person can never have natural love and affection for a company or other artificial person. The Commissioner has considered submissions that focus upon the similari- ties between family companies and family trust arrangements. However, there is a clear legal distinc- tion between these chosen vehicles, in that a company has separate legal personality from its shareholders. Accordingly, any relationship between the creditor and the shareholders is irrelevant. • A trustee forgives a debt owed by the trust beneficiar- ies. This is irrespective of a trustee’s natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee’s natural love and affection arises in his or her personal capacity. It would be improper for the trustee to forgive a debt in consideration of his or her natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee could only forgive in accordance with his or her duties as trustee (as set out in the trust deed). At least in the statutory context of section EH 4 (6), the Commissioner considers that a trustee acting in his or her capacity as trustee is not a natural person. The settlor’s natural love and affection for the beneficiar- ies would also be irrelevant as the forgiveness would be by the trustee. • The debt forgiveness forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of a provision such as section GD 11 or BB 9. For example, an individual taxpayer owes a bank an amount under a debt which she cannot pay in full. The individual pays what she can, and the bank, in turn, transfers the balance of the debt to the taxpayer’s spouse for nominal consideration. The spouse forgives the balance supposedly within section EH 4 (6). In these circumstances the Commis- sioner might invoke an anti-avoidance provision such as section BB 9. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Policy statements This section of the TIB contains policy statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. Qualifying companies with trustee shareholders Summary A qualifying company (“QC”) may have shareholders who are trustees if all QC income (not including non- cash dividends apart from taxable bonus issues) derived by the trustee is beneficiary income. There is a limited exception to the requirement that all QC dividend income derived by the trustee must be beneficiary income and this is discussed below. The trust beneficiar- ies must be either natural persons or another QC. It is possible for a trustee shareholder to be a trustee of a trust which includes another trustee as beneficiary. However, the second trustee in the capacity of a trustee may not receive any dividend income from the QC, except for non-cash dividends other than taxable bonus issues. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 OB 1 - beneficiary income 226 OB 3 (1) - qualifying company393B OB 3 (3A)393B(3A) The definition of a QC in section OB 3 (1) imposes certain requirements for a company to be a qualifying company. Section OB 3 (1)(c) sets out some of these requirements: Each person who is at any time during the income year a shareholder in the company is- (i)A natural person (other than a trustee); or (ii) A trustee of a trust in respect of which all dividend income (not being income from non-cash dividends other than taxable bonus issues) derived by the trustee from any qualifying company during the income year is beneficiary income of beneficiaries (not being trustees or companies other than qualifying companies); or (iii)Another qualifying company; ... The requirement that all QC dividends derived by the trustee constitute beneficiary income is modified by section OB 3 (3A). Under that section, the QC will not lose its QC status if both of these conditions are met: • As much of the QC dividend income derived by the trustee as is available to be distributed under general trust law is beneficiary income of natural persons or other QCs; and • Since the company acquired QC status, at least some of the dividends derived by the trustee from the QC have vested or been distributed as beneficiary income of natural person or other QCs. Section OB 1 contains the following definition of “beneficiary income”: “Beneficiary income” in relation to any person who is a beneficiary of a trust for any income year, means income derived during that income year by a trustee of the trust which- (a) During that income year vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary; or (b) Is paid or applied by the trustee to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during, or within 6 months after the end of, that income year;- but does not include income derived by a trustee of the trust in any income year during which the trust is a superannuation fund: Policy Section OB 3 (1)(c)(ii) limits the situations in which a trustee can be a shareholder in a QC. These limits prevent the trustee distributing income from a QC to persons who are neither natural persons nor another QC. This is consistent with the legislative intent of the QC rules that ultimate control of a QC should rest with natural persons. Since any other QC is controlled by a limited number of natural persons, it is acceptable to include QCs (but not companies which are not QCs) as beneficiaries of a trust. Distributions to trustee beneficiaries Section OB 3 (1)(c)(ii) permits a QC shareholder to be a trustee of a trust, even when that trust’s beneficiaries 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) include trustees of another trust. However, none of those beneficiary trustees (in their capacity as trustees of another trust) can receive any beneficiary income being dividends (except for non-cash dividends other than taxable bonus issues) derived from any QC by the shareholder trustee. The shareholder trustee in the QC must ensure, within the powers granted to the trustee by the trust deed, that the cash dividends and taxable bonus issues derived from the QC are beneficiary income of either natural persons (not in their capacity as trustee) or another QC. In certain cases, where under general trust law not all of the QC dividends derived can be beneficiary income, the exception provided by section OB 3 (3A) which is discussed above may apply. Trustees who are also beneficiaries Trustee shareholders may be also be beneficiaries of the trust of which they are a trustee. They may receive beneficiary income from the trust. The Commissioner’s policy is that this does not breach section OB 3 (1)(c)(ii), provided the person is receiving that beneficiary income in the capacity of a beneficiary and not as trustee of that or any other trust. Example P is a shareholder in QC Ltd, a QC, and holds the shares as trustee for the X Family Trust. The beneficiaries of the X Family Trust are P, M, and Company Ltd. Company Ltd is a beneficiary only in its capacity as the trustee of the Y Family Trust. In the relevant income year, P, as trustee of the X Family Trust derives dividends from QC Ltd. QC Ltd will lose its QC status if: P distributes any cash dividends or taxable bonus issues from QC Ltd to Company Ltd. (It is not relevant whether or not Company Ltd is a QC: it is its status as a trustee that is relevant). QC Ltd may retain its QC status if: P distributes all the dividends from QC Ltd as beneficiary income to M or himself; but not Com- pany Ltd. The fact that P also happens to be a trustee as well as a beneficiary is acceptable, as he is receiving the beneficiary income in his capacity as a beneficiary. Subject to the powers in the trust deed, P may also distribute non-cash dividends in accordance with the trust document from QC Ltd (none of which are taxable bonus issues) to Company Ltd. ACC employer premium - accounting for experience rating adjustments Summary This item considers whether section ED 1 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 requires taxpayers to retrospec- tively adjust the deduction for the ACC employer premium payable on 31 May, if the experience rating adjustment occurs in an income year after they have claimed a deduction for the employer premium. The term “employer premium” in this item (called “premium from employers” in section ED 1 (2)) refers to the basic premium payable on 31 May before the experience rating adjustment. Experience rating is a process in which the safety record of the employer is taken into account in determining whether the employer receives a refund or has to pay an extra amount (load- ing) to ACC. If the experience rating adjustment occurs in an income year after the employer has claimed a deduction for the employer premium, the Commissioner’s view is that section ED 1 (2) does not apply to retrospectively adjust the employer premium deduction by the amount of the experience rating adjustment. For tax purposes, the amount of the adjustment is assessable or deductible in that subsequent income year. Refunds or loadings are GST inclusive, so employers who are GST registered persons need to account for the GST component of any experience rating adjustment in the taxable period in which the loading or refund occurs. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background Employers must pay the ACC employer premium by 31 May each year. The employer premium is based on the wages and salaries paid to the employer’s employees under section 101 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 (“the ARCI Act”). The employer premium calculation is subject to a two- step process: • The employer premium is payable on 31 May each year. • An “Experience Rating” assessment is carried out in November - July. Based on the employer’s accident record, the experience rating assessment process results in either a discount (employers receive a refund from ACC); or a loading (employers have to pay extra to ACC). Small employers who pay less than $10,000 in premi- ums in a year and who have not had a work injury claim during the year receive an automatic adjustment of the continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) premium payable under section 101 of the ARCI Act) to be deductible only in the income year that it is due and payable. • Section 101 of the ARCI Act imposes an obligation on the employer to pay a “basic premium” at such a rate prescribed by the ARCI Act. • Depending on the safety record of the employer, the basic premium payable under section 101 of the ARCI Act may be adjusted under section 104 of the ARCI Act. This item considers whether section ED 1 (2) requires taxpayers to retrospectively adjust the deduction for the employer premium if the experience rating adjustment occurs in an income year after the employer has claimed a deduction for the employer premium. Policy The experience rating adjustment of the employer premium payable in May is carried out over the follow- ing November-July period, and may result in an addi- tional loading or a refund. If the refund or loading from the experience rating adjustment is in the same income year as the employer premium payable on 31 May, the deduction is calculated by adjusting the employer premium by the amount of the experience rating adjustment. Taxpayers with a March balance date are generally in this category. If the refund or loading occurs in an income year subsequent to the employer premium deduction, the Commissioner’s view is that section ED 1 (2) does not apply to retrospectively adjust the employer premium deduction by the experience rating adjustment. Taxpay- ers will not need to file amended returns. For tax purposes, the refund or loading is treated as normal business income or expenses. Analysis Section ED 1 is not designed to retrospectively adjust the amount that is deductible in earlier income years. The predecessor to section ED 1, section 140A of the Income Tax Act 1976, was inserted in 1985 to standard- ise the different treatments of accident levy deductibility by making the levy deductible when it was due and payable. Taxpayers’ practices had ranged from deduct- ing levies on an accrual basis by making provision in the accounts before levies were due and payable, to claiming levies in the year they were paid; see PIB 136 Part 2 (May 1985). Example If a taxpayer has a 30 June balance date, the employer premium payable on 31 May 1994 is deductible in the income year ended 30 June 1994. However, if the experience rating adjustment is not made until February 1995, the loading or refund is deductible or assessable in the income year ended 30 June 1995. employer premium paid. Small employers are not subject to loadings. Note that the experience rating adjustment currently applies only to the employer premium payable by employers. There is provision in the ARCI Act to experience rate earners who have earnings other than as employees, but ACC do not currently do this. Legislation Cross - reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 BB 4 (a)65(2)(a) BB 7104 ED 1140A ED 1 (2)140A(4) ED 1 (4)140A(3) Section ED 1 refers to provisions of the ARCI Act. The relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the ARCI Act are produced below. Section ED 1 (2) standardises the income year in which the employer premium is deductible, by making it deductible only in the income year that it becomes due and payable: ... any amount of premium from employers ... that becomes due from and payable by the taxpayer in that income year shall be deemed to be expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in that income year and in no other income year, and the deduction (if any) allowable in respect of the premium under section BB 7 of this Act shall be computed accordingly. \[emphasis added\] Section ED 1 (4) states: “Premium from employers means”, where a taxpayer is an employer, the premium payable by the employer under section 101 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992: Section 101 of the ARCI Act states: (1) There shall be payable by every employer, in accordance with this Act and regulations made under this Act, a basic premium at such rate or rates as are prescribed on the amount of earnings paid or deemed to have been paid by that em- ployer to its employees. Section 104 of the ARCI Act states: (1) The basic premium payable under section 101 of this Act by an employer may be adjusted by reference to the accident experience of or attributed to that employer. (2) The adjustment referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be by way of a premium loading being imposed on the employer or a premium discount being allowed to the em- ployer. Application of legislation The legislation applies as follows: • Section ED 1 (2) deems the “premium from employ- ers” (which is defined under section ED 1 (4) as the from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Authority for deductibility of loadings The loading is deductible as expenditure incurred under section BB 7 when there is a definitive commitment to pay the expenditure. There is only a definitive commit- ment to pay the loading in the income year that the experience rating assessment occurs. Assessability of refunds The refund is assessable as income under the general assessability provision, section BB 4 (a). The authority for this is Cromwell Jockey Club v CIR (1954) 6 AITR 188. Cromwell Jockey Club, a decision of the New Zealand Supreme Court, concerning the exercise of a discretion- ary power by the Minister of Finance to refund duty paid on totalisator takings. In circumstances when the original payment and a refund were made in different financial years, it was held the refund was in its true nature an income payment and assessable in the year of receipt. Other examples are HR Sinclair & Son Pty v FCT (1966) 114 CLR 537 concerning royalty payments claimed as a deduction one year and partially reim- bursed in a later year; and Automatic Totalisator Ltd v FCT (1968) 119 CLR 666 concerning a refund of payroll taxes. GST treatment of loadings or refunds Refunds or loadings are GST inclusive, so employers who are GST registered persons must account for the GST component of any experience rating adjustment in the taxable period in which the loading or refund occurs. In the case of a loading, employers are entitled to claim an input tax deduction. In the case of a refund, employers must account for output tax. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. National standard costs for specified livestock - 1996 Under the authority of section EL 4 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 the Administrator of the Government (in the absence of the Governor-General) has declared the national standard costs for specified livestock for the year starting on 1 April 1995 (the 1995-96 income year). Farmers using the scheme apply the national standard costs to stock bred on the farm or on hand at the beginning of the year, while stock purchased are valued at their purchase price. The average of these costs is applied to the stock on hand at year’s end to derive the closing value of livestock on hand. In announcing the values, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said that the costs for dairy cattle and deer had increased this year, but those for sheep, beef cattle, goats, and pigs have changed little. “The increases in the dairy and deer industries reflected the improved income in those sectors being channelled back into repairs and maintenance, fertiliser and feed. Also a reduction in the number of homebred calves reared to weaning, in the survey year to June 1994, increased the per head cost of producing dairy cattle offspring. This increased costing will generally be offset by the lesser number of rising one year heifers on hand at balance date.” “The increased national standard costs for both dairy cattle and deer will not necessarily result in additional income tax for farmers.” “The livestock valuation scheme had the built in flexibility to negate any undue tax consequences. Farmers who are presently using the national standard cost scheme to value rising one year animals had the option of moving these animals to either the herd scheme or the market value option. As with last year it is expected that both these options for dairy cattle will be lower than the national standard cost values”, Mr Dunne said. The national average market values of livestock, which farmers use to value livestock under the herd scheme, will be released in May this year after a national survey of market values taken at 30 April. The national standard costs for the 1995-96 income year are: National Livestock CategoryStandard Cost $ SheepRising 1-year 16.10 Rising 2-year 9.20 Dairy Cattle Purchased bobby calves123.00 Rising 1-year453.00 Rising 2-year 70.80 Beef CattleRising 1-year132.00 Rising 2-year 76.80 Rising 3-year male non-breeding cattle (all breeds) 76.80 DeerRising 1-year 42.90 Rising 2-year 21.90 Goats (Meat Rising 1-year 12.40 and fibre)Rising 2-year 7.60 Goats (Dairy) Rising 1-year 80.90 Rising 2-year 13.20 PigsWeaners to 10 weeks of age 71.50 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age 56.00 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Yachts - depreciation Introduction Previously there was one asset class for all types of yachts, setting a depreciation rate of 12% DV. The Commissioner has issued Determination DEP12: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 12, which is reproduced below. The determination sets two new general depreciation asset classes for yachts. One of these asset classes “Yachts (international ocean going)” sets a new depreciation rate of 15% diminishing value (“DV”). The other asset class clarifies that the existing rate of 12% DV continues to apply, but to “Yachts (other than international ocean going)” rather than to all “Yachts”. The new depreciation rate for “Yachts (international ocean going)” of 15% DV is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of six years and a residual value of 40% of cost. The EUL of six years is because this type of yacht typically has a useful charter life of 6 years and after this period is not typically useful for charter (i.e., producing assessable income). The estimated residual market value of this type of yacht at the end of six years is typically 40% of cost. General Depreciation Determination DEP12 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP12: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 12”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. 2.

This rate will con- tinue to apply to subsequent quarters until any further adjustment is made. The prescribed interest rate was previously 10.6% for the quarter that started on 1 October 1995. The reduction reflects the recent fall in market rates. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 “Injurious affection” - assessability of a payment Section BB 4 (section 65, Income Tax Act 1976) - Receipt of capital payment: Telecom has requested permission from a farmer to lay underground telecom- munication cabling across her land. To allow this to happen, and to provide continuing access to the cable, Telecom has asked for an easement over the land. While no payment is made for the easement, the agreement between the parties provides for the payment of a set amount as compensation for any “injurious affection” caused by Telecom in carrying out any work relating to the easement. The farmer has asked whether the payment is assessable income. A common type of easement is one granted to allow access over a front neigh- bour’s property to a back section. In this case the easement is a right of way over another person’s land. The easement allows Telecom to lay the cable through a portion of the farmer’s land, as well as providing access for repairs and mainte- nance. However, the payment is to “compensate for any injurious affection caused by Telecom in carrying out work related to the easement”. The term “injurious affection” refers to any ancillary damage that is, or may be, caused to land or buildings as a result of the work that is being undertaken. Such a payment is of a capital nature. In most cases capital receipts are not treated as assessable income and as such are not taxable. In this case, the pay- ment is not taxable income. Wages - deductibility when taxpayer runs a non-business venture Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A taxpayer is considered by Inland Rev- enue to be involved in a farming venture that is not a business. Recently, under the Task Force Green scheme, the taxpayer engaged a person to clear gorse on her property. She has asked whether the payment of wages makes her an em- ployer, and whether she can claim a deduction against income for the wages paid. Section OB 1 (section 2, Income Tax Act 1976) defines an “employer” as a person who pays or is liable to pay a source deduction payment. A source deduction payment includes salary and wages. This means that the payment made by the taxpayer is a source deduction payment, and on that basis alone would make her an employer. As an employer, the taxpayer will be required to deduct PAYE and ACC premiums from the employee’s payments, and to account for the deductions to Inland Revenue. Section BB 7 states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it - 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year - may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure is incurred. This means that if the taxpayer were receiving assessable income in any income year from the farming venture, or were carrying on a business, the wages could be claimed as an expense. Inland Revenue has ruled that the farming venture is not a business. The taxpayer is not receiving assessable income from the farming venture, nor is she carrying on a business. The wages cannot be claimed as an expense against any other income. The payment received from Task Force Green to pay the wages is income re- ceived by the farming venture, and would, if the farming venture were a busi- ness, be offset against wages paid. As Inland Revenue has determined that the farming venture is not a business for tax purposes, the payment is not part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. She is not required to include the payment received as income. Child Support payments - whether included as assessable income for income tax purposes Section CB 9 (section 61(15), Income Tax Act 1976) - Other exempt income: A taxpayer has asked whether the Child Support payments that he receives should be included in his income tax return as assessable income. Under section CB 9 (a), income from either of the following sources is exempt from tax: • Payments in the nature of alimony or maintenance made to that person out of money belonging to the spouse or former spouse of that person. • Payments of Child Support or spousal maintenance within the meaning of those expressions in the Child Support Act 1991. Section 2 of the Child Support Act 1991 defines “Child Support” as any payment required to be made under that Act by any person towards the support of a qualifying child, whether under a formula assessment, voluntary agreement, or order of the Court. Child Support payments are exempt from tax, but anyone who is applying for Family Support must still show any Child Support payments that are to be received, or have been received, on the Family Support application and declara- tion form. This is because Child Support payments are taken into account when calculating any Family Support entitlement. In this case, the Child Support falls within the above definition. Accordingly we told the taxpayer that the Child Support payments he receives are exempt from income tax, and need not be included in his income tax return. Low income rebate for retired person who is not a New Zealand superannuitant Section KC 1 (section 50D, Income Tax Act 1976) - Low income rebate: A tax- payer decided to retire from employment in 1994. His only income source for the 1995-96 income year was from interest. As the taxpayer was only aged 55 at the time of retirement, he was not entitled to receive New Zealand superannuation. continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) The taxpayer has been told that as a retired person he is eligible to claim the low income rebate. His total income earned for the year ended 31 March 1996 was $8,500. Section KC 1 allows an income tax rebate to a natural person in either of these circumstances: • If the taxpayer is a New Zealand superannuitant and has assessable income in the income year of less than $9,500. The rebate is an amount equal to 9 cents for each complete dollar of that assessable income. • If the taxpayer is not a New Zealand superannuitant and has assessable income in the income year of less than $9,500. In this situation the taxpayer will only be allowed the rebate to the extent that such assessable income does not comprise interest, dividends, royalties, rents, or income derived from the beneficial interest in a trust. A New Zealand superannuitant is a person who receives New Zealand superan- nuation in the income year in question. New Zealand superannuation itself is administered by the New Zealand Income Support Service. In this case, the taxpayer may have retired from employment and earned under $9,500 for the year, but the rebate entitlement will be nil, as his only income source is from interest. Section KC 1 (1)(b) excludes interest income from the rebate calculation. PAYE deduction certificates and computer payroll systems Section NC 8 (6) (section 344(8), Income Tax Act 1976) - Continuation of tax code: A company has obtained the Commissioner’s consent under section 48 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section 354, Income Tax Act 1976) to submit computer-generated employee tax details to Inland Revenue. The company’s manager has asked whether the company’s employees must still complete IR 12 PAYE deduction certificates each year. In the past, employers had to obtain a completed IR 12 from each employee, each year. However, from 1 April 1995 employers who operate a computer payroll system no longer need to have an IR 12 completed by existing staff. Instead, the employer continues to use the tax code that applied to each em- ployee in the past year. To this end, the employer must keep the latest IR 12 on file as proof that tax is being deducted at the correct rate. The only employees who must complete an IR 12 are new employees and em- ployees wanting to change tax codes. Employees who used a special tax code in the past year will have to apply each year if they wish to continue using a spe- cial tax code. Tax free allowances - recording details on tax deduction certificates Section NC 15 (section 353, Income Tax Act 1976) - Payment of tax deductions to Commissioner: An employer has asked if she must show details of tax free allowances paid to her employees on their IR 12 tax deduction certificates. Section NC 15 (1)(d) (section 353(1)(b), Income Tax Act 1976) requires an em- ployer to deliver tax deduction certificates to each employee. A copy of the certificate is also forwarded to Inland Revenue when the reconciliation is filed by the employer. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) The tax deduction certificate must be in a format authorised by the Commis- sioner, and the employer must show all the following information: • total amount of source deduction payments • total amount of tax deductions • the combined tax and earner premium deductions • other information as may be prescribed. Inland Revenue’s IR 12 tax deduction certificate requires that the total tax free allowances paid to an employee must be separately shown on the IR 12. In this case, as the employer has paid tax free allowances, she must show the total amount paid on the appropriate employees’ IR 12 tax deduction certificates. Adverse event income equalisation scheme deposit - forms to be completed Section OB 1 (section 185A, Income Tax Act 1976): A taxpayer believes she is eligible to deposit an amount to the adverse event income equalisation scheme. She has asked what forms she needs to complete for Inland Revenue, and what details are to be given in the statutory declaration. Section OB 1 defines a “self-assessed adverse event” as meaning any: (a) Fire, flood, drought, or other natural event; or (b) Sickness or disease among livestock - that materially affects the business of the taxpayer and in respect of which the taxpayer has made and furnished to the Commissioner a statutory declaration describing the relevant event or occurrence and specifying how the taxpayer’s business is affected by that event or occurrence. Inland Revenue requires an adverse event income equalisation deposit form (IR 139), which includes the statutory declaration, to be completed. Tax Administration Act 1994 Request to extend an income year Section 33 (section 76, Income Tax Act 1976) - Annual income tax returns by taxpayers: A trust was formed on 20 February 1995, and started business on 20 March 1995. The trust’s adviser has asked Inland Revenue if the trust may file a nil income tax return for the year ending 31 March 1995, and include the period 20 - 31 March 1995 in its return for the year ending 31 March 1996. Section 33 requires every taxpayer to file a return in the prescribed form setting out details of assessable income derived during the preceding year. “Taxpayer” is defined in section OB 1 (section 2, Income Tax Act 1976) as: a person chargeable with income tax, whether on the person’s own account or as the agent or trustee of any other person, and includes- (a) The executor or administrator of a deceased taxpayer... Section 42(1) (section 10(1), Income Tax Act 1976) states: When income is derived by 2 or more persons jointly, whether as partners, trustees, or otherwise,- (a) In the case of trustees, they shall make a return of that income, and shall be jointly assessable on that income. The Commissioner has no discretion to allow a return to be filed for an extended year, except when he has given his consent for a change of balance date under section 38 (section 15, Income Tax Act 1976) and consequential adjustments to a normal 12-month return are required under section 39 (section 16, Income Tax Act 1976). continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) We told the trust’s adviser that the trust must file a return for the period 20-31 March 1995 by 7 July 1995 (as no extension of time arrangement has been made in this particular case) in accordance with section 37(1)(c) (section 17(2)(c), In- come Tax Act 1976). Student Loan repayment deductions - relief from late payment penalties imposed Section 182 (section 413, Income Tax Act 1976) - Relief from penalty: An em- ployer incurred a 10% penalty for making a late payment of Student Loan de- ductions to Inland Revenue. The employer has paid the penalty, but wonders under what circumstances relief from it might be available. He has also asked whether remission will be considered now that the penalty has been paid. When a borrower notifies an employer that Student Loan deductions are to be made from wages, section 19 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 requires the employer to make the deductions at the appropriate deduction rate. The deduc- tions are forwarded to Inland Revenue, along with the PAYE deductions for the same period, and are then credited to the borrower’s account. If an employer fails to forward the full amount of repayment deductions to Inland Revenue, or makes a late payment of the deductions, a late payment penalty is imposed on the employer under section 140 (section 370, Income Tax Act 1976). A 10% penalty is added to the outstanding balance, with a further 10% penalty being added for every six months that the balance remains out- standing. Section 182 allows the Commissioner to remit in full or in part any late payment penalty if he considers it equitable to do so. A taxpayer must apply in writing for such a remission. In considering whether a penalty should be remitted, the circumstances of each individual case are taken into account. Any mitigating circumstances, such as whether the late payment was a genuine oversight, and the taxpayer’s previous compliance record, are taken into account. A penalty may still be remitted even if it has been paid. At the taxpayer’s discre- tion, any resulting excess can be either credited to another period or refunded. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Suspensory loans and GST Section 5(6D) - Payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy: A GST registered person has received a grant from the Crown for $20,000 in the form of a suspen- sory loan in August 1995. The loan will be used to develop a market for a device she has invented. As part of the loan application, the taxpayer was required to submit a “sales budget” for the following twelve months. If the projected sales are achieved, the loan will be written off by the Crown at the end of the twelve months. The taxpayer has asked if she must account for GST on the loan. Section 5(6D) states that: ...where any payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy is made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority to- (a) Any person (not being a public authority) in relation to or in respect of that person’s taxable activity; or (b) Any person for the benefit and on behalf of another person in relation to or in respect of that other person’s taxable activity, - from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) that payment shall be deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods and services by the person to whom or for whose benefit the payment is made in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity. Section 5(6E)(a) defines the term “payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy” to include: (i) Any suspensory loan or advance, when the loan or advance becomes non-repayable by reason of its conditions for non-repayment being satisfied... Under section 5(6D), when a grant or subsidy is paid by the Crown or a public authority to a person in respect of that person’s taxable activity, the payment is to be treated as consideration for a supply of goods and services in the course of a taxable activity. A suspensory loan which is non-repayable is deemed by section 5(6E) to be a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy from the time the non-repayment conditions of the loan have been met. If the recipient of the payment is registered or liable to be registered for GST, and the non-repayment conditions of the loan have been met, he or she must account to Inland Revenue for one-ninth of the payment as GST output tax when notification is received from the Crown that the loan is written off. If the payment is made to a person who is not GST registered (or liable to be regis- tered), that person does not have to account for GST. In this case, the recipient has received a suspensory loan which has a non- repayable contingency when certain conditions are being met. Accordingly, she has been advised that if the non-repayment conditions of the loan are met, the payment will become subject to GST at the time she receives notification from the Crown. If the non-repayment conditions are not met and the suspensory loan becomes payable, the payment will not be subject to GST. 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Land sale on winding up proposed business not a taxable activity Rating:••• Case:TRA Nos 95/75 and 93/76 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 6, 51(1)(c) Keywords:subdivision, taxable activity, liability to register Summary:The objectors were not carrying on a taxable activity by selling four sections because the sales were made to wind up a project to build a rest home. The sales of the four sections were not part of any land development or property dealing activity. Following on from this finding, the Taxation Review Authority held that section 51(1)(c) exonerated the objectors from any need to register or from any deemed registration. Facts:The objectors are the trustees of two family trusts which together purchased a 16 lot residential subdivision in 1984. Twelve of the subdivided lots were sold by the objectors prior to the introduction of GST on 1 October 1986. The objectors intended to use the remaining four sections for building a rest home. However, the rest home was never built and in 1988 and 1989 the objectors sold the re- maining four sections. The Commissioner assessed the objectors for GST on the final four property sales. The Commissioner contended that the objectors were carrying on a taxable activity because the sales of the four sections were part of a continuous and regular activity. A second issue was whether the provisions of section 51(1)(c) precluded the objectors from liability to be registered under the Act. The objectors contended that section 51(1)(c) applied because the remaining four sections were sold solely as a consequence of the objectors’ cessation of any taxable activity. Decision:Judge Barber held that at the time of each sale of the remaining four sections the objectors were not carrying on the taxable activity of selling sections to third parties. 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Judge Barber held that the objectors’ property sale activity ceased after the sale of the first 12 sections and that the objectors were holding the remaining four sections for the development of a rest home business. He said there was no nexus between the initial sales of 12 sections and the subsequent sale of the remaining four sections other than a common purchase origin. The four sections were not sold as part of any land development or property dealing business, but to wind up the rest home project. On the second issue, Judge Barber held that section 51(1)(c) exonerated the objectors from any need to register or from any deemed registration. This was because the four sections were sold solely as a consequence of the trustees decid- ing to abort their rest home enterprise and not as part of any land development or property dealing activity. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Management fees paid to parent company - deductibility Rating:••• Case:Lockwood Buildings Limited v CIR HC Auckland M 455/95 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 104 and 106(1)(a) (Income Tax Act 1994 - sections BB 7 and BB 8 (a)) Keywords:deductibility, management fee, capital or revenue expenditure Summary:Management fees paid by a subsidiary company to its holding company were deductible expenses. The question of deductibility was not affected by the fact that the fees were paid to a holding company or that the fees were not calculated by the holding company in direct reference to services performed. Facts:The case concerned the deductibility of a management fee paid by the objector, Lockwood Buildings Limited (Lockwood Buildings), to its holding company, La Grouw Corporation Limited (La Grouw Corporation). La Grouw Corporation was a holding company for Lockwood Holdings and thirteen other companies. In 1990 Lockwood Holdings and the other subsidiary companies divested their financial and management functions to La Grouw Corporation. Services provided by La Grouw Corporation for Lockwood Buildings included investigating the possible acquisition of timber mills and State forests. These investigations were carried out so that Lockwood Buildings would be assured of receiving a steady supply of timber for its day to day business. A timber mill was purchased by Lockwood Buildings in 1990. Lockwood Buildings paid La Grouw Corporation $1.2 million for management fees in the 1990 income year and $701,821 in the 1991 income year. La Grouw Corporation calculated the amount of fees payable by each subsidiary on the basis of the profits made by each subsidiary rather than calculating the fee in relation to the actual services performed for that subsidiary. In the 1990 income year Lockwood Buildings was the only subsidiary which paid La Grouw Corpo- ration for management fees while in the 1991 income year three other subsidiar- ies also paid a management fee to La Grouw Corporation. The Commissioner contended that $119,280 of the management fees paid by Lockwood Buildings represented capital expenditure and was not deductible under section 106(1)(a). The Commissioner argued that this proportion of the management fee was expenditure relating to the acquisition of forestry assets incurred for the benefit of Lockwood Buildings. continued on page 36 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Lockwood Buildings argued that the expenses were wholly deductible as this case was no different from any purchase of services, the fee for which includes a number of components including the cost to the supplier of providing those services. Decision:The High Court held that the payments of the management fees by Lockwood Buildings to La Grouw Corporation were wholly deductible under section 104(a). The management fees were not capital expenditure under section 106(1)(a). Justice Williams reviewed previous cases concerning the deductibility of ex- penses. The main factors he considered were: • the occasion which gave rise to the expenditure • whether the expenditure was of a once and for all nature producing enduring assets or lasting advantages • whether the expenditure was a recurrent part of the cost of the objector’s ordinary business operations • whether the expenditure was fixed or circulating capital or money expended on the structure of the business • how the payment of the management fees would be treated according to the principles of commercial accounting. Applying these tests, the Court found that the management fees were not capital expenditure. The occasion giving rise to the expenditure was the divesting of management and financial functions by Lockwood Buildings to La Grouw Corporation. The management fees paid to La Grouw Corporation were for services provided of negotiating contracts and ensuring it had access to a supply of timber. The payment of management fees was part of a decision by Lockwood Buildings to enhance its ability to trade profitably. No assets were acquired by Lockwood Buildings as a result of its payment of the management fees. It was immaterial that those services were provided by the objector’s parent company or that the fee was not calculated strictly in accordance with the serv- ices provided. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Penal tax charged - whether amount excessive Rating:•••• Case:TRA No. 94/80 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 420 and 423 (Tax Administration Act - sections 186 and 190) Keywords:penal tax Summary:The Commissioner made an assessment for penal tax calculated as 110% of deficient tax. The issue was whether the tax charged was excessive. The TRA reduced the Commissioner’s assessment from $32,080 to $20,000. Facts:The taxpayer was prosecuted for the years 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1989 for wilfully making false returns of income. The Commissioner assessed him for penal tax amounting to $32,080 (110% of the deficient tax ) for those years as well as for the years 1988 and 1990. The taxpayer was found to have suppressed income he received from hunting, interest and dividends. The Commissioner imposed from page 35 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) penal tax for the two additional years (1988 and 1990) because, although there was no tax payable in those years due to losses suffered on the share market, there was evasion of tax which “is or may become chargeable” under section 420. The Commissioner took into account the large amount of deficient tax, the depositing of income in a foreign bank account and bank accounts under false names in arriving at the quantum of penal tax. Regard was also had to past penal tax cases where 100% penal tax had been upheld where deficient tax had been much less than in this case. The taxpayer advised he undertook hunting as a hobby and referred to the freak prices in the 1980s “as a temporary chance thing”. The use of fictitious names in local and foreign banks accounts was to keep his finances secret from his es- tranged wife. He considered the penal tax charged to be excessive due to the fact that he did not consider at the time that the hunting proceeds and the invest- ment income therefrom to be taxable income. His normal business was as a retailer which he said was in order. Decision:The TRA placed more credibility on the taxpayer’s explanations than did the Commissioner. Also, in referring to the 1988 and 1990 years when the taxpayer incurred share trading losses, the TRA said that tax cannot become chargeable if there is no taxable income. The Authority said this should have been taken into account when considering whether the penal tax charged was excessive under section 423(1). The TRA found that the penal tax charged was excessive and should be reduced from $32,080 to $20,000. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Regular employee unloading containers under contract - employment status Rating:••• Case:TRA No. 94/47 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 104 (Income Tax Act 1994 - BB 7) Keywords:independent contractor, employee Summary:The taxpayer contracted to undertake a job for his employer which was com- pletely separate from that of his normal employment. The TRA found that the taxpayer was engaged as an independent contractor and consequently ruled that certain expenditure incurred by the taxpayer should be allowed as a deduction. Facts:The objector was employed as a carpet mender by a leading carpet manufac- turer. He tendered in the name of a trading partnership for a contract unloading containers at one of his employer’s bulk stores. The parties agreed upon a price of $260 “per container unloaded”, the work on which was to be carried out outside the objector’s regular work hours with the manufacturer. The objector used the manufacturer’s fork lift trucks but provided his own trolleys, bulk cutters, locks, and lighting equipment. The manufacturer stipulated that the containers be unloaded within eight days of delivery to the bulk store although the partners could unload the containers using whatever method they chose. There was no provision for holiday or sickness pay in respect of the unloading. Inland Revenue required the objector to be treated as an employee of the manu- facturer in respect of the unloading work. Inland Revenue also disallowed expenditure claimed for protective clothing, safety shoes and mileage. The objector contended he was on a contract basis with the manufacturer. continued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Decision:The TRA looked at the various tests set down by case law, i.e., the control, integration, fundamental, and intention tests. It considered that the work that the objector undertook was completely separate from his normal job with the manufacturer. It did not consider that the degree of control the manufacturer had over the objector was significant. The TRA said it was quite reasonable for the manufacturer to place an eight day deadline on the work. The unloading work could not be considered to be integrated into the objector’s other work with the manufacturer nor as overtime or extended employment work. The partners used most of their own equipment and could carry out the job on their terms. The same reasoning applies in relation to the fundamental test, i.e., (Is the objector in business on his own account?). The TRA considered that the manufacturer could not have intended retaining the partnership for unloading work on an employer/employee basis. It also did not consider that the objector and his partners thought that their unloading activity had any direct connection with their work at the carpet factory. The TRA said that although the work undertaken by the partnership did not achieve a return on investment or require particularly sound management, this was pecu- liar to a lot of contract work. On the basis of the application of the above tests, the Authority found that the partnership undertook the unloading services as an independent contractor. Therefore, the objector was entitled to a deduction for the protective clothing, the safety footwear, and half the amount claimed for mileage. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Real estate salesperson - employment status Rating:• Case:TRA No. 92/159 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 105 (Income Tax Act 1994 - section DE 1) Keywords:employment status, deduction for expenses Summary:The Taxation Review Authority found that the real estate salesperson was an employee and not an independent contractor. The taxpayer was therefore unable to deduct expenses. Facts:The taxpayer was a real estate salesperson in the 1991 tax year. He incurred expenses in earning his income as a real estate salesperson. The taxpayer asked the Court to rule that he was an independent contractor and therefore able to claim the expenses. The Commissioner disputed that the taxpayer was an inde- pendent contractor on the grounds of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Challenge Realty v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7, 214: (1990) 3 NZLR 42. Decision:Judge Barber held that the objector, under the then statute law, was an em- ployee. Challenge agreed that certain factors pointed to an independent contrac- tor relationship. These included no holiday pay, sick leave, or superannuation, lack of supervision, no fixed hours of work, provision of own cars. However, it was established that all contracts negotiated by a salesperson were in fact and in law the contract of the licensed real estate agent. In all circumstances the Court of Appeal found the salespersons to be employees. As an employee, under section 105, the taxpayer in this case was unable to claim a deduction for ex- penses incurred in earning his assessable income. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. from page 37 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) House built to run camping ground business - GST input deduction Rating:• Case:TRA 95/44 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 2 Keywords:input tax, principal purpose, taxable activity Summary:The Taxation Review Authority found that the objector erected a house for the principal purpose of running a camping ground business. He was therefore entitled to claim a GST input tax deduction on the costs of the house. Facts:The objector partnership ran a camping ground business. As part of the agree- ment with the Department of Conservation, any manager of the camping ground had to ensure that there was 24 hour daily supervision. DOC effectively said that this could not be achieved unless a manager lived on site in suitable accommodation. The Commissioner contended that the principal purpose for building the house was to provide private accommodation for the objectors and their family. Decision:The TRA held that the full input tax deductions were available because the principal purpose of the house was to operate the camping ground, which is one of making taxable supplies. The TRA acknowledged that there was a duality of purpose of providing private accommodation and the taxable supply of camping ground services, but the principal purpose was that of providing taxable sup- plies. In reaching this conclusion, the TRA took into account the fact that the objectors owned other residences in the nearby town, and the fact that they chose to live on the camp site supported the view that the need to live on site was for management purposes rather than for private accommodation purposes. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.10 (March 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Transfer pricing regime Sections GD 13 and FB 2, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction A new transfer pricing regime has been enacted to improve the measurement of taxpayersí net New Zealand-sourced income, and to reduce the scope for manipulation of cross-border transfer prices to reduce New Zealand tax liabilities. The new transfer pricing rules are principally contained in section GD 13. In short, this section requires cross- border transactions between related parties that would otherwise deplete the New Zealand tax base to be reported for tax purposes at armís length terms. An anti-avoidance provision will allow the section to also apply to certain other non-armís length transactions. Cross-border income and expenditure apportionment for branches (mainly relevant to New Zealand branches of non-resident companies) is dealt with separately in new section FB 2. The new transfer pricing regime is consistent with the international consensus developed between OECD countries on transfer pricing. It is also consistent with the approach used in all of New Zealandís double taxation agreements. Later this year Inland Revenue will issue guidelines containing a detailed explanation of how to apply the new transfer pricing provisions. These guidelines will be based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines), and will be developed in consultation with interested parties. Until New Zealandís guidelines are issued, Inland Revenue will be following the OECD guidelines in applying the regime. Background Multinational groups can manipulate their worldwide tax position by paying inadequate or excessive consid- eration for the transfer of goods, services, intangible property and loans between their constituent members. For example, a multinational has an incentive to sell into a high tax country at high prices, as this reduces the profit earned in that country. Similarly, a multina- tional has an incentive to sell into a low tax country at low prices, as this increases profits earned in that country. The overall effect is that the multinational can minimise its total tax by manipulating its cross-border prices, thereby shifting its profits to the jurisdictions that impose the lowest tax cost. An effective transfer pricing regime is one that prevents multinational groups from manipulating their intra- group prices to reduce their New Zealand tax liabilities. New Zealandís former transfer pricing rules, contained in the now repealed section GC 1, were deficient in this regard. For example, the control test which had to be satisfied before the provision could apply was inad- equate, allowing the rules to be easily circumvented. Internationally, the common approach to the problem of transfer pricing has been to require multinational groups to calculate prices for their intra-group transac- tions for tax purposes as if those transactions had been conducted on armís length terms. New Zealand has looked to follow this internationally accepted ìarmís length principleî in enacting the transfer pricing rules in new section GD 13. Key features ï The regime generally applies to cross-border non- armís length transactions between related parties that have the potential to deplete the New Zealand tax base. ï An anti-avoidance rule extends the regime to certain other non-armís length transactions. ï The internationally accepted range of transfer pricing methods (as expressed in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines) may be used to calculate the armís length price. These are transaction-based methods (compara- ble uncontrolled price, resale price, cost plus) and profits-based methods (profit split and comparable profits). ï Each transfer pricing method will require reference to comparable uncontrolled prices and/or comparable profit margins. ï The method producing the most reliable measure of the armís length price must be applied. ï The choice of transfer pricing method and its applica- tion must be made having regard to criteria including comparability, accuracy and completeness of the data, assumptions used, and sensitivity of results to defi- ciencies in the data and assumptions. ï The taxpayerís determination of the armís length price will be upheld, unless either of the following applies: - The Commissioner can demonstrate a more reliable armís length price. - The taxpayer does not cooperate with the Com- missioner in the Commissionerís administration of the regime (such non-cooperation having a material effect on the Commissionerís adminis- tration), in which case the burden of proof will fall back on the taxpayer. ï In certain circumstances the rules allow compensating adjustments for a taxpayer who is subject to an adverse transfer pricing adjustment. The rules will also allow a substituted armís length price to be used to calculate the tax of the other party to a transfer pricing arrangement. ï Companies may attach imputation credits retrospec- tively to non-cash dividends arising from transfer pricing arrangements. Imputation credits relating to continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) The terms ìsupplyî and ìacquisitionî take their ordinary wide meaning. However, these ordinary meanings are supplemented by partial definitions in section GD†13†(13). ìAcquisitionî is defined to include obtain- ing the availability of anything, and ìsupplyî is defined to include making anything available. The references to ìavailabilityî in the ìacquisitionî and ìsupplyî definitions were included to ensure that the new transfer pricing regime has its intended effect and ambit. The reference to ìobtaining the availabilityî makes it clear that the regime applies to acquisition-type transactions by a New Zealand subsidiary from its non- resident parent (e.g., receiving a loan at an excessive interest rate or an intellectual property license at an excessive consideration (royalty)). Similarly, the ìmak- ing availableî reference makes it clear that the regime applies to supply-type transactions by a New Zealand subsidiary to its non-resident parent (e.g., a low interest loan or the licensing of intellectual property at an inadequate consideration). Equity capital The only exception to what can be included in the subject matter of a supply and acquisition is equity capital. The terms ìacquisitionî and ìsupplyî in section GD 13†(13) specifically exclude the receipt or payment of consideration for the issue of shares (equity capital), unless the shares are fixed rate shares. (The term ìfixed rate shareî is defined in section OB 1.) The exception for equity capital (other than fixed rate shares) has been made because there is no requirement in the case of ordinary shares for any dividend to be paid by the recipient of the equity capital (the company) to its provider (a shareholder). The continued inclusion of fixed rate shares in the types of transactions covered by the transfer pricing regime is necessary because such shares are analogous to, and highly substitutable with, loans. As loans are covered by the transfer pricing regime, it is appropriate that fixed rate shares are also covered. (Note that a New Zealand company that is deemed to have received an armís length amount of dividend on a fixed rate share in an offshore subsidiary will not be entitled to an underlying foreign tax credit to offset the resultant dividend with- holding payment liability. This is because section LF†2†(2)(c) provides for a nil underlying foreign tax credit if the share in respect of which a dividend is paid is a fixed rate share.) 2. Related party requirement (section GD 13 (2)(b)) The transfer pricing regime generally applies only to transactions between related parties. This is effected by requiring the supplier and acquirer to be associated persons. The associated persons definition in section OD†8†(3) is used for the purposes of the transfer pricing regime. Additionally, the proviso to section OD 8†(3)(a) (which provides that two companies are not associated if one is non-resident) does not apply. This associated persons definition is used for the purposes of most international tax provisions in the Income Tax Act. tax paid on a transfer pricing adjustment may also be used to impute such dividends retrospectively. ï The Commissioner will issue guidelines on the detailed application of the transfer pricing rules in section GD 13 later this year. These guidelines will be based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and will be developed in consultation with interested parties. ï New rules provide for the apportionment of cross- border income and related expenditure for branches, using the armís length principle. ï Advance pricing agreements will be available as part of the binding rulings regime in order to increase taxpayer certainty. These agreements can be unilat- eral (involving only Inland Revenue) or multilateral (involving tax treaty partners willing to enter into such agreements). ï The new transfer pricing rules are consistent with New Zealandís double taxation agreements. Application date The new transfer pricing regime applies from the start of the 1996-97 income year. The new regime can apply to existing arrangements to the extent they affect income tax liabilities in the 1996 - 97 income year and subsequent years. Scope of the regime (section GD 13 (2)) In order for the transfer pricing regime to apply to a transaction, the transaction must meet the following three conditions: 1. The arrangement must involve the supply and acquisition of goods, services or anything else. 2. The supplier and acquirer must be related parties. 3. The arrangement must be cross-border in character (i.e., not wholly within the New Zealand tax base). These requirements are discussed in detail below. 1. Supply and acquisition of anything (section GD 13 (2)(a) and (13)) Section GD 13 applies to an arrangement involving the supply and acquisition of goods, services, money, other intangible property, or anything else. This means the description of the subject matter of a transfer pricing arrangement is all-encompassing. Section GD 13 uses the term ìarrangementî in relation to any transaction. ìArrangementî is widely defined in section OB 1 as meaning ìany contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unen- forceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effectî. This term underlies the all- encompassing nature of the transfer pricing regime with regard to what can be the subject matter of an affected transaction. from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) 3. Cross-border requirement (section GD 13 (2)(c)) The transfer pricing regime generally applies only to cross-border transactions. These are effectively defined to mean all transactions which have an international aspect (i.e., are not wholly domestic), and which therefore have the potential to reduce the New Zealand tax base. An arrangement involving a non-resident who has a New Zealand tax presence not amounting to a permanent establishment is not considered to be wholly domestic because New Zealand generally cannot tax the business profits of such persons if they are resident in a treaty country. (Section GD 13 actually uses the term ìfixed establishmentî, although this is similar in meaning to the term ìpermanent establishmentî used in New Zealandís double taxation agreements.) The approach taken in the legislation is to include within the potential ambit of the transfer pricing rules all arrangements that are not wholly within the New Zealand tax base. Accordingly, cross-border arrange- ments include all of the following: ï An arrangement between two non-residents, unless each of the non-residents enters into the arrangement for the purposes of a business carried on by that person in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. ï An arrangement between a resident and a non-resident, unless the non-resident enters into the arrangement for the purposes of a business carried on by that person in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, and the New Zealand resident has not entered into the arrangement for the purposes of an offshore business carried on by that New Zealand resident. ï An arrangement between two residents, if either or both enter into the arrangement for the purposes of an offshore business. (It is necessary to include these arrangements, as they are not wholly domestic and allow for the potential manipulation of foreign tax credits and losses by New Zealand residents, with a resultant reduction in the New Zealand tax base.) The operative provisions in section GD 13†(3) and (4) will not apply to a transaction involving two non- residents which is wholly outside the New Zealand tax base. This is because these provisions can only apply to a ìtaxpayerî, which is defined in section OB 1 to be a person chargeable with New Zealand income tax. As neither non-resident derives New Zealand-sourced income in respect of the transaction, section GD 13 cannot apply. Section GD 13†(2)(c) applies to transactions between any type of persons. The regime therefore has a broader application than to merely transactions between compa- nies, extending to transactions involving individuals and persons in their capacity as trustees of trusts and partners in partnerships. Note that the limitation on the application requirements in section GD 13†(2) (notably the related party and cross-border requirements) do not apply if the specific transfer pricing anti-avoidance provision in section GC†1 is applicable to any arrangement (see page 10). The following table summarises the 15 possible combi- nations of supply and acquisition arrangements involv- ing residents and non-residents. The 12 types of ar- rangements which are covered by section GD 13†(2)(c) have a ìyesî label while the three types of arrangements which are not covered have a ìnoî label. The subparagraph in section GD 13†(2)(c) which is relevant to a particular arrangement is also identified.

If the armís length amount for the asset was in fact $10,000, section GD 13†(3) would substitute this $10,000 amount so far as the New Zealand subsidi- aryís tax liability is concerned, and accordingly its cost base for depreciation purposes would be reduced by $5,000. However, the non-residentís tax position is not affected and accordingly it still derives a dividend of $5,000 under section CF†2†(1)(d) (property acquired by a company from any shareholder for excessive consideration). Section GD 13†(12) confirms that the New Zealand subsidiaryís obligation to deduct NRWT in respect of this dividend is not affected by the application of section GD 13†(3). Section GD 13†(3) applies for all purposes of the Income Tax Act in relation to the taxpayerís income tax liabil- ity. The flow-through effect for tax calculation purposes of the substitution of an armís length amount is also illustrated in the case of trading stock; the transfer pricing adjustment may affect the value of any trading stock on hand at the end of the year and at the begin- ning of the following year. Example 3 A New Zealand company in an income year pur- chases trading stock from its non-resident parent at a cost of $10 million. The armís length amount of $7.5 million is substituted under section GD 13†(3) and therefore this amount represents the deduction under section BB 7 for the New Zealand company. Assume that: ï the New Zealand company recorded $4 million worth of trading stock on hand at the end of the year in its tax return, cost price being used for the purpose of section EE 1†(3) (all stock on hand is sourced from its parent); and ï the effect of the section GD 13†(3) adjustment can be apportioned on a straightline basis between stock on hand and the stock which has been sold, so that the value of any over-priced stock still on hand will be 25% ($1 million) less than the value of the stock on hand recorded by the New Zealand company; and ï the New Zealand company included an amount of $12 million in its income under section EE 1†(8) and (9) (being the excess of the stock on hand at the end of the year over the value of the stock on hand at the start of the year). This figure of $12 million was based on the $4 million over-priced stock on hand at the end of the year. In this situation, the amount to be included in the income of the New Zealand company for the income year under section EE 1 will be reduced by $1†mil- lion in accordance with the second step above to $11 million. Operative provisions (section GD 13 (3), (4), (5) and (12)) In short, the operative provisions of section GD 13 require the substitution of an armís length amount in either of these situations: ï The taxpayer is paying an excessive consideration in respect of an acquisition. ï The taxpayer is receiving an inadequate consideration in respect of a supply. The regime effectively only applies to transactions that deplete the New Zealand tax base. The operative provisions apply automatically; they do not depend on the exercise of the Commissionerís discretion for their application. This is consistent with the principle of self-assessment. Also, a tax avoidance purpose is not a prerequisite to the application of the provisions. Excessive consideration payable for acquisition (section GD 13 (3)) If the amount of consideration payable by a taxpayer for an acquisition exceeds the armís length amount, an armís length amount is deemed to be the amount payable by the taxpayer in substitution for the actual amount. A substitution of an armís length amount under section GD 13†(3) applies only in respect of the taxpayerís income tax liability. It does not affect the tax liability of the other party to the agreement, unless the other party has obtained an adjustment to its tax liability under section GD 13†(11) (see page 8). Section GD 13†(12) confirms that a transfer pricing adjustment affects only the taxpayerís income tax liability and does not affect the taxpayerís obligation to deduct withholding tax. Example 1 A New Zealand subsidiary acquires a trademark license from its non-resident parent. If the New Zealand companyís royalty payment to its parent in one year is $1.5m and the armís length amount is $1m, an adjustment would be made under section GD 13†(3). The armís length amount of $1m would be substituted and the New Zealand companyís deduction for the royalty payment would accord- ingly be reduced by $0.5m. This substitution does not affect the New Zealand companyís non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) deduction obligations, and unless a consequential adjustment under section GD 13†(11) is obtained, the New Zealand company would still be required to deduct an amount of $0.15m NRWT, based on the actual royalty payment of $1.5m (assuming the non- resident parent is resident in a treaty country for which the NRWT rate is 10%). from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) The opening stock figure for the following year will be $3m ($4m, less the $1m stock adjustment). Inadequate consideration received for supply (section GD 13 (4) and (5)) If the amount of consideration receivable by a taxpayer for a supply is less than the armís length amount, section GD 13†(4) provides that the armís length amount is deemed to be the amount receivable by the taxpayer in substitution for the actual amount. An adjustment under section GD 13†(4) applies for all purposes of the Income Tax Act in relation to the taxpayerís income tax liability, and may also affect the obligation of the taxpayer or the other party to the arrangement to make a withholding or deduction. The other partyís own tax liability is not affected. Example 4 A New Zealand subsidiary sells trading stock to its non-resident parent for a payment of $20,000. If the armís length amount is in fact $30,000, section GD†13†(4) will substitute this amount for the purposes of calculating the subsidiaryís tax liability. Accordingly the subsidiary is treated as having derived $10,000 additional income. The substitution of the armís length amount under section GD 13†(4) does not affect the tax position of the parent which still derives a dividend under section CF 2†(1)(c) (property of a company transferred to a shareholder for inadequate consideration). Section GD 13†(12) confirms that the New Zealand subsidiaryís obliga- tion to deduct NRWT in respect of this dividend is not affected by the application of section GD 13†(4). Section GD 13†(5) sets out certain circumstances where subsection (4) will not apply and is designed to ensure that that provision only applies if the transfer pricing arrangement would deplete the New Zealand tax base. Section GD 13†(5) is relevant to arrangements under which a non-resident is the supplier. In particular, section GD 13†(5) provides that subsection (4) will not apply if all of these conditions are met: ï The taxpayer (supplier) is a non-resident and did not enter into the arrangement for the purposes of a business carried on in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. ï The amount derived by the non-resident is interest, royalties, or an insurance premium. ï The amount is deductible in calculating the other partyís net income. Section GD 13†(4) will therefore not apply if the amount that would be increased is subject only to a form of NRWT and the New Zealand payer of the amount can claim an income tax deduction for the increased amount if it obtains a consequential adjustment under section GD 13†(11). Section GD 13†(5) ensures that section GD†13†(4) only applies if the combined tax of both parties to the arrangement would otherwise be reduced under the transfer pricing arrangement. Section GD†13†(5) would not apply if the payer was exempt from tax (meaning the payment was not deductible for tax purposes) and accordingly section GD 13†(4) would apply to deem the non-resident to have received an armís length amount which would be subject to NRWT. Example 5 A non-resident company (resident in a treaty country) licenses intellectual property to a New Zealand subsidiary. No royalty is paid by the New Zealand company for the use of the licence. The non-resident parent is the taxpayer in terms of section GD 13†(4). If an armís length royalty of $100 was substituted for the nil payment, the New Zealand subsidiary could apply under section GD†13†(11) for a consequential adjustment, result- ing in a deduction of $100 to the New Zealand subsidiary (for the deemed royalty payment) which has a greater tax cash value ($33) than the amount of tax ($10) that New Zealand could impose on the non-resident in respect of the $100 deemed royalty receipt. Section GD 13†(5) prevents section GD†13†(4) applying in this case. However, section GD 13†(5) would not apply if the New Zealand subsidiary was exempt from tax. In this case, no deduction to the New Zealand company could arise from a consequential adjustment under section GD 13†(11), and it would therefore be in New Zealandís interest to maximise the income of the non-resident parent by allowing GD 13†(4) to apply to deem it to have received an armís length royalty payment. An adjustment under section GD 13†(4) also applies for the purposes of the obligation of the other party to the arrangement to withhold or deduct from the amount receivable by the taxpayer. This will apply in the limited number of situations in which the non-resident is the taxpayer in terms of section GD 13†(4), and both of the following conditions are met: ï The taxpayer makes a supply for which the considera- tion is subject to NRWT ï The arrangement is not excluded from the transfer pricing regime by section GD 13†(5) (because, for example, the other party is tax exempt). If an armís length amount is substituted the other party to the arrangement will have an obligation to deduct NRWT from the substituted higher amount. Therefore, in the above example, assuming the New Zealand subsidiary was tax exempt (and therefore section GD†13†(4) is still applicable) the New Zealand subsidi- ary would have an obligation to deduct $10 of NRWT (assuming the relevant treaty rate is 10%). An adjustment under section GD 13†(4) also applies for the purposes of the taxpayerís obligation to withhold or deduct from the amount receivable by that taxpayer. This reference is necessary to cater for the situation of a New Zealand company holding fixed rate shares in an continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Guidelines. The brief descriptions of the methods given are derived from these guidelines: Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method This method compares the price for property or services transferred in a controlled transaction (a transaction between associated enterprises) to the price charged for property or services transferred in an uncontrolled transaction in comparable circumstances. The price charged in the uncontrolled transaction forms the basis for the armís length price determined under the CUP method. Resale price method This method is based on the price at which the product that has been purchased from an associated enterprise is resold to an independent enterprise. To determine the armís length price, the resale price is: 1. reduced by the resale price margin, which is a margin representing the amount out of which a reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and, in the light of the functions performed (e.g., assets used and risks assumed), make an appropriate profit; and then 2. adjusted for other costs associated with the purchase of the product (e.g., customs duties). Cost plus method This method is based on the costs incurred by the supplier of property (or services) in a controlled transac- tion. The armís length price is determined by adding an appropriate profit margin (measured by reference to margins computed after the direct and indirect costs incurred by a supplier of property or services in a transaction) to the costs incurred by the supplier, to make an appropriate profit in light of the functions performed (e.g., assets used and risks assumed) and the market conditions. Profit split method This method first identifies the combined profit to be split between the associated enterprises to a controlled transaction, and then splits those profits between the associated enterprises based upon an economically valid basis approximating the division of profits that would have been anticipated and reflected in an agreement made at armís length. Comparable profits methods These methods are a range of methods that examine the net profit margin realised by a taxpayer from a control- led transaction relative to an appropriate base (e.g., return on assets, operating income to sales, or other suitable financial ratios). They include what the OECD refers to as ìtransactional net margin methodsî. Note however, that these methods are internationally ac- knowledged to be the least reliable of the transfer pricing methods, and should generally be considered to be methods of last resort. offshore subsidiary for which the dividend paid is below an armís length amount. Section GD 13†(4) would substitute an armís length amount of dividend, giving the New Zealand company an obligation to deduct a dividend withholding payment under section NH 1 from this deemed amount. Determination of arm’s length amount (section GD 13 (6) to (9)) The preceding material has mainly described the provisions stipulating what transactions are affected by the transfer pricing regime. In short, these are generally cross-border, non-armís length transactions between related parties that deplete the New Zealand tax base. Transactions subject to the transfer pricing rules must be reported at armís length terms for income tax purposes. Section GD 13†(6) to (9) stipulate how an armís length amount of consideration is to be deter- mined. Section GD 13†(6) provides that the armís length amount must be determined by using whichever one of the prescribed methods ìwill produce the most reliable measure of the amount completely independent parties would have agreed upon after real and fully adequate bargainingî. This statement of the armís length princi- ple is consistent with the expression of this principle contained in the Associated Enterprises article (Article 9) of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (OECD Model Tax Convention), which is also found in all of New Zealandís double taxation agree- ments. The relevant part of this article reads: ìWhere ... conditions are made or imposed between two \[associated\] enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordinglyî. The purpose of this part of the article is to give a brief overview only of the provisions relating to the determi- nation of an armís length amount. Guidance on the detailed application of these provisions (and other matters such as documentation requirements and advance pricing agreement procedures) will be provided by comprehensive guidelines to be issued by the Com- missioner later this year. These guidelines will be based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (published in July 1995), which represent the international consensus on the appropriateness and application of the armís length principle in transfer pricing matters. New Zealandís guidelines will be developed in consultation with interested parties. (Until New Zealandís guidelines are issued, Inland Revenue will be following the OECD guidelines in applying the regime.) Set out below are the transfer pricing methods pre- scribed in section GD 13†(7). These methods comprise the internationally recognised range of transfer pricing methods as expressed in the OECD Transfer Pricing from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Choice and application of methods The CUP, resale price and cost plus methods are referred to as transactional methods and the profit split and comparable profits methods as profits methods. The main distinction between transactional methods and profits methods is that transactional methods compare prices, while profits methods compare profits. Section GD 13†(8) requires that the taxpayerís choice and application of a method to determine the armís length amount must be made having regard to all of the following: ï the degree of comparability between the uncontrolled transactions used for comparison and the controlled transactions of the taxpayer ï the completeness and accuracy of the data relied on by the taxpayer ï the reliability of all assumptions ï the sensitivity of any results to possible deficiencies in the data and assumptions. A key factor in determining an armís length amount is comparability. This is because the application of the armís length principle is generally based on a compari- son of the conditions in the controlled transaction with the conditions in uncontrolled transactions (transactions between independent parties). Each of the prescribed transfer pricing methods requires reference to either comparable prices or comparable profit margins in comparable uncontrolled transactions. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines indicate that the main factors for determining comparability are: ï characteristics of property or services ï functional analysis (whether functions performed by parties to the controlled transaction are comparable to those performed by the parties to the uncontrolled transaction, considering also factors such as assets used and risks assumed) ï contractual terms ï economic circumstances ï business strategies. The importance of each of these factors in establishing comparability in a particular case will depend on the nature of the controlled transaction and the transfer pricing method adopted. The comparability standard requires controlled and uncontrolled transactions to be the same as or similar to each other, in order to provide the most reliable estimate of the armís length price. A method will become a less reliable means for determining the armís length price as the characteristics of the controlled and uncontrolled transactions become less comparable. While inexact comparables are acceptable, material differences between compared transactions need to be taken into account. Adjustments will need to be made to account for any differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions that significantly affect the reliability of the price. Although there is no formal priority of methods, the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (on which the New Zealand guidelines will be based) incorporate a prefer- ence for transactional methods, as these methods produce the most reliable results if sufficient and accurate data exists. This is because transactional methods, by their very nature (they directly compare individual transactions), achieve a higher degree of comparability than profits-based methods. The profits- based methods, although recognised by the OECD to be consistent with the armís length principle, allow only for an indirect comparison of individual transactions, and are generally regarded by the OECD as methods of last resort. The armís length amount determined under section GD†13†(6) to (8) should be treated as the ìmarket valueî amount where that term or an equivalent term is used elsewhere in the Income Tax Act (e.g., in section GD†1†(1) - market price or the true value). Section GD 13†(9) provides that the taxpayerís determi- nation of the armís length amount, in accordance with subsections (6) to (8), will be upheld, unless either of the following applies: ï The Commissioner can demonstrate a more reliable armís length amount in accordance with subsections (6) to (8). ï The taxpayer has not cooperated with the Commis- sioner in the Commissionerís administration of the transfer pricing regime and the non-cooperation has materially affected that administration, in which case the Commissioner will determine the armís length amount in accordance with subsections (6) to (8). This rule effectively places the burden of proof on the Commissioner to demonstrate that the taxpayerís determination of the armís length amount (in particular, the taxpayerís choice of method and selection of compa- rable prices or profit margins) is incorrect and should not be applied. However, the taxpayer is still required to determine the armís length amount in accordance with subsections (6) to (8). Section GD†13†(8) effectively requires taxpayers to make reasonable efforts to assess adequately the comparables to a controlled transaction. A taxpayer is therefore required to make a reasonable determination of the armís length price. There are two main situations where the non-coopera- tion rule would apply so that the burden of proof reverts to the taxpayer: ï The taxpayer does not provide requested relevant information to the Commissioner. ï The taxpayer fails to comply in a material manner with the documentation requirements (necessary to support a taxpayerís prices in its controlled transac- tions) contained in Inland Revenueís transfer pricing guidelines. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) A common situation in which a compensating adjust- ment would be available would be if a fixed price is used to record transactions between related parties, but the market price in fact fluctuates during the period. Section GD 13†(10) allows the transactions that resulted in an overpayment of tax (inadequate payment for an acquisition or an excessive receipt for a supply) to also be adjusted to the armís length amount in accordance with section GD 13†(6) to (8). Example 6 A New Zealand subsidiary acquires in an income year a commodity from its non-resident parent. The contract provides for a set price notwithstanding that the market price of the commodity may vary during the year. If the transfer pricing rules were applied in the absence of subsection (10), the price payable by the New Zealand subsidiary to the extent that it was greater than the armís length amount would be adjusted downwards, but there would be no upwards adjustment if the price paid was less than armís length. Section GD 13†(10) would apply in this case to allow an upward adjustment to the less than armís length prices paid by the New Zealand subsidiary. The conditions of section GD 13†(10) are satisfied as the arrangements are between the same parties and involve the same subject matter and have all taken place within the prescribed period. The compensating adjustment mechanism can also apply if a taxpayer makes an acquisition for an exces- sive price but also makes a supply for an inadequate price, and the various conditions of subsection (10) are also satisfied (the arrangements take place within the three year timeframe and involve the same other party, and involve the same subject matter, or the considera- tion payable and receivable under the arrangements are linked). Section GD 13†(10) would also be applicable if a taxpayer makes an acquisition for an inadequate price and makes a supply for an inadequate consideration, again so long as the various conditions in subsec- tion†(10) are met. 2. Consequential adjustments (section GD 13 (11)) The other party to an arrangement that was adjusted under the transfer pricing rules may request that the armís length price also apply for tax purposes in relation to that other party. The application for a consequential adjustment must be made by the other party in writing within six months of when the taxpayer receives the assessment or determination reflecting the adverse transfer pricing adjustment. The consequential adjustment will apply if the Commissioner considers it is fair and reasonable to do so, having regard to any Collateral adjustments (section GD 13 (10) and (11)) The collateral adjustment provisions allow a person to make a downward adjustment to its tax liability that relates to and is a direct consequence of an upward transfer pricing adjustment to itself or another person. The operative provisions in section GD 13 (subsections (3) and (4)) only apply if the New Zealand tax base is depleted, so section GD 13 also contains provisions allowing for compensating and consequential adjust- ments (collectively referred to as ìcollateral adjust- mentsî) in certain situations to give relief to taxpayers and other parties to arrangements which have been subject to an adverse transfer pricing adjustment. Compensating adjustments may be available for the taxpayer in an arrangement subject to the transfer pricing rules. Consequential adjustments may be available to the other party to the arrangement. 1. Compensating adjustments (section GD 13 (10)) In certain circumstances, a taxpayer who has been subject to an adverse transfer pricing adjustment is allowed a compensating adjustment for a transaction involving an inadequate payment for an acquisition or an excessive receipt for a supply (ìfavourable transac- tionî). Therefore, if a taxpayer conducts two related non-armís length transactions, and section GD 13†(3) or (4) applies to only one of those transactions, a compen- sating adjustment may be allowed to provide relief in relation to the other transaction. For a compensating adjustment to be allowed, the adverse transfer pricing adjustment under section GD†13†(3) or (4) must have occurred in the same income year as the favourable transaction or in the immediately preceding or succeeding income year, and involve the same other party. Either of the following conditions must also be met: ï The transaction giving rise to the adverse transfer pricing adjustment must involve the same subject matter as that in the favourable transaction. ï If the transaction involves different subject matter, the amount of consideration in the transaction giving rise to the adverse transfer pricing adjustment was deliber- ately set having regard to the pricing in the favourable transaction (commonly referred to as an ìintentional setoffî). The restrictions on the availability of compensating adjustments were considered necessary to make the transfer pricing rules administratively manageable. The conditions mean that the favourable transaction must be directly related to the transaction giving rise to the adverse transfer pricing adjustment. It is therefore not possible to dispute the outcome of a particular adverse transfer pricing adjustment by seeking a series of compensating adjustments to unrelated transactions. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) adjustment made under a double taxation agreement or any other matter. The consequential adjustment will apply for all purposes in relation to the application of the Income Tax Act to the other party, except for determining whether the other party has derived a dividend. Unless the other party to an arrangement (typically a non-resident involved in an acquisition by a New Zealand taxpayer) seeks a consequential adjustment under section GD 13†(11), a transfer pricing adjustment will not affect the taxpayerís obligation to deduct withholding tax, something which is confirmed by subsection (12). Example 7 A New Zealand company is licensed to use the trademark of its non-resident parent. If an excessive royalty of $150 (the armís length amount being $100) was paid by a New Zealand company to its non-resident parent, the New Zealand company would be denied a deduction for the $50 amount of excess royalty under section GD 13†(3). Section GD†13†(11) allows the non-resident parent to request a consequential adjustment to reduce the amount of royalty income (subject to NRWT) it derives by the same amount. If an adjustment were obtained, the NRWT liability of the non-resident company would be reduced from $15 to $10 (assum- ing a 10% treaty rate applies). The New Zealand companyís liability to deduct NRWT would be correspondingly reduced. Interaction with dividend rules (sections CF 2 and ME 6) The transfer pricing rules in section GD 13 work in conjunction with the non-cash dividend rules contained in section CF 2. As noted earlier, the armís length amount is equivalent to the market value amount in section CF 2. For example, if a subsidiary sells trading stock to its non-resident parent for a less than armís length amount, section GD 13†(4) would deem the sale price to be the armís length price, thereby increasing the New Zealand companyís gross income. In addition, section CF 2†(1)(c) would deem the difference between the actual sale price and the armís length price to be a dividend to the non-resident parent. The combined effect of the transfer pricing and non-cash dividend rules is to increase the New Zealand subsidiaryís profits from which a higher-than-declared dividend was paid. Consequential adjustments sought by the non-resident parent under section GD 13†(11) cannot affect the amount of dividend derived. New section ME 6 allows a company that is subject to a transfer pricing adjustment to attach imputation credits retrospectively to a related non-cash dividend. (Fully imputed deemed dividends are subject to 0% NRWT rate under section NG 2†(1)(b)(ii) and are also excluded from the foreign investor tax credit regime.) This is subject to the condition that the companyís imputation credit account remains in credit at the end of each imputation year between the end of the year in which the non-cash dividend was paid and the end of the imputation year before the year in which the company retrospectively attaches the imputation credits. Income tax paid that is attributable to a transfer pricing adjustment is also allowed to be treated as being paid on the original date the related non-cash dividend was paid (thereby giving rise to imputation credits) to the extent necessary to fully impute the non-cash dividend. Example 8 In the 1998-99 income year, the Commissioner makes a transfer pricing adjustment in respect of the 1996-97 income year. The adjustment results in extra tax of $165,000 being payable by the New Zealand company, and a non-cash dividend of $500,000 arising to its non-resident parent. The New Zealand company has a credit balance of $100,000 in its imputation credit account (ICA) at the end of each of the 1996-97 and 1997-98 imputa- tion years. The amount of imputation credit required to fully impute the $500,000 non-cash dividend is $246,269 ($500,000 x 33/67). The New Zealand company will be able to fully impute the dividend by: ï retrospectively attaching the $100,000 credit balance in its ICA at the end of the 1996-97 imputation year; and ï retrospectively attaching the remaining $146,269 required to fully impute the dividend by treating $146,269 of the payment of tax on the transfer pricing adjustment as having been paid in the 1996-97 (rather than the 1998-99) income year for ICA purposes. Unwinding deemed dividends (section CF 2†(9A)) Section CF 2†(9A) operates independently of the transfer pricing adjustment provisions in section GD 13 and will not affect their operation. Section CF 2†(9A) allows for the unwinding of a dividend in certain circumstances. It allows the Commissioner to disregard the amount of a non-cash dividend arising from non- market value transfers of property between companies and shareholders if the company took reasonable steps to ascertain the market value of the property at the time of the transfer and the shareholder has subsequently paid the correct amount of consideration, or refunded any excess consideration. Controlled foreign companies (sections CG 11 (8) and GD 13 (11)) A controlled foreign company (CFC) is treated as a non- resident company for the purposes of the normal continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) CFC. This flows through to the calculation of the attributed foreign income of the New Zealand company. Transfer pricing anti-avoidance rule (section GC 1) The main transfer pricing rule in section GD 13 nor- mally applies only to cross-border transactions between related parties (these requirements being contained in section GD 13 (2)). Section GC 1 is a specific transfer pricing anti-avoidance provision which is designed to bolster the application of the general transfer pricing regime in section GD 13. Section GC 1 allows the operative provisions in section GD 13 to apply to a transaction even if the cross-border and related party requirements in section GD 13†(2) are not satisfied, if the transaction has been entered into with an avoidance purpose or effect. Section GC 1 allows section GD 13 to substitute armís length prices for transactions which, taking into account related transactions and considered as a whole, have an in-substance, cross-border, non-armís length nature, even though the individual transactions which are adjusted do not separately meet the cross-border or related party conditions in section GD 13†(2). Section GC 1 contains a non-exhaustive number of circumstances that could result in an arrangement having an avoidance purpose or effect and therefore being subjected to a section GD 13 adjustment notwith- standing any of the requirements in section GD 13†(2). The circumstances listed are: ï a collateral arrangement involving an associated person not resident in New Zealand ï another collateral arrangement such as a market sharing arrangement, an arrangement not to enter a particular market, a back-to-back supply arrangement, or an income sharing arrangement. The anti-avoidance rule will allow section GD 13 to apply to domestic transactions that are part of a broader agreement involving non-residents that have a character similar to that of cross-border transactions. Example 10 ForCo 1 1 ForCo 2 1 NZCo 1 1 NZCo 2 1 International border Supply Payment = 80% Payment = 20% In this example, two unassociated company groups, comprising NZCo†1 and ForCo†1 in one group and NZCo†2 and ForCo†2 in the other group, have agreed that NZCo†1 will receive 80% of the armís length price from NZCo†2 (which is in loss) for the supply of property in New Zealand. NZCo†1ís offshore associate, ForCo†1, will receive the balance of 20% of the armís length price from ForCo†2. application of section GD 13. Unless a CFC has a branch operation in New Zealand, it will not normally qualify as a taxpayer for the purposes of section GD†13†(3) and (4) (although it could qualify as the other party to a relevant transfer pricing arrangement). However, section GD 13 is also relevant to the calcula- tion of the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC and the resultant calculation of the attributed foreign income or loss of New Zealand residents holding an income interest of 10% or greater in the CFC. This is because of the general rule for calculating branch equivalent income or loss set out in section CG 11†(1), which provides that the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC is the net income or net loss that would be calculated in accordance with the Income Tax Act (including section GD 13) if the CFC were resident in New Zealand. Section CG 11†(8) modifies the application of section GD 13 for the purpose of calculating the branch equiva- lent income or loss of a CFC. It provides that section GD 13 shall apply in determining the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC only if a transaction has been entered into between a CFC and an associate of the CFC which has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the loss and foreign tax credit jurisdic- tional ring-fencing rules. The application of the transfer pricing rules in section GD 13 in determining the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC is therefore limited in effect to an anti- avoidance rule directed at transactions with associated parties (the associated persons definitions in both sections OD†7 and OD 8†(3) apply in determining whether a CFC and another person are associated). Such an anti-avoidance rule is necessary to protect the integrity of the loss and foreign tax credit jurisdictional ring-fencing rules which could otherwise be circum- vented by CFCs shifting profits between jurisdictions through manipulative transfer pricing practices. Any shareholder in a CFC is entitled to request a consequential adjustment to the tax position of a CFC which is the other party in a transfer pricing adjustment made to a New Zealand company. Section GD 13†(11) confirms that the consequential adjustment flows through to the calculation of the branch equivalent income or loss of the CFC and the resultant calculation of the attributed foreign income or loss of the New Zealand shareholders. Example 9 A New Zealand company sells trading stock with an armís length value of $150 to a Hong Kong subsidi- ary for $100. Section GD 13†(4) applies to substitute the armís length amount so far as the New Zealand companyís tax liability is concerned (increasing its gross income by $50). The New Zealand company may apply under section GD 13†(11) for the armís length amount of $150 to apply in relation to the Hong Kong CFC. If the Commissioner agrees to the consequential adjustment, an increased deduction of $50 is allowed for the purposes of the calculating the branch equivalent income of the Hong Kong from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) While, at first sight, the transaction between the two New Zealand companies appears to be wholly domestic, the transactions represent a transfer of New Zealand-sourced income from NZCo†1 to ForCo†1. As NZCo†2 is in loss, there is a deferral of New Zealand tax. Section GC†1 would apply in this case to protect the New Zealand tax base by allow- ing the application of section GD†13†(4) to the non- armís length supply made by NZCo 1 to NZCo 2. Section GC 1 will also allow section GD 13 to apply to cross-border transactions between parties that are not related but are acting in concert to avoid tax through manipulative cross-border transfer pricing. Example 11 ForCo 1 1 ForCo 2 1 NZCo 1 International border Market sharing arrangement Payment = 70% Supply In this example, the group of ForCo†1 and NZCo has agreed with ForCo.2 that NZCo will only receive 70% of the armís length price from ForCo†2 in respect of the supply made by NZCo to ForCo†2. In the absence of section GC 1, section GD 13 would not apply because the related party require- ment is not satisfied. The group of ForCo†1 and NZCo have agreed to accept a less than armís length amount on the supply because of a market sharing arrangement between ForCo†1 (which receives the benefit of the arrangement) and ForCo†2, which has the effect of redressing for ForCo†1 and NZCo the income imbalance resulting from the less than armís length amount received on the export to ForCo†2. The New Zealand tax base is depleted because of the transfer of New Zealand- sourced income from NZCo to ForCo†1. Accord- ingly, section GC 1 would apply in this case to allow the application of section GD 13†(4) to the non-armís length supply made by NZCo to ForCo†2. Apportionment of income and expenditure for branches (section FB 2) New section FB 2 effectively allows transfer pricing adjustments to be made in respect of: ï a single non-resident entity with a branch operation in New Zealand, to determine the New Zealand-sourced income of the entity (section FB 2†(1)); and ï a single New Zealand resident entity with an offshore branch or branches, to determine the net income sourced in each jurisdiction (section FB 2†(1A)) Section GD 13 is not applicable in a branch situation, as it only applies to transactions between separate legal entities. There are no inter-entity transactions in respect of a branch and its parent company to which section GD†13 could apply. New Zealand branches of non-resident entities The armís length principle is applied in section FB†2†(1) to apportion gross income and expenditure between New Zealand and elsewhere in the case of a non-resident with a branch operation in New Zealand. This is achieved by apportioning the gross income and expenditure of the non-resident taxpayer in such manner as is necessary to produce an amount of net income or loss which the taxpayer might be expected to have if the taxpayerís activities in New Zealand were carried out by the taxpayer as a separate and wholly independent person undertaking only those activities and dealing at armís length. The ambit of section FB†2†(1) is restricted to determining the New Zealand- sourced business income and contract income of non- residents. (Other types of income are covered by the source rules in section OE†4.) Section FB 2†(1) states that the amount of gross income apportioned under the subsection to New Zealand is deemed to be derived from New Zealand. This ìderived from New Zealandî reference ensures consistency of terminology with section OE 4, which stipulates the classes of income that are deemed to be derived from New Zealand, and section BB 3, which stipulates that all income derived from New Zealand is assessable for income tax. The use of the armís length principle in section FB 2†(1) is consistent with the armís length approach commonly used in the Business Profits articles in New Zealandís double taxation agreements. These articles govern New Zealand taxation of the business profits of non-residents who are from treaty countries. When conducting an apportionment in accordance with the armís length principle under section FB 2†(1), no profit element or mark-up will be permitted for Head Office management or administrative expenses. This approach is consistent with the Business Profits articles in New Zealandís double taxation agreements and the OECD commentary on the Business Profits article (Article 7) in the OECD Model Tax Convention. Note that any transfer pricing involving, for example, a non-resident company (with a New Zealand branch) and another non-resident (with no New Zealand branch) is dealt with by the inter-entity transfer pricing rules in section GD 13. Section FB 2 is only required to deal with intra-company income and expenditure apportion- ment involving the first non-resident. Branches of New Zealand resident entities New section FB 2†(1A) provides for gross income and expenditure to be apportioned among two or more countries, primarily for the purposes of determining foreign tax credit entitlements of New Zealand residents on foreign-sourced business and contract income. For foreign tax credit purposes it might be necessary to apportion gross income and expenditure among several foreign countries. Section LC 1 provides a credit for continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) ï It reduces the likelihood of transfer pricing adjust- ments, which may result in tax penalties. However, in deciding whether to pursue an APA, taxpayers will need to weigh these benefits against the costs of seeking one, such as financial and time costs. Taxpayers will also need to disclose all relevant infor- mation to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenueís transfer pricing guidelines (to be issued later this year) will detail the process and docu- mentation requirements for obtaining an APA. Relationship with double taxation agreements The issue of transfer pricing is addressed in New Zealandís double taxation agreements with other countries. In particular, two types of articles are rel- evant: ï The Associated Enterprises articles enable the profits of associated enterprises to be determined on an armís length basis. These articles are based on Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. ï The Business Profits articles provide for the profits of a non-resident enterprise to be allocated to a New Zealand branch (permanent establishment) of the enterprise on an armís length basis. These articles are based on Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Conven- tion. Sections GD 13 and FB 2 allow treatment correspond- ing with these two articles to occur under New Zea- landís domestic legislation. New Zealandís domestic transfer pricing provisions are generally consistent with New Zealandís double taxation agreements. In the event of any inconsistency, the double taxation agreement provisions will prevail in the normal manner. If a transfer pricing dispute involved allocation of income with a treaty partner, the taxpayer could invoke the mutual agreement procedure in a treaty. In such a case, Inland Revenue would discuss the transfer pricing issue with the competent authority of the other country and an agreement would be sought between the compe- tent authorities. Consequential repeals (Tax Administration Act 1994, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992) Several redundant references to the former section GC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which contained the previous transfer pricing rules, have been repealed. These redundant references were contained in sec- tion†92 of the Tax Administration 1994 and section 16 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. foreign tax paid in respect of income derived by a New Zealand resident for each country or territory from which the income is derived. The maximum credit allowed is the New Zealand tax payable in respect of the particular foreign income. Section FB 2†(1A) will therefore assist in determining the income from each jurisdiction for the purposes of determining the foreign tax credit entitlements of New Zealand residents (no foreign tax credit is available for income that is deemed to be derived from New Zealand). Advance pricing agreements (Part VA, Tax Administration Act) Advance pricing agreements (APAs) will be able to be negotiated with Inland Revenue on transfer pricing issues (involving both section GD 13, if different entities are involved, and section FB 2, in relation to cross-border income and expenditure apportionment for branches). An APA can be issued as a private binding ruling by the Commissioner under section 91E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, or under the Mutual Agreement articles in New Zealandís double taxation agreements. Section 91E has been amended (new subsection (4A)) to allow a binding ruling to be given on questions of fact in relation to how section GD 13 or section FB 2 applies to particular persons and arrangements. An APA issued under the binding rulings process will bind the Commissioner in the normal manner if it is complied with. An APA issued under a Mutual Agree- ment article in a double taxation agreement will simi- larly be binding if complied with (by virtue of section BB 11). APAs can be either unilateral or multilateral. A unilat- eral APA is an agreement conducted with only one tax authority, while an agreement conducted with more than one tax authority is referred to as a multilateral APA. The key difference between a unilateral APA and a multilateral APA is that Inland Revenue cannot guarantee that a unilateral APA will be accepted by the country in which the other party to the transaction to which the unilateral APA applies is resident. There are several advantages in obtaining an APA: ï It increases certainty of tax treatment for taxpayers. ï It reduces the risk of double taxation and also reduce the scope for international disputes between tax authorities over the source of income (if the APA is multilateral). ï It may prevent the occurrence of costly audits during the period for which the APA applies, thereby reduc- ing compliance costs through the up-front agreement to a taxpayerís pricing approach in its controlled transactions. from page 11
