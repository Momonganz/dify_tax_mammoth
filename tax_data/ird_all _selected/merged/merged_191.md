DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER TO ANOTHER PERSON A LIFE ESTATE IS GRANTED BACK – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/04 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA and sections CE 1 (1)(e) and OB 1 (definitions of “lease” and “leasehold estate”) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person, and under the arrangement the other person subsequently grants a life estate (including a lease for life) back to the transferor out of the property transferred. For the purposes of this Ruling: • In determining whether the transfer is for inadequate or no consideration, the value of the life estate granted back is included as consideration. • A “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. • An interest in land referred to as a “lease for life” is an estate in land giving exclusive possession and enduring for the life of a particular person. It excludes a periodic tenancy. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The life estate (including a lease for life) granted back to the transferor is a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The life estate (including a lease for life) granted back to the transferor is not a lease for the purposes of section CE 1(1)(e), and the grant back of the life estate (including a lease for life) does not give rise to gross income to the transferor or the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER TO ANOTHER PERSON A LEASE IS GRANTED BACK – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/05 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA; and sections CE 1 (1)(e), EB 1 (1), EB 2, and OB 1 (definitions of “lease” and “leasehold estate”) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person subsequently grants a lease for a term back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where: • the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. For the purposes of this Ruling: • In determining whether the transfer is for inadequate or no consideration, the value of the life estate granted back is included as consideration. • A “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The lease granted back to the transferor is a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is gross income to the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. • The grant of the lease does not give rise to gross income to the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER TO ANOTHER PERSON A LICENCE IS GRANTED BACK – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/06 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA; and sections CE 1 (1)(e), EB 1 (1), EB 2, and OB 1 (definitions of “lease” and “leasehold estate”) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person subsequently grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where: • the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. For the purposes of this Ruling: • In determining whether the transfer is for inadequate or no consideration, the value of the life estate granted back is included as consideration. • A “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The licence granted back to the transferor is a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is gross income to the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. • The grant of the licence does not give rise to gross income to the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE THE TRANSFEROR PURPORTS TO GRANT HIM OR HERSELF A LICENCE TO OCCUPY AND TRANSFER THE BALANCE – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/07 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA and section CE 1 (1)(e) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where: • the transferor purports to grant to him or herself a licence to occupy; and • the transferor then purports to transfer the balance of the property to another person; and • the transferee then grants a licence back to the transferor. For the purposes of this Ruling, a “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • As a transferor cannot legally grant him or herself a licence to occupy, the full property interest will be transferred to the transferee. • The licence granted back to the transferor is not a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The grant of the licence does not give rise to gross income to the transferor or the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.

These arrangements are ispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of property transferred, including the interest reserved.

I included in determining whet s property gifted tr determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 7 applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction bet The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to disposition real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arisin p Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, an so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came afte the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decis Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now consider there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer tak view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, d . A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the er person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property .

The key definitions and Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, t property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • transfers the ba section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of h or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 • Where a transferor trans granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back t him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA ( • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneou transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention o parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). islation provisions relating to gift duty follow.

Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA impos 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such re S (1) For the purposes of this section- “As C “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so fa the annuity or payment— period, or for life, or at h) Is secured to the pers ( (i) By a mortgage (ii) By an agreemen n; or (iv) By deed,— tion ) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in iderur of the on mr allowance shall be made in respect of that fit o (3) iththe ellatting or evidencing a disposition of property to allow in the special circumstances of the case.

A The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amoun the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requi to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman Appeal in Finch: could give a fa If a donor charge re prg part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or d. d be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barre Estate and Gift Duty (5th orths), in which the authors say (p 205): ection 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a lue of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for ng or at least postponing the gift duty. t of instead, to reflect the servation. t ties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be oted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an d as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp on was very different. That section began thus: “In order to revent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed d rging section rasts the section with the previous “very This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterw S consideration in calculating the va aluable consideration, thus avoidi v These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amoun gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into ccount the value of the reservation. a Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced re This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. A p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Du n out and out sale it could not be construe cts Amendment Act, 1895, the provisi A p of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every dee or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as cha duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in . 9 In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is gift without its operation. He then cont a different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift lent to e capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the ly. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest olved and s 70(2) can be applied. g king t that he transferor the right to continue to live in the house of mstances, section 70(2) t the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equiva th annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. pman J said at p 1,098: Cha It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not app degree, there is a dutiable gift inv How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty bein reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person ma the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipien e recipient will later give t th until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circu will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the ransferee to the transferor. t Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property tha some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). ion of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general equirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the ion giv rese Thetant, because section 70(2) ill apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not The reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that ection 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the as d he test terest reserving an interest out J e distinction: y the If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definit r gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any considerat en. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest rved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. first of the three steps in the bullet points is very impor w when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a s transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” h a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depen on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: Tin that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole in of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman in the Court of Appeal drew the sam ...

These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. W u legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Sta u common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. T ons paid the father £100 in cash to ensu s which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor etained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage r Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 w reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was no The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from w th A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, th was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated p1567: their Lordships’ judg In these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to cons nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. L 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, o hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interes re-existing interest, this is ot the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with 0-3\] g these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases ave found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of h of the children.

Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, an gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in roperty p interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation t conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discuss below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. ew Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a sim N a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father o grant his ha t retain something he alwa the transfer, he owned a d in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as th e ut he only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be he ext of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, s a transfer simultaneous? sfers, ocused on the eaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That d re d that servation. other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, becaus no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest o of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. T simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. T Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the cont a not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous.

The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case f m provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” an may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers we simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, an there was no re The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. ons . 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement ot a ngram a retention rather than a reservation so that heritance tax would not be payable.

However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if th were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoff ( It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has b vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: d part of the subject m Ingram not rese ve away.

This finding was se ers be simultaneous, r it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to e the to ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction an not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not atter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady ’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had ut of the property the subject of the gift. rved a benefit o The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to gi o Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the tr w supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lea before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transf o equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would hav effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior theory) a grant back of a right. tion and e and obligations that resulted from the transactions, nd with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is e law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not quire such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor a J in er, re, they arranged for e property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their has an the lessor acquires the asehold interest. there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transac should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The Hous of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits a Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It more sensible than th re attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. Howev the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefo th favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before le simultaneous transfer is not always a retention n ehold. e son ervation, and it could not be a retention.

The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least ecided il when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” nd when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared A However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retentio of the leas Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, th was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a res b could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something ret T she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand b 1 in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament d that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great deta a that: e ection 70(2) after Ingram sposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). rvation and a retention of a benefit or advantage.

The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measur designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules.

Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself i p Rye v Rye \[1 of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold i in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the le c of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers value of the lease is $100,000. The val T unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming othe gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred wo le $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value o the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. L unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose.

In the absence of comp a The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to gr him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interes The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and the rights i o Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no g n the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the tr same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done e of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from th obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain.

(The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below. documents to the transaction will be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement.

The documents are ith the parties’ intentions. the Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will eithe result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer.

Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the pr s documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention th back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift.

As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus o section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor ha equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of th payable will be based o tr This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. L As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention o the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equ th transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer c net property is evidenced y the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or e grant e licence back.

If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transfere th Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make th transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a l le back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property intere was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. T transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass.

A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE THERE IS A “SIMULTANEOUS” GRANT OF A LEASE AND TRANSFER OF THE BALANCE TO ANOTHER PERSON – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/09 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA and section CE 1 (1)(e) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor grants him or herself a lease for a term and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. A simultaneous transfer includes the situation where it is the intention of the transferor that only the balance or interest in reversion in the property is transferred, even though in conveyancing law terms the whole property initially transfers; and • there is an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant the lease back; and • the transferor does not obtain any benefit out of the balance or interest in reversion that was transferred; and • the transferor’s intention to retain the lease is evidenced in the documents and in the surrounding circumstances. For the purposes of this Ruling, a “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The lease granted by the transferor is a retention and not a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The retention of the lease does not give rise to gross income to the transferor or the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE THE TRANSFEROR PURPORTS TO “SIMULTANEOUSLY” GRANT A LICENCE AND TRANSFER THE BALANCE TO ANOTHER PERSON – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA and section CE 1 (1)(e) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where: • the transferor purports to grant to him or herself a licence to occupy; and • the transferor simultaneously purports to transfer the balance of the property to another person; and • the transferee grants a licence back to the transferor. A simultaneous transfer includes the situation where it is the intention of the transferor that only the balance or interest in reversion in the property is transferred, even though in conveyancing law terms the whole property initially transfers; and • there is an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant the licence back; and • the transferor does not obtain any benefit out of the balance or interest in reversion that was transferred; and • the transferor’s intention to retain the licence is evidenced in the documents and in the surrounding circumstances. For the purposes of this Ruling, a “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • As a transferor cannot legally grant him or herself a licence to occupy, the full property interest will be transferred to the transferee. • The licence granted back to the transferor is not a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The grant of the licence does not give rise to gross income to the transferor or the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 738.60 691.40 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
1 NETHERLANDS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS—TAXATION WHEN THE RECIPIENT IS A NEW ZEALAND RESIDENT PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/01 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 98/6 which was published in TIB Volume 10, No.12, December 1998. BR Pub 98/6 applied until 30 November 2001. This new ruling takes into account minor changes in legislation since BR Pub 98/6 was published. Its period of application is from 1 December 2001 to 30 November 2006. ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”), and to the Double Tax Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand, which appears in the Schedule to the Double Taxation Relief (Netherlands) Order 1981, S.R. 1981/43 (“the Double Tax Convention”). This Ruling applies in respect of Article 19(2) of the Double Tax Convention. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the periodic payment of a Netherlands social security pension to a person who is a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. This person may be a national of the Netherlands, or of New Zealand, or of both countries. For the purposes of this Ruling the word “national” has the meanings attributed to it by Article 3, paragraph 1.h of the Double Tax Convention. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • When a New Zealand tax resident receives a Netherlands social security pension, and that person is also a New Zealand citizen, the pension is taxable only in New Zealand. • When a New Zealand tax resident, who is not a New Zealand citizen, receives a Netherlands social security pension, the pension may be subject to tax in both the Netherlands and New Zealand; with the Commissioner giving a credit for tax paid in the Netherlands in accordance with New Zealand’s foreign tax credit rules. 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 December 2001 to 30 November 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24th day of January 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 03/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 03/01 (“the Ruling”). Background Confusion has arisen as to the New Zealand tax treatment of social security pensions paid by the Netherlands Government to people living in New Zealand. Some taxpayers believe that the pensions are not taxable in New Zealand if the recipients are not New Zealand citizens. This ruling clarifies New Zealand's jurisdiction to tax pensions paid by the Netherlands, including when New Zealand's right to do so is an exclusive right. Legislation Section BD 1(2) states: An amount is not gross income of a taxpayer if it is ... (c) a foreign-sourced amount and the taxpayer is a non-resident when it is derived. Article 19(2) of the Double Taxation Convention reads as follows: a. Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, one of the States or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority and any pension paid to an individual under the social security scheme of one of the States, may be taxed in that State. b. However, such pension shall be taxable only in the State of which the individual is a resident if he is a national of that State. Article 3(1)(h) defines the term “national” to mean: 1. in the case of the Netherlands, any individual possessing the nationality of the Netherlands, and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in the Netherlands; 2. in the case of New Zealand, any individual possessing citizenship of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand. Article X of the Protocol to the Double Tax Convention states: X. With reference to Articles 18 and 19 It is understood that the term “pensions and other similar remuneration” includes only periodical payments. Application of the Legislation Under the Income Tax Act 1994, persons who are resident in New Zealand are subject to New Zealand tax on their worldwide income. Double Tax Conventions and Agreements with other countries override the Income Tax Act and determine which country has jurisdiction to 4 tax the income in question. Among other issues the Double Tax Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand determines the tax treatment of periodic pensions paid by an organisation in one country to residents of the other country. Article 18 of the Double Tax Convention sets out which country has the jurisdiction to tax pensions paid by one country to the residents of the other country. This article, however, does not apply to pensions paid out: • under social security schemes, or • for services rendered to the country paying the pension. Article 19 deals with these two classes of pension. Article 19(2) states that a social security pension may be taxed by the country from which it is paid but the pension shall be taxed only in the country in which the recipient of the pension is resident if the recipient is also a national of the country of residence. Therefore, a social security pension paid to a New Zealand tax resident who is also a national of New Zealand may be taxed only in New Zealand. However, if the recipient is a New Zealand tax resident but is not a New Zealand citizen, New Zealand will not have an exclusive right to tax the pension. In those circumstances the Double Tax Convention does not restrict either the Netherlands or New Zealand from taxing the pension and the pension could be taxed in both the Netherlands and New Zealand under their domestic law. Persons who are not New Zealand citizens and have tax deducted by the Government of the Netherlands from their Netherlands social security pensions are entitled to tax credits under section LC 1. When this occurs the Commissioner will, in accordance with New Zealand’s foreign tax credit rules, give the recipient a tax credit for the tax paid in the Netherlands. However, these tax credits cannot exceed the amount of tax due in New Zealand. Residence and Nationality Article 4 sets out rules for determining the residence (for the purpose of the Double Tax Convention) of a person who is resident for tax purposes in both the Netherlands and New Zealand under their domestic law. The term “national” in the case of New Zealand is defined in the Double Tax Convention as: ... any individual possessing citizenship of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand (The rules determining how New Zealand citizenship is acquired are set out in the Citizenship Act 1977.) Hence, under the Double Tax Convention a person who is a citizen of New Zealand is a national of New Zealand. Accordingly, under Article 19(2)(b) New Zealand will have an exclusive right to tax a Dutch social security pension when the recipient is determined to be a New Zealand tax resident under Article 4 and is also a New Zealand citizen. (This will be so whether or not that person is also a Dutch national. In the case of dual nationality, the recipient will still satisfy the requirements of Article 19(2)(b) - New Zealand tax residency and New Zealand citizenship - 5 and the additional fact of possessing Dutch nationality will not alter the conclusion that only New Zealand may tax the pension.) Liability to tax under New Zealand domestic law The Double Tax Convention need not be considered unless an amount of Netherlands pension is taxable under New Zealand domestic law. A Netherlands pension could be fully or partly exempt from tax under sections CB 5(1)(f) or CB 5(1)(fa) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section CB 5(1)(f) may apply where the New Zealand benefit payable to a Netherlands pensioner has been reduced in terms of section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964. Section CB 5(1)(fa) applies where an arrangement has been made in respect of an overseas pension under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964. Section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964 applies where the recipient of a Netherlands pension is also entitled to a benefit of a similar nature under New Zealand social welfare legislation. In that event the New Zealand benefit is to be reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension and the effect of section CB 5(1)(f) is as follows: • Where the amount of the New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension payable has been reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension under section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964, section CB 5(1)(f) does not apply; therefore, the full amount of the Netherlands pension is taxable under New Zealand domestic law; and • Where an entitlement to another type of New Zealand benefit has been reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension, the Netherlands pension is exempt income under section CB 5(1)(f) to the extent that the New Zealand benefit has been reduced. Therefore, where a deduction from a New Zealand benefit entitlement has been made under section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964 and the amount of a Netherlands pension exceeds the amount of the New Zealand benefit entitlement, the amount exceeding the New Zealand benefit entitlement is taxable under New Zealand domestic law. Under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964 an arrangement may be made to pay the full amount of an overseas pension to the Chief Executive of the department responsible for administering that Act (which is currently the Department of Work and Income) in order to receive the full rate of a benefit payment under that Act, the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 or the New Zealand Superannuation Act 2001. This option is available to recipients of Netherlands pensions from 1 July 2002: Social Security (Alternative Arrangement for Overseas Pensions) Amendment Regulations 2002. Where such an arrangement is made the Netherlands pension is not taxable under New Zealand domestic law (but the equivalent amount of the New Zealand benefit would be taxable): section CB 5(1)(fa). Example 1 A taxpayer is a Dutch citizen who immigrated to New Zealand two years ago. He receives a Netherlands social security pension. He has not become a New Zealand citizen, but is a tax 6 resident of New Zealand. Both New Zealand and the Netherlands may tax his pension. New Zealand will grant him a tax credit for the tax charged on the pension by the Netherlands. Example 2 A taxpayer also has Dutch nationality and immigrated to New Zealand five years ago. She likewise receives a Netherlands social security pension. Unlike the taxpayer in Example 1 she has become a New Zealand citizen. Only New Zealand may tax the social security pension that she receives from the Netherlands.
1 TERTIARY STUDENT ASSOCIATION FEES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/02 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is a modified version of public ruling BR Pub 99/1 which was published in TIB Volume Eleven, No. 1, January 1999. Its period of application is from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2005. BR Pub 99/1 applied up until 31 March 2002. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section KC 5 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment by a student at a tertiary institution, of a tertiary student association fee as a membership fee to that tertiary student association. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The payment of a tertiary student association membership fee is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4) where any rights arising from membership are conferred by the payment, and/or where the payment is compulsory. Accordingly, a rebate will not be available under section KC 5. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of April 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 03/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 03/02 (“the Ruling”). For the purposes of this commentary, reference to “associations” includes reference to societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts or funds. Background Section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”) provides a rebate to a donor of a gift of money in certain circumstances, where the recipient of the gift is a non-profit body whose funds are applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purpose(s) within New Zealand. The issue dealt with in the Ruling is whether a tertiary student association membership fee is a “gift” within the meaning of section KC 5 of the Act. The subject matter was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 99/1, which expired on 31 March 2002. This public ruling replaces BR Pub 99/1, effective 1 April 2002. The previous ruling concluded that if a student pays a single fee to the student association to become a member of the student association, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on members, the payment is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4). As the payment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. Legislation Section KC 5 provides: (1) A taxpayer, other than an absentee or a company or a public authority or a Maori authority or an unincorporated body, or a trustee liable for income tax under sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, and HZ 2, is allowed as a rebate of income tax the amount of any gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more made by the taxpayer in the income year to any of the following societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts, or funds (being in each case a society, an institution, an association, an organisation, a trust, or a fund in New Zealand), namely: (aa) A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab) A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac) A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: 3 (ad) A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ae) - (bw) \[provide a list of organisations.\] (2) The rebates provided for in this section shall not, in the case of any taxpayer, in any income year exceed in the aggregate the smaller of— (a) 33 1 / 3 % of the aggregate of all gifts described in subsection (1): (b) $500. (3) No rebate shall be allowed under this section in respect of any gift unless the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner in support of the taxpayer's claim for the rebate a receipt evidencing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the making of the gift by the taxpayer. (3A) A refund may be made under this section only if section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is complied with. (3AA) Despite subsection (3), a rebate is allowed under this section if a tax agent makes an application for a refund under section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on behalf of a person and— (a) The tax agent sights the receipt evidencing the making of the gift for which a claim is being made; and (b) The person retains the receipt for 4 income years after the income year to which the claim relates. (4) In this section, “gift” includes a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, only if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. Application of the Legislation Under section KC 5, a taxpayer other than an absentee, company, public authority, Maori authority, unincorporated body, or trustee liable for income tax (sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, HZ 2), can claim a rebate if: • that person makes a gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more; • the gift is made to any of the associations listed in section KC 5(1); • the recipient, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”), applies its funds wholly or principally for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes, or is maintained (subparagraphs (ab) and (ac)) or established and maintained exclusively for one or more of those purposes (subparagraph (ad)); • the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner a receipt evidencing the making of the gift by the taxpayer to the recipient, or a tax agent makes the refund application on behalf of the taxpayer and the requirements of section KC 5(3AA) are satisfied; and 4 • section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is complied with. Furthermore, if the gift is a subscription paid to any association specified in section KC 5(4), the Commissioner must be satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other association. Tertiary student association fees are considered “subscriptions” for the purposes of section KC 5(4), as students receive the services provided by the student association, and the rights attaching to membership of that association in return for the fee, or can be said to be applying to participate in the association. As such, any rights arising from membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee, will preclude such fee from the definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. The definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4) Section KC 5(4) operates as an exhaustive provision with respect to when subscriptions will constitute “gifts” for the purposes of section KC 5, and includes only subscriptions paid to an association if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other association. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825, the Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) noted that the Commissioner had allowed the general school activity fee paid to State schools as a deduction, because such fees came within the expanded definition of “gift”. However, the Authority held that payments to a school for camp fees, a school trip, stationery, and a manual were not gifts, as they conferred particular rights on the pupil. Tertiary student association fees will only be a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5(4), and will only qualify for a rebate, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment does not confer any rights arising from membership. Such rights may include things such as rights to do anything, receive anything, or have access to anything in return for the payment. If no rights are received, the payment of a subscription is considered to be in the nature of a donation, because the payer does not get any direct rights in return for the payment. The requirement that a subscription confer no rights does not contain words of apportionment (i.e. “to the extent to which”), but is absolute in its terms. Accordingly, if any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. It should be noted that section KC 5(4) refers only to rights being conferred: the rights do not have to be exercised or enjoyed by the taxpayer. Students attending tertiary institutions may pay a sum for membership of a student association or union. Tertiary student association fees will commonly give rise to the following types of rights or benefits: • Access to advice, welfare, and counselling services. • Access to liaison services between students and teaching staff. 5 • Access to newsletters and other information. • Access to facilities on campus, such as library, health, or sport and recreation facilities. • Discounts on various goods and services. • Voting rights in respect of the election of association executives, and also at general meetings. In addition, it may also be that the payment of a student association fee (or a substitute payment to a charity of the student’s choice) 1 is one of a number of payments a student must make, or things a student must do, in order to qualify for enrolment at the particular tertiary institution. The payment of a student association fee may, therefore, confer a further right on students – the right to enrolment if the other conditions of enrolment are met. Any of the above, or any other rights arising from membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee will preclude such a fee from the definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. The Education (Tertiary Students Association Voluntary Membership) Amendment Act 1998 (“the 1998 EAA”), which came into force on 11 August 1998, abolished compulsory student association membership, except where a referendum of students at an institution determined that membership of the association at that institution would be compulsory. The 1998 EAA was subsequently repealed, from 8 July 2000, by the Education Amendment Act 2000 (“the 2000 EAA”). The 2000 EAA also inserted new provisions into the Education Act 1989, to the effect that tertiary student association membership is now prima facie compulsory, with the ability for a vote of all students at a particular institution to make membership of that association voluntary. Where tertiary student association fees are voluntary, it may well be that some or all of the services listed above are available to all students, whether paying association members or not. However, students who pay association fees may also be accorded the right to vote to elect association executives, and at general meetings. Further, students who pay association fees may have access to discounts not available to non- paying students. As stated above, any rights arising from association membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee will preclude such a fee from the definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. 1 The Education Act 1989 provides that a student association may exempt any student from membership of the association on the grounds of conscientious objection; and, if exempted, the association must pay the student’s membership fee to a charity of its choice. 6 Where tertiary student association fees are voluntary, it may be that there are in fact no rights arising from membership in that or any other association, conferred upon students who elect to pay association fees. It is only in this circumstance that the payment of such fees will constitute a gift within the meaning in section KC 5(4), and a rebate will be allowable accordingly, provided the other criteria of section KC 5 are satisfied. Any right conferred by the payment of student association fees will be sufficient to prevent the rebate from being available. It should be emphasised that it will only be in the very limited circumstances detailed above that a rebate will be available. In the event that there are in fact no rights arising from membership in a tertiary student association with compulsory fees, the payment of such fees will also not be considered a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4), as it would fail to meet the fundamental precept that a gift must be something transferred voluntarily, and not as a result of a contractual or other obligation to transfer it 2 . Given that section KC 5(4) operates to extend the definition of the term “gift” to include certain subscriptions, the general common law requirement for a gift to be voluntary remains applicable, and it is only the common law consideration of whether any advantage or benefit of material character is received in return, which is modified by section KC 5(4). Example 1 A student enrols at a university, the student association of which has compulsory membership. The student pays the association fees, and is able to use the gym facilities, counselling services, and the subsidised health care programme. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fees confers certain rights upon the student, the payment does not qualify for a rebate as a donation to the student association. However, if a person who is not a student makes a donation to the student association at the university and no rights are conferred because of the payment, a gift is made and a rebate is allowed. Example 2 A student enrols at a polytechnic, the student association of which has voluntary membership. The student believes in and wishes to support the work of the association, and so elects to pay the association fees. The services provided by the association are available to all students at the polytechnic, regardless of whether they are paying members or not. No discounts are available to students who have contributed association fees. The association’s Constitution deems all students at the polytechnic to be “members”, and accordingly able to exercise all membership rights, for instance the right to vote at general meetings. The student association has charitable status. 2 In this regard, see for instance Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v McPhail (1968) 117 CLR 111, Lawson Klopper & Anor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 97 ATC 4179, Hodges v FC of T (1997) 97 ATC 2158, Australian Dairy Corporation v FC of T (1998) 98 ATC 2059, and Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451. 7 As the payment of the student association fee does not confer any rights upon the student, a rebate will be available, provided the other criteria set out in section KC 5 are satisfied (these criteria are listed under the heading “Application of the Legislation”, above).
1 ADVERTISING SPACE AND ADVERTISING TIME SUPPLIED TO NON- RESIDENTS – GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/03 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces public ruling BR Pub 00/06, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000) due to amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. BR Pub 00/06 applied up until 30 November 2004. This ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 00/06; however it addresses section renumbering and an amendment to the wording of the new section. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11A(1)(k). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the contractual supply of advertising space in a publication, or the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), by a GST registered person to a non-resident person who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. For the purposes of this Ruling the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The contractually supplied service of providing advertising space in a publication or advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), to a non- resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the service is performed, is not supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement thereto) or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. Section 11A(1)(k) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11A(1)(k) are satisfied. 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 10 October 2000 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 28 th day of April 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 03/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 03/03 (“this Ruling”). The majority of the subject matter covered in this Ruling was previously dealt with by BR Pub 00/06 that appeared in TIB Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000), at page 13. This Ruling applies from 10 October 2000 for an indefinite period. Background This public ruling considers the application of section 11A(1)(k) to advertising supplied to non-residents. New section 11A(1)(k) was introduced to replace the previous section 11(2)(e) regarding the zero-rating of services supplied to non- residents. Section 11A(1)(k) is almost identical to the previous provision except the words “for and” have been omitted from the phrase “services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand”. Section 11A(2) replaces section 11(2A) with identical wording regarding the receipt of those services in New Zealand. Section 11A(3) replaces section 11(2B) with identical wording regarding the meaning of “outside New Zealand”. The amended legislation came into force on 10 October 2000, the date from which this ruling applies. This commentary is designed to clarify the impact of the altered legislation in the context of cases decided under the previous legislation. Legislation Section 11A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is as follows: (1) A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ...... (k) subject to subsection (2), the services are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are— (i) supplied directly in connection with— (A) land situated in New Zealand or any improvement to the land; or (B) moveable personal property, other than choses in action or goods to which paragraph (h) or (i) applies, situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed; or (ii) the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity, to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand; or ...... (2) Subsection (1)(k) and (1)(l) do not apply to a supply of services under an agreement that is entered into, whether directly or indirectly, with a person (person A) who is not resident in New Zealand if— (a) the performance of the services is, or it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement is entered into that the performance of the services will be, received in New Zealand by another person (person B), including— (i) an employee of person A; or 4 (ii) if person A is a company, a director of the company; and (b) it is reasonably foreseeable, at the time the agreement is entered into, that person B will not receive the performance of the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. (3) For the purpose of subsection (1)(k), (1)(l) and (1)(ma) and subsection (1)(n) as modified by subsection (4)(b), outside New Zealand, for a company or an unincorporated body that is not resident, includes a minor presence in New Zealand, or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. ... Section 60 sets out the GST agency provisions. Section 60(2) states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of this Act, where any registered person makes a taxable supply of goods and services to an agent who is acting on behalf of another person who is the principal for the purposes of that supply, that supply shall be deemed to be made to that principal and not to that agent:... Application of the Legislation The key features of section 11A(1)(k) are the phrases “services are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand” and “directly in connection with”. “Services are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand” Section 11A(1)(k) omitted the words “for and” from the legislation which now reads “services are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand”. In Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 the Court of Appeal held that the word “for” did not mean “beneficially for” and was only used to emphasise the word “to” as being “contractually to”. Section 11A(1)(k) omitted the word “for” from the legislation as it was not required to interpret or emphasise “to” as being “contractually to”. The purpose of this amendment was not to change the established meaning of the word “to” in this context nor was it to override the existing law. “To” continues to mean “contractually to”. An important factor supporting this conclusion is the enactment of section 11A(2). The purpose of section 11A(2) is to protect the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that domestic consumption of services is subject to GST, even though a non-resident may have purchased the services. An example is where New Zealand educational institutions contract with non-residents to provide education for the non-resident’s children in New Zealand. The section operates to ensure supplies of this type are standard rated for GST purposes. If a third party benefiting from these types of services was intended to be caught under section 11A(1)(k) then the enactment of section 11A(2) would have been unnecessary. The following is an analysis of the cases considering the interpretation of section 11(2)(e) which is now section 11A(1)(k). As explained above the interpretation of section 11A(1)(k) is identical to that of the previous section 11(2)(e) as the removal of the words “for and” do not impact on the previous interpretation as set out below. “For and to” 5 The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton rejected the High Court’s interpretation of “for” in section 11(2)(e), as meaning “beneficially for” and held that the supply of the publication of advertisements by Wilson & Horton to non-resident clients qualified for zero-rating under the former section 11(2)(e), irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident obtains a benefit from the supply. The Court noted that many parties may potentially benefit from an advertisement placed by a non-resident, and that it was unlikely that the legislature would have intended a wide group of possible beneficiaries of a service to determine the GST treatment of the service. In discussing the “for and to” wording in section 11(2)(e), the Court of Appeal examined the possible meanings of “for” and concluded that “for” in section 11(2)(e) was used for emphasis only. Justice Richardson noted that legislative drafters often convey emphasis through the use of a combination of words and said that (at 12,330): I am inclined to think that the framers of s11(2)(e) employed both expressions to convey emphasis and perhaps to bring out the intent that the contract must be genuine and so the services must be supplied under that contract to and for the other contracting party. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the Court said that section 11(2)(e) would have been worded quite differently if the intent had been to preclude zero-rating, unless a non-resident recipient of a supply was the only person who could benefit from the services supplied. Penlington J considered that this result was consistent with one of the underlying themes of zero-rating - the preservation of New Zealand’s competitiveness in world trade. It was also recognised that if advertised merchandise is sold in New Zealand, GST will be imposed on the sale at that time. The Commissioner accepted the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” in Wilson & Horton for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). In that context, “for and to” was a composite phrase. “For” simply emphasised “to” and does not connote any requirement that services must be provided for the exclusive benefit of the recipient of the supply. If services are supplied pursuant to a contract with a non-resident and are for that non-resident, section 11(2)(e) would have applied to zero-rate the supply regardless of any other benefits also arising to a New Zealand resident (provided that the other requirements of the section are satisfied). The Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” is not restricted to the supply of advertising space in a newspaper. It also applies to the supply of advertising space in all forms of publication and to the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). This Ruling deals with the application of section 11A(1)(k) to the supply of advertising space in publications, such as newspapers and magazines. The Ruling also covers the supply of advertising time on radio and television, or by way of any other broadcasting service, e.g. the internet. For the purposes of the Ruling, the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. 6 “Directly in connection with” Previously the publishing industry had asked the Commissioner to clarify the application of the “directly in connection with” exclusion in section 11(2)(e) (now section 11A(1)(k)) in this context. This ruling brings up to date that clarification by taking into account recent legislative amendments. A supply of services to a non-resident will not be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k) if the services are supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement to the land) or moveable personal property (other than choses in action and goods which are referred to in section 11A(1)(h) or (i)) situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. There have not been any cases on the meaning of “directly in connection with” under the new provision (section 11A(1)(k)). However, given that the identical phrase has been used in the new provision the following case law that considered the earlier provision (section 11(2)(e)) is still relevant to the interpretation of the phrase. Case law The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton did not discuss the meaning of “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(e), nor resolve whether advertising space is supplied directly in connection with the newspapers in which advertisements are placed. The High Court had accepted that the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was not “directly in connection with” the subject matter of the advertising. During the Court of Appeal hearing, the potential argument that the services are supplied directly in connection with the newspapers themselves was also raised. However, the Court of Appeal did not allow the Commissioner to introduce this new line of reasoning, as it would have changed the basis upon which the assessment was made and objected to. The determination of whether or not services are supplied “directly in connection with” land or moveable personal property depends on the circumstances in which the services are supplied. In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441, Bathgate DJ considered the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” (it is to be noted that the word “directly” was not used) in the context of section 165 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) and noted (at 59,444 and 59,446): It may be that only an empirical and common sense approach to the interpretation of the words can be applied in each particular case to determine where, if at all, the line should be drawn to allow or not allow expenditure ‘in connection with’ an assessment. However I believe that a narrow interpretation of the words ‘... any expenditure ... in connection with ... the assessment ...’ is the correct interpretation ... ... It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. 7 In the context of GST, the meaning of “directly in connection with” for the purposes of section 11(2)(a) \[now section 11A(1)(a)\], prior to its amendment in 1988 when the words “directly in connection with” were removed, has been judicially considered by the High Court in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 and the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) in Case P78 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,532. Before amendment, section 11(2)(a) provided for zero-rating of services supplied “directly in connection with” transportation. The High Court and TRA cases concerned the application of section 11(2)(a) to various charges (landing dues, international terminal charges, and rubbish disposal charges) levied on overseas airlines. The High Court and the TRA adopted similar interpretations of the words “directly in connection with” under section 11(2)(a). The Auckland Regional Authority case summarises the reasoning of the TRA in Case P78 (at 11,084): There, the Taxation Review Authority, Judge Barber, held that “airport dues” were zero-rated for GST because passengers cannot realistically be transported to New Zealand by air unless a plane lands and parks on the tarmac; that charges for those services can be regarded as provided for international passengers who are in a sense “outside New Zealand” until they pass through customs. The services are fundamental to and directly connected with the transportation of passengers; The High Court and the TRA focus on whether a supply of services is fundamental or integral to transportation to determine whether the “directly in connection with” test in section 11(2)(a) is satisfied. This reasoning is not strictly relevant for the purposes of interpreting “directly in connection with” in section 11A(1)(k). This is because the focus of section 11(2)(a) was on services directly connected with transportation services, and the identification of a direct connection between a service and another service, and a service and an item of property, involves different considerations. In Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551 the TRA applied the proviso to section 11(2)(e) and considered the words “directly in connection with”. The objector in Case S88 purchased motor vehicles from its non-resident parent company and then sold the vehicles to independent dealers, who on-sold them to the public. The parent company provided a contractual warranty to the objector. The objector agreed with the dealers that if a vehicle was repaired under warranty the objector would reimburse the dealer. The objector would then register a claim with the parent company under the warranty and receive payment pursuant to that claim. The TRA was required to consider whether the repair services provided by the objector pursuant to its contract with the non-resident parent were zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The TRA concluded that section 11(2)(e) could not apply to zero- rate this supply as the services were supplied “directly in connection with” moveable personal property (the vehicles) situated in New Zealand at the time the services were provided. Although, the TRA did not examine the meaning of “directly in connection with” in great detail, it did state (at 7,558): The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. The TRA decision was appealed to the High Court in CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819. In dismissing the appeal Justice McGechan found that 8 repairs to vehicles were “directly in connection with” the cars in New Zealand, at page 15,830: I have held S\[uzuki\]NZ provided a repair service to SMC. SMC was not resident in New Zealand. I have no doubt that repair services were carried out directly in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. Quite simply, they were repairs carried out on cars within New Zealand. The situation equates \[to\] “painting the ship”. The nexus could not be closer.....I conclude that SNZ’s supply of repair services to SMC was not zero- rated. The High Court decision was appealed in Suzuki New Zealand v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096. The Court of Appeal agreed that the repairs were directly in connection with the motor vehicles and upheld the High Court’s decision and dismissed the appeal. The High Court in Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 also considered the words “directly in connection with” but in the context of section 11(2)(b) \[now section 11A(1)(e)\]. In Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410, the TRA considered whether the supply of video services for Japanese honeymoon couples to a Japanese company was zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The decisions in both of these cases are consistent with the cases mentioned above. There have been no further cases relating to the interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with”. Therefore, the case law discussing “in connection with” and “directly in connection with” indicates that the interpretation of the test will be dictated by the particular context involved. The Commissioner considers that the “directly in connection with” proviso in section 11A(1)(k) should be interpreted narrowly (Judge Bathgate’s words from Case E84 quoted above support this), and that there must be a clear and direct relationship with moveable personal property or land in New Zealand before a supply will be standard-rated. This is consistent with the approach of the TRA in Case S88 in identifying on the facts of that particular case a “direct relationship or connection” between the repair services and the vehicles under repair. This was supported by the Court of Appeal in Suzuki which held that: The repair services were obviously supplied in relation to goods, namely motor vehicles, which were situated in New Zealand. The supply of repairs could hardly be more directly connected with the motor vehicles. Advertising space and advertising time The supply of advertising space in a publication is the supply of the service of communicating an advertising message, involving all the steps required to achieve communication of the advertisement. This service is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisement. In the words of the High Court in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (at 11,224): The supply of space and services rendered by Wilson & Horton are directly connected with the advertising but not with the goods advertised. The goods are, as it were, at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor. 9 The Commissioner agrees with this view. There is no direct relationship or connection between the provision of advertising space and the subject matter of the advertisement. The same reasoning also applies to the supply of advertising space in all types of publication as well as advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). The supply of advertising space or time in these media cannot be described as “directly in connection with” the advertised commodity. Similarly, when advertising space is supplied in a publication, the services are not supplied directly in connection with the publication in which the advertisements are published. The High Court judgment in Wilson & Horton concluded that the provision of advertising space was supplied directly in connection with (if anything) the advertising itself. The advertised goods were considered to be at least one step removed from the services. The Commissioner considers the same logic applies in respect of a newspaper or other publication. The service of communicating an advertising message is directly connected with that message and not the publication. The publication is at least one step removed from the service and is merely the medium in which the advertising message is publicised. Accordingly, the service is not supplied directly in connection with the publication produced by the publishers. Consequently, the supply of advertising space in either a publication or by way of broadcast will be treated in the same way for GST purposes. The supply will qualify for zero-rating, provided that the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Supplies through agents The application of section 60(2) may also need to be considered to determine whether a supply is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made by a registered person to an agent who is acting on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. Therefore, if a supply of advertising space or time is made to a New Zealand resident person who is acting as an agent for a non-resident principal, section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the non-resident principal and not the resident agent. Section 11A(1)(k) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11A(1)(k) are satisfied. A common example of this is where a resident advertising agency acts as an agent for a non-resident person in purchasing advertising space or time in New Zealand. Conversely, if a supply is made to a non-resident person who is acting as an agent for a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply, section 11A(1)(k) will not apply to zero-rate the supply even if the criteria in section 11A(1)(k) are otherwise satisfied. The supply will be deemed to be made to the resident principal and it will not be to a non-resident person. Section 11A(2) Section 11A(2) (formerly section 11(2A)) was introduced to deal with situations where services are provided to non-residents and persons in New Zealand receive the 10 performance of these services. Section 11A(2) will not affect the provision of advertising services to non-residents in the circumstances covered by the arrangement described in this Ruling. The performance of these services is not received in New Zealand by other persons. Examples For the purposes of these examples, it is assumed that: • A person referred to as a resident is a “resident” as defined in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The converse applies to non-residents; and • If the services are supplied to a non-resident, the non-resident is outside New Zealand at the time of performance of the services. Example 1 A UK resident manufacturing company contacts a New Zealand magazine publisher and books advertising space for a newly developed product. The UK company has a GST registered subsidiary in New Zealand that sells the advertised product. The supply of advertising space by the magazine publisher to the UK manufacturer is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). This is because: • The publisher supplies the services contractually to a non-resident. The fact that the New Zealand resident subsidiary potentially may benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. • The services are not supplied directly in connection with either the products for sale in New Zealand or the magazines in which the advertisements are shown. Example 2 A US resident distributor of soft drinks contracts for the supply of radio time on a national radio station in New Zealand. The soft drinks are available from all chains of supermarkets throughout New Zealand. The supply of radio time by the New Zealand radio station to the US distributor is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). This is because: • The radio station supplies its services contractually to a non-resident. The fact that New Zealand resident retailers throughout New Zealand may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. • The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand. Example 3 11 An Australian computer distributor plans to advertise its product range in New Zealand. The computers will be available through all major computer distributors in New Zealand. The Australian company contacts a New Zealand resident advertising agency to arrange an advertising campaign. The agency, acting in the capacity as agent for the Australian company, purchases air time on a New Zealand resident television channel. The supply of air time by the television station to the Australian company is zero- rated under section 11A(1)(k). This is because: • The television channel supplies the air time services contractually to a non- resident. Section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the Australian company, as principal. The New Zealand resident advertising agency receives the supply as agent only. • The fact that New Zealand resident distributors may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand.
1 PAYMENTS MADE BY PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF STUDENTS TO STATE SCHOOLS – GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 03/04 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8 and 10(2) of the Act and the definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment of amounts (whether described as “school fees”, “activity fees” or otherwise) by parents or guardians of pupils who are New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents (or who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) and who are enrolled at state schools (including schools integrated within the state system of education under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975) to a Board of Trustees of such a school. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: A payment which is consideration for the supply of goods or services by a registered person, in New Zealand, in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, is subject to GST. Payments made by parents or guardians of children who are New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents (or who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) and who are enrolled at state schools to the Board of Trustees of such a school for the purpose of a general fund to assist with meeting school costs, are not consideration for the supply of education to which there is a statutory entitlement and which the Board has a statutory obligation to provide free of charge. Therefore, GST is not payable on such amounts. If other services, not integral to the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement, are supplied on the basis that the supply is conditional upon payment being made for such services, the payment is consideration for that supply. GST is chargeable on payments made in those circumstances. 2 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 20 June 2003 to 20 June 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20 th day of June 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 03/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 03/04 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter of the Ruling was previously considered in Appendix B of TIB Vol 2, No 4 (November 1990) at page 1. The Ruling replaces that earlier item. Background State primary and secondary schools are controlled and managed by their Boards of Trustees: section 75 of the Education Act 1989 (“the Education Act”). Under that section, except to the extent that any enactment or the general law of New Zealand provides otherwise, a school’s Board has complete discretion to control the management of the school as it thinks fit. Under section 93 of the Education Act, every state school is required to have a Board of Trustees. Grants are paid out of public money to Boards for the purpose of administering their schools: section 79 of the Education Act. The Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 (“the PSCI Act”) enables private schools originally established to provide education with a special character to become part of the state system of education as an integrated school. Under section 7 of the PSCI Act, integration is effected by the proprietors of a private school entering into an integration agreement with the Minister of Education. Upon integration, an integrated school becomes part of the state system of education and is subject to the legislation governing other state schools, but subject to the PSCI Act: section 4 of the PSCI Act. Under section 40(2) of the PSCI Act, the proprietors of integrated schools own, hold on trust, or lease the land and buildings of the schools and are liable for all mortgages, liens, and other charges in respect of the land and buildings. They are also responsible for the maintenance and preservation of the special character of the school: section 3(3) of the PSCI Act. As with other state schools, the controlling authority of an integrated school is its Board of Trustees: section 25(5) of the PSCI Act. Under section 70 of the Education Act, the Secretary of Education may specify the terms and conditions applying to land and buildings occupied by Boards of Trustees, whether or not the land and buildings are owned by the Crown. The terms and conditions specified may include standards of maintenance of capital works and minimum safety and health requirements. Every Board is to have a written charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school Board that will give effect to the Government’s national education guidelines and the Board’s priorities: section 61. A copy of the school’s first charter and every updated charter must be provided to the Secretary of Education: section 62. The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the Board to the Minister to take all reasonable steps to 4 ensure that the school is managed, organised and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and the school, its students and community achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: section 63 of the Education Act. A school charter will not take effect if the Secretary of Education determines that it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: section 63A Education Act. The Secretary of Education may direct a Board to get specialist support if the Secretary considers that the Board is not meeting or is not likely to meet its statutory obligations (including the aims, purposes and objectives of its charter): section 64A of the Education Act. The national education guidelines are defined in section 2 of the Education Act as the national education goals, foundation curriculum policy statements, national curriculum statements, and national administration guidelines, for the time being in force under section 60A of that Act. Section 60A(1) permits the Minister to publish by notice in the Gazette all or any of the following: (a) National education goals (that is to say statements of desirable achievements by the school system, or by an element of the school system): (aa) Foundation curriculum policy statements, which are statements of policy concerning teaching, learning, and assessment that are made for the purposes of underpinning and giving direction to⎯ (i) The way in which curriculum and assessment responsibilities are to be managed in schools: (ii) National curriculum statements and locally developed curriculum: (b) National curriculum statements (that is to say statements of⎯ (i) The areas of knowledge and understanding to be covered by students; and (ii) The skills to be developed by students; and (iii) Desirable levels of knowledge, understanding, and skill, to be achieved by students,⎯ during the years of schooling): (c) National administration guidelines, which are guidelines relating to school administration and which may (without limitation)— (i) set out statements of desirable codes or principles of conduct or administration for specified kinds or descriptions of person or body, including guidelines for the purposes of section 61: (ii) set out requirements relating to planning and reporting including— (A) scope and content areas, where appropriate: (B) the timeframe for the annual update of the school charter: (C) broad requirements relating to schools' consultation with parents, staff, school proprietors (in the case of integrated schools) and school communities, and the broad requirements to ensure that Boards take all reasonable steps to discover and consider the views and concerns of Maori 5 communities living in the geographical area the school serves, in the development of a school charter: (D) variations from the framework for school planning and reporting for certain schools or classes of schools, based on school performance: (iii) communicate the Government's policy objectives: (iv) set out transitional provisions for the purposes of national administration guidelines. Regulations providing for the control, management, organisation, conduct, and administration of schools may be made: section 78 of the Education Act. Regulations made under section 78 prescribing a course of study are not to restrict the method by or manner in which any subject forming part of the course is to be taught, except to the extent necessary to ensure that the teaching of the subject is consistent with the general aims of the course. Under section 3 of the Education Act, everyone who is not a foreign student (that is, generally a New Zealand citizen or resident) is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any state school during the period beginning on their 5th birthday, and ending on the 1st of January after their 19th birthday. Students enrolled at an integrated school are entitled to free education on the same terms and conditions as students enrolled at other State schools: section 35(1) of the PSCI Act. However, the proprietors of an integrated school may require payment of attendance dues as a condition of enrolment and attendance: section 36 of the PSCI Act. The money received from attendance dues can only be used for the purpose of meeting debts, mortgages, liens, or other charges relating to the school premises or for improvements required under the integration agreement or for capital works required by the Minister pursuant to section 40(2)(d) of the PSCI Act: section 36(3) of the PSCI Act. Attendance dues paid to the proprietors of integrated schools are payments to secure the enrolment of a pupil in a school for which the proprietors provide the buildings and ensure the special character, and are subject to GST. See Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032. Each year parents or guardians of students enrolled at state schools may be asked by school Boards for payment of a nominated amount to assist with meeting school costs. These payments are commonly referred to by schools as “fees”. In the case of integrated schools such fees are in addition to attendance dues payable to the proprietors. A Ministry of Education Circular (Circular 1998/25), however, states that whatever terms are used to describe such payments, they are in fact donations and cannot be made compulsory. Schools may also ask for payments to cover a variety of items including: the cost of class trips, the cost of materials in practical subjects such as workshop technology, the cost of swimming lessons, fees for performances by visiting drama groups etc. These payments are commonly referred to as “activity fees”. 6 The Ruling addresses the issue of whether such payments (however described, but commonly referred to as “school fees” or “activity fees”) are subject to GST. Legislation Under section 8 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”), GST is charged on supplies (other than exempt supplies) made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity by reference to the value of the supply. The value of the supply is determined under section 10(2). Section 10(2) states: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,⎯ (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Act reads as follows: “Consideration” in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: Application of the Legislation Scheme of the Act Under section 8(1), GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person by reference to the value of the supply. The value of the supply is the consideration provided for the supply (including both monetary consideration and non-monetary consideration): section 10(2). GST is not payable on payments which are not “consideration” as defined in the Act. “Consideration” is widely defined. Consideration The statutory definition of “consideration” is wider than the contract law meaning of “consideration”. In The Trustee, Executors and Agency Co New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 Chisholm J commented in respect of the definition of “consideration” as follows: In the context of this matter I am not persuaded that it is helpful or appropriate to reflect upon the ordinary meaning of the word. The statutory definition extends the ordinary meaning and it is the scope of the extended statutory definition which needs to be determined. (p.13,085) The following principles can be drawn from the cases on the statutory definition of “consideration": 7 • Under the first part of the definition of “consideration”, it is irrelevant whether the payment is voluntary. No contract between the person making the supply and the person providing the consideration is necessary. The supply need not be made to the person who makes the payment: Turakina Maori Girls’ College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032. In the Turakina case McKay J, referring to the definition, said: It is clear from this definition that the supply of any service for consideration is part of a “taxable activity” under sec 6, even though it is to a person other than the person who provides the consideration. Likewise, the value of the supply is to be measured by the consideration, whether or not the consideration is provided by the person to whom the service is supplied. It is not necessary that there should be a contract between the supplier and the person providing the consideration, so long as the consideration is “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supply”. • The supply also need not be made by the person who receives the payment. In Trustees & Executors Chisholm J said: ... in my opinion the crucial factor is the strength of the connection between the payment and the supply. If there is sufficient proximity between the supply and payment to satisfy the requirement that the payment is “in respect of” (or “in response to, or for the inducement of”) the supply of goods then the payment qualifies as “consideration” notwithstanding that the payment is made to a third party. (p.13,086) • Although the statutory definition of “consideration” is wider than the contract law meaning, not every payment received by a registered person is “consideration” for GST purposes. A distinction is drawn between a payment in respect of the payee’s taxable activity and a payment that is consideration for a supply of goods and services: Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636. • For a payment to be “consideration” within the first part of the definition, there must be a sufficient relationship between the making of the payment and the supply of goods or services. See CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147; Trustees & Executors. In the NZ Refining case Blanchard J said: It is fundamental to the GST Act that the tax is levied on or in respect of supplies. It is not a tax on receipts or on turnover; it is a tax on transactions: C of IR v Databank Systems Ltd. It is therefore necessary, as Mr Green submitted, to distinguish between supplies and the taxable activity (as defined in s 6) in the course of which they are made. The definition in s 6 itself requires a nexus between a supply and consideration, as does s 10. The tax itself is levied by s 8 on a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and is “by reference to the value of that supply”. Section 10 provides that the value of a supply is “to the extent of the consideration for the supply” the amount of the money involved or the non-monetary open market value of the consideration. Already, before turning to the definition of “consideration”, it can be seen that, again, a linkage between supply and consideration is requisite to the imposition of the tax. The definition of “consideration”, though broad, cannot and does not dispense with that requirement. To constitute consideration for supply a payment must be made for that 8 supply, though it need not be made to the supplier nor does the supply have to be made to the payer. There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. The mechanics of the legislation will otherwise make it impossible to collect the GST (p.13,193). \[Emphasis added\] • An expectation that the payee will supply goods and services is not enough. It is not sufficient that the person who receives the payment carries out some activity which has the effect of benefiting either the person making the payment or some other person. It is also not sufficient that the payment enables the payee to carry on its activity. Hence, a payment made by the Crown to a charitable trust established by the Crown to promote the economic development and well-being of the Chatham Islands and to promote the provision of services in the interests of the community was not consideration for GST purposes. The trustees were fulfilling their fiduciary duties under the trust and the payment was not an inducement for the performance of services by the trustees. Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075. • The expressions “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” in the definition involve an element of reciprocity: Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075. • There can be two separate supplies for GST purposes where performance of services under a contract with one person, is also performance under a separate contract with another person. In Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 the Court of Appeal said: \[23\] ....This is simply an instance of the common enough situation in which performance obligations under two separate contracts with different counter-parties overlap, so that performance of an obligation under one contract also happens to perform an obligation under another. In such case a supply can simultaneously occur for GST purposes under both contracts. There is a nexus in both cases between the performance and the consideration given by the other party. In Suzuki, the taxpayer had an obligation to repair defective vehicles under a warranty given by the taxpayer to its customers. In turn, the taxpayer had a warranty from its parent company (from which the taxpayer had purchased the vehicles) and had received payments from the parent company for carrying out the obligations of the parent company under the parent company’s warranty. There were two separate supplies: the supply of repair services under the warranty to customers and the supply of repair services to satisfy the obligations of the parent company under its warranty. As two separate supplies were made, the Court of Appeal did not accept that the Commissioner had sought to impose tax on the same supply \[para 24\]. Existing statutory obligation There have been two GST cases relating to a situation where the parties had statutory rights or obligations outside any contractual relationship there might have been 9 between the parties. These are: Television New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,295 and Case U1 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,001. The TVNZ case concerned payments made by the Maori Affairs Department to the Broadcasting Council (whose assets and liabilities were later vested in TVNZ) for the purpose of a training scheme operated by the Broadcasting Council (and later TVNZ) for Maori trainees. The taxpayer’s argument was that a supply had not been made for the payment because in collaborating with the Maori Affairs Department the Broadcasting Council was merely discharging a statutory obligation to be a good employer (which included operating a personnel policy that complied with the principle of being a good employer, including recognition of the aims and aspirations of the Maori people, the employment requirements of the Maori people, and the need for greater involvement of the Maori people as employees of the Broadcasting Council). Tompkins J held that the Broadcasting Council had made a supply of services, being the provision of the training programme. There was a contractual obligation to provide the services and the fact that the supply was in accordance with the statutory obligations of the Broadcasting Council did not affect the conclusion that a supply was made under the contract. Under contract law, the performance of a statutory duty is not consideration, although the undertaking of something more than the bare discharge of the duty can be good consideration: see Ward v Byham \[1956\] 2 All ER 318; Williams v Williams \[1957\] 1 All ER 305. The TVNZ case is consistent with that principle. There was reciprocity between the Broadcasting Council and the Maori Affairs Department. Payment would not have been made if the services had not been provided. The Broadcasting Council had discretion as to how it would carry out its statutory obligation to be a good employer. The provision of training services under the agreement with the Maori Affairs Department was in accordance with the Broadcasting Council’s statutory obligations, but there was no direct and specific statutory obligation to provide the training. In Case U1 the taxpayer had granted a lease which provided that the tenant had an obligation to pay rates (in addition to rental). The tenant in Case U1 was an “occupier” under the Rating Powers Act 1988 (being the lessee of a property under a lease for a term of not less than 12 months). Under that Act the occupier has primary liability to pay rates. The issue in Case U1 was whether the payment of rates formed part of the consideration for the lease. (Hence, the issue considered in Case U1 was slightly different from the issue considered in the TVNZ case.) Judge Barber considered and rejected the argument that the payment of rates was consideration (as the obligation contained in the lease to pay rates was “in respect of” the lease) and that the payment of rates by the lessee was part of the inducement to persuade the landlord to lease the farm at the rental figure agreed upon and was also part of the lessee’s response to the granting of the lease. Judge Barber considered that the lease merely recorded the legal position and was not consideration as the payment of rates by the lessee satisfied the lessee’s own statutory obligation rather than an obligation of the lessor. (However, the payment of rates by a lessee under a lease would be part of the consideration for the lease if the lessor was primarily liable for payment of rates and the lessee had accepted an obligation under the lease to meet the lessor’s liability.) 10 In both cases, the essential issue was whether there was a sufficient relationship between the payment and a supply. The fact that one of the parties has an existing statutory duty is to be considered in that context. 11 Role of School Boards In Maddever v Umawera School Board \[1993\] 2 NZLR 478 Williams J discussed the role of school Boards as follows: The 1989 Act was based on Administering for excellence: The Report of the Task Force to Review Education Administration (the Picot report (1988)) which found that the existing administrative structure of the Education Act 1964 was over-centralised and overly complex. Its recommendations for change were largely implemented in the Education Act 1989, the title of which states that it is “An Act to reform the administration of education”. The statute brought about a marked devolution of decision making away from the Minister of Education so that schools became the basic unit of education administration. The primary mechanisms in the statute to achieve the legislative objectives were the novel concept of Boards of Trustees who were given by s 75 broad powers to manage schools and the idea of a school charter.... Williams J then referred to section 61 of the Education Act. Williams J went on to say: It is thus clear that the Act contemplates that the board, in consultation with the Minister, should have a significant role in determining the school’s educational goals and a degree of independence in deciding how those goals should be achieved. While the Ministry of Education influences a school’s broad objectives through the application of the national educational guidelines established under s 60A... and the Minister also has a power of approval of school charters, the guidance thus provided is in rather general terms. It is for the parents, staff and other persons to largely determine the distinctive character of the charter for a particular school. (p.505) Williams J noted that the accountability of school Boards was achieved in a number of ways, including the requirement that Boards must adhere to their charters. The policy of the Education Act, therefore, is to decentralise the administration of education so that Boards of Trustees are responsible for the control and management of the schools. Although school Boards have considerable power to manage schools, such powers are subject to any enactment and the law of New Zealand: sections 72 and 75 of the Education Act. The Education Act provides for a number of ways of achieving accountability of Boards, including the obligation to adhere to their school charters (which must incorporate guidelines specified by the Minister for the education services to be provided). What are education services? The term “education” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as: 1 the act or process of education or being educated; systematic instruction. 2 A particular kind of or stage in education (further education, a classical education) 3 a. development of character or mental powers. b. a stage in or aspect of this (travel will be an education for you). It is possible to define the limits of the obligation of school Boards to provide education services (and, therefore, the scope of the entitlement to free education). The national education guidelines issued by the Minister specify: • the outcomes desired from the school system; 12 • the policy concerning teaching, learning, and assessment for the purposes of underpinning and giving direction to the way in which curriculum and assessment responsibilities are to be managed; • the subjects in which education is to be provided (including areas and levels of knowledge). The type, level, and standard of instruction or education to be provided in state schools is specified by the Minister in broad terms through the issue of the national education guidelines or by regulation. Every school must have a school charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school Board that will give effect to the Government’s national education guidelines and the Board’s priorities: section 61. Although the Board itself has a significant role (through the preparation of the school’s charter) in determining the aims and objectives of the school and how these are to be achieved, the charter will not take effect if the Secretary of Education determines that it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: section 63A. The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the Board to the Minister to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the school is managed, organised and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and the school, its students and community achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: section 63. Therefore, school Boards have an obligation to provide education (which complies with the requirements of the national education guidelines). New Zealand citizens and residents (or children who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) have a statutory right to free enrolment and free education at any state school: section 3 Education Act 1989. The Ministry of Education (which is responsible for developing the national education guidelines and the review of school charters) has issued a circular to Boards of Trustees and principals of state and integrated schools on the rights of Boards, parents and students regarding the rights of Boards of Trustees, parents and students regarding requests for donations and other forms of payments in schools: Circular 1998/25. The Ministry’s views are that: • No charge can be required for materials used in delivering the curriculum such as photocopying charges, use of musical instruments, use of computer facilities, as the right to free education implies that there should be no charge for materials used in the delivery of the curriculum. However, students may be charged for the hire of musical instruments owned by the school and used outside the basic delivery of the music curriculum. Also, a charge may be made for costs involved in project work (such as the production of a T-shirt in a design class) if the student takes ownership of the finished product. Schools cannot, however, insist that the students take the finished product home. 13 • No charge can be made for attendance at a school camp which is a compulsory part of the school’s curriculum or which is part of the content of a particular course at the school. The Ministry has stated in the circular that it considers that: It is reasonable, however, for parents to be asked to contribute towards the cost of food and towards the costs which are involved in travel to and from the camp. In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to pay for a camp, teachers should try to provide work which will be an appropriate alternative to the camp. In cases where attendance at an outdoor or recreational activity is voluntary, parents should expect to meet the costs involved if they agree to their children’s participation. • Students should not be excluded from activities organised away from school as part of the curriculum (for example, field work in geography, biology and outdoor education programmes). The Ministry says: It is reasonable to expect parents to pay the travel costs which are inevitably connected with such activities, provided the staff have made every effort to minimise costs by ensuring that the activities are held as close to the school as possible. In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to pay for a trip, teachers should provide an alternative which would give the student an insight into the curriculum experience covered by the trip. To avoid misunderstanding which may lead to later problems with payment, boards should ensure that parents are made aware of the situation at the beginning of the year. • Boards cannot require the purchase of a workbook which accompanies a course and in which answers are written, but the circular indicates that where a student chooses to purchase a workbook, a charge may be made. The Ministry considers that workbooks lie between textbooks, which are provided free to students, and stationery, which students are expected to provide for themselves. • No charge can be made for programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages, special education services (speech therapy, behaviour or learning difficulties) or music tuition. The circular says resourcing is provided to schools for these programmes as part of the conventional curriculum or through the Ongoing Resource Scheme, Specialist Education Services or Special Education Grant. • No charge may be made where secondary schools purchase tertiary level courses which they offer to senior students as part of the school programme. However, where the school merely facilitates enrolment in a tertiary course for students, the student would be enrolled only part-time at the school and would be required to pay the fees associated with the tertiary course. • A charge can be made for in-school activities such as performances by visiting drama groups at which attendance is voluntary. • Boards are required by the national education guidelines to report on student progress and they are also subject to the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. Therefore, Boards are not entitled to withhold items such as reports or leaving certificates to encourage parents to pay school donations or to resolve unpaid debts for services provided by the school. 14 The Commissioner accepts the views expressed in the circular. The supply of services which are necessary to the supply of education services (in which a school Board has an obligation under its charter to provide instruction and in which participation by students is compulsory) are also within the scope of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement to receive free of charge. Examples of services that are necessary to the supply of education services are as follows: • The use of materials or goods necessary for delivering the curriculum. Examples are the use of computers, photocopying charges for materials used in delivering the curriculum, materials for practical subjects (such as woodwork); • The right to participate in activities which are a compulsory part of the curriculum. Examples are outdoor education camps which are part of the curriculum, fieldwork in geography or biology; and • The provision of remedial programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages, special education services (speech therapy, behaviour or learning difficulties). There is a distinction between such supplies and supplies made in circumstances where the supply made is not necessary to the supply of education services and students have a choice as to whether to receive the supply such as: • Goods are supplied where there is a take-home component (for example, the supply of stationery or the supply of materials where a student is entitled to ownership of the finished product from practical classes such as woodwork). In such circumstances a school may not insist that the student take ownership of the goods supplied; or • Attendance at or participation in activities is voluntary; or • Transport to and from school activities (such as a camp) or food at the camp are supplied. Whether sufficient relationship between payment and a supply Grants paid to school Boards by the Crown are deemed to be consideration for a supply. Under section 5(6) of the Goods and Services Tax Act, payments in the nature of a subsidy or grant made by the Crown or any public authority to a person in relation or in respect of that person’s taxable activity are deemed to be consideration for a supply. The Commissioner considers that school Boards also make an actual supply of education services for which the grant received from the Crown is consideration. The definition of “consideration” does not require the supply to be made to the person providing the consideration: Turakina. The supply of education services in terms of the undertaking given to the Minister may be taxed only once, but GST would be chargeable on any separate supply of education services made by the Board to parents: Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190; Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096. Payments made by parents 15 or guardians may supplement the grant received from the Government. School Boards have a considerable degree of autonomy as to how their funds are used. How the amounts paid are used is not the test of whether a supply is made for the payment: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. The Turakina case also confirms that how payments are used does not determine the nature of the supply for the payments. In Turakina the court rejected the argument of the taxpayers that because attendance dues were applied to meet mortgage obligations of the proprietors of the schools, the attendance dues were paid for exempt supplies (being the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal or any other amount in respect of a debt security in terms of sections 14(a) and 3(1)(ka)): see p.10,037. There is an expectation that amounts paid will be used for the purposes of the school. However, when the supply of education services is not conditional upon payment being made, the payments are not made for any particular purpose and the school Boards do not undertake any obligations in return for payment, the Commissioner considers that there would not be a sufficient relationship between the payment and the supply of education services (or any other services). Refer Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. Some school Boards may attempt to collect amounts unpaid by withholding items, e.g. reports, leaving certificates, school magazines, until payment is made. It is possible to argue that although school Boards have an obligation to the Minister to supply education services, if there is a threat to withhold education services unless payment is made, there is a separate obligation to parents to supply education services under a separate transaction with the parents. On that basis it could be argued that the payments are consideration, being a payment for the inducement of the supply of education services. However, the cases emphasise that for a payment to be consideration for a supply, there must be a sufficient relationship between the payment and the supply. The relationship between the pupils and the school Board is based at least partly on the Education Act: refer Grant v Victoria University of Wellington (CP312/96; 13 November 1997; High Court, Wellington). There is a statutory right to free education. School Boards have a corresponding statutory obligation to provide education in state schools free of charge. The Boards are responsible for providing free education in state schools. They cannot contract out of that statutory obligation. Although Boards may represent that education services would not be supplied if payment is not made, the true legal nature of the transaction is that the Board is obliged to supply education services free of charge. In the Chatham Islands case Tipping J commented: GST is payable on transactions. When deciding whether a particular transaction is of a kind which attracts GST, it is important to analyse carefully its legal characteristics. A person may waive a statutory benefit conferred on that person under a statute if the waiver does not infringe some public right or public policy: see Bowmaker Ltd v Tabor \[1941\] 2 All ER 72; Reckitt & Colman (New Zealand) Ltd v Taxation Board of Review \[1966\] NZLR 1032. To determine whether a statutory right to free education 16 can be waived, it is appropriate to consider whether the purpose of the legislation under which the right is conferred would be infringed by the waiver or contracting out: see Johnson v Moreton \[1978\] 3 All ER 37; Lieberman v Morris 69 CLR 69. Sections 20 and 25 of the Education Act require all New Zealand citizens and residents between the ages of 6 and 16 to be enrolled at a state registered school and to attend the school. Private schools must satisfy requirements as to the suitability of premises, staffing, equipment and curriculum, and, in order to be registered, must give students a tuition no lower in standard than that of tuition given to students enrolled at state schools: section 35A of the Education Act. The purpose of the PSCI Act was to enable private schools, originally established to provide education of a special character, to be brought within the state system of education as integrated schools. As with other schools in the state system, the Board of a private integrated school is responsible for the provision of education free of charge to their pupils. Parents have the choice of having their children educated at non-state schools. It could be argued that in that sense the statutory entitlement to free education can be waived. However, the statutory entitlement is to free enrolment and education in state schools. The public policy objective expressed in the Education Act is that all children are to receive education of a minimum standard. The provision of public funding for education and the entitlement to free education are intended to ensure that cost is not a barrier to education access. Therefore, it can be argued that the right to free education is not solely a private right. If Boards were able to impose a requirement for the payment of “fees” and individual parents were able to waive the right to free education, the purpose of the legislation would be infringed. Although school Boards have wide discretion to manage and control schools, such powers cannot be exercised in a manner inconsistent with a statutory provision: sections 72 and 75 of the Education Act. The Commissioner’s view is that school Boards do not have the power to require the payment as a condition of the provision of education or any other services or items that are properly regarded as being integral to the supply of education to which there is a statutory entitlement. However, given that an illegal activity can be a taxable activity, and given that the definition of “consideration” does not require a contract to exist between the supplier and recipient for a payment to be consideration, payment need not be enforceable for the payment to be consideration. Therefore, the fact that the transaction is invalid because parties do not have power to enter into a transaction, does not mean that the transaction would not be recognised for GST purposes. In C & E Commrs v Oliver \[1980\] 1 All ER 353 it was held that a taxpayer who dealt in stolen cars had made a supply for VAT purposes, and the fact that the contracts of sale might subsequently become void was not relevant. However, the statutory entitlement to education could not be altered by a representation that education services are conditional on the payment of “fees”. Amounts paid to the Board of Trustees of a state school would not be consideration for the supply of education services even if there was a representation that reports or other information relating to the assessment of students would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position ). However, if school Boards supplied other goods or services not integral to the supply of education services on the basis that the supply was conditional upon payment being made, the payment would 17 be consideration for that supply. If a separate charge is not made for an item such as a school magazine, there will be a case for apportionment of the payment. Section 10(18) states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Conclusion Amounts paid by parents are not consideration for the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement, because: • The GST definition of consideration is not the same as the contract law definition. A contract is not required between parents and school Boards for the payments to be consideration for GST purposes: Turakina. However, for the payments to be consideration for a supply, there must be a sufficient relationship between payments and a supply: NZ Refining; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust; Suzuki; Trustee Executors. • As there is a statutory right to free education, in circumstances where the amounts are not paid for any particular purpose or for the Board undertaking any specific obligation there is not a sufficient connection between the payments and a supply (whether of education services or a supply of a different nature). This is so even though there is an expectation that the payments would be used for the Board’s taxable activity: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust; NZ Refining. The fact that the amounts are used to pay for things not covered by the government grant does not establish that they are paid for services of a particular nature: Turakina; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. • It is possible to argue that where a representation is made that education services would be withheld if payment is not made, the payments would be made “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of” the supply of education services. However, as there is a statutory entitlement to free education in state schools, the true legal position is that education services would be provided whether or not payment was made. Therefore, there would not be a sufficient connection between the payment of “fees” and the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement. • GST consequences are determined on the basis of the legal character of the transaction: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. The relationship between parents and school Boards is based on the Education Act, which requires Boards of state schools to provide education and entitles students to free enrolment and education at state schools, and the PSCI Act which entitles students enrolled at integrated schools to free education on the same terms and conditions as in state schools. The true legal nature of the arrangement between parents and the school Board is that school Boards have a statutory obligation to provide free education and students have a right to free education. The supply of education services is not conditional upon the payment being made, and payment is not required for the supply of education services. 18 • A statutory right conferred on a person may be waived only if the waiver does not infringe the purpose of the legislation: Bowmaker Ltd v Tabor; Reckitt & Colman v TBR; Johnson v Moreton; Lieberman v Morris. The purpose of the Education Act is that all children should receive education of a minimum standard, and there should be no barriers to access to such education. That purpose would be infringed by a waiver of the right to free education and an ability of school Boards to require the payment of “fees” for education. The scope of the obligation to provide education services is defined by the national education guidelines, incorporated in every school charter, and by the school’s charter. The supply of reports and other information relating to the assessment of students is integral to the supply of education services, and are to be supplied free. The amounts would not be consideration, even if there was a representation that the supply of such information would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position). Therefore, GST is not payable on amounts paid for the purpose of a general fund to assist the schools with meeting costs or for “activity fees” for activities which are an integral part of the course requirements in which the school has an obligation to provide instruction and in which participation by pupils is compulsory. However, if other services not integral to the supply of education services are supplied on the basis that the supply is conditional upon payment being made, the payment will be consideration for that supply. Where a separate charge is not made for such an item, apportionment may apply: section 10(18). For payments made by parents or guardians to schools to be consideration, it must be possible to identify a supply of goods or services other than the supply of education services which the schools must supply in terms of their charters. The issue requires determining which payments made to schools are made for a supply other than the supply of education services (to which there is a statutory entitlement free of charge). Examples \[It is assumed for the purposes of these examples that the students are either New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents.\] Example 1 Each year the Board of Trustees of a state school asks parents or guardians of students enrolled at the school to pay a nominated amount to assist with meeting school costs. The Board is not required to use the fee for any particular purpose and the fee is paid for the general purposes of the school. The only benefits received by pupils are facilities for common use, such as the school library, swimming pool or computer facilities. Such payments are not consideration for a supply made by the Board. Therefore, GST is not chargeable on the payments. 19 Example 2 Students at a state school are required to pay a fee for materials used in a clothing class. The students are not required to take ownership of the completed item but will not be entitled to ownership unless payment is made. The fee is not consideration for the use of the materials as the use of such materials is necessary for the provision of instruction in the subject. However, if a student elects to take ownership of the completed item, the fee is consideration for the right to ownership of the item and the Board is liable to account for GST on the fee. Example 3 Students at a state school are asked to pay photocopying charges for materials (such as articles, extracts from textbooks or homework exercises) used in teaching. The payment is not consideration. It is implicit in the right to free education that there should be no charge for the cost of materials used in the delivery of the curriculum. The provision of photocopied materials necessary for teaching is incidental to the supply of education services. GST is not chargeable on the payment. However, if a student chooses to purchase a photocopy of an entire item (such as a workbook or a magazine produced by students) which may be retained by students, the payment made would be consideration for the supply of that item and GST would be chargeable on the payment. Example 4 A state school hires a bus to transport students on a field trip to carry out activities which are part of the geography curriculum. Students are asked for payment of an amount to cover the cost of hiring the bus. The payment does not relate to the right to participate in the activities carried out on the field trip. The payment is consideration for the supply of transport and GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 5 Students at a state school are asked to make a payment to cover the costs of food provided at a school camp and transport to the camp site. Attendance at the camp is a compulsory part of the school’s total curriculum. The payment does not relate to the right to participate in activities at the camp. The payment is consideration for the supply of food and transport. GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 6 A state school asks for payment for stationery and a workbook which students are entitled to retain. The payment is made for the supply of the stationery and the work book and is consideration. GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 7 20 A drama group puts on a performance at a state school. Attendance by students is voluntary but if students wish to attend a charge is payable. The payment is consideration for the right to attend the performance. GST is chargeable on the payment.

BR Pub 00/05 applied until 30 June 2003. This ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 00/05. Its period of application is from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2008. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale or other disposition of land by a taxpayer who is associated with another person. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of determining whether any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of land is included in the gross income of any taxpayer by virtue of paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2), the test of whether a taxpayer and another person are associated persons is applied only at the time of the acquisition of the land. The test of association is not applied at the time of the sale or other disposition of the land. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14 th day of August 2003. Martin Smith 2 General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 03/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 03/05 (“the Ruling”). Background Paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) include within the gross income of a taxpayer any amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of land if the taxpayer, or any other person associated with the taxpayer, carried on certain businesses at the time the land was acquired. For the purposes of section CD 1, associated persons or persons associated with each other are defined in section OD 8(4). The Ruling confirms that the test of association under paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) applies at the time the land is acquired. This question is important in general terms because in many cases a taxpayer may be associated with a person at the time of acquisition of land, but may not be associated with the person at the time of the sale or disposition of the land (and vice versa). A number of commentators have expressed their view as to the timing of the test of association in section CD 1(2)(b) to (d), but there seems to be uncertainty as to the correct view. This uncertainty stems from the wording and tenses used. The Commissioner’s view is, and always has been, that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired. Legislation Section CD 1(1) states: Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, being an amount to which this section applies, is gross income. Section CD 1(2) sets out the amounts that are included in the gross income of any person under section CD 1(1): For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross income of any taxpayer includes the following amounts— ... (b) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of dealing in land, and— (i) That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of dealing in land; or (ii) That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: 4 (c) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of developing or dividing land into lots, being development or division of the kind (not being work of a minor nature) referred to in paragraph (f), and— (i) That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of developing or dividing land into lots; or (ii) That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: (d) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of erecting buildings, and the taxpayer or that other person carried out, whether before or after the acquisition of that land by the taxpayer, any improvements, not being improvements of a minor nature, to that land (whether by way of erecting a building or otherwise); and (i) That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired for the purpose of that business of erecting buildings; or (ii) That improved land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which those improvements were completed. ... \[Emphasis added\] Section OD 8(4) defines “associated persons or persons who are associated” for the purposes of section CD 1: (4) In sections CD 1, FF 6, and GD 9, associated persons or persons associated with each other are— (a) Any 2 companies where there is a group of persons— (i) The aggregate of whose voting interests in each company is equal to or exceeds 50%; or (ii) In any case where a market value circumstance exists in respect of either company, the aggregate of whose market value interests in each company is equal to or exceeds 50%; or (iii) Who have control of both companies by any other means whatsoever; or (b) A company and any person (other than a company) where— (i) The person; or (ii) Any spouse of the person; or (iii) Any infant child of the person; or (iv) Any trustee of a trust under which such person or spouse or infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit,— or any 2 or more of them have, when aggregated, a voting interest in the company equal to or exceeding 25% or, in any case where a market value circumstance exists in respect of the 5 company, a market value interest in the company equal to or exceeding 25%; or (c) Any 2 persons one of whom is the spouse or infant child of the other person, or is a trustee of a trust under which that spouse or infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit; or (d) A partnership and any person where that person is a partner in that partnership; or (e) A partnership and any person, where that person and any partner in that partnership are, in accordance with this subsection, associated persons. Application of the Legislation Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2) all use the same phrase to include in a taxpayer’s gross income “Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of ...”. The question is raised as to whether the use of the words “are associated persons” means that in order for the provisions to be satisfied the test of association is applied: • At the time of acquisition of the land by the taxpayer: e.g. this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was acquired (but that person would not necessarily be associated with the taxpayer at the time of disposition); or • At the time of disposition: e.g. this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to be associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was disposed of (but that person would not necessarily have been associated with the taxpayer at the time of acquisition); or • At the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposal: e.g. this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was acquired and also to be associated with the taxpayer at the time the land is disposed of. Plain words On an ordinary reading of the words of the legislation, it seems clear that the phrase “at the time the land was acquired” relates to the carrying on of the relevant business, rather than to the timing of the associated persons test. However, it is not clear as to the point in time that the words “are associated persons” are referring to. The word “are” generally indicates a present tense and, therefore, arguably indicates that the test should be applied at the most recent point in time (i.e. the time of the disposal of the land). However, another reading of the words indicates that the test should be applied at the time of acquisition. 6 The meaning of the words without the presence of an associated person is clear: • An amount will be gross income if: • a taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, • the taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business when the land was acquired, and • the land was acquired for that business or sold within 10 years of acquisition. There are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or disposition of land. Second, the taxpayer must have been carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired. Third, the land must have been acquired for that business or sold within 10 years. Arguably the second element is the most important. The fact that the taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired is central to the issue of the taxability of any amount derived on the sale of the land. For example, if the taxpayer were not carrying on a business of dealing in land, any amount derived would not be taxable under section CD 1(2)(b). However, if the taxpayer were carrying on such a business, any amount derived would be taxable if the land was either acquired for the business or sold within 10 years. If the land was acquired for the purpose of a relevant business, it is logical that any amount derived from the sale of the land would be taxable. This is entirely consistent with the fact that any amount derived from a business is gross income under section CD 3. However, where the land was not acquired for the purpose of such a business, any amount derived would still be taxable if the land was sold within 10 years. In this situation, it is simply the fact that the taxpayer carried on the relevant business that leads to the inclusion of the amount derived within gross income. All acquisitions of land by the taxpayer are tainted by the existence of the business, regardless of whether the land is acquired as part of that business. Now consider the effect of the section where an associated person is involved: • An amount will be gross income of a taxpayer if: • the taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, • an associated person of the taxpayer was carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land, and • the land was sold by the taxpayer within 10 years of acquisition. Again, there are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or other disposition of the land. Second, an associated person of the taxpayer 7 must have been carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land. Third, the land must have been sold within 10 years of acquisition. In a situation where an associated person is involved, the central focus of the section is even more clearly the fact that a relevant business, such as dealing in land, must have been carried on at the time the land was acquired. As it is the associated person who was carrying on the required business at the time of acquisition, the taxpayer could not have acquired the land for the purposes of the business. In these circumstances the amount derived will only be taxable if the land is sold within 10 years. It is only the existence of the business at the time of acquisition that allows the section to include the amount derived on sale in the taxpayer’s gross income. The taxpayer is effectively tainted by the activities of the associated person at the time the land was acquired. The section, therefore, is concerned with what was happening at the time the land was acquired – was an associated person of the taxpayer carrying on a business of dealing in land? It would seem that in these circumstances it is logical to argue that the associated person must have been associated with the taxpayer when the land was acquired. To separate the associated persons test from the test of the relevant business is an artificial interpretation of the section. Although the section is including in gross income amounts derived on sale, the focus of the section is on the activities of either the taxpayer or the associated person at the time the land was acquired. The time of sale or other disposition of the land is certainly important in the context of section CD 1. The time of the sale of the land is the time at which the application of the section is triggered. However, once the application of the section is triggered by the sale of the land, the focus of the section is clearly on the activities which took place at an earlier time. The mere fact of the sale of the land is insufficient to include any amount derived from that sale in a taxpayer’s gross income. The scheme and purpose of the provisions is not simply to bring to tax amounts derived on the sale of property. There must be some other relevant purpose or intention, some other relevant action on the part of the taxpayer or associated person, or some link with business activities, before any amount will be included in gross income. However, as it is not completely clear on the plain reading of the words that the test is applied at acquisition, relevant case law should be considered. The question as to the relevant time for testing association does not appear to have been directly considered by any New Zealand court. However, there is implicit support in some TRA cases for the view that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired. For example, in Case H92 (1986) 8 NZTC 630, the TRA considered whether the objectors were assessable on the profit made on the sale of land, A, under any of sections 65(2)(a) and 67(4)(a), (b) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. On concluding that the objectors were not dealers in land at the time the land was acquired, the issue was then whether an associated company, P, was dealing in land when the relevant land was purchased by the taxpayer. The TRA found that the 8 company’s activities did not constitute the business of dealing in land at the time of purchase. Although the TRA did not specifically consider the time at which the parties needed to be associated, the judgment appeared to assume that this was at the time of acquisition. Bathgate DJ said (at page 642): The thrust of cross-examination of the objectors concerning P was to show that it was involved in erecting buildings when A was purchased by the objectors. At that time P and the objectors were associated persons for the purposes of sec 67(4)(b) and (c). \[Emphasis added\] Case T25 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,160 concerned whether a taxpayer was assessable on the proceeds of the sale of a commercial property. The question to be answered by the TRA was whether, on the date of acquisition by the objector of his interest in the commercial property, the objector carried on any business of developing or dividing land into lots or whether on that date any associated person of the objector (i.e. the CC Partnership or the R Syndicate) carried on such a business. Although the timing of the test of association is not specifically referred to by Barber DJ, his Honour makes it clear that he considers the time of acquisition to be the appropriate time and he proceeds on that basis. When discussing whether the objector was a developer or subdivider as at the date of acquisition of the property, his Honour stated (at pages 8,174 – 8,175): However, as at 17 October 1978 only two relevant projects had been undertaken. One subdivisional project (of residential land) had been completed and the other was a building project so that, at that date, the objector could not be described as carrying on the business of developing or dividing into lots ‘any land’ and nor was any associated person of the objector at that time. I appreciate that the CC Partnership and the R Syndicate each commenced in 1974 and ended in late 1979; but on the crucial date, 17 October 1978, the nature of their activity did not offend s 67(4)(ba). \[Emphasis added\] Barber DJ’s statement that the CC Partnership and R Syndicate ended in 1979 impliedly gives strong support for the proposition that the time for the test of association is at acquisition. In this case the property in question was disposed of in 1988. In these circumstances, if the test of association were to be applied at the time of disposal the above comments by Barber DJ would have been irrelevant. Notwithstanding the above statements, it is clear that the issue of the timing of the test of association was not argued in Case H92 or Case T25. Case law, therefore, provides limited guidance on the interpretation of the words “are associated persons” in the context of land sales. However, case law does indicate that one should be careful in the interpretation of tenses. The use of a tense may be decisive only if it is clear what the tense used relates to. For example, in Maradana Mosque Board of Trustees v Mahmud \[1967\] 1 AC 13, the Privy Council considered a provision that empowered the Minister to make a certain order if satisfied that a school “is being administered” in contravention of the Act. Counsel for the Minister argued that it was permissible to take account of the past running of the school. The Privy Council held that only the current method of administration at the time of the order could be considered. 9 By way of contrast, in Norman v Simpson \[1946\] 1 All ER 74 the United Kingdom Court of Appeal needed to interpret the words “have been” and concluded that the expression could be equated to “are” or “is” in the context before the Court. In that case the use of the words “have been” did not limit the Court to considering only the point in the past at which the sub-letting commenced. In relation to section CD 1(2), it can be argued that the use of the word “are” does not necessarily limit the inquiry to the present time and that it could be interpreted as operating in the past tense. The approach of the courts has been that if the use of a tense is not clear or is ambiguous, other sources such as the statutory context and the scheme and purpose of the legislation will be used as aids in determining the correct interpretation. This approach is also consistent with the Court of Appeal’s approach to statutory interpretation set out in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175. Section GD 9(1) The associated persons test is used in many provisions of the Revenue Acts. Generally, these provisions are unhelpful for present purposes as it is obvious in most cases that the associated persons test relates to only one point in time. However, section GD 9(1) is relevant here because it is closely related to the provisions currently being considered. Section GD 9(1) deals with the situation where a person transfers land to an associated person some time after acquisition. Section GD 9(1) is in the nature of an anti-avoidance provision, and applies where land is transferred from a “transferor” to a “transferee” and the transferor and the transferee “are associated persons”. If the transferee later sells or otherwise disposes of the land, any amount derived from the transaction is gross income of the transferee if that amount would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1(2). Section GD 9(1) states: Where— (a) Any land has been transferred from any person (the “transferor”) to any person (the “transferee”); and (b) The transferor and the transferee are associated persons; and (c) The transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that land and the consideration from that sale or disposition exceeds the cost of the land to the transferee; and (d) If, had the transferor not transferred the land to the transferee but instead had sold or otherwise disposed of the land for the consideration referred to in paragraph (c), that consideration would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1 – that consideration shall be deemed to be gross income of the transferee under section CD 1. Thus, section GD 9(1), like section CD 1(2), also uses the phrase “are associated persons” in a context where its meaning could be ambiguous. The section is concerned with the situation of a property being disposed of at a profit or gain, i.e. something that happens in the present and triggers the application of the section. 10 However, the section also refers to the earlier transfer from the transferor to the transferee who “are associated persons”. In section GD 9(1), the words “are associated persons” clearly relate back to the earlier time of the transfer from the transferor to the transferee, rather than the present time of the disposal of the land. The words “are associated persons” are followed by “and the transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that land”. The use of the word “subsequently” denies any connection to the event of disposal to the words “are associated persons”. The section, therefore, is an example of words in a present tense being used to relate to a past event. Section GD 9(1) clearly supports the conclusion that “are associated persons” does not necessarily mean associated at the most recent point in time, i.e. the time of disposal, but can be interpreted as “were associated persons”. In the case of section GD 9(1), this means looking back to the time of acquisition by the relevant taxpayer, i.e. the transferee. Legislative purpose The use of the associated persons test in section CD 1(2) is essentially for anti- avoidance reasons and aims to stop the use of associated persons who are not carrying on any relevant business. This was referred to in the Parliamentary Debates in 1973 on the Land and Income Tax (Annual) Bill (which contained the predecessor provisions to section CD 1). Mr Munroe (MP, Invercargill) explained the difficulties in applying the then current law on the taxation of profits relating to land and the need for amendment, and stated (NZPD Vol. 386, 1973: 3653): There is a provision in the \[Land and Income Tax\] Act which makes dealing in real or personal property for profit or gain assessable for tax. The Inland Revenue Department has had difficulty with this provision because of interpretations of it by the courts. The courts have tended to take the view before they will uphold an assessment, that as there is no capital gains tax in New Zealand there must be a clear pattern of previous dealings, or the circumstances must be such as to leave an inference that a profit motive was present at the time of purchase. In cases where the taxpayers have been land dealers or builders they have been able to avoid assessment of profits on property deals by claiming quite successfully that the property was held as an investment even if the sale was made shortly after acquisition. In other cases the land dealers or builders have held properties in the names of members of their families or in associate companies for the purpose of avoiding tax on the sale of the properties. \[Emphasis added\] If the intention were to prevent dealers in land using associates (who are not dealers) to acquire the land, one would expect that the relevant association would need to be examined at the time of acquisition. The intention behind the provisions of section CD 1(2) would seem to be to make it more difficult for a person who is carrying on one of the specified businesses to hide behind associated persons. If the test of association applies only at the time of disposal, this would mean that associated person purchasers of land who are “substituted” for land dealers could avoid being taxed where the association was technically terminated immediately before the disposal of the land. 11 Furthermore, if the association test applies only at the time of disposal, it would apply to persons who happen (by way of “accident” or otherwise) to become associated with, for example, a land dealer just prior to their disposing of property where no taxable purpose or connection previously existed. In addition, the anti-avoidance policy would tend to suggest that the possible interpretation of applying the association test at both acquisition and disposal is also incorrect. As such an interpretation would also require the test to be applied at disposal, the concerns expressed above would be equally applicable to that interpretation. Proposed Amendments The Income Tax Bill 2002 which seeks to rewrite Parts A to E of the Income Tax Act 1994 proposes changes to section CD 1(2). Clauses CB 6 to CB 9 of the Bill expressly state that the test of association applies when the land is acquired or, in the case of builders undertaking improvements, improved, rather than at the time of disposal. In respect of builders undertaking improvements this represents a change to the current law. Whereas currently the associated persons test is applied at the time of acquisition of the land, under the proposed changes the test will be applied at the time that improvements were begun. If the Bill is passed in its present form it is currently proposed that these changes will take effect from 1 April 2005. Conclusion In paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2), on an ordinary reading of the words “are associated persons”, the time at which the test of association must be applied is ambiguous. However, the scheme and purpose of the provisions indicate that the correct interpretation is that the test of association is applied at the time the land is acquired by a taxpayer. The test is not applied at the time of sale or other disposition of the land, nor must it be applied at both the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposition.
1 “COST PRICE OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE” – MEANING OF THE TERM FOR FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/06 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces public ruling BR Pub 00/10 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 12, No 10 (October 2000). BR Pub 00/10 applied until 31 October 2003. This ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 00/10. Its period of application is from 1 November 2003 to 31 October 2008. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (and the meaning of “cost price” for the purposes of determining the value of the benefit to the employee). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a motor vehicle by an employer, who owns the motor vehicle, to an employee for the private use and enjoyment of the vehicle by the employee. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: The “cost price of the motor vehicle” for the purpose of the calculation of fringe benefit tax under section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2 will be determined as follows: • The “cost price of the motor vehicle” will include: • the purchase price of the vehicle (inclusive of goods and services tax (GST)). • the cost of initial registration and licence plate fees (inclusive of GST). • the cost of accessories, components, and equipment (other than “business accessories”) fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter (all costs inclusive of GST). • the cost of sign writing or painting the vehicle in the employer’s colours or style (all charges GST inclusive). 2 • the cost (if any) of transporting the motor vehicle to the place where the motor vehicle is to be first used (all charges GST inclusive). • The “cost price of the motor vehicle” will not include: • the cost of annual vehicle re-licensing fees. • the cost of “business accessories”, fitted to the motor vehicle at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter. • the cost of financing the purchase of the vehicle. For the purposes of this Ruling: • The term “business accessories” means accessories, components, and equipment fitted to the vehicle, required for and relating solely to the business operations to which the vehicle is used, and that are in themselves “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Act. Where powered, they will usually require the vehicle’s power source to operate them, e.g. a two-way radio, roof mounted flashing warning lights, electronic testing/monitoring equipment, etc. • The term “fitted to the vehicle” means permanently affixed to the vehicle. Permanency would not be negated if the accessory were removed from the vehicle on a temporary basis, for repair or maintenance, or on the removal of the accessory at the time of sale or disposal of the vehicle or the accessory itself. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 November 2003 to 31 October 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4 th day of September 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 03/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 03/06 (“the Ruling”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background If an employee has the private use or enjoyment, or the availability for private use or enjoyment, of a motor vehicle that is owned by the employer of the employee, the employer must pay FBT on the value of the benefit. The benefit is calculated by reference to the cost price of the vehicle to the employer, not the value of the benefit to the employee. If an employer purchases a motor vehicle to be used by, or to be made available for use by, an employee, a number of costs are incurred in addition to the purchase price of the vehicle for the vehicle to be in a state where it can be used by the employee. Some of the additional costs include: • On-road costs. Under section 5 of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986, no motor vehicle can be driven on the road unless: • the motor vehicle is registered; and • the registration plates and a current license issued for the vehicle are affixed and displayed on the vehicle; and • the full amount of the accident compensation levy has been paid. • The cost of transporting the vehicle to the initial place where it is to be used. • The cost of fitted accessories, components, or equipment required for and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used. • The cost of accessories, components, and equipment, such as towbars, roof racks, and stereos, fitted to the car at the time of purchase or at some later time. This Ruling identifies the costs that form part of the “cost price of the motor vehicle” for the purposes of calculating FBT. The Commissioner considers the cost of motor vehicles includes accessories that are permanently affixed to the vehicle. Everything that is permanently affixed to the vehicle, including accessories such as CD players, towbars, and radiotelephone sets, is part of the cost to the employer of making the vehicle available to the employee. Accessories not so permanently affixed are not part of the cost price of the vehicle in the first place and their FBT (or other income tax) status is to be determined separately. However, the Commissioner considers that certain accessories, permanently fitted to the vehicle and relating solely to the business operations for 4 which the vehicle is used, should not be treated as part of the cost of the vehicle for FBT purposes. For example, a radiotelephone set fitted to the vehicle and only able to be used for business purposes would be excluded from the vehicle’s cost price because it is a “business accessory”. On the other hand, a mobile phone is an example of an item considered not to be part of the cost price of the vehicle because it does not meet the test of being permanently affixed to the vehicle. Legislation Section CI 3(1) provides a formula for calculating the value of the fringe benefit that consists of the private use and enjoyment, or the availability for the private use and enjoyment, of a vehicle. This formula is: • y x z when the benefit is subject to FBT on a quarterly basis; and 90 y x z when the benefit is subject to FBT on an income year basis. 365 In these formulae, if the benefit is subject to FBT, (z) is the amount calculated in accordance with Schedule 2. Schedule 2 states: PART A – MOTOR VEHICLES Subject to clause 3, in relation to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) to any income year, and to any motor vehicle that in the quarter or income year is provided by any person for the private use or enjoyment of an employee or is available for such private use or enjoyment, the value of the benefit that would be able to be enjoyed by the employee, if the employee had unlimited private use or enjoyment or availability for private use or enjoyment of the motor vehicle in that quarter or income year, shall be, - (a) Where the motor vehicle is owned (whether in the person’s own right or jointly with any other person) by that person, 6% or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) 24% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to that person or, as the case may be, those persons: (Emphasis added) (b) Where the motor vehicle is leased or rented by that person from any other person (that person and that other person being associated persons) under a lease or rental agreement that commenced - (i) ... (ii) On or after 23 September 1985, 6% or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) 24% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to the person who is the owner of the motor vehicle at the time the benefit is provided to the employee: (Emphasis added) The definition of “Adjusted tax value” in section OB 1 states: (a) Means, in relation to any depreciable property of a taxpayer and any particular time (and subject to section EG 11, in the case of property in a pool, and to section EG 19(10)(a), in the case of software to which that section applies), the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: bv (base value) - ad (aggregate deductions) 5 where – bv (base value) is – (i) Except where paragraph (ii) or paragraph (iii) or paragraph (iv) of this item applies, the cost of the property to the taxpayer (excluding any expenditure of the taxpayer allowed as a deduction under any provision of this Act or the Income Tax Act 1976 other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18 of this Act or sections 108 to 108N and section 113A of the Income Tax Act 1976): (Emphasis added) Application of the Legislation The determinative factor in the calculation of FBT on motor vehicles is the “cost price of the motor vehicle to that person” (the employer) as contained in Schedule 2. The calculation of fringe benefit tax on the provision of a motor vehicle to an employee is based on the vehicle’s cost price, and not its value to the employee. This was the “test” adopted by Parliament and confirmed in C of IR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327. At pages 7,334 and 7,335 Sinclair J said: The Tenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act clearly states that the value of the benefit is an amount equal to “6% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to that person”, where “that person” is the person providing the benefit. In other words, the schedule expressly states that the value of the benefit is to be calculated by reference to the cost price to the employer. There is no justification in the legislation for defining the term by reference to the value of the benefit to the employee rather than the cost of the benefit to the employer. There is no room for an employee notion to be introduced when construing the Schedule. The above comment is consistent with the intent of Parliament that the cost price of motor vehicles for FBT purposes should equal the cost to the employee, had the employee purchased the vehicle rather than having the vehicle provided by the employer. In introducing the Tax Reform Bill 1990, on the 19 December 1990, the then Minister of Revenue (Hon. Wyatt Creech) said that the amendment to the FBT rules was to ensure that the value of the motor vehicle for FBT purposes included GST. He said that this was to ensure that the FBT “cost price” would equate with the cost that the employee would have had to pay had the employee purchased the vehicle. Meaning of “cost price” “Cost price” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of the FBT rules. It is, therefore, not clear whether it is limited to the purchase price of the vehicle, as some suggest, or whether it includes costs incidental to the purchase, such as on-road costs and the costs of transporting the vehicle to the place where it will be used. The words “cost” and “cost price” are used extensively throughout the Act. Section OB 1 defines these words for a very limited number of sections where the words are used. Examples include: • For the purposes of Part EE (the trading stock rules) “cost” is defined as: 6 In Part EE, for trading stock other than an excepted financial arrangement, means costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring trading stock to its present location and condition including purchase costs and costs of production calculated under sections EE 5 to EE 7. (Emphasis added) • “Cost price” in relation to “specified leases” means: ... the amount of expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the lessor in acquiring and installing that lease asset... (Emphasis added) The significance of these two definitions (even though they have limited application in the Act) is that they both include a reference to costs (“bringing to its present location” and “installing”) that are more than simply the purchase price of the item in question. In the definition of “cost” (for the purposes of the trading stock rules), it could be argued that getting the stock “to its present location” is synonymous with “installing” as used in the definition of “cost price”. “Install” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as “place (heating or lighting etc.) in position for use”. While the two definitions relate to the two different sides of the revenue/capital distinction, they both relate to the assets used in a business. This leads to the view that there may be very little difference (if any) between the terms “cost” and “cost price” as used throughout the Act. This view is supported by the comments of Fullagar J in Australian Jam Co. Pty Ltd v FCT (1953) 10 ATD 220. This case concerned the valuation of trading stock. At 570 the Judge said: The words ‘cost price’ in the section \[relating to the valuation of trading stock\] are perhaps not literally appropriate to goods manufactured, as distinct from goods purchased, by the taxpayer, but I feel no difficulty in reading them as meaning simply ‘cost’. This implies that “price” adds nothing to the meaning of “cost”. “Cost price” is simply “cost”. In commenting on the above citation in an item entitled “Some Aspects of Valuation of Trading Stock for Income Tax Purposes” in the NZ Universities Law Review, Vol. 1 (September 1964), ILM Richardson (now Sir Ivor) said: If “price” adds anything to “cost” it is only in emphasis, in stressing that what is involved is the actual expenditure of money by the taxpayer with relation to the trading stock. In Phillip Morris Ltd v. F.C. of T. 79 ATC 4,352, the Supreme Court of Victoria had to decide what constituted “cost price” for the valuation of cigarettes (trading stock) on hand at the end of an income year under section 31(1) of the Income Tax Act Assessment Act 1936. The Court determined that in respect of manufactured goods: ...t he words “cost price” in that subsection \[section 31(1)\] should be understood as meaning “cost”. Both the above cases (Australian Jam and Phillip Morris) considered section 31(1) of the \[Australian\] Income Tax Assessment Act, which gives taxpayers an option of valuing trading stock at its “cost price”. The wording of the section is very similar to the former New Zealand equivalent - section EE 1(3) prior to amendments that applied from the 1998-99 income year - that is, the same “cost price” option applied to New Zealand taxpayers. It follows that in considering the use of the words “cost 7 price” in New Zealand, the courts would arguably adopt the same position as the Australian courts in the above decisions. Where the words are used in other parts of the Act (including Schedule 2), and there is no specific definition, it is considered that “cost price” should be given a similar interpretation. This means that “cost price” as used in Schedule 2 for FBT purposes also means “cost”. In discussing trading stock, some authorities take the view that “cost price” relates to things purchased, while “cost” relates to things manufactured. For example, in Phillip Morris Jenkinson J said: The statutory conception of “cost price” or, in the case of manufacturer’s stock, “cost” is merely a value at a particular time... (Emphasis added) In Australian Jam, Fullagar J said: The words ‘cost price’ in the section \[relating to the valuation of trading stock\] are perhaps not literally appropriate to goods manufactured, as distinct from goods purchased, by the taxpayer, but I feel no difficulty in reading them as meaning simply ‘cost’. (Emphasis added). In TRA Case S12 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,102, Barber DJ considered what is meant by “its cost price” in relation to the valuation of foals born to broodmares owned by a horse breeder. He determined that the foal’s cost price should include the write-down (depreciation) of the broodmare. At 7,107 he said: ...the Legislature has provided that the breeder or farmer must take progeny into account at “its cost price”. Those words do not seem to me to be a particularly happy choice because “cost price” is normally that which a merchant buys something (refer Sixth Edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary). The cost is the price to be paid for a thing and the price is the money or other consideration for which a thing is bought or sold. The taxpayer has not purchased the foal but has had the foal created through the mare after servicing from the stallion. However, in their context, the words “its cost price” must be given a sensible interpretation. In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd Edition) a meaning for “cost” is “That which must be given in order to acquire, produce or effect something”. (Emphasis added) In these cases the courts make a distinction between “cost” and “cost price”. “Cost” relating to manufactured goods (the cost of manufacture) and “cost price” relating to goods purchased (the cost of purchase). However, under both the Australian and the former New Zealand trading stock valuation rules there is only one option for valuing trading stock at cost and that is its “cost price”. In terms of the legislation, therefore, both manufacturers of trading stock and purchasers of trading stock are required to value their goods under its “cost price”. So, in the trading stock context at least, “cost price” includes both the terms “cost” and “cost price”. Trading stock context As mentioned above, the trading stock rules changed with effect from the 1998-99 income year. The current definition of “cost” applying to the valuation of trading stock requires the “cost” to include, “any costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring the trading stock to its present location and condition including purchase costs and costs of production calculated under sections EE 5 to EE 7”. The effect is that now trading stock must be valued by the taxpayer using generally accepted accounting principals (section EE 5(1)). Effectively, section EE 5(2) says 8 that the trading stock must comply with Financial Reporting Standard No.4 (FRS 4) 1994 (Accounting for Inventories). In FRS 4, the value of inventories (trading stock) is to include: 4.6 “Cost of inventories” is the total of: (a) cost of purchase (as defined in paragraph 4.10 below); (b) costs of conversions (as defined in paragraph 4.13 below); and (c) other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 4.10 “Cost of purchase” includes: (a) import duties and other purchase taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable); (b) Transport and handling costs (c) ... (Emphasis added) As this standard applied from 1994 (replacing the previous standard -SSAP 4), presumably FRS 4 could have been used as a guide by taxpayers in valuing trading stock under the former valuation option, “cost price”. That the Commissioner accepted similar calculations to FRS 4 is illustrated by the contents of an item on the valuation of trading stock published in Public Information Bulletin No.82 (December 1974). This item set out the three options available to taxpayers, being cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. It then went on to define “cost” - (note: not “cost price”). In respect of purchases of finished goods the item said: Here the cost should include freight inwards, customs duty, insurance, and sales tax in addition to the actual purchase price of the goods. (Emphasis added) In the context of their use in relation to trading stock, the words “cost” and “cost price” are interchangeable. Depreciation context The only provisions that deal with valuation of capital assets in the Act are the depreciation rules set out in Subpart EG. Generally, business assets are “depreciable property” as defined in section OB1, being property that “might reasonably be expected ...to decline in value ...while used or available for use ...in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income”. This is provided that the assets are not trading stock, land, financial arrangements, or intangible property. Motor vehicles are “depreciable property” and will qualify for depreciation deductions under Part EG. Under section EG 2(1)(a) depreciation is calculated: • where the diminishing value method is being used, on the “adjusted tax value” of the property. 9 • where the straight-line method is being used, on the “cost of the property” to the taxpayer. “Cost” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of section EG 2. “Adjusted tax value” is defined in section OB 1. The main component of this definition is the “base value” of the property. “Base value” in the majority of cases, especially in respect of property acquired after the beginning of the 1993-94 income year, will be its “cost”. As stated above, as far as trading stock is concerned there appears to be no difference between the use of the words “cost” and “cost price”. The words are interchangeable. If the same applies in respect of the word “cost” used in subpart EG, it could mean that “cost” and “cost price” are interchangeable elsewhere in the Act, e.g. in Schedule 2, in determining the “cost price” of a motor vehicle for FBT purposes. The definition of “cost price”, as it applies to Schedule 2, was discussed in C of IR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd. This case considered whether the “cost price” in respect of motor vehicles was the GST inclusive or exclusive cost. While it was not necessary for the Court to formulate an exhaustive meaning of “cost price”, Sinclair J concluded that the words “cost” and “price” are susceptible to a wide variety of meanings. At page 7,332 Sinclair J referred to expert accounting evidence on the meaning of “cost” and stated: This accords with the expert evidence given by two accountants, Mr John Hagen and Professor David Emanuel. Professor Emanuel cited a number of definitions of “cost” from leading textbooks on accounting: “(a) ‘Costs represent the financial sacrifices which are involved in acquiring or producing assets.’ Ma, Matthews and Macmullan, The Accounting Framework (2 nd Ed, 1987) at p 43. (b) ‘Accountants have placed a great deal of emphasis upon the principle of objective evidence, and nowhere is it more apparent than in accounting for the acquisition of plant and equipment. Cost is used as the valuation method in this instance because it is more easily identified than any other valuation and because it is said to be the sacrifice given up now to accomplish future objectives.’ McCullers and Schroeder, Accounting Theory: Text and Readings (1978) at p 233. (c) ‘We define cost here as the sum of the quantitative representations of the sacrifices necessarily incurred to bring the fixed asset to its place and state of use.’ Most, Accounting Theory (1977) at p 235. (Emphasis added) (d) ‘Cost is thus the economic sacrifice expressed in monetary terms required to obtain a specific asset or group of assets.’ Hendriksen, Accounting Theory (3 rd Ed, 1977) at p 270. (e) ‘Cost is an economic sacrifice, an outflow of wealth, by giving up asset value or incurring liability value.’ Staubus, Activity Costing for Decisions (1988) at p 192.” Professor Emanuel then summarised the position by saying that: “Cost is the economic sacrifice associated with getting the purchased item to its current location and condition.” (Emphasis added) It is interesting to note that here the accountants used the term “cost” rather than “cost price” – the term (as used in Schedule 2) that the Court was considering. This is consistent with the earlier analysis that the words are interchangeable. In Atlas Copco the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the accountants. At page 7,333 the Court said: 10 Counsel for the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the two accountants on the basis that the interpretation of “cost price” is a question of law for the Court, and to rely upon the interpretation of accountants would infringe the “ultimate issue” rule. Moreover, counsel felt that the accountants had mistakenly placed economic substance over legal form in analysing the nature of the payment paid by the purchaser. It is true that defining “cost price” is a question of statutory interpretation and, as such, must be resolved by the Court. Where the meaning of words in a statutory context is unclear or ambiguous, however, the Court may derive some assistance from common business parlance and practice, as well as international standards. Moreover, as I have already discussed, the approach of the accountants accords with both the economic substance and the legal form of the transaction: the GST component of the purchase price which may be recovered by a registered purchaser cannot be considered part of the effective “cost price”. (Emphasis added) Here the Court accepts that where uncertainty in the legislation exists, common business practice can be taken into account in defining terms or words. As sufficient doubt surrounds the use of the words in question, accounting or business usage may be of assistance. Generally, the accounting treatment is that the initial cost of a fixed asset includes the costs of putting it into the working condition necessary for its intended use, installation costs, and freight etc (see for instance, FRS 4, 4.6(c), and the expert evidence given in Atlas Copco (cited above)). This further strengthens the proposition that no fundamental difference exists between “cost” and “cost price” as used in the Act. Conclusion On the above analysis it is concluded that “cost” and “cost price” as used in the Act are interchangeable. The calculations of both terms, using accepted accounting principles, include costs in addition to what can be termed the “purchase price”. This means that for the purposes of the phrase “cost price of the motor vehicle” in the FBT rules, the “cost price” of a motor vehicle will be more than just its purchase price. What is the “cost price” of a motor vehicle for FBT purposes? When a new motor vehicle is purchased, a number of Government charges have to be paid before the purchaser can use the vehicle on the road. The purchaser may also have accessories fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at a later date. Some of these accessories may be of a non-business nature, such as a towbar, CD player, CNG/LPG conversion, air conditioning, alloy wheels, etc. Generally, unless they are part of a special deal, these accessories will be additional costs to the purchaser. In some instances the purchaser may have a business accessory, e.g. a radio-telephone, fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at a later date. The question to be considered is whether all or any of (the cost of) these items forms part of the “cost price” of the vehicle. Government charges 11 Fees payable at the time of purchase of a new car so that it can be driven on the road include: • Once only payments: registration fee, number plate fee. • Annual (recurring) fees: annual relicensing fee, ACC levy, label fee. It is arguable that without payment of the initial registration and plate fees (as distinct from the recurring annual re-licensing fees) by the employer the vehicle cannot be used immediately. The employer has to pay these costs before the vehicle can be “put on the road” or in a position to be used. This suggests that they are properly to be treated as part of the “cost price” of the car. Support for the view that “cost” includes such items as getting the vehicle “on the road” so that it can be used, is found in the High Court of Australia case of BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT (1960) 8 AITR 113. At page 117, Kitto J in considering the issue of what was included in the term “cost”, said. ... in my opinion, the word “cost” in section 56 (1)(b) bears the meaning which it has in the business life of the community. It seems to me impossible to suppose that the depreciation provisions of the Act are intended to apply only to those simple cases in which the ascertainment of cost is a purely arithmetical process. I interpret it as embracing the whole sum which, according to accepted accountancy practice as applied to the circumstances of the case, ought to be considered as having been laid out by the taxpayer in order to acquire the subject-matter as plant, that is to say installed and ready for use as plant for the purpose of producing assessable income. (Emphasis added) Therefore, the cost of the vehicle must include expenditure making it “ready for use” by the taxpayer. Without payment of the registration and plate fees the vehicle is not ready for the purpose intended. Whether the costs of the initial registration fee and the plate fee form part of the cost of the vehicle is not entirely clear. The Commissioner considers the better view of the law, and the likely intent of Parliament, is that such expenses form part of the cost price of the vehicle, particularly given that they are one-off costs that fall into the “once and for all payments” category (see BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209) and hence are capital in nature. These fees are intended to make the vehicle able to be used. The remaining fees are annual charges and normal accounting practice would treat them as revenue expenditure, even if they were incurred upon purchase of the vehicle. In summary, the better view is that registration and plate fees are “once and for all” payments, are of a capital nature, make the vehicle able to be used, and are part of the “cost price” of the vehicle. Annual charges (licensing, ACC levy, etc.) are revenue expenditure and not part of the “cost price”. Business accessories 12 Generally, accessories permanently fitted to the motor vehicle are properly to be included as part of the vehicle’s cost. As discussed earlier, accessories, such as stereos, towbars, roofracks, etc., fitted to a vehicle will form part of its cost price. However, some components or equipment fitted to vehicles may be of a purely business nature. The issue arises as to whether such components or equipment should also be included in the “cost price of the vehicle” for FBT purposes. There is no legislative direction on this issue. This may indicate that all accessories, components, or equipment attached to the vehicle form part of its “cost price”. It is arguable, however, that business accessories, components, and equipment fitted to the vehicle should not be treated as forming part of the cost price, where they are required and relate solely to the special business operations for which the vehicle is used, and are in themselves depreciable property for the purposes of the Act, e.g. a two-way radio telephone in a salesperson’s vehicle. Such components or equipment are fitted to the vehicle to facilitate the business use of the vehicle, and may be considered as separate business assets located in the vehicle. Another factor (relevant to this last-mentioned aspect) possibly pointing to the components or equipment as not being part of the cost price, is to consider the nature of the assets and how they are treated by businesses for accounting purposes. For example, it is most likely that components such as two-way radios are accounted for and depreciated separately. The radios can be removed from vehicles, or moved from one vehicle to another, and it seems logical that they be treated as separate assets for depreciation purposes. Note: motor vehicles and radiotelephone equipment are listed separately in Depreciation Determination DEP 1. Two-way radios have their own depreciation rate because they are regarded as assets in their own right and not accessories (to a motor vehicle). They form part of a larger asset, for example, the entire radio telephone network, consisting of radios in vehicles and the central control unit in the employer’s premises. In such circumstances, even though they are a form of accessory or addition to the motor vehicle, they are an asset in their own right and therefore require a separate asset classification. Usually, radio networks are purchased as a package consisting of a number radios (for each vehicle) plus the central control station. To treat the network as part of the cost price of each car would require an apportionment of the overall expense, including installation costs to each vehicle. The Commissioner does not consider this to be a sensible approach. The same could be said of accessories such as roof mounted flashing lights, and electronic monitoring equipment. If these types of assets are added because they are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, they will be treated similarly to the two-way radio system. Therefore, where business components, such as two-way radios, roof mounted flashing lights, electronic testing or monitoring equipment, etc., are fitted to the vehicle and are paid for by the employer, they do not form part of the “cost price” for FBT purposes. As mentioned earlier, such accessories are business assets of the employer, coming within the definition of “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Act. 13 As previously discussed under the heading “Application of the Legislation”, it was the clear intent of Parliament that the “cost price” for FBT purposes should equal the cost to the employee had the employee purchased the vehicle rather than having it provided by the employer. It follows that if the employee had to pay for the vehicle, the cost to the employee must also include accessories fitted to the vehicle as already discussed. Exceptions are the cost of separately depreciable components or equipment fitted to the vehicle solely to meet the special needs of any business operations for which the vehicle is used. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that business components fitted to the vehicle, which are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, and are in themselves depreciable property, should be excluded from the “cost price” of motor vehicles for FBT purposes. This covers assets requiring the vehicle’s power source in order to operate: they are not part of the cost price of the car itself. There may be isolated instances, where the type of business asset mentioned above will unavoidably be used for non-business purposes. The Commissioner considers that any extraordinary and unenvisaged use of the accessory for non-business use over the life of the asset will not in itself negate the purpose of fitting the accessory to be “solely for business purposes” in this context. Cost of non-business accessories Commonly, when a vehicle is purchased the owner asks for certain “extras” or accessories (other than business accessories) to be fitted to the vehicle. If these accessories are not “optioned” (and included in the purchase price), the dealer will charge for their cost and fitting to the vehicle. Such accessories can include: • stereos, towbars, sunroof, roofrack, CNG/LPG conversions, alloy wheels, air- conditioning, electric windows and locking systems, higher specification tyres, etc. Where the vendor charges for any of these accessories, the question arises as to whether they should be added to the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. The same issue arises if the accessories are acquired from another person or supplier, or acquired at a later date. Such accessories are of a capital nature and should be added to the vehicle’s purchase price to arrive at its “cost price”. They are part of the vehicle as a whole and are not generally removed at the time the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of. They are either singularly or collectively a “once and for all” payment(s), culminating in the “cost price” of the vehicle that is provided to the employee by the employer for the employee’s “private use and enjoyment”. Under this interpretation, the cost price may vary from period to period, depending on when accessories are added (or in the unlikely or rarer event of an accessory being removed). 14 Therefore, in summary, accessories fitted to a vehicle form part of its “cost price” for FBT purposes (as contemplated in Schedule 2), irrespective of the time they are purchased and fitted to the vehicle. Cost of sign writing or painting the vehicle in the employer’s colours or design It is the Commissioner’s view that costs associated with sign writing and painting the motor vehicle in the employer’s colours, logo, or design are part of the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. It was concluded earlier that “cost price” for the purposes of Schedule 2 means something more than the “purchase price” of the motor vehicle. While the cost of sign writing or painting may not add to the value of the motor vehicle, that is not the test. As discussed earlier, the test is the “cost to the employer”, not the “value to the employee”. Some may argue that the costs associated with sign writing and painting the vehicle are primarily of a business nature and should be excluded from the vehicle’s cost price. However, unlike business accessories, the sign writing and painting will generally not be depreciable property and therefore, such costs must be added to the cost of the vehicle. The better view of the law is that the costs are correctly attributable to the vehicle itself and form part of the cost price for FBT purposes. Transporting or freighting the vehicle to its place of use In the above discussion on “cost price”, it is clear that the courts have accepted that the cost of transporting or freighting goods (whether those goods are trading stock or capital assets of the business) to the place where they are to be used is part of the cost of the goods. As a general rule, the initial cost of fixed assets will include expenditure incurred to put it (the asset) into the working condition necessary for its intended use. And in Atlas Copco, “cost is ...associated with getting the purchased item to its current location and condition”. This would include installation costs and freight. The cost of transporting a purchased motor vehicle to the place where it can be used by the taxpayer, is clearly part of its “cost price”, both for FBT and depreciation purposes. For example, the purchase of vehicles direct from a manufacturer or from another source overseas, where the purchaser pays for the cost of transporting the vehicle to New Zealand. It is the Commissioner’s view that these transport costs form part of the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. However, these costs only relate to the initial cost of getting the vehicle to the place it will first be used by the employer, after acquisition. Subsequent transport costs of moving the vehicle within New Zealand (say from one branch of the employer’s firm to another) are considered to be part of the normal business operations of the employer and on revenue account. Cost of repairs and maintenance Another issue is the costs of repairs and maintenance of the vehicle and/or accessories, and whether they should be added to the cost price. 15 Generally, repairs and maintenance expenditure on the vehicle or accessories will not increase the vehicle’s “cost price” for FBT purposes. However, if work on the car is more than normal repairs and maintenance, such as replacing the existing motor with one of larger capacity, the question arises whether that alteration will increase the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. If the repair or replacement is considered to be of a revenue nature, and deductible for income tax purposes, the cost price of the vehicle will not increase in value for the calculation of FBT. On the other hand, if the repair or replacement is of a capital nature, the cost price for FBT purposes must be increased by the amount of that capitalisation. Each case will need to be considered on the basis of its own facts applying established capital/revenue distinction rules. If the FBT cost price is increased, the recalculation of FBT (on the increased cost price) will apply from the quarter in which that capital expenditure was incurred. Example 1 Employer A purchases a secondhand motor vehicle as a company car for the use of a salesperson employee. The employee will be travelling long distances, so the employer purchases a CD player and has it fitted to the vehicle. As the employee has the full use of the vehicle for private use and is likely to tow his own trailer from time to time, he asks the employer to purchase and fit a towbar to the vehicle. The employer agrees. The “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes will be the total of the purchase price plus the cost of acquiring and fitting the CD player and the towbar (all costs GST inclusive). Example 2 Employer B is looking for a vehicle to replace an existing vehicle written-off by the firm’s Wellington based accountant. The accountant will be entitled to use the vehicle for private purposes when it is not being used for business purposes. While on a trip to Auckland the employer locates a suitable secondhand car, purchases it, and has it transported to Wellington where the accountant will use it. The “cost price” of the car for FBT purposes will be the purchase price plus the cost of transporting it to Wellington (both costs GST inclusive). Example 3 Employer C decides to replace the company’s fleet of cars used by its sales representatives, because of the high cost of maintaining the existing fleet. The sales representatives are permitted to use the vehicles for private use when they are not required for business purposes. Through a contact with a motor vehicle dealer, the company decides to purchase 10 secondhand cars direct from Japan. The employer agrees on a purchase price with a Japanese car dealer and arranges for the vehicles to be shipped to New Zealand. The “cost price” of the vehicles for FBT purposes will be the total of: • the purchase price of the cars, including any costs or commissions paid in Japan or in New Zealand • the cost of transporting the cars to New Zealand 16 • GST and any import or inspection levies payable at the time of importation • the cost of initial registration and licence plate fees, and • the cost of any accessories fitted to the cars at the time of purchase or any time after purchase, either in Japan or in New Zealand. Example 4 Employer D is a forestry contracting firm, and has recently purchased a four-wheel drive motor car for its forestry foreman. The foreman has the full use and enjoyment of the vehicle for private purposes while not working. As with the employer’s other work vehicles, the car is fitted with a radiotelephone used only for communication between the company’s headquarters and its own vehicles. As the radiotelephone is fitted solely for business purposes, and may be considered a separately depreciable business asset located in the vehicle, it does not form part of the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. Example 5 An employee of Employer E is a travelling salesman. When the employer purchased a new vehicle for the employee’s use, a mobile phone kit (mobile phone and car kit) was installed in the car at the employer’s expense. The cost of the mobile phone will be excluded from the cost price of the motor vehicle because it is not “permanently affixed to the vehicle”. Whether use of the mobile phone gives rise to a fringe benefit in its own right must be decided on the facts. Comments on technical submissions received Many comments received in the course of producing this item suggested that the cost of fitted accessories should not be subject to FBT, as they have no inherent benefit for employees. As noted earlier in the ruling commentary, this argument ignores the fact that the statutory test, in the context of motor vehicles, is not the value of the benefit to the employee, but the cost price of the vehicle to the employer. It is considered that the Commissioner’s approach in excluding any such fittings and accessories on the basis of being business assets is arguably a favourable interpretation of the legislation to taxpayers, particularly when compared to the wording in the Australian legislation where such a test has been specifically legislated.
