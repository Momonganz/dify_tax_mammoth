The exemption replaces comprehensive taxation of non-portfolio FIFs if investors can obtain enough information to undertake an active business test. When investors either cannot obtain enough information or do not wish to use the active income exemption, the bill allows the use of methods used by portfolio investors (mainly the fair dividend rate method). Submitters are primarily focused on reducing the compliance costs of the new test. Before the bill’s introduction, officials had heard these concerns and made two key changes to the initial proposal in the discussion document. • One change was to make the active exemption available for investors holding an interest of more than 10% in a foreign company (down from 20% initially). • Another change was to allow the active business test to be undertaken using group financial accounts of the non-portfolio FIF, if those accounts complied with international financial reporting standards (previously this was possible only if the FIF and any subsidiaries were in the same country). This report recommends a further change which would allow the use of accounts that comply with United States generally accepted accounting principles in some circumstances. This will widen the group of non-portfolio FIFs to which the active exemption could apply. Officials have not recommended accepting submissions that call for more radical reform, such as replacing the non-portfolio FIF regime with a targeted anti-avoidance rule. Although Australia has released draft legislation for such a measure, our judgement is that it would distort investment incentives and increase fiscal costs in the New Zealand context. A number of other minor changes are recommended to the non-portfolio FIF rules in response to submissions, to ensure that legislation and policy intent are aligned. The other significant initiative in this bill is an exemption from the approved issuer levy for interest payments on certain bonds. This is intended to remove an impediment to the development of a New Zealand bond market. The exemption is limited to bonds that are listed on a recognised exchange or that are held by at least 100 people. Submissions argued for the exemption to be widened to cases in which the bond was held by, or offered to, as few as 10 people. Officials accept that a wider exemption would be used by more issuers, which could further develop a New Zealand bond market. However, this would involve additional fiscal costs. 2 Officials have recommended against accepting these submissions. This is partly because of the direct fiscal costs, but more because of concerns that a wider exemption might include transactions that are – in substance – ordinary loans. This poses a potential threat to the substantial corporate banking tax base. The potential threat would increase further if a wider exemption were used as a precedent to argue for exempting similar transactions. Other changes in this bill include a new thin capitalisation test for multinational groups based in New Zealand, the final repeal of international memorandum accounts, and some remedial amendments to the controlled foreign company rules introduced in 2009. There were few submissions on these issues. In response to some that were made, minor changes have been made to ensure clarity and correct policy outcomes. The following table summarises the key submissions and officials’ recommendations on these submissions. CHANGES TO THE FIF RULES Submission Officials’ Recommendation Page number The FIF rules should be repealed and replaced with a specific anti-avoidance rule (in line with what Australia has recently implemented). Decline 7 The grey list exemption for FIFs should be retained. Decline 8 The passive income threshold for passing the active business test should be raised from less than 5% of gross income to less than 10% (or 15%) of gross income. Decline 10 Taxpayers should be able to apply the active business test based on accounts prepared in accordance with the local GAAP standards rather than only accounts which conform to New Zealand IFRS or international IFRS. Allow US GAAP (but not all local GAAP) 11 The amount of passive income that is actually attributed should be calculated using consolidated accounts rather than detailed tax calculations being required for each individual FIF. Decline 14 The branch equivalent and accounting profits methods should be retained as alternative methods for calculating FIF income. Decline 17 The comparative value method should be available for all companies, in addition to individuals and family trusts. Decline 18 The attributable FIF income method should be able to be used by investors with less than 10% interests in certain exceptional circumstances. Accept (Matter raised by officials) 19 FIFs that are held indirectly through a CFC or another FIF should be able to use the attributable FIF income method and the exemption for FIFs resident in Australia. Accept 20 3 THIN CAPITALISATION RULES Submission Officials’ Recommendation Page number The thin capitalisation rules should not apply to New Zealand companies with non-portfolio FIFs. Decline 27 The definition of interest in the new thin capitalisation test should be clarified. Accept 30 ZERO RATE OF AIL ON BONDS Submission Officials’ Recommendation Page number The zero rate of AIL should be extended to include wholesale bonds offered to at least 10 (institutional) investors. Decline 35 The requirement that no person hold more than 10% of the bonds should be removed. Decline 36 The requirements that the issue of the security is not a private placement and that the security is not an asset- backed security should be removed. Decline 37 The zero rate of AIL should be extended to include bonds issued in currencies other than New Zealand dollars. Related to this the requirement for the registrar and paying agent activities to be performed in New Zealand should be removed. Decline 38 It should be clarified that only traded instruments qualify for the widely held bond exemption Accept (Consequential recommendation of officials) 41 REMEDIAL ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS Submission Officials’ Recommendation Page number The requirements for a Commissioner’s determination should be amended so that it disregards reinsurance claim income when considering if “all or nearly all” of the CFC’s income is from premiums or investments commensurate with insurance contracts. Accept (Matter raised by officials) 47 A remedial amendment is necessary to ensure that bond issuers and bond holders do not become associated simply by being trustees and beneficiaries in a trust that has a principal purpose of enforcing rights under the bond. Accept 48 Third-party royalty payments paid in relation to property owned by a New Zealand resident should be treated as “active”, even if those payments pass through an upper-tier and a lower-tier CFC before being returned to New Zealand. Accept 51 4 Submission Officials’ Recommendation Page number The proposal to alter the definition of deductible foreign equity distribution should be withdrawn. Accept 53 The proposal to require revaluation of inherited grey list shares should not apply if they were inherited at the cost to the testator. Relatedly, tax on revaluation gains should be limited. Accept 58 The foreign dividend exemption should be amended to ensure that all foreign dividends from greater than 10% interests in CFCs or Australian FIFs that meet the criteria in section EX 35 remain exempt. Accept 62 The FIF rules do not apply to natural persons with attributing interests in FIFs that are below a minimum threshold of $50,000. Natural persons should have the option to disregard this threshold, and so apply the FIF rules regardless of the level of their FIF interests. Accept 63 The exemption for new resident’s superannuation schemes needs to be amended to achieve the policy intention. Accept (Matter raised by officials) 65 The exemption of certain telecommunications income from the controlled foreign company rules should be altered to accommodate existing commercial arrangements. Accept (Matter raised by officials) 66 5 Changes to the FIF rules 6 7 SCOPE OF REFORM Issue: FIF rules should be repealed Submission (KPMG, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels) The FIF rules should be repealed and replaced with a specific anti-avoidance rule (in line with what Australia has recently implemented). Comment Were the FIF rules to be repealed, New Zealand would be close to having an outright exemption for FIF interests rather than an active income exemption. An outright exemption could create opportunities for taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand tax burden by shifting assets offshore that produce passive income. These opportunities arise even when the New Zealand investor does not control the foreign entity. For example, a New Zealander could invest alongside foreign investors who have similar incentives to shift income into a tax-deferral arrangement. In our view, the proposed Australian anti-roll-up fund rule would not adequately guard against this fiscal risk in the New Zealand context. Our understanding is that the Australian rule is likely to apply in very limited circumstances. Specifically, it only applies to debt investments and only when profits are retained abroad rather than distributed to Australian investors. More detail on the Australian reform can be found in the appendix. Moreover, adopting the Australian approach would mean that the various rules applying to the taxation of outbound investment would be much less integrated. There would be stark differences in treatment depending on whether the investment was portfolio, non-portfolio or in a controlled foreign company (CFC). Differences in treatment can distort decisions about the size of an interest to hold when making an international investment. These differences in tax treatment also put pressure on the boundary between the CFC and FIF rules, since there will be incentives to argue that the entity is in the regime with the most favourable tax treatment. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 8 Issue: Exemption for companies in eight grey list countries Clause 24 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exemption for 10% or greater shareholdings in companies in one of eight grey list countries should be retained. Comment The grey list was removed for portfolio FIF interests in 2007 and for CFC interests in 2009. The reasons for removing the grey list exemption in those cases are the same as the reasons for removing it for non-portfolio FIF interests. Compared with the active business test which applies equally to all jurisdictions, a grey list is arbitrary and distortionary. It creates a preference to invest into traditional, high tax jurisdictions when market growth and investment opportunities are increasingly outside of the grey list. This distortion of investment decisions was one reason why the grey list was removed for portfolio investors when the fair dividend rate method was introduced in 2007. The grey list exemption is based on an assumption of comparable taxation in the eight grey list countries. Although this assumption generally holds for active business income, it cannot be relied upon for passive income. Grey list countries have exemptions and concessionary rules for investment income to implement their domestic policy frameworks. This was the case with UK investment trusts and the Open Ended Investment Companies where gains were exempted from tax on the basis that the UK unit holders would be taxed on their investments. However, New Zealand unit holders also benefited from the entity-level exemption under the FIF grey list exemption. The removal of the grey list following the enactment of the FDR rules addressed this concern. Technical differences between different countries’ treatment of particular instruments also create opportunities for passive income to escape taxation in the other jurisdiction. For example, fixed-rate shares are sometimes classified as debt in some grey list countries such as the United States. This means that a CFC can get a deduction on the payment of a fixed-rate dividend and so would pay no foreign tax on the underlying income. Yet New Zealand would not give a deduction in equivalent circumstances. Similarly, technical differences also occur in relation to different countries’ treatment of entities. Sometimes income (particularly foreign income) flows through grey list entities without any entity-level taxation. This was the case with Australian unit trusts. It is also the case with US limited liability companies (LLCs). In the latter case, it was clarified that US LLCs would only qualify for grey list treatment if more than 80 percent of income was actually sourced in the US. 9 In such cases, a grey list exemption may allow taxpayers to escape income tax anywhere in the world on their passive income. This creates incentives to shift passive income to the relevant grey list country and is, therefore, a risk to the New Zealand tax base. Consistent with the earlier CFC changes, a “grey list of one” will be retained for greater than 10% shareholdings in foreign companies which are located in Australia. An Australian exemption recognises that a lot of smaller businesses first operate in Australia when expanding offshore. For those businesses, the compliance costs of carrying out an active business test are likely to be proportionately higher than for larger businesses, and so a specific exemption for Australia is particularly beneficial. There are differences between the tax systems of the two countries which, as noted earlier, can be a problem in the context of a grey list exemption. However, New Zealand’s relationship with Australia, including a close relationship between Inland Revenue and the Australian Tax Office, means differences can be more readily identified and monitored than in other cases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Active income exemption for branches Submission (Fonterra) The bill should include amendments so that branches are taxed consistently with CFCs (that is, an active income exemption should apply). Comment The main priority for this bill is to extend the active income exemption to non- portfolio FIFs. This extension is based on the CFC rules that were introduced in 2009. Reforming the taxation of branches in line with the CFC and non-portfolio FIF reforms is on the Government’s tax policy work programme and will form the next stage of the international tax review. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 10 ACTIVE BUSINESS TEST Issue: Passive income threshold for active business test Clause 29 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels) The passive income threshold for passing the active business test should be raised from less than 5% of gross income to less than 10% (or 15%) of gross income. Comment A 5% passive income threshold is used for applying the active business test to CFCs. It is desirable for the active business test for non-portfolio FIFs to align with the active business test for CFCs. Otherwise, FIF investments could be preferable to CFC investments. There could also be adverse consequences if a taxpayer’s investment ceases to be a FIF and falls into the CFC rules. This would have the potential to distort investment decisions and would place additional strain on the boundary between FIFs and CFCs. While the figure of 5% may seem low, this threshold allows a typical business to have a substantial portion of its assets earning passive income. This is because the gross return on typical passive investments is much lower than the gross return on typical active investments. For example, if a FIF’s active business activities generate a gross return of 75% on assets employed in those activities, and its passive investments generate a return of 10%, up to 28% of the FIF’s assets could be passive investments before it would fail the active business test. The 75% assumption is considered realistic. The average gross returns for non-financial private-sector New Zealand businesses, including both passive and active returns, were 80%, 77% and 77% in the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. Some submissions have pointed out that there is less risk when the foreign company is not a CFC, as the New Zealand investors lack control or the ability to influence passive investment. The bill recognises that there is less risk by allowing the active business test to be applied on a worldwide consolidated basis rather than on a country- by-country basis as required for CFCs. This feature of the bill allows more practicality and flexibility in the application of the active business test to FIFs while maintaining overall consistency with the CFC rules in terms of the level of the threshold. 11 Other submissions argue that a higher threshold is necessary because some optional rules in the proposals will over-inflate passive income in certain circumstances. The rules referred to will allow an investor to apply the active business test to a group of FIFs based on the worldwide consolidated accounts of an upper-tier FIF in that group. If the top-tier FIF has an interest in a lower-tier FIF of less than 50%, the share of income from the lower-tier FIF can be regarded as passive income for the purposes of the active business test. However, we note that it is optional to include lower-tier FIFs in the calculation, so it is expected that taxpayers are only likely to include such FIFs when doing so does not breach the 5% threshold. When inclusion would breach the threshold, an alternative FIF calculation method (such as FDR) could be applied to the lower-tier FIFs to ensure the upper-tier FIF can still pass the active business test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Accounting standards requirements for using the active business test Clause 29 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers should be able to apply the active business test based on accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) that apply in the FIF’s jurisdiction, rather than only accounts which conform to New Zealand IFRS or international IFRS. Comment Under the existing CFC rules, New Zealand taxpayers will typically prepare IFRS accounts which include a line-by-line consolidation of amounts earned by a CFC. Taxpayers can use the underlying information from these accounts to distinguish active and passive items of income, and therefore check whether the CFC passes the active business test. In the case of a non-controlling stake in a foreign company (an interest in a non- portfolio FIF), the IFRS accounts prepared by the New Zealand taxpayer will not include a line-by-line consolidation of the amounts earned by the foreign company. Instead there will be a single line item which cannot be identified as being either active or passive in nature. However, the New Zealand taxpayer will usually have access to the FIF’s own accounts, which can be used to identify whether income is active or passive. If the FIF’s accounts are prepared according to IFRS, taxpayers will be able to use these accounts under the current proposals. 12 Submitters have asked for the IFRS requirement to be relaxed so that if a FIF’s accounts are prepared according to local GAAP they can still be used for this purpose. The most compelling case concerns the United States. The United States does not require companies to prepare accounts according to IFRS, so it is common for United States companies to prepare accounts only under US GAAP. Officials agree that it could be impractical for a non-controlling shareholder to insist that a United States company prepare IFRS accounts for New Zealand tax purposes. We recommend that taxpayers should be able to apply the active business test based on accounts prepared in accordance with US GAAP. This would be subject to the inclusion of FIF income in IFRS accounts at some level (even if only as dividends or an equity-accounted amount) and to appropriate audit and consistency requirements. We do not consider that there is a strong case for allowing the use of GAAP of countries other than the United States, as most other countries have adopted IFRS or have standards that are close to IFRS. There are also risks from allowing local GAAP in other countries: some GAAP standards may not correctly identify passive income, meaning that significant amounts of passive income could escape tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Composition of test group for applying the active business test Clause 29 Submission (Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Law Society) The legislation should clarify that a taxpayer can choose which FIFs make up a FIF test group for the purposes of applying the active business test. More specifically, it should be clarified that: • taxpayers can select the relevant companies to be included in the test group concerned (that is, it is not an “all or nothing” approach); • taxpayers may apply the active income test to multiple test groups; and • the existence of a CFC in a wider group of companies does not prevent taxpayers from using the test group provisions in relation to other members of that group. 13 Comment Officials agree that the points raised above are consistent with the policy intention. The existing drafting in the bill already accommodates the options suggested above, so no changes are required. However, this will be spelt out in a Tax Information Bulletin item on the rule changes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 14 ATTRIBUTION RULES Issue: Calculating attributable income Clause 29 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels) Under the attributable FIF income method the amount of passive income that is actually attributed should be calculated using consolidated accounts, rather than detailed tax calculations being required for each individual FIF. Comment The purpose of the active business test is to reduce compliance costs for FIFs which have only a small amount of passive income. In such cases an approximate measure of passive income based on amounts in consolidated accounts is appropriate as there is less fiscal risk. If a FIF or FIF test group has more than 5% passive income, however, there is a higher risk associated with using an approximate measure of passive income. There are several important differences between measuring passive income using consolidated financial accounts and measuring it under tax concepts. For example, consolidated accounts ignore transactions within a group. It would not be appropriate to exempt consolidated amounts when significant amounts of passive income are involved, because such an exemption could lead to profits being shifted from high-tax countries into low-tax countries. This proposal could reduce the overall tax impost on international investments relative to New Zealand investments, providing an incentive to shift New Zealand income or activity offshore. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue: Exemption for royalty and interest payments between FIFs in the same jurisdiction Clause 29 Submissions (Russell McVeagh, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels) The exemption for interest, rent and royalty payments between FIFs in the same jurisdiction should be consistent with CFC rules (that is, the exemption should require the companies to be associated rather than be a parent and subsidiary). The exemption for interest, rent and royalty payments between FIFs in the same jurisdiction should be extended further to apply to intra-group transactions between FIFs located in different jurisdictions. Comment The CFC and FIF rules exempt payments between FIFs that are commonly controlled. The objective of these concessions is to ensure that taxpayers are not penalised when a holding company is used to control an active business in the same jurisdiction (relative to holding the active business directly). The concession is not intended to apply to companies that operate independently from each other (for example, if the New Zealand investor has two independent joint ventures in the same jurisdiction). Adopting the same wording as the CFC rules would extend the exemption so that it applies to payments between companies that operate independently of each other. A problem with the existing wording is that it does not accommodate payments from a parent company to a subsidiary, or payments between two sister companies which are controlled by the same FIF holding company. The exemption should be amended to accommodate these cases. In relation to the second submission on this matter, limiting the exemption for inter- group transactions of interest and royalties to payments within a jurisdiction is a feature of the new CFC rules. When the active income exemption was introduced for CFCs, the policy was designed so that CFCs will generally face the normal rate of tax in the country they are operating in. If income can be shifted from high-tax to low-tax countries, this is no longer the case. An important concern about CFCs not facing the rate of tax in the country they operate in is that it would reduce the overall (world) tax impost on international investments relative to New Zealand investments, providing an incentive to shift New Zealand income or activity offshore. Escaping foreign tax could also encourage multinational firms to hold more debt in New Zealand, and could facilitate structured financing transactions which are harmful to the New Zealand tax base. 16 The reasoning underpinning the CFC rules is also relevant to non-portfolio FIFs. Recommendation That the first submission be accepted, subject to officials' comments. That the second submission be declined. 17 OTHER FIF CALCULATION METHODS Issue: Repeal of the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods Clauses 25, 26, 28, 29, 33, 35 to 40, 42, 43, 97, 131, and subclauses 126(2) and (7) Submissions The branch equivalent method should be retained. (KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels) The accounting profits method should be retained. (KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The main arguments advanced for retaining these methods are that they more accurately reflect the actual income earned by the offshore entity, as opposed to the FDR and cost methods, which assume a 5% return. We do not consider there to be strong grounds for retaining these methods, as they would rarely be used and would add significant complexity to the rules. For interests of 10% or more in a FIF, the active income exemption replaces the branch equivalent method, and few investors with a less than 10% interest currently use the branch equivalent method. The accounting profits method is also rarely used by portfolio and non-portfolio investors. We have identified several issues with retaining the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods. Retaining a “full attribution” branch equivalent method or an accounting profits method alongside an active income exemption would lead to significant complexity. For example, rules would be needed to adjust ring-fenced losses and foreign tax credits when an investor moves into and out of the active income exemption. In some situations these methods could also enable taxpayers to reduce their overall tax liabilities by initially receiving and using losses under a branch equivalent or accounting profits method, before switching to the cost or FDR methods once historic losses are used up and they are consistently making returns in excess of 5%. This is also a potential difficulty with an active income exemption, but is likely to be less severe because active losses will not be recognised. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 18 Issue: Access to the comparative value method Clauses 26 and 30 Submissions The comparative value method should be available for all companies, in addition to individuals and family trusts. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The comparative value method should be available for non-portfolio shareholders. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants ) Comment When the portfolio FIF reforms were enacted in 2007, a concession was made that allowed individuals and trustees of family trusts to elect to be taxed on the actual returns of all of their investments, if greater than zero (losses are ignored). People elect to use the concession by using the comparative value method. It can be used to reduce tax in years when a person makes a return of less than 5% on their entire investment portfolio (FDR would otherwise apply to tax a hypothetical 5% return). It recognises the fact that individuals and family trusts may find it more difficult to free up enough cash to pay a tax liability in years when they make only a small return or a loss. It would be costly to extend this exemption to companies and PIEs. It would effectively reduce the FDR rate to below 5%. This is because, in years when they make much higher returns (such as 10% or 20%), taxpayers would only pay tax on a 5% return when using FDR. We note that the bill allows for the comparative value method to be used by non- portfolio shareholders as long as they are individuals or trustees of a family trust. This is consistent with the rules for portfolio shareholders. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 19 ATTRIBUTABLE FIF INCOME METHOD Issue: Access to the attributable FIF income method Clause 26 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Investors with less than 10% interests should be able to use the attributable FIF income method in certain exceptional circumstances. Comment The bill replaces the branch equivalent method with the attributable FIF income method. However, unlike the branch equivalent method, the attributable FIF income method is limited to investors with a 10% or greater interest in the foreign company. Portfolio shareholders with an interest of less than 10% are not the target for the new method, because: • it is less likely that they will be able to obtain the information necessary to use the method; and • they are less likely to be making decisions about where business activities of the entity they invest in will be located. We are aware however that there are several groups of investors with less than 10% interests in CFCs for which they currently use the branch equivalent method. The bill will make these investors worse off. Instead of paying no New Zealand tax (as a result of losses or using the attributable FIF income method) they will pay tax under the cost method. The cost method applies tax based on the amount of income that would be generated if the CFC made a hypothetical 5% rate of return. There are two reasons why this appears to be a comparatively harsh outcome. First, if the shares in the CFC were sold to a New Zealand holding company the CFC rules could be applied to the entire investment. We understand, however, that this type of restructuring would give rise to fairly significant costs, including foreign capital gains taxes and other transaction costs. Second, individuals and trustees of family trusts can normally choose to be taxed on the actual returns (excluding losses) of all of their investments. This means that no tax would be paid in years when a CFC made a loss. However, because shares in the affected CFCs are not widely traded (for example, listed on a stock exchange) it is not possible for the investors to use this concession. 20 Officials agree that shareholders with interests of less than 10% should be able to access the attributable FIF income method in exceptional cases. A pragmatic option would be to allow investors with a less than 10% shareholding to access the active income exemption if they meet the following criteria: • The foreign company must be a CFC (that is, it is controlled by five or fewer New Zealand residents). This ensures that at least one New Zealand investor should have sufficient information to comply with the active income exemption; the other investors may be able to approach that investor for this information. It also makes it more likely that there will be economic benefits accruing to New Zealand (for example, through a link to New Zealand business or expertise) from the investment. • The shares in the CFC must not be widely traded (for example, listed on a stock exchange). This reflects the fact that widely traded shares are close substitutes for other types of portfolio investment. In other words, the shares are more likely to be part of a wider investment portfolio and purchased because of expected dividends or share gains, rather than being a link to the investor’s own business or expertise. • The investor must not be a listed company or managed fund (and the CFC must not be controlled by a managed fund or listed company). Otherwise, there could be a tax incentive for managed funds and listed companies to buy shares in CFCs, or to sell shares in CFCs they already control to smaller investors who could then use the active income exemption. This could distort investment portfolios and reduce tax revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement for “direct” income interests Clauses 24 and 26 Submissions The proposed subsection EX 46(3) only allows the attributed FIF income method to apply to “direct” income interests. This needs to be amended to allow the method to apply to direct and indirect income interests. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The “direct” income interest requirement in section EX 35(a) (Exemption for interest in FIF resident in Australia) should be removed. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The treatment of underlying FIF interests should be clarified. (Ernst & Young) 21 Comment The current drafting will mean that the attributed FIF income method and the Australian exemption may not be used when a FIF is held indirectly through another FIF. This is contrary to the policy intention and should be corrected to accommodate FIFs which are held indirectly. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Requirement that an investor not be a certain type of entity (such as a unit trust) Clause 24 Submission (Russell McVeagh) The requirement in section EX 35(a) (Exemption for interest in FIF resident in Australia) that the person holding the interest in the FIF may not be a certain type of entity, such as a unit trust, should only apply to the New Zealand investor rather than, for example, a FIF holding company. Comment Officials agree that these entity requirements should only apply to the ultimate New Zealand investor, rather than a FIF intermediary. The requirements deny the exemption to investors who are a PIE, superannuation scheme, unit trust, life insurer or a group investment fund. They are necessary because these entities can pass income back to their shareholders with no New Zealand tax. In contrast, investors in an ordinary company which benefits from this exemption will have to pay tax when they receive unimputed dividends from the foreign company. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 22 Issue: Exemption for inter-group loans Submission (Russell McVeagh) The definition of “group funding” in section EX 20C(6)(c)(i) should be modified for the purposes of the attributable FIF income method to include funding provided to associated FIFs. Comment The definition of “group funding” in section EX 20C(6)(c)(i) is applied by FIFs which use the attributable FIF income method. However, in its current state that provision will only allow a FIF to provide funding to an associated CFC. It should be modified for the purposes of the attributable FIF income method to include funding provided to other FIFs, if the funder and the other FIF have the same controlling shareholder. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exemption of income from FIFs that pass the active business test Submission (Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Law Society, Ernst & Young) Sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007 prevent income or losses arising from interests in non-attributing active CFCs. Equivalent provisions are needed for non-attributing active FIFs. Comment Officials agree that provisions similar to the CFC exemptions should be inserted in order to make the active income exemption for FIFs effective. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 23 Issue: Application date Clause 2 Submissions Taxpayers should be able to opt in to the new rules if the bill is enacted before the end of their income year. (KPMG, Millenium and Copthorne Hotels) Taxpayers should be able to elect to use the new non-portfolio FIF rules for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2011. (BDO Auckland) Comment The approach to the application date in the bill is the same as the CFC reforms in 2009. Taxpayers were not able to elect when they adopted the new CFC rules. There would be an additional fiscal cost if taxpayers were able to elect whether to apply the old FIF rules (for example, if they have grey list FIFs) or the new FIF rules (if they had active FIFs outside the grey list). There may also be increased compliance costs as some taxpayers may determine the outcomes under both sets of rules before electing to use the rules which produce the best tax result. Finally, it would increase legislative complexity, particularly in relation to the transitional provisions which deal with pre-reform losses and which phase out BETA and conduit accounts. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 24 25 Changes to the thin capitalisation rules 26 27 APPLYING THIN CAPITALISATION RULES TO FIFS Clauses 44 and 45 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The thin capitalisation rules should not apply to New Zealand companies with non- portfolio FIFs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date of the changes to the thin capitalisation rules should be deferred in order to allow New Zealand shareholders time to structure their affairs to mitigate the potential denial of interest deductions in New Zealand. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Existing non-portfolio FIF holdings should be excluded from the thin capitalisation rules. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The interest allocation rules were introduced in the 2009 CFC reforms to deal with a particular fiscal risk. That risk is that the application of an active income exemption for offshore income can create an incentive for businesses to reduce their taxable income from New Zealand operations by allocating all their debt to New Zealand even when the debt is used to fund their exempt operations located offshore. This concern was resolved for CFCs by introducing thin capitalisation rules, which limit the amount of debt allocated to New Zealand to the greater of 75% of the investor’s New Zealand assets or 110% of the worldwide group’s debt-to-asset ratio. The same issue arises for investors in FIFs which use the active income exemption. Although in some cases a New Zealand investor may be unable to manipulate the location of debt (either in New Zealand or in the FIF), there will be situations when that opportunity does arise – for example, in a 50/50 joint venture. Further, as a matter of general principle, a New Zealand taxpayer who is exempt on offshore income should not be able to claim all their interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base. Money is fungible and New Zealand borrowings can be used to fund those offshore operations. The interest allocation rules indirectly resolve this concern by putting an upper limit on the amount of deductions that may be claimed in New Zealand. Finally, the thin capitalisation rules have been designed to bite only when New Zealand debt levels are very high. There is a 75% safe harbour before deductions are denied. Many non-portfolio FIF investors will already be subject to the interest allocation rules by virtue of having a CFC interest. Businesses with less than $1m of interest deductions or less than 10% of their assets offshore are exempt from having to apply the interest allocation rules and so will not incur additional compliance costs. 28 In our view it is highly desirable to keep the CFC rules and FIF rules consistent in this respect. For this reason the bill amends the thin capitalisation rules so that they also apply to investors in FIFs that use the active income exemption or the Australian exemption. We do not consider that there is a strong case for deferring entry or grandparenting existing FIFs so they do not enter the thin capitalisation rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Matter raised by officials Clause 51 Submission (Matter raised by officials) For the thin capitalisation rules to apply to FIFs which use the attributable FIF income method or are exempt under section EX 35 (as is intended and was signalled in the bill commentary), a reference to these FIFs needs to be added to the rules. Comment Section FE 16(1B) should be amended so that it also includes a reference to a FIF for which a member of the New Zealand group uses the attributable FIF income method or has an interest in a FIF that meets the requirements of section EX 35. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 29 DRAFTING OF THIN CAPITALISATION RULES Clause 49 Submission (Ernst & Young) Sections FE 13(3)(a)(ii) and FE 12B(3)(b) should be amended to refer to income “other than non-resident passive income”. Alternatively, clarification is required of the intended meaning of the reference in those provisions to relief from New Zealand tax under a double tax agreement being available for all income with a New Zealand source. Comment The issue raised in the submission relates to the application of thin capitalisation rules to non-resident companies that invest in New Zealand. The thin capitalisation rules apply to non-resident companies with New Zealand- sourced income that is not relieved under a double tax agreement, even if the company does not have a taxable presence (such as a branch) in New Zealand. This limits the ability of such companies to use debt to reduce their exposure to New Zealand tax by claiming excessive interest deductions. When the income derived from New Zealand by the non-resident company is “non- resident passive income” (dividends, interest and royalties), it is subject to non- resident withholding tax as either a final tax or a minimum tax. Non-resident withholding tax is based on gross payments, which are not affected by interest deductions. Therefore, if a non-resident company derives only non-resident passive income from New Zealand and does not have a taxable presence here, it is not necessary to apply the thin capitalisation rules to that company. In view of this, the bill amends various provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 to stop the thin capitalisation rules applying to non-resident companies merely because they derive non-resident passive income from New Zealand. The submission points out that equivalent changes are needed to section FE 13(3)(a)(ii) and to new section FE 12B(3)(b). These consequential changes are needed to ensure that the thin capitalisation rules operate consistently in the circumstances described. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 30 NEW THIN CAPITALISATION TEST BASED ON EARNINGS Clauses 47 to 49 Submissions Taxpayers should be allowed to use accounting classifications of items and amounts for non-resident entities when performing group calculations for the new thin capitalisation test. (Ernst & Young) The intended meaning of interest income should be clarified. (Ernst & Young) Taxpayers should be able to meet the requirements of the test if the interest-to- earnings ratio for the group is less than 50% or (not and) less than 110% of the ratio of the worldwide group. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The test should be extended to entities that are not “excess debt outbound entities”. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The new thin capitalisation test requires measures of net profit or loss, income from a CFC or FIF, depreciation, amortisation and net interest expense. Officials consider that the drafting in the bill already allows the use of accounting classifications in determining net profit or loss and income from a CFC or FIF for the purpose of the thin capitalisation rules. Officials agree that the bill should be changed to make it clear that accounting classifications are to be used for determining depreciation and amortisation as well. For interest, tax concepts are to be used. This is explicit in the legislation. This is in part to prevent exploitation of important differences between the tax and accounting treatment of income from some financial assets. It is noted that the existing thin capitalisation test – based on debt and assets rather than interest expense and profits – requires debt to be calculated using New Zealand tax principles, and that this requirement was introduced as a base maintenance measure. Officials agree that the meaning of interest income should be clarified and made consistent with the definition of interest deductions. We recommend that both interest deductions and interest income be restricted to amounts arising from arrangements that provide funds to the relevant entity (such as loans). This is consistent with existing thin capitalisation rules that restrict “debt” to instruments that provide funds to the entity. The new thin capitalisation test is based on the ratio of interest deductions to profits. There are two main requirements. The first is that the ratio calculated for the New Zealand entities in a multinational group is 110% or less of the ratio of the entire multinational group. The second is that the ratio calculated for the New Zealand entities is less than 50%. 31 The first, and main, requirement ensures that deductions of a multinational group are not concentrated in New Zealand and are instead fairly spread around. The second requirement puts an absolute cap on deductions, which is common practice abroad (the United States uses 50%, some European countries use 30%). This limits the risk of unusual outcomes in which very small changes in profit can lead to large changes in the ratio. 50% is an unusually high interest-to-profit ratio and we expect it would rarely be exceeded by a solvent non-financial business. The test is limited to New Zealand-based multinationals because they are the most likely to be in the position that was envisaged when the policy was formulated – having high-value intangible assets in New Zealand (not recognised for accounting purposes) and acquiring significant overseas assets (recognised for accounting purposes). Foreign-based multinationals are more likely to be in the opposite position of not recognising their foreign intangible assets but recognising their New Zealand assets. Recommendation That the submissions relating to the definition of interest and the use of accounting concepts be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. That other submissions be declined. 32 33 Zero rate of AIL on bonds 34 35 ZERO RATE OF AIL ON BONDS Issue: Scope of the proposal Clause 142 Submissions The zero rate of AIL should be extended to include wholesale bonds offered to at least 10 (institutional) investors. (Kiwibank, New Zealand Post, New Zealand Bankers Association, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) Concerns about the fiscal risk of extending the proposal to wholesale bonds could be dealt with either by excluding syndicated loans or loans to related parties, or by allowing issuers to apply \[to the Commissioner\] for an exemption for programme debt or for wholesale funding programmes. (Kiwibank) More needs to be done to make New Zealand a more attractive investment destination for foreign capital and to reduce offshore borrowing costs for New Zealand business. At a minimum, there should be greater discussion about the relative merits of extending the proposal \[beyond widely held bonds\]. (KPMG) Comment The current tax policy settings already distinguish between related-party debt and unrelated-party debt. Related-party debt is subject to NRWT of 15%, or 10% if a treaty applies. The AIL regime was introduced in 1991 to dramatically reduce the tax impost to 2% if the lender and borrower are unrelated. The purpose of this proposal is to provide a very targeted exemption from the AIL rules. It is narrowly aimed at removing a potential tax impediment to the development of a traded bond market, rather than reducing the cost of corporate debt across the board. Thus, the measure is intentionally restricted to retail bonds that are traded in the New Zealand market. In this respect, the main test is the “listed on a securities market” test, with a widely held test as a back-up option for bonds that are not listed. The proposal does not apply to wholesale bonds which are generally issued in offshore markets to a small number of institutional investors (typically through a private placement). If traded at all, such bonds are traded in foreign bond markets and so do not add to the development of a New Zealand bond market. Wholesale bonds can be close substitutes for bank loans. Extending the proposal to wholesale bonds could have a high fiscal cost. In addition to the foregone AIL revenues (up to $50m per year), there is an unquantifiable risk that it could encourage some domestic lending activity to shift offshore, undermining the corporate tax base. 36 Some submitters suggested that New Zealand should follow Australia’s rules, which exempt interest from withholding tax when debt is offered to 10 institutional investors. An “offered to 10 investors” test would provide inadequate protection against the risk of exempting closely held debt. For example, a debt instrument could be offered to 10 investors but be taken up by only one. This could occur if the terms of the investment were designed so they would only appeal to the intended lender (who, for example, could be compensated through a separate transaction). The context for the Australian rules is fundamentally different from that in New Zealand. In Australia, the equivalent rules are the main rules for distinguishing between related-party debt to which NRWT applies and unrelated-party debt for which no NRWT is imposed (comparable to our 2% AIL rate). Unlike Australia, the New Zealand banking sector is predominantly foreign-owned. This makes it critical to ensure that foreign banks cannot lend directly to New Zealand residents while facing no New Zealand tax on the interest received. An exemption that applies to wholesale bonds could encourage some domestic lending activity to shift offshore (that is, an Australasian banking group may do more lending out of Australia as opposed to lending through a New Zealand subsidiary). This could have a very high fiscal cost. Because of this concern, the proposal in the issues paper is much more restrictive than the comparable exemption which operates in Australia. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Requirement that no person hold more than 10% of the bonds Clause 142 Submission (Kiwibank, New Zealand Post, New Zealand Bankers Association, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) The requirement (in proposed section 86IB(2)(d)) that no person hold more than 10% of the bonds should be removed. Comment Officials consider that a maximum ownership threshold is necessary to support the integrity of the widely held test. Interest paid to investors who hold more than 10% of a company’s bonds should be subject to 2% AIL, as in certain circumstances holdings of this size can resemble closely held debt as opposed to publicly traded bonds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Requirement that the bonds not be a private placement Clause 142 Submission (Kiwibank, New Zealand Post, New Zealand Bankers Association, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Post) The requirement (in proposed section 86IB(1)(b)(ii)) that the issue of the security is not a private placement should be removed. Comment It is not intended that the exemption be available for private placements, even if these are widely held. This is because the objective is to remove a potential obstacle to the development of a traded bonds market as opposed to reducing the cost of corporate debt more generally. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Requirement that the bonds not be an asset-backed security Clause 142 Submission (New Zealand Bankers Association) The requirement that the bond not be an asset-backed security should be removed. Comment The purpose of this requirement is to deny the zero rate of AIL in cases where a group of loans have been bundled together and securitised into a bond. The concern is that such securities could be used to effectively shift the margin earned on closely held loans (such as mortgages) outside the New Zealand tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 38 Issue: Requirement that the bonds be issued in New Zealand Clause 142 Submission (Kiwibank, New Zealand Post, New Zealand Bankers Association, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, Ernst & Young) The zero rate of AIL should be extended to include bonds issued in currencies other than New Zealand dollars. Related to this, the requirement for the registrar and paying agent activities to be performed in New Zealand should be removed. Comment To qualify for the zero rate of AIL, the bonds must be issued in New Zealand and be denominated in New Zealand dollars. The objective of the policy is to remove a potential tax impediment to the development of the New Zealand bond market, and thus improve its depth and liquidity. A well-functioning bond market has a number of important signalling and support roles which affect the performance of the capital markets and the wider financial system. Submissions have generally sought a different objective, which is to reduce the cost of capital for New Zealand businesses by removing tax on New Zealand corporates that issue bonds to non-residents. Submissions point to the fact that many New Zealand corporates issue bonds in offshore bond markets. Such bonds are usually issued to a small number of institutional investors (typically through a private placement). If traded at all, such bonds are generally traded in foreign bond markets (for example, on the Australian, London or New York exchanges) and so do not contribute to the development of the New Zealand bond market. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Requirement that the bonds be an offer to the public Clause 142 Submission (Kiwibank, Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Post) The requirement that the bonds be an offer to the public under the Securities Act 1978 should be removed. 39 Comment For reasons mentioned earlier, the zero rate is not intended to apply to bonds that are issued through a private placement. One feature of private placements is that they are offered to a select group of investors rather than the general public. For this reason, there is a requirement that the bonds be an “offer of securities to the public” under the Securities Act. The Securities Act does not expressly define “an offer of securities to the public” but section 3 of the Act provides guidance as to how the phrase should be interpreted. Submitters were concerned that this condition would prevent bonds issued offshore from qualifying for the zero rate of AIL. If a decision is made that bonds issued offshore should qualify (we have recommended against it) the condition could be altered. An altered condition might be that that the bond issue would meet the definition of offer of securities to the public under the Securities Act if they were issued in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: 100 holder test should be an alternative to the requirement that the bonds be an offer to the public Clause 142 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) If the scope of the exemption is to remain narrow, the 100 holder test should be an alternative to the requirement that the bonds be an offer of securities to the public under the Securities Act 1978. Comment As mentioned earlier, there could be a significant risk to the corporate tax base if the zero rate of AIL applied to closely held debt (such as loans, syndicated loans and private placements). Officials have developed a “belt and braces” approach to manage this risk through the use of requirements, tests and exclusions. The offer of securities to the public requirement is intended to ensure that the bonds are available to any investor, rather than only a certain group (such as a private placement that is only offered to a foreign bank). 40 We do not consider it prudent to rely only on the bonds being an offer of securities to the public, as this requirement could be subjective. This test is best supported by an additional test that the bonds be either listed or issued to 100 persons. Although the 100 holder test is outside the issuer’s control, the consequences of failing this test are not severe given that AIL is only 2%. Concerns about uncertainty deterring investors can be dealt with by having the issuer or underwriter absorb any AIL cost if it arises. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposal should include government bonds Clause 142 Submission (KPMG) The zero rate of AIL should be extended to cover government bonds. Comment The government already bears the cost of AIL on government bonds. This means that non-residents receive the same interest payments on government bonds as New Zealand residents. Therefore it is not necessary for the zero rate of AIL to include government bonds, although we note that it does not expressly exclude them either. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Applying the widely held test on a programme basis Clause 142 Submission (New Zealand Bankers Association) The widely held test should apply on a programme basis rather than on a tranche-by- tranche basis. 41 Comment As currently drafted, the widely held test would be applied to a group of identical securities, rather than to each individual issue. This would accommodate issuers which choose to issue additional tranches of the same bond. It would also allow issuers to gradually build up to 100 investors in their bonds, so that bonds which did not initially qualify for the zero rate may qualify from a later date. (It is not proposed that such bonds would get the zero rate applied retrospectively.) Note that this requires each tranche of the bonds to be identical (that is, fungible). Allowing the test on a programme basis would allow the bonds to have different rates, terms and conditions. For example, so long as a corporate had an existing bond programme, they would be able to add a loan from a foreign bank to this programme and the loan would qualify for a zero rate of AIL. This would be contrary to the policy intent of the measure which is that the zero rate of AIL should only be available on publicly traded bonds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of coverage and requirements Clause 142 Submission (Kiwibank) The following points should be clarified: • Bank term deposits – do these qualify or not? • Asset-backed security – if a company issues bonds and then on-lends all of the funds to a related party, is this an asset-backed security? • 10% holding requirement – does this look through widely held vehicles and does it disqualify all investors or just investors with holdings of more than 10%? Comment The purpose of the proposal is to remove a potential tax impediment to the development of the corporate bond market. Accordingly it is only intended to apply to tradeable debt instruments, such as bonds, and so should not apply to bank term deposits. To clarify this point, we recommend adding an additional requirement that the debt securities be traded. 42 The purpose of the exclusion for asset-backed securities is to deny the zero rate of AIL when a group of loans have been bundled together and securitised into a bond. The concern is that such securities could be used to effectively shift the margin earned on closely held loans (such as mortgages) outside the New Zealand tax base. In most cases, when a company issues bonds and then on-lends the funds from those bonds to a related party it would not be an asset-backed security. However, this does depend on the exact circumstances. If, for example, the related party was set up to hold a bundle of mortgages and the bond issuer was interposed merely to lend against those asset-backed securities, it might well be considered that the bond was asset-backed. We will clarify this in the guidance material prepared as part of the Tax Information Bulletin item on the changes. For the requirement that no person holds more than 10% of the bonds at the time the widely held test is applied, a widely held vehicle holding the bonds should be treated as a single person. Otherwise, this would effectively extend the proposal to wholesale bonds and possibly bank loans, as bonds issued to institutional investors would easily satisfy the 100 persons requirement. This is because nearly all banks or managed funds invest on behalf of other investors. The requirement that no person holds more than 10% of the bonds would disqualify all investors in the bonds. If it only disqualified a person with a 10% or greater holding, it would be much easier to organise arrangements that undermine the intention of the widely held test, given that this test need only be satisfied on one occasion. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and that officials’ consequential recommendation to add a “traded” requirement be accepted. Issue: Clarification of whether 100 holder test needs to be re-applied Clause 142 Submission (Ernst & Young) It is unclear whether securities meeting the widely held criteria need to continue to meet those criteria for subsequent interest payments, or if not, whether they are intended to be disqualified in another way. Policy and legislative clarification are required. Comment In general, bonds will continue to satisfy the widely held test if they have passed it on one occasion. However, there is an anti-avoidance rule to prevent transactions that temporarily increase the number of persons holding the bonds. If such an arrangement occurs, the test will no longer be satisfied and the issuer will be required to pay AIL of 2%. 43 The legislation already provides for this result, and it will be explained as part of the guidance material in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Title of the proposal Clause 142 Submission (Russell McVeagh) The proposal is an exemption from the requirement to pay AIL in order to obtain a zero rate of NRWT, rather than a zero rate of AIL. Either the legislation should be amended to provide a zero rate, or the section title and Inland Revenue guidance should refer instead to an exemption. Comment The drafting of the provision in section 86IB means that there is not technically a zero rate of AIL. However, a zero rate of AIL is a more intuitive concept than an exemption from the requirement to pay AIL, as an exemption from AIL may imply that a person would have to pay NRWT. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 44 45 Remedial amendments 46 47 INSURANCE CFCS WITH REINSURANCE CLAIM INCOME Clause 140 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement for a Commissioner’s determination should be amended so that it disregards reinsurance claim income when considering if “all or nearly all” of the CFC’s income is from premiums or investments commensurate with insurance contracts. Comment Section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out requirements for obtaining a special exemption from the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. The exemption is for companies with active insurance businesses. Section 91AAQ(4)(b) requires “all or nearly all” of the CFC’s income to be produced from premiums from insurance contracts that cover risks in the same country that the CFC is located in, or from proceeds from investment assets that have a value which is commensurate with those insurance contracts. This income test covers the main types of income generated by an insurance business. The problem is that insurers can receive another type of income in the form of reinsurance claim income for liabilities which they have reinsured. This additional income can mean that the “all or nearly all” requirement is no longer satisfied. At least one company would be adversely affected if reinsurance income is not carved out of the test. Officials recommend that the test be amended to disregard any reinsurance claim income. This means that reinsurance claim income would not count towards either the active income portion (numerator) or the total income amount (denominator) when applying the “all or nearly all” test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 48 ASSOCIATED PERSONS REMEDIAL (BOND ISSUERS AND BOND HOLDERS) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Law Society) A remedial amendment is necessary to ensure that bond issuers and bond holders do not become associated simply by being trustees and beneficiaries in a trust that has a principal purpose of enforcing rights under the bond. Comment This is an unintended consequence that arose as a result of the associated person changes in 2009. The main problem is that the bond issuers will be required to pay non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest payments to non-resident bond- holders. Prior to 2009 they were able to pay the approved issuer levy which applies at a lower rate than NRWT. In cases where the bond issuers and bond holders are only associated due to the use of trust whose principal purpose is enforcing rights on the bond, they should be able to pay the approved issuer levy as opposed to NRWT. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 AIL CLARIFICATION Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) It should be clarified that AIL is available in cases when a guarantor discharges an issuer’s obligation to pay interest. Comment This issue falls outside the scope of the current bill. However, it may be considered at a later date as resources permit. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 50 EXCLUDING QUALIFYING COMPANIES FROM HOLDING INCOME INTERESTS OF 10% OR MORE IN FIFS Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ernst & Young) The legislative change should not be retrospective to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. At the earliest it should apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Comment As part of the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, an exemption was introduced for foreign dividends derived by companies. This means that the exemption applies to qualifying companies even though these companies are able to pass exempt income on to their shareholders with no further tax impost. This is inconsistent with exempt foreign income usually being taxed if received directly by an individual taxpayer, or when unimputed dividends are paid by a company to individual shareholders. An amendment was made in the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 to deal with this issue. However, the amendment refers to “attributing interests” in a FIF. This means that non-attributing active FIFs and FIFs that qualify for the grey list exemption could be under-taxed as these are not attributing interests. It is unlikely that any qualifying companies will be affected by this change as there is an existing limit whereby qualifying companies cannot have more than $10,000 of foreign non-dividend income. We have not been contacted by any affected qualifying companies. Nevertheless, there could be a fiscal cost if this remedial change is not backdated to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 51 ROYALTIES REMEDIAL: PRESERVE EXEMPTION FOR ROYALTIES WHEN THIRD-PARTY ROYALTIES ARE RECEIVED BY A LOWER-TIER CFC Submission (KPMG) The wording of section EX 20B(5)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be consistent with the policy intention of the new CFC rules, so that: • the royalty income derived by an upper-tier CFC from intellectual property licensed to a lower-tier CFC, which in turn licenses the property to a non- associated third party, is excluded from “attributable CFC amount”; and • the royalty income derived by the lower-tier CFC from the non-associated third party is also excluded from being an attributable CFC amount. Comment The current drafting of section EX 20B(5)(d) does not achieve the desired policy intent of the provision. That is, third-party royalty payments paid in relation to property owned by a New Zealand resident should be treated as “active”, even if those payments passed through an upper-tier and lower-tier CFC before being returned to New Zealand. Currently, the provision only takes into account the payment that is made between the upper-tier and lower-tier CFCs. It does not provide for the initial payment made by the third party to the lower-tier CFC. As such, that third-party payment will be considered as “passive income” and will be subject to attribution. To illustrate, the existing drafting fails to accommodate the following scenario. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. NZ Co IPIP Royalty 1 Royalty 2 NZ IP Royalty 3 CFC 1 CFC 2 Third party 52 RESIDENCE OF CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES Clauses 19, 21 and 22 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Subparagraph (d)(ii) of new sections EX 20B(16), EX 21D(10) and EX 21E(14) should be removed, to allow certain “flow-through” entities to qualify for exemptions. Comment A number of exemptions and special treatments apply to controlled foreign companies (CFCs) when CFCs are resident in the same country, on the basis that tax outcomes will be relatively similar for all the CFCs in such a case. The new sections dealing with the residence of a CFC have been introduced for two reasons. First, they put restrictions in place to make it more likely that tax outcomes will in fact be similar for all the CFCs. For example, they require that the CFCs not be dual- residents (a dual-resident CFC might end up being taxed elsewhere and not in the country in question). And secondly, they recognise that there are some situations in which, although an entity resident in a country is not subject to tax there (because it is a “flow-through” entity), the outcome for a group of CFCs is as if all were subject to tax in that country. The submission argues that other cases involving “flow-through” entities should also be addressed. In the two examples given, we could have no confidence that the income would face the normal company tax in the country in which the “flow- through” entity is present. This would allow income to be shifted between countries without New Zealand tax consequences, including from high-tax to low-tax countries. This is contrary to the policy that underlies the new CFC rules, which is that New Zealand will exempt income from active CFCs but expects that they will face the host-country tax rate on their income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 DEDUCTIBLE FOREIGN EQUITY DISTRIBUTION CHANGE SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN Subclauses 126(16) and 126(17) Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed change to the definition of deductible foreign equity distribution should not proceed until there has been further consultation. Alternatively, the amendment should be prospective. Comment The rule was introduced to address issues of potential tax arbitrage caused by New Zealand regarding some entities as non-taxable when they are regarded as taxable in other countries. We agree that there should be further consultation about this issue. The proposed amendment is unlikely to be effective in its current form and a more general rule to prevent arbitrage may be desirable. We recommend withdrawing the proposed change at this time. We also note that Inland Revenue has now made taxpayers aware that this type of arbitrage may be inconsistent with the intent of the policy to exempt most foreign dividends. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 55 Other matters 56 57 DEADLINE FOR ELECTION TO USE BETA DEBITS Clauses 101 and 114 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement to make an election before the end of the third income year in order to use branch equivalent tax account (BETA) debits should be removed. If a time limit is to be applied, the limit should instead be the time by which the company is required to have filed its tax return for the second income year in which attributed CFC income has been allocated. The Commissioner should also be given the discretion to accept a late election. Comment BETA accounts of companies are being repealed because they are no longer necessary under the new CFC rules. Credit balances in BETA accounts have already been cancelled, and debit balances remain only for exceptional cases in which dividends have been received in advance of the underlying income being derived by a CFC. In these exceptional cases, there is a possibility of double taxation because the dividend may have been taxed already and the underlying income will also be taxed when it is derived. Commonly though, debit balances that remain have arisen from fixed-rate share dividends paid by CFCs in Australia. Such CFCs are very unlikely to ever have New Zealand tax imposed on their underlying income (owing to the exemption for Australian CFCs). The potential risk of double taxation is therefore low. At the time the repeal of credit balances was publicly announced, it was also announced that BETA debit balances would be retained only for a two-year period (that is, for the first two years of application of the new CFC rules). In practice, a conservative approach has been taken and they are remaining for three years, to allow more time for debits to be used against the first two years of income. Given the low probability of double taxation and the fact that a full additional year has been allowed to use debit balances against the first two years of income under the new CFC rules, officials do not recommend that the submission be accepted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 REVALUING INHERITED FORMER GREY LIST SHARES Clause 41 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should not proceed if the existing law is sufficient to deem these interests to have a market value. The rule in proposed section EX 67B should cover gifts, trust distributions and in- specie company distributions. The rules in sections EX 71 and GC 4 should be statutorily reconciled with the rules in subpart FC. Comment The amendment is necessary because a major change in the law in 2007 did not apply to some inherited foreign shares. As a consequence these inherited shares slipped through the cracks and retained a cost base of nil instead of being re-valued at market value, as was the case for other foreign shares. The problems we have observed relate to inherited shares as opposed to shares that were transferred as gifts, trust distributions and in-specie company distributions. When originally designing the proposal we thought about extending the provisions to these other types of transfer but decided they were likely to be insignificant. It would not be appropriate to extend the proposal without consulting on the extension first. The interaction between sections EX 71 and GC 4 (which revalue non-market transactions in FIF shares at market value) and subpart FC (the general inheritance rules) is a separate issue that is outside the immediate scope of this bill. Further work and consultation would be needed to establish how these provisions should interact, and what changes, if any, were necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 59 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 67B(1)(b)(i) should be deleted. (Ernst & Young) The way the provision is worded, it overrides the rules in section FZ 6. Taxpayers who inherit FIF interests in former grey-list countries should be given the option of valuing these interests at the cost to the testator. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who inherited shares after 1 October and when either section FC 3 or section FC 4 would have applied had the shares been tax base property should be given the benefit of being able to value the shares at cost if available. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials agree that taxpayers should have the option of inheriting the shares at the cost of the person who they inherited the shares from where the taxpayer would have been able to use the cost to the testator under subpart FC (if inherited from a close family member) or section FZ 6 (inherited before inheritance rules). We will accommodate this by only requiring the revaluation if the inheritance was at nil value, not if it was inherited at the cost to the testator. This can be achieved by deleting section EX 67B(1)(b)(i) as submitters suggest. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The only income arising on deemed disposal of these foreign shares should be the difference between the market value at the time of inheritance and the market value on the date section EX 67B applies. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clarification is needed regarding the time that the proposed disposal and reacquisition provisions would apply and the income tax liability that may be spread. (Ernst & Young) Comment Officials agree that if there is a revenue account gain as a result of a deemed sale under section EX 67B, the affected taxpayers should only be taxed on the difference between the market value at the time of inheritance and the market value at the time section EX 67B applies (as opposed to facing tax on the entire market value of the shares). 60 It will be very unlikely for a person to have a revenue account gain on inherited shares in any case, as these shares will generally be held on capital account (except perhaps if the person is a share trader). We note that the main intention of the proposal is to require persons with more than $50,000 in FIF interests (including inherited interests which may have previously not counted to towards the $50,000 de minimis) to begin to apply the FIF rules on a prospective basis. The proposed disposal and reacquisition provisions will apply on the date the bill is enacted. The income tax liability that can be spread is most likely to be a liability that relates to revenue account gains which, as noted above, are expected to be rare. The liability to be spread will not include FIF income arising after the deemed reacquisition. Both of these points will be clarified in the Tax information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 61 DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF ACCOUNTING PERIOD Submissions (Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Law Society) An amendment should be made to the definition of “accounting period” in section YA 1 to take account of the buying and selling of interests in a FIF part way through a FIF’s accounting year. Without this amendment, the active income exemption will not be available for the relevant part year in which an acquisition/disposition occurs in circumstances where, in policy terms, it should be available. It is also not entirely clear whether the concession in relation to the quarterly measurement of income interests (section EX 26) applies when determining whether a person has a direct income interest of 10% or more at all times in an accounting period, which is required for the attributable FIF income method to be available (proposed section EX 46(3) – see clause 26(2) of the bill). Comment The issue outlined above is an existing feature of the CFC and FIF rules. Officials recognise that averaging a person’s income interest over the entire year can lead to an inappropriate treatment in certain cases. However, attempting to correct this result would add complexity and would most likely produce other incorrect treatments and unintended consequences. For example, changing the definition of “accounting period” as suggested could also lead to double taxation, as the same income could be attributed under two different methods for the same year. It would require taxpayers to perform complex apportionments of income and expenses to different periods within the same year. Similarly, it would not be prudent to define a person’s income interest to be the same as their highest level of ownership in the FIF that year, as this would allow investors to swap shares with each other for short periods in order to access a more favourable tax treatment. The consequences of the current rule which averages a person’s income interest are usually offset by other features of the FIF rules. For example if a person buys 30% of a FIF in the last quarter of the year they would not be able to use the active income exemption as they will only have a 7.5% income interest for that year. However, they will still effectively get an exemption as the FDR or cost methods do not attribute income in the year that a FIF interest is first acquired. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 62 FOREIGN DIVIDEND EXEMPTION Clauses 9 and 19 Submissions The foreign dividend exemption should be amended to ensure that all foreign dividends from greater than 10% interests in CFCs or Australian FIFs that meet the criteria in section EX 35 remain exempt. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young) The intended scope of the section CW 9 dividend exemption should be clarified. (Ernst & Young) Comment In general, foreign dividends are exempt when received by a New Zealand company. However, there are exceptions to the general rule when exemptions apply. This is appropriate when some exemptions from the FIF rules apply (such as for FIFs listed on the ASX). It is not appropriate when other exemptions from the FIF rules apply (such as when the CFC rules apply or when there is a greater than 10% interest in an Australian FIF that meets the criteria in section EX 35). The complication is that both types of exemption from the FIF rules can apply to the same investment. In such cases the dividend should be exempt. Some minor changes to section CW 9 are required to achieve this result. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 63 OPTING OUT OF THE NZD$50,000 MINIMUM-VALUE THRESHOLD EXEMPTION, IN ORDER TO APPLY THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND (FIF) RULES Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The foreign investment fund (FIF) rules do not apply to natural persons with attributing interests in FIFs that are below a minimum-value threshold of $50,000. Natural persons should have the option to disregard this minimum-value threshold, and so apply the FIF rules regardless of the level of their FIF interests. This would simplify compliance for some shareholders. For example, if a person who currently uses the FIF rules reduced their foreign portfolio holdings in a year so that the cost was less than $50,000, they could no longer use the FIF rules; instead, they would have to change the basis of taxation to use the dividend-only method. To prevent arbitrage arising from taxpayers switching between the FIF rules and dividend-only methods, a person with less than $50,000 of attributing interests in a FIF and who chooses to file their return on the basis of the FIF rules applying, should be required to apply that same basis in each subsequent tax year. Only if the person ceases to hold attributing interests in a FIF for four complete tax years could the minimum-value threshold then apply to any future FIF interests. Comment The $50,000 threshold applies to smaller FIF interests because officials considered this to be simpler for smaller investors to understand. The original policy intent was to provide a balance between accuracy and simplicity for individuals with relatively small amounts invested offshore. Officials consider that this remains the case, and that the minimum-value threshold is appropriate for many investors. However, it is agreed that if, in some cases, the minimum-value threshold instead adds to the complexity, those investors should have the ability to apply the FIF rules. This places smaller investors in the same position as all other investors with portfolios above $50,000. Officials agree that the continuous application of FIF rules following an opt-out from the minimum-value threshold will reduce arbitrage concerns. The reinstatement of the minimum-value threshold after four years with no FIF holdings resolves concerns about future compliance and complexity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 64 MINIMUM-VALUE EXEMPTION FROM THE FIF RULES Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The minimum-value threshold of $50,000 for attributing FIF income should be reviewed and adjusted to reflect the increase in compliance costs that will occur with the enactment of the non-portfolio FIF rules. The legislation should be amended to allow adjustment by Order in Council. Comment The current minimum-value threshold means that natural persons and certain family trusts with less than $50,000 worth of FIF interests do not apply the FIF rules. We note that the proposed non-portfolio FIF reforms will mainly apply to a different set of investors: New Zealand companies with substantial shareholdings in foreign companies. Furthermore, any individual with a non-portfolio interest in a FIF is likely to have far more than $50,000 worth of FIF interests. In other words, the reforms do not create a case for reviewing the minimum-value threshold, which affects a much larger and entirely different set of investors. As such, we do not recommend that the minimum-value threshold be increased as part of this reform package. If a decision is made to review the minimum-value threshold, it would be appropriate to consult with the affected investors and report to Cabinet, given that increasing the threshold would involve a fiscal cost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 NEW RESIDENTS’ SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES Issue: FIF exemption for interests in foreign employment-related superannuation schemes Submission (Russell McVeagh) Section EX 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains an exemption from attribution under the FIF rules for rights held in a foreign employment-related superannuation scheme that accrued while the taxpayer was non-resident. The exemption applies up to the end of the fourth full income year after that taxpayer became a New Zealand tax resident. However, the current drafting in section EX 42(3) and (4) does not take into account investment gains or exchange rate fluctuations on those exempt contributions which accrued after the end of the fourth full income year. This can result in situations where a portion of a person’s foreign superannuation interest is non-attributable one year and attributable the next, even if that person has made no further contributions after the end of the fourth full income year. This does not make sense given the absence of further contributions to the scheme, and is contrary to the original policy intent. Section EX 42(4) should be amended to provide that the opening and closing values, used to calculate the non-attributing interest in the foreign superannuation scheme, should be the market value at the current time of contributions made while non- resident or during the first four years after becoming resident. Comment Officials agree. The policy intent is for contributions made before becoming resident or during the first four income years after becoming resident, as well as ongoing gains and losses on those contributions, to be non-attributing FIF interests. It is intended that a person only needs to calculate their FIF income arising from interests in a foreign superannuation scheme if they continue to make contributions after the end of the fourth full income year since becoming resident (subject to the $50,000 minimum-value threshold). If no further contributions are made after that period, the person’s foreign superannuation interest will be exempt from the FIF rules. The current formula does not currently achieve the appropriate outcome and is inconsistent with the original policy intent of the exemption. Section EX 42 should be amended in line with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 66 ATTRIBUTABLE (PASSIVE) TELECOMMUNICATIONS INCOME Clause 19 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sections EX 20B(11)(c) and (d), relating to attributable (passive) income from telecommunications activities of a controlled foreign company, should be replaced. Comment Most income of a controlled foreign company (CFC) from services performed in New Zealand is attributable (that is, subject to New Zealand tax under the CFC rules). This is to prevent income that should properly be entirely within the New Zealand tax base from being diverted to an exempt offshore company. However, a concession was made for certain telecommunications income, on the grounds that a service is unavoidably performed in New Zealand when a CFC connects calls from its country to New Zealand. This concession is currently limited to cases in which the CFC does not use its own equipment or staff, or those of an associated CFC, to perform the service in New Zealand. These limitations have caused difficulties in practice. Officials recommend replacing the existing limitations with requirements that the person performing the service in New Zealand: • is not the CFC; and • is subject to New Zealand tax on income they receive for performing the service (either because they are resident here or because they earn the income through a fixed place of business in New Zealand); and • performs the service as part of a substantial telecommunications business in New Zealand. These requirements are intended to maintain protection of the New Zealand tax base while accommodating commercial arrangements that existed prior to the new CFC rules being enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 67 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Suggestions to fix / improve the drafting of the bill Submissions (New Zealand Post, Ernst & Young, Russell McVeagh, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clause 126(30) amends the definition of “New Zealand banking group” in section YA 1. The words in brackets after “section FE 36B” should be replaced with “Identifying members of New Zealand banking group: Crown-owned, no interest apportionment” so as to align with the heading in that section. (New Zealand Post) Clause 44: The reference to “derived from New Zealand” should be replaced with a reference to “has a source in New Zealand” to be consistent with clause 64 of the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. (Ernst & Young) Clause 112(1): The reference to “before the paragraphs” should be to “before the formula”. (Ernst & Young) Clause 126(18): The reference to “GDP ratio” should be replaced with “FDP ratio”. (Ernst & Young) Clause 141: The amendment appears to be effected already by clause 174 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. (Ernst & Young) Clarification is required of the various references to situations where taxpayers “use the attributable FIF income method” and the implications of doing so. (Ernst & Young) There are various references to “the CFC”, “another CFC” or “CFCs” in sections EX 18 to EX 21. Clarification is needed as to how these references would apply to FIFs. (Ernst & Young) References to the terms “domestic law” and “permanent establishment or fixed establishment” should be clarified. (Ernst & Young) Clause 29(3): The reference to “net attributable CFC income or loss” should be replaced with a reference to “attributed CFC income or attributed CFC loss”. (Russell McVeagh) Clauses 19, 21, 22, 29 and 126 duplicate information and should be rationalised using a common definition of “host country”. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clause 26(6): Consequential to the repeal of section EX 46(7), the reference to that section in section EX 46(8) is no longer valid. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 68 Clause 29: Consequential to the repeal of the branch equivalent method for FIFs, the term should be replaced with attributable FIF income method in section EX 50(5)(a). (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Clarification about taxpayers who use the attributable FIF income method Some sections such as the thin capitalisation rules apply to taxpayers with CFCs or taxpayers who use the attributable FIF income method. The submission suggests it is unclear whether a person uses the attributable FIF income method when the FIF passes the active business test as in this case no income is attributed. The policy intention is that these sections should apply when a FIF passes the active business test as well as when a taxpayer attributes income under the attributable FIF income method. Officials agree that this issue should be clarified by changing the reference to something more explicit such as taxpayers who apply section EX 50 (attributable FIF income method), as section EX 50 applies even if taxpayers have FIFs that satisfy the active business test. Various references to “the CFC”, “another CFC” or “CFCs” in sections EX 18 to EX 21 When a taxpayer applies the attributable FIF income method in section EX 50, they effectively apply the CFC rules (with certain modifications), as if the FIF were a CFC. This means that references to the “CFC” in sections EX 18 to EX 21, should be read as references to the FIF for which the taxpayer is applying section EX 50. In these cases there is no need to change the legislation (as it already achieves the desired result) but the references and how they should apply will be noted in the Tax Information Bulletin. The references to “another CFC” and “CFCs” will require legislative amendments as in many cases these references should also apply to “another FIF for which the person applies section EX 50” or “FIFs for which the person applies section EX 50”. Reference to section FE 36B The words in parentheses apply to both sections FE 36 and FE 36B, and both of those sections identify members of a New Zealand banking group. We therefore consider that the words “which identify the members of a New Zealand banking group” are appropriate. Domestic law, permanent establishment and fixed establishment The terms “domestic law” and “permanent establishment” are not explicitly defined. However, “permanent establishment” is a term that has been the subject of extensive legal interpretation in the context of double tax agreements, which is where the term is relevant (see, for example, clause 22(14)). The term “fixed establishment” is already defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 69 There may be some uncertainty about the application of the words “under an agreement” to fixed establishments. It is intended that they apply only to the words “permanent establishment”. We recommend this be clarified. “Domestic law” is intended to be given its ordinary meaning; it would therefore include tax law but also non-tax law. This could be useful, for example, in cases when there is no specific tax law relating to residence, and could also discourage the use of dual-resident entities. No change is required to the existing wording to achieve this effect. Clause 141 This is a correction to an incorrect application date in another bill. We will make a further minor change to ensure the old application date does not persist. Duplicated provisions Clauses 19, 21, 22, 29 and 126 do duplicate information about the relationship between a CFC or FIF and a company or territory. We agree the duplication should be reduced, though not specifically by defining “host country” as suggested by the submitter. Clause 29 is different from the others because it refers to the relationship between a FIF, rather than a CFC, and the country or territory. Other submissions Officials agree with the other submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Ordering and structure of the CFC and FIF rules Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young) The whole of the CFC and FIF rules should be rewritten and restructured into portfolio and non-portfolio sections. Comment Officials agree that as a result of reforms in 2007, 2009 and in this bill, the structure of existing CFC and FIF rules may not be ideal. Any restructuring of the provisions would be a complex exercise which would be likely to require several rounds of consultation. It is therefore not practical to include the restructuring as part of this bill. 70 However, a rewrite of these provisions may be considered for inclusion as part of a future tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Structure of the CFC and FIF rules Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young) The new non-portfolio FIF rules plug into the existing CFC rules. A simpler and cleaner drafting option could be to have a separate stand-alone section for FIFs. There should be a clear provision for a “non-attributing active FIF” category, and a clear distinction between determining that status and using a method to calculate any attributable FIF income or loss. Comment The drafting of the new non-portfolio FIF rules is based on the existing provisions for the branch equivalent method. This has some advantages as it minimises the legislative change and means that the legislation highlights the few areas where non- portfolio FIFs are treated differently to CFCs. However, as submitters have pointed out it also means that taxpayers need to refer to both the CFC and FIF rules when applying the new non-portfolio FIF rules. A rewrite exercise may be desirable in future, but is not practical at this time. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 71 TAXATION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN NEW ZEALAND Submission (Green Party Member) The bill should increase taxation on all properties owned by non-resident, or non-New Zealand citizens and increase GST on all earnings by those property owners, from that land. Comment The requested tax changes are both fundamental and outside the scope of the proposals in this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 72 73 Appendix 74 75 AUSTRALIAN FIF REFORMS Australia has released draft legislation to replace its FIF rules with a special anti- avoidance rule that targets “roll-up” funds (offshore funds that do not distribute income back to investors). The anti-avoidance rule is likely to apply in very limited circumstances. Specifically, it only applies to debt-like investments and only when profits are retained abroad rather than distributed to Australian investors. Under the Australian plans there will be a significant difference in tax treatment depending on whether the Australian investor is a portfolio investor, a non-portfolio investor or has control of the foreign company. By contrast, the New Zealand approach is to provide overall consistency of treatment by providing similar options for attribution across the various tranches. NEW ZEALAND AUSTRALIA Portfolio FIF FDR is main attribution method No tax on dividends or capital gains No tax on attribution (unless a roll-up fund) Tax dividends and capital gains Non-portfolio FIF Either: Attribute passive income (if more than 5% passive income); OR Use FDR, Cost etc. No tax on attribution (unless a roll-up fund) CFC (in Aus will include joint ventures) Attribute passive income (if more than 5% passive income) Attribute passive income (if more than 5% passive income) In the case of portfolio investment the Australian investor is taxed on dividends and any capital gains from sale. This is broadly equivalent to the New Zealand approach of applying the fair dividend rate (FDR) method. Accordingly, no major difference between the two countries arises. Similarly, in cases when the Australian investor has control, the Australian approach broadly lines up with the New Zealand approach. That is, passive income will be attributed unless the foreign company passes an active business test. The main difference relates to the treatment of non-portfolio FIFs. In cases when an Australian investor does not control the foreign company, no foreign income is attributed, regardless of whether the income is active or passive. Under the Australian approach no tax liability will arise except in very limited circumstances. By contrast, the New Zealand approach will be to allow investors to use either the active income exemption or FDR. 76 We think the Australian approach is likely to be unsuitable in New Zealand (where, for example, there is no general capital gains tax). First, there are fiscal risks associated with this approach. It would allow non- controlling investors to shelter or defer tax on domestic-sourced income by shifting it into an offshore company. For example, under this approach a New Zealand investor could invest alongside foreign investors who had similar incentives to shift passive income into a tax-efficient arrangement. Second, the approach creates disparity in tax treatment between situations where an investor has control and situations where the investor’s interest falls short of control. This puts pressure on the design of the control test. It also provides preferential treatment for investors who may have effective control in commercial terms but don’t meet the tax control test. Finally the approach might distort commercial decisions by providing an incentive to invest offshore as opposed to in the domestic economy. The objective of the New Zealand reforms is to reduce tax barriers to New Zealand businesses expanding offshore. This is not the same as explicitly encouraging foreign investment.

The bill seeks to support the objectives of: • giving parents greater choice in their work and caring roles; • giving families with children additional financial support; and • acknowledging the contributions of those who forgo income to care for their children. To achieve this, the bill proposes a new tax credit for couples who care for dependent children and sets out the eligibility criteria for the new income-sharing tax credit. Under the proposed scheme, couples with dependent children will pay the same amount of tax for the same level of combined couple income, regardless of which partner earns the income. The notional effect of the tax credit is as if each individual earned, and was taxed on, half of the couple’s combined income amount. This addresses concerns that the individual-based progressive personal tax system results in unfair outcomes for couples with dependent children. The bill also amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 by setting out the method of applying for and receiving the tax credit. The bill does not contain any other tax issues. Submissions The bill attracted 102 submissions. Feedback was general, with very few of the submissions relating to specific provisions in the bill. 1 There were 85 submissions in support of the bill, 12 opposed the bill and 5 expressed mixed views. Most submissions were from individuals with most supporting the intent of the bill and the creation of a new tax credit. A number of submissions were received from organisations, most of which opposed the bill or raised fundamental concerns with key elements. Several organisations agreed with the underlying objectives of the bill but not with creation of a new tax credit for couples with dependent children. Some submitters recommended that the bill should not proceed and that alternative options should be reviewed to achieve the underlying objectives. The general themes and arguments raised in support or opposition to the bill are set out in the following tables. Some submissions recommended changes to the eligibility criteria in clause 15, or to other specific criteria. The report sets out officials’ responses to those submissions. 1 The names of those who made submissions are listed in the annex at the end of this report. 2 General themes The majority of submissions mentioned general themes or reasons for supporting or opposing the bill without discussing specific aspects of the draft legislation. Submissions by the Families Commission and the National Council of Women in New Zealand, for example, set out a range of arguments in support and opposition to various concepts in the bill. Two broad themes emerged in submissions: • arguments for and against the use of the income-sharing tax credit compared with other methods of supporting families and the impact on those in greatest need of financial assistance; and • whether there is an inequity in the individual-based progressive tax system for couples who are financially interdependent but not in a business partnership (regardless of whether they have dependent children or not). Supporting families with dependent children through the income-sharing tax credit While some submitters saw the income-sharing tax credit as a means of supporting families with dependent children, others considered the income-sharing tax credit to be an inequitable and discriminatory means of supporting families. As 78% of the value of the tax credits is expected to go to families with more than $70,000 income, submitters raised concerns that the tax credit was poorly targeted and not helping those in greatest need, especially sole parents. Alternative methods of supporting families were instead recommended. The arguments around assisting families with dependent children through the income- sharing tax credit are set out in the following table. SUPPORT OPPOSE Fairness and equity A fairer tax system with reduced taxes on couples is a better approach than handouts and transfers such as Working for Families (WFF) tax credits. It gives an unjustifiable and inequitable benefit to relatively well-off families. The tax credit is poorly targeted as it does not go to households with the highest needs. It will have a negative impact on income distribution. It does not address child poverty. It does not help those in greatest need. Those on a low income will have less opportunity to benefit from the bill. It does not take into account that there are other gains associated with having a non-working partner, such as free childcare. Two parents working have additional costs such as childcare and transport but may not receive anything from the tax credit. Fiscal cost Revenue costs could be recouped through lower social costs from poor health and family disunity. It may result in some savings from childcare subsidies. It has a large fiscal cost, which could come at the expense of other policies that support families or be a burden to other taxpayers. 3 SUPPORT OPPOSE Human rights Sole parents can access other forms of social assistance – for example, the domestic purposes benefit. It meets international obligations to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Equal taxation of couples with the same combined income is a human rights issue. It does not recognise or assist sole parents or other household arrangements that do not meet the definition of “couple”, such as grandparents raising grandchildren. There is a human rights issue under the Bill of Rights Act 1990 section 19(1), in terms of discrimination against sole parents and women (and indirectly against Māori). It is inconsistent with international obligations on human rights. Consistency with government policy It is consistent with other universal support accessible to higher income families such as 20 hours free childcare. It is inequitable to subsidise private childcare but not to support parents providing childcare. Paying parents to care for children would align with the government’s support of childcare. It does not align with wider government objectives on employment and growth or fiscal sustainability. The domestic purposes benefit rules have been amended to require work-testing when the youngest child is aged six – setting age of dependent child as 18 for the purposes of the income-sharing tax credit would offer couples more favourable treatment than that for sole parents. Benefits to families and society Additional financial support will make it financially viable for a parent to raise children and support working partners. Families face additional costs, which this tax credit will recognise and assist with. It provides more options for families about work and care choices. It supports families raising children with special needs – when there are no suitable childcare options. Evidence supports families directly raising very young children during the critical early years of child development. This is a long-term investment in the wellbeing of children, which will produce gains to society as a whole. It could reduce benefit fraud when couples declare they are separate or single to claim benefits. It supports couples to stay together, including through a psychological effect of couples viewing themselves as one unit. This reduces societal costs associated with separation. The current system promotes family separation. It supports family wellbeing. It supports good parenting. It may free up part-time vacancies for the unemployed. It will support entrepreneurs and start-up self- employed businesses by increasing after-tax family income. It supports couples where one partner is on call (such as doctors and policemen) and the other has to be available for caregiving. This would encourage the retention of qualified workers in New Zealand, particularly in rural communities. It will assist home buyers wanting to start a family to meet mortgage payments, especially when one partner has no income. The bill will not create a supportive environment for children and families. 4 SUPPORT OPPOSE Recognition of caregivers The bill recognises the role of caregivers who forgo work to raise their children, which is a vital contribution to society. The bill provides caregivers with economic visibility. It does not extend to other forms of dependents such as disabled adults, partners with health problems and infirm elderly parents. It does not recognise the value of the caregiver as the tax credit is based on a working individual’s income. Inequity in the individual-based progressive tax system for couples who are financially interdependent Some submitters saw the income-sharing tax credit as a means of ensuring that couples paid the same level of tax, regardless of which party earns the income. Other submitters considered that the current individual-based tax system was appropriate and that other changes to the tax system were a higher priority or a better alternative to a tax credit. SUPPORT OPPOSE Fairness and equity It addresses the unfairness that exists in the current tax system where families earning the same combined income pay different levels of tax. The current system penalises parents who have one partner forgoing income in order to care for children directly. It provides similar tax incentives to those faced by couples who are self-employed and business owners by treating a couple as a “partnership”. It will create new anomalies between different types of taxpayers, such as sole parents and couples without children. Recognition of caregivers It recognises the interdependence of the family unit. Nominal splitting does not encourage actual sharing of income or assets. Not all families pool resources and share income. Consistency with government policy Other welfare payments (WFF and benefits) are based on household income rather than individual income. The tax system is out of step and the tax credit would address this inconsistency. It is consistent with the Relationship Property Act 1976. Tax law is unduly individualistic and should instead reflect the family unit. It is inconsistent with the principles underlying the Budget 2010 tax changes and directions set out in “Making Tax Easier”. There is a disincentive for a carer to work part-time or remain attached to the workforce as the marginal tax rate is higher (particularly for women and therefore there are implications for the gender pay gap and labour force participation). 5 SUPPORT OPPOSE Tax system The current system has deadweight costs from couples finding ways to split income through trusts and companies. The tax system should remain based on the individual, and welfare systems on household income. The single earner / dual earner tax differential is an inherent feature of progressivity. Direct social assistance outside of the tax system would be preferable. The 2001 McLeod tax review did not support income sharing. The tax system should not subsidise lifestyle choices. Recent tax cuts reduced disparity between single and dual earner households. It will add complexity to the tax system. It will distort the tax system and impose deadweight costs to the economy. Alternative options Submitters who opposed the bill, but generally supported assisting families with dependent children, particularly low income families, suggested this objective would be better achieved in a number of alternative ways, including: • changes to Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, including removing the work requirement of the in-work tax credit; • increasing the housekeeper/childcare rebate; • increasing welfare benefit levels; • extending paid parental leave; • a universal child benefit or an allowance for preschool years; • improving early childhood health and education provisions; • a carer’s allowance; and • restructuring the tax and benefit system with a view to helping lower income earners. Submitters who opposed the bill, but generally supported addressing inequities in the individual-based tax system, suggested this objective would be better achieved in a number of alternative ways, including: • implementing a 28-28-28 top tax rate system; • a uniform personal tax rate for all taxpayers, or cutting personal tax rates; • a guaranteed minimum income scheme; • couples could register with Inland Revenue as a partnership and be taxed under the partnership tax rules; • analysing the proposal as part of a wider review of tax policy. 6 Additional information The Committee requested officials provide further information on two options based on arguments raised in the submissions. This additional information is provided below. Reducing the age of “dependent child” to two years old If the age of “dependent child” was reduced to a maximum of two years old, this would reduce the number of families potentially eligible for the tax credit from approximately 310,000 to 55,000. This would significantly reduce the fiscal cost of the tax credit from $460 million to $90 million in the 2012–13 tax year. It would also reduce the ongoing operational costs to Inland Revenue by $2 to $3 million a year (from $3 to $4 million to around $1 million a year). Parents of young children may be more likely to want to take up the option to sacrifice paid work to care for young children and to need the additional financial assistance. Some submitters have suggested that the benefits from parenting at home were greatest during the early years of childhood. Once the child turned three the couple would no longer be eligible for the tax credit. This loss of assistance could require some families to increase the number of hours worked, or require a full-time carer to take up paid work and make greater use of early childhood education services, in order to maintain family income levels. In developing the income-sharing scheme, officials have considered 6 and 18 as the potential age of “dependent child”. Setting the age of “dependent child” to two years old would not align with WFF tax credits (18 years old), the age at which sole parents on the domestic purpose benefit are required to begin work testing (six years old), nor the age for compulsory schooling (six years old). The question remains whether other means of providing additional support to families may be better targeted to couples facing the same marginal tax rate (who otherwise do not benefit), or couples on low incomes. Treating the family unit as akin to a partnership under the Income Tax Act 2007 One alternative would be to treat the income of the couple as jointly earned, similar to the way a business partnership is treated. This reflects the idea that the couple is interdependent, with both partners contributing to the earning of income. Under the provisions of the bill, the calculation of the proposed income-sharing tax credit is based on a notional sharing of income; it does not legally attribute or assign income between parties. Some submitters raised concerns that couples in a business partnership are able to attribute business income to each party but couples relying on wage and salary income are unable to share income in this manner. However, business income usually includes returns on capital investment as well as returns to physical effort, so a direct comparison cannot be made. 7 Attributing employment income between a couple would be a significant shift in the fundamental principles of the Income Tax Act 2007, which taxes an individual on the income they earn in their own right. That is, employment income is attributed only to the individual who has the employment contract with the employer. The option raises questions of how to treat the deduction of expenses in these partnerships. This option would require a significant revision of the current bill and parts of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. There would be significant fiscal and administrative implications. Treating a couple as a partnership would mean that the individual partners would be attributed income in their own right. This would have flow-on implications to other situations, such as child support payments and student loan repayments. There are implications outside of the tax system such as for loan applications, other payments and legal arrangements that rely on an individual’s own level of income. 8 DEFINTION OF “COUPLE” Clause 15(1) new section MG 2 Issue: Definition of “couple” to target people who are married only Submissions (The Kiwi Party, M van Beyere, Christo van Niekerk, Anthony Pitt, Family First NZ) The tax credit should be especially targeted at married couples to encourage a marriage culture and family stability. This would balance out a “marriage penalty” within current tax and benefit systems. It should be available to married couples only, as evidenced by a marriage certificate. (The Kiwi Party) Comment It is not clear how the tax credit could be especially targeted to married couples other than by restricting the eligibility criteria to couples who are registered as married. Restricting the tax credit to married couples would reduce the number of people who would be eligible. Non-married couples who are in a civil union or de facto partnerships would also appear to face the “marriage penalty” some submitters referred to, as both partners’ incomes are taken into account in assessing eligibility for social assistance programmes. Restricting couples on the grounds of marital status would raise further discrimination issues. We do not consider that it would be significantly more difficult to verify the relationship status of people who are not married. Shifting from the definition used in WFF may also increase administrative costs slightly. Other submitters, such as the Families Commission, were pleased to see the diversity of couple-partnerships recognised, including married, civil union and de facto couples. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 9 Issue: Couples without children should be eligible Submission (National Council of Women of NZ, W Pincott, Robin Johnstone, Hilary Beath) The tax credit should be extended to all couples in a committed relationship irrespective of whether they have children, or whether their children are still dependent. Comment The submission would significantly alter an underlying purpose of the tax credit, which is to support families with dependent children. While it may address equity concerns about the tax treatment between couples with and without children, it would not address concerns raised about sole parents not being eligible. The suggested change would simplify the system by removing requirements relating to children (including shared care) but would also expand the number of people who would be eligible. The fiscal cost of the tax credit would consequently significantly increase. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Period of relationship should be reduced to a minimum of 122 days Submission (Hutt Valley Community Law Centre) Further consideration is needed on why the length of the relationship is one tax year, while the exclusive care of a dependent child is 122 days. A parent who meets the exclusive care requirement may not have been in a new relationship for a whole tax year and therefore will miss out on the tax credit. It is not uncommon for people to change partners within a tax year. The same qualifying time (122 days) should be used to prove a new relationship. Comment The tax credit relates to the sharing of taxable income across the whole of the tax year. Therefore the criteria are for couples to be together for the whole of the tax year. Introducing a part-year option would complicate the administration of the tax credit, by requiring the allocation of income to portions of the tax year. It could also increase the possibility of fraud by people claiming to be a couple for short periods of time. 10 The period of “exclusive care” is set at 122 days to allow former partners to enter into shared care arrangements (compared with sole care arrangements) and still be eligible for the tax credit, similar to WFF tax credits. Requiring care of a dependent child for the whole of the tax year would be likely to exclude children under shared care arrangements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Dependent child should be dependent for whole of tax year Submission (Michael Taylor) The period of dependency for a child should be the whole of the tax year, consistent with the period used in the definition of a couple. This would simplify the system and any anomaly would be similar to that created by the cut-off when reaching 18 years. Comment New section MG 2(1)(c) of the bill refers to the couple being a principal caregiver at some time during the year. This allows couples to qualify if there are times of the year when neither was caring for a dependent child. This could be due to shared care arrangements, as well as when a child may begin or cease to be a dependent child during the year. Sections MG 3(7) and MG 5 deal with a dependent child only being dependent for part of the year. The amount of the tax credit is adjusted on a pro rata basis to the portion of the year the child was a dependent child. Requiring a parent to be a principal caregiver for the whole of the tax year would exclude couples in the year a dependent child was born or ceased to be dependent. While this would reduce the fiscal cost and simplify the administration of the system, removing the availability of the tax credit for the year a child is born would reduce the effectiveness of the scheme. The tax credit would no longer assist with work and caring choices in the year the child was born, when it may be most necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 DEFINITION OF A DEPENDENT Clause 15(1) new section MG 2 Issue: Extend the criteria for “principal caregiver” to include caring for disabled adult children, disabled spouses or elderly parents Submission (Christopher Walters, National Council of Women of NZ, Parents as Partners) The qualifying criteria defining a “principal caregiver” could be extended to include the care of disabled adult children, disabled spouses or elderly parents, as well as dependent children. There is a similar level of dependency and requirement for flexibility and choice in work and caring responsibilities as with dependent children. Similar changes could be made to the WFF tax credit. Comment Extending the bill to include other dependents would further increase the fiscal cost of the tax credit and increase the complexity and administration of the tax credit in verifying that other adults were dependent on the couple. The proposal is consistent with the bill’s aim to provide couples with greater choice in their work and caring roles, but is inconsistent with its focus on families with children. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 AGE OF DEPENDENT CHILD Clause 15(1) new section MG 2(3), MG 2(4) A number of submitters supported the current age of 18 as it is consistent with the age of a dependent child used elsewhere, including in WFF tax credits, and would simplify administration. Some submitters proposed alternative age limits. Issue: Include children up to the age of 25 who are ineligible to receive a parental income-tested student allowance Submission (Andrew and Jacqueline Hart, Family First NZ, Hilary Beath, National Council of Women of NZ, Christo van Niekerk, Parents as Partners, Family First NZ) The age of a dependent child should be extended to include young adult children up to the age of 24 or 25 years, if the young adult is in full-time study/tertiary education and is ineligible for a student allowance on the basis of parental income. This change in definition of dependent child could also apply to WFF tax credits for consistency. One submitter suggested that there should be no age limit for dependent children. Comment The bill extends the definition of the age of a dependent child up to the end of the school year in which they turn 18. The eligibility rules for a student allowance for a young adult up to 24 years, who does not have their own dependent child, is subject to a parental income test. This reflects an expectation by government that parents will continue to financially support their young adult children in tertiary education. Students are also income tested against any income they earn in their own right. Extending the definition of “dependent child” to students up to the age of 24 or 25 would include students who are ineligible for a student allowance on the basis of parental income. Such an extension would result in an increase in fiscal cost and a significant increase in the complexity and administration of the scheme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 Issue: Restrict age to six years old Submission (National Council of Women in NZ, Michael Taylor) Eligibility to the tax credit should cease or be drastically reduced once there is no child under the age of full-time schooling (effectively six years) – given the intention of the bill to give parents greater freedom to work fewer or more flexible hours in order to care for children full-time. Leaving the age at 18 would mean paying parents to be at home to care for children when the child is actually at school. Reducing the age limit would also align with the age of the youngest child at which sole parents on the domestic purposes benefit are required to be work-tested. Comment Restricting the age to six would align with children attending compulsory primary education, as well as the age at which sole parents on the domestic purpose benefit are required to begin work-testing. If it is necessary to decrease the cost of the scheme, the option of restricting the age to six could be considered as it would significantly reduce the fiscal cost of income sharing from $460 million to $240 million in the 2012–13 tax year. However, this would also significantly decrease the number of couples who could benefit from the tax credits from 310,000 to 150,000. It would not address concerns raised by some submitters over the targeting of the scheme; most of the benefit would be received by couples with relatively high incomes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Restrict age to 5 or 12 years old Submission (Friends of Income Sharing) If the fiscal constraints mean that the bill cannot proceed, the cost could be reduced by narrowing the criteria for the tax credit. This could be done by reducing the age of eligible children to 5 or 12 years. Comment While restricting the age of a couple’s children would reduce the fiscal cost of the tax credit, the number of couples who would benefit from the scheme would also decrease. If the age were to be reduced to align with the age at which children attend primary school, it would be better to set the limit at six years of age. This would ensure consistency with the Education Act 1989 requirement that children must begin compulsory schooling before they turn six years old. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 SHARED CARE Clause 15(1) new MG6 Most members of the National Council of Women in NZ saw problems with the administration of shared care in relation to income sharing when relationships are already strained or new partnerships are involved. Others indicated that separated partners would be more focused on care of the child than on forming new partnerships. The Families Commission welcomed the application of the bill to parents who are in new relationships after separating and who continue to have significant caring roles for their children. Issue: Remove shared care eligibility Submission (Michael Taylor) Only couples with full care of the child or who have responsibility for caring for the child for a significant amount of time, such as 80%, should be eligible as shared care of at least 122 days is an unjustified complication and could potentially influence sharing arrangements. Comment Restricting eligibility to those with full care for the whole year would reduce the number of couples eligible. While this would reduce the fiscal cost, it would likely put greater pressure on separating couples to gain full custody of the child, as there would be a potential financial advantage to doing so if they expected to be in a new relationship. This could lead to poorer outcomes for the children involved. This would lead to a different definition of “dependent child” from that in the WFF system, restricting Inland Revenue’s ability to use existing information and systems. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue: Make tax credit proportional to shared care Submission (Parents as Partners) Couples with shared care of a child should be eligible for income sharing in proportion to the time allocated to care, with a minimum requirement of one-third of any time. Care less than one-third of the time would arguably not affect their availability for employment. Comment Requiring parents to determine and declare the proportion of care they provided through the year will increase compliance requirements for applicants. Linking the level of the tax credit to the amount of time they provide care could affect decisions between former couples about care arrangements and potentially worsen outcomes for children. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 LEVEL OF TAX CREDIT Clause 15(1) new section MG 3 Issue: Limit the tax credit for couples with incomes above a threshold Submissions (Michael Taylor, Whitireia Community Law Centre, Anthony Muir) There should be a limit on eligibility for those who earn more than a certain amount in a tax year. (Anthony Muir) The limit should be set at a household income of $80,000. (Whitireia Community Law Centre) The tax credit should start reducing at some level and drop to zero at a higher level, such as four times the median individual wage. (Michael Taylor) Comment The suggested change would significantly reduce the cost of the new tax credit by reducing the number of people who would be eligible (78% of the value goes to households on more than $70,000). However, it would also reduce the effectiveness of the tax credit and remove key aspects, such as ensuring couples on the same combined income pay the same amount of tax. It could also create negative work incentives for couples near the threshold if a small increase in the combined couple income meant the loss of all the tax credit. There would be a small increase in complexity from the new eligibility criteria, although it is unlikely to increase the administrative cost of the new tax credit. Designing an abatement rate to reduce the amount of the tax credit as income increased would also defeat the underlying rationale and method of calculating the tax credit as well as worsening work incentives for both partners (especially where it overlaps with WFF abatement). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 17 Issue: Reduce the level of the in-work tax credit if the couple is in receipt of an income-sharing tax credit Submission (The Kiwi Party) When a family is entitled to receive an income-sharing tax credit, the WFF in-work tax credit should be reduced by 50% if one spouse is in work for less than 10 hours a week. This would acknowledge that there are fewer costs incurred when a spouse is not in full-time work. This would reduce the overall fiscal costs of the income- sharing measure. Comment The amount of the in-work tax credit should not be affected by the receipt of the income-sharing tax credit. The same amount of in-work tax credit is paid regardless of whether the qualifying person is a sole parent or in a couple arrangement and regardless of whether they are a single or dual-earner couple. The question of whether the in-work tax credit should reflect the level of extra costs associated with working and be on a per person basis is separate from the issue of income sharing. If the desired outcome is to reduce the costs of income sharing, other options would be preferred, such as lowering the eligibility age for the dependent child. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 SHARING OF INCOME Clause 15(1) new section MG 3 Issue: Share family income among all members of the household Submission (Family First NZ) Looking at the income levels of the couple, the tax credit fails to take into account the number of children that a family is raising. Some adjustment should be made to reflect the number of children and resulting household costs. This could be achieved by the ability to split income amongst the children – for example, two-thirds between adults and one-third between children. Comment Splitting the income among family members was considered during the consultation process but was not recommended because of the higher level of complexity and administration costs that would be involved for a relatively small gain in tax savings for the family. This is particularly so if the tax credit is also to be shared based on the number of children and if a child starts or stops being a dependent child during the tax year. It also raises the question of whether children’s income should also be added to the total amount of income to be shared. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 ADMINISTRATION OF TAX CREDIT Clauses 19 to 23 Issue: Requirement to file and provide information and declare eligibility Submission (Michael Taylor, National Council of Women in NZ, Whitireia Community Law Centre) Michael Taylor, most members of the NCWNZ and the Whitireia Community Law Centre supported using the same or similar methods of administration that existed for the WFF tax credits, including the use of an annual declaration of eligibility. Comment We agree that using the same rules will simplify the administration of the scheme for most people. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Deliver through the PAYE system Submission (Father and Child Trust, Whitireia Community Law Centre, Parents as Partners) The WFF tax credit is a subsidy paid out of general taxation, while the income- sharing tax credit is an adjustment to ensure parents are taxed equally compared with other couple households on the same combined income level. Paying the tax credit using the same systems as WFF tax credits may confuse the public into thinking income-sharing is a form of subsidy. To maintain its nature as an adjustment to tax, it should ideally be made available through the PAYE system. (Father and Child Trust) The close alignment with the policies and processes used to administer the WFF scheme is supported as it is cost effective. (Whitireia Community Law Centre, Community Law Canterbury and Parents as Partners) 20 Comment An alternative method of administering the income-sharing proposal would be to create a new PAYE tax code for eligible couples which alters the amount of PAYE withheld during the year to achieve the same net of tax result. However, this would impose greater compliance costs on couples, employers and PAYE intermediaries. It would require an end-of-year square-up to ensure the right amount of PAYE was withheld during the year and that any overpayments are recovered. The additional administration costs to implement a PAYE system would be much greater than by providing through an annual tax credit. Recommendation That the first submission be declined. 21 ANNEX: INDEX OF SUBMISSIONS Note: listed in alphabetical order by surname or organisation name • Al-Sallami, Hesham • Auber, Fleur • Bailey, Michelle • Baker, Kerry • Baron, Peter • Beath, Hilary • Binks, Richard • Blackburn, Maria • Blummont, Catherine • Bracefield, Anthony Robert • Business New Zealand • Cahill, Derek and Margaret • Caampbell, Josephine Lesley • Campbell, Penny • Chalmers, Justin Paul • Chalmers, Martyn • Community Law Canterbury • Courtney, Bill • CPAG - Child Poverty Action Group • Dunedin Community Law Centre • Eliott, Mark • England, Colin • Families Commission • Family First New Zealand • Farrell, Brenda • Fatemi, Mehrdad • Father and Child Trust • Friends of Income Sharing • Gibson, Nicola • Halcrow, Gerry • Hart, Andrew and Jacqueline • Hill, Martin • Hippolite, James • Hitchins, Nicholas • Holden, Allan and Wendy • Human Rights Commission • Hutt Valley Community Law Centre • Johnstone, Helen • Johnstone, Karen • Johnstone, Robin • Kamp, Betty-Ann • Kat, Arjen • Kiwi Party, The • Knight, Jacqueline Anne • Lemmon, Diane and Denis • Lindsay, Megan • Lord, Michael David • Macdonald, Rowena • McCarthy, Denis • McCrossan, Anna • McLaren, Duncan • Mcpherson • McPherson, Alex • Metcalfe, Christine • Miller, Stephen • Moala, Ate (Dr), The Healing Centre • Mockett, Keith • Morris, Jordan • Morris, Julie (Mrs.) • Muir, Anthony • National Council of Women of New Zealand • New Zealand Business Roundtable • New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services • New Zealand Council of Trade Unions • New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants • Novilla, Francis • Novilla, Grace • Pace, Alan • Parents as Partners • Paul, Craig • Pickering, Eric • Pincott, Wayne • Pitt, Anthony • Prestidge & Associates, Brian E • Mark Prestidge & Co Ltd • Roblett, Chris and Sue • Shakouri, Sara • Sherwood, Mark • Simpkin, Tim • Skilling Family • Smith, GE • Taylor, Michael • Thompson, G • Thorp, Alan • Tyremax New Zealand • van Beyere, M • van der Voorn, Peter • van Niekerk, Christo • Walters, Christopher • Watts, Brandon • Watts, Kelly-Marie • Watts, P R • White, Robert • Whitehead, Lydia • Whitehead, Matthew • Whitireia Community Law Centre • Wild, Eileen • Wilkinson, Amanda • Wilson, Hugh • Women’s Studies Association of New Zealand • Wyatt, Sally • Zohrab, Peter

Ten submissions were received on the bill. The two proposals which proved to be the most controversial with submitters were the changes to the assessment basis for salary and wage earners – moving from an annual basis to a pay-period basis, and to the exemption of student loan contracts from the requirements of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003. Other changes in the bill were greater use of electronic services to enable more timely provision of information and the ability for borrowers to self-manage their loans, increasing the StudyLink and Inland Revenue administration fees, aligning penalties with those that apply for other taxes, aligning the interim payment rules more closely with the provisional tax rules, and changes to interest rates. Most submissions supported the intent of the bill, welcoming moves to improve student loan administration and reduce the compliance costs imposed on borrowers. Submitters commented that the proposed measures would reduce compliance costs for borrowers and a high degree of self-management would be a welcome improvement. There was also support for aligning the penalties that apply to student loans with those that apply for other taxes, and the excess repayment bonus. Three submitters raised matters that were not directly related to changes in the bill. These related to requiring borrowers to pay a deposit for each loan, the recent announcement to introduce a lifetime limit on accessing student loan funding and ways to provide further assistance to borrowers. This report sets out officials’ detailed responses to submissions. Officials have taken into account the recommendations in submissions seeking greater disclosure to borrowers following the exemption of the Student Loan Scheme from the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act, and the extension of the exemption from student loan repayments for full-year students while studying full-time to also include those students with a full-time workload but who study for part of the year. Supplementary Order Paper No. 200 – Student Loan Scheme Bill, was released by the Minister of Revenue on 14 December 2010. The SOP outlined changes to enable the Commissioner to exercise rights in the contract to recall the full amount of the student loan. No submissions were received on the SOP. Repayment obligations for salary and wage earners determined on a pay-period basis The bill proposes that for the majority of salary and wage earners, their repayment obligations will be determined on a pay-period basis, providing greater certainty for borrowers as their repayment obligation will be finalised each pay period or errors identified and if significant, corrected sooner. 1 2 Borrowers will focus on the pay-period income and expenses and not on their annual liability. Under this proposal borrowers will make repayments when they can afford to – that is, when their income is over the repayment threshold of $19,084 ($367 per week), and are not required to make repayments when they cannot afford to pay. If a borrower is in significant financial difficulties, they will qualify for hardship and will either not be required to make repayments, or their payments will be reduced. A borrower’s loan repayments each pay-period (excluding errors and income fluctuations) will not change between the current process and that proposed in the bill. What will change is that borrowers will not be required to undertake an end-of-year return and deal with any resulting additional repayments. Significant policy matters 3 4 PROVISION OF ELECTRONIC SERVICES Clauses 13 to 15 Submissions (NZ Union of Students’ Associations, Whitireia Community Law Centre) The ability for borrowers to access a greater amount of information online and to be able to self-manage their loans is supported. The current interactions between borrowers and Inland Revenue are complicated, time-consuming and not user-friendly. Processes are generally outdated and inflexible. The provision of more online services and borrowers’ ability to self- manage their loans will be of significant benefit, especially to overseas-based borrowers. The NZ Union of Students’ Associations also supports the continued provision of paper-based and phone-based communication where appropriate and necessary. Comment Although most communication will occur via electronic means, borrowers who, for example, do not have access to the internet will still be able to receive paper-based communication. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 5 CHANGING THE BASIS OF ASSESSMENT FOR BORROWERS WITH SALARY OR WAGE INCOME Clause 32 Submissions (Lenore Bamfield, NZ Union of Students’ Associations, Whitireia Community Law Centre, Auckland University Students’ Association) Currently, the same repayment obligations apply to all New Zealand-based borrowers – that is, the repayment obligation is 10 percent of the borrower’s annual net income that exceeds the repayment threshold (currently $19,084). The bill proposes to have different repayment obligations for different classes of New Zealand-based borrowers, namely: • repayment deductions from salary or wages which generally will be determined on a pay-period basis; • repayment obligations on pre-taxed income is determined on an annual basis and applies when this income exceeds $1,500; and • repayment obligations on borrowers with other income is determined on an annual basis and is based on the borrower’s taxable income. The four submitters were against changing the basis of assessment from an annual assessment to a pay-period assessment for borrowers who have salary and wage deductions made. Their view was because of potential negative effects on borrowers, particularly those with irregular or part-time employment, and students. Although the pay-period assessment basis may benefit borrowers in the long term submitters say it may not benefit borrowers in the short term, and may lead to borrowers undertaking non-compliant actions to reduce their liability. The submitters say there could also be a disincentive for students seeking full-time work during non-study periods, which could lead to increased borrowing or reduced income available to students for their next period of study. (Lenore Bamfield, NZ Union of Students’ Associations) The NZ Union of Students’ Associations questions whether the change in the basis of assessment is necessary as part of an efficient student loan administration and suggest if the improvements should not come at the disadvantage or cost to borrowers. The submitter says the compulsory pay-period basis of assessment for salary or wage earners should be removed and replaced by borrowers having the choice over whether they want to apply the pay-period basis of assessment. (NZ Union of Students’ Associations) The submitter says due to the different basis of assessment proposed in the bill, borrowers on the same total income may face different repayment obligations depending on the sources of that income. Some borrowers will have assessments and others will not and only borrowers with other income will be able to have small overpayments (below the significant overpayment threshold) refunded. (Lenore Bamfield) 6 7 The same submitter also refuted the following grounds for the changes in the bill: • that the current system is complex; • that they provide certainty for salary and wage earner borrowers; • that the pay period is a better basis of assessment for salary and wages than current annual system; • that the majority of overpayments are currently offset against a borrower’s loan balance; and • that the changes will result in shortened repayment times. The following table summarises the submitter’s comments on each of these points and officials’ responses. Justification for change Submitter’s comment Officials’ response Complexity • The current system of an annual assessment process for all borrowers is already simple. • The proposed system is complex – fo r example, there are two formula is to establish a pre-taxed assessment. • Moving to an electronic environment would reduce complexity with an end-of-year square-up. • The requirement for students applying for the full-time, full-year repayment exemption will increase their compliance costs. • Retaining the current system stil l requires borrowers to file and IRD to assess returns. This does not reduce compliance a nd administration costs. • The proposed system may seem le gislatively complex with differ ent calculations required in different circumstances (for example, pre-taxed assessment). However, borrowers will only have to provide data and Inland Re venue will perform the calculations. • Under the proposal, borrowers with only salary or wage income will be removed from the requirement to file, with any small overpaym ents applied to the loan balance and under- payment not collected. Retaining the assessment basis and moving to electronic filing may reduce but would not remove compliance or administration costs. • Although there are compliance costs involved with students applying for the repayment exemption, the cost of students responding to current requests to apply the SL deduction code would reduce. 1 Certainty • If the PAYE system is working properly then large numbers of borrowers would have their repaym ents correctly deducted (within a $20 threshold). • Increasing the accuracy of the PAYE system alone will not address the situation when a borrower’s income fluctuates. This would still require an end-of-year assessment. Retaining the annual square-up will not reduce compliance or administration costs. Pay-period vs annual basis of assessment • Not allowing student loan liabilities to be spread over the year could lead to hardship. However, relief is only available for serious financial hardship. • The proposal in the bill creates an inconsistent treatment between borrowers on the same income but who derive salary or wage income compared with those who derive other income. • Currently if a borrower does not qualify for seri ous financial hardship, they have to wait until after the end of the year to receive a refund. The current relief in the form of a refund is not timely. • Instead of grouping all borrowers together, the proposals try to segment borrowers into groups to reduce compliance costs for some cla sses of borrowers, where appropriate – that is, borrowers with salary or wages only. There is consistency within the group but no t between groups of borrowers both in the current Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the bill. However, under the bill borrowers with salary or wage income have their re payment obligation determined on a pay-period basis. This enables both compliance and administration costs to be reduced. Majority of overpayments currently offset against loans • Borrowers may not be advised they may have a refund – leading to low levels of refunds. • Previously Inland Revenue did not notify borrowers of potential overpayments (by way of a personal tax summary). There were 18,000 such borrowers affected in 2010 – approximately 5 percent of salary or wage borrowers. Inland Revenue has changed its policy and in the current year will provide advice to borrowers who have a potential overpayment. This will address the submitter’s concerns. 1 Inland Revenue undertakes checks of borrowe rs with salary and wage income to ensure they are applying the correct deduction co de. As Inland Revenue is not curr ently aware whether a borrower is currently studying and therefore not liable the department theref ore contacts borrowers seeking to change their deduction code to SL (requiring student loan deductions). 8 9 Justification for change Submitter’s comment Officials’ response Shortened repayment times • In an interest-free environment, applying overpaymen ts to the loan may not be in the borrower’s best interest. This money may be needed to meet current needs. • If the amounts are over a threshold (yet to be determined) the overpayment will be available for refund. Comment The current annual system has a number of problems. They are: • an annual basis of assessment where accuracy is achieved only at year-end; • inaccurate deductions during the year lead to end-of-year debts and refunds; • there is no incentive to ensure correct deductions are made during the year: – Inland Revenue has limited resources to review every borrower; – borrowers can benefit by deferring payment; – employers may not be required to fix mistakes (not all mistakes are able to be checked during the year so are addressed at year-end); – Inland Revenue undertakes annual assessments, follows up debts, and handles end-of-year contacts. Under the pay-period proposal: • Inland Revenue resources will be shifted from undertaking the annual assessment and collecting large debts to ensuring deductions made during the year are correct (as far as possible). • Under the pay-period basis of assessment, greater accuracy would be achieved each payday and therefore the borrower has certainty of liability or over- deduction sooner. • Any resulting debt/overpayment will be smaller and occur for shorter durations – enabling certain tolerances to be applied. • If significant errors occur in a pay-period deduction, these can be considered for refund or recovery. • If an overpayment is not a significant amount but would cause hardship, Inland Revenue can provide relief and refund the amount to the borrower. • Inland Revenue will have the ability to move resources from the current end-of- year assessment processes to provide better services to borrowers during the year. • Borrowers’ compliance costs will fall as they will no longer be required to square-up their repayment obligations. Twelve examples were provided in the submission by Lenore Bamfield. These examples can be grouped into five categories as outlined in the following table, along with officials’ responses. 10 11 Submitter’s examples Officials’ response Income which fluctuates under and over the repayment threshold. This results in too much being deducted on an annual basis. - Under the proposal, resources are put into ensuring pay-period deductions are correct (within certain tolerances). - Amounts deducted for a pay-period would be a borrowers’ liability (providing certainty of liability during the year). - Significant over- or under deductions that occur will either be collected/refunded if they are significant or ignored if below the threshold. This process will occur throughout the year. - Any small overpayments (not considered significant) will be applied to the loan balance – which is to the borrower’s advantage. - Relief is available if the borrower experiences hardship. Lump sum payments received (such as redundancy, retiring, or bonus payments) results in over-deductions. Same comments as above. Full-time study but for only part of the year (commencing or ceasing study part-way through the year) does not qualify for the repayment exemption. Officials agree with the submitter and an amendment is proposed below on the exemption applying to students who are undertaking full- time study for part of the year. Deductions from secondary income (Inland Revenue’s existing practice is not in keeping with the proposed legislation). The bill resolves this by clarifying that borrowers are required to have deductions made during the year on secondary income and enables a borrower to apply any unused repayment threshold from their primary income to their secondary income. There are different treatments for borrowers with salary and wage income and borrowers with other income. Borrowers with other income are different from salary and wage income earners and are currently treated differently (for example, they have losses, expenses to deduct and have a different repayment system during the year). The bill continues to treat these two classes of taxpayer differently. Recommendation The issue of students studying full-time for only part of the year, is dealt with later in this report. With regard to the rest of the submissions it is recommended that they be declined. OIA ON OVERPAID STUDENT LOAN DEDUCTIONS Submission (Lenore Bamfield) In an oral briefing to the Select Committee, the submitter provided information received from Inland Revenue, under an Official Information Act request, on borrowers who had significant under- and overpayments. This information showed that there were significant numbers of borrowers who had overpaid as well as a group who had a significant over-deduction. Comment The request for information was quite specific in its nature in that it requested the figures for the tax year, hence not allowing for under-payments to take account of the due date for payment (being the 7th February in most cases), nor for borrower requests for refunds or other forms of transfers in the case of over-payments. To illustrate the issue, Inland Revenue looked into 16 cases where borrowers had a serious over-deduction. Although Inland Revenue cannot discuss the specific cases, the following is a general explanation of these cases. Two cases are awaiting the student loan account to be closed. These payments were made by the borrower to pay off the remaining loan balance in total. This is a timing lag between when payment was received, the extracting of the information for the submitter, and the closing of the borrower’s account. There were four cases of borrowers who had large payments transferred from other taxpayers to offset the borrower’s outstanding loan balance. Over-payment can occur, as in these four cases, when the borrower’s parent or relative contributes to pay off some of the loan or all of the borrower’s loan. In five cases, the borrowers qualified for and received an excess repayment bonus. It cannot be determined whether the excess deductions made through the PAYE system were due to an incorrect tax code being applied, incorrect deductions being made by the employer, or the borrower requesting additional student loan deductions to be made from their salary or wages. In any case, the borrowers were aware of the over- deduction and have taken advantage of the excess repayment bonus. There were two further cases of borrowers who were in a similar position to the above five borrowers, except that due to the timing of when the information was extracted, these two cases were still waiting to receive the excess repayment bonus. In three cases borrowers had overpaid their student loans liability and had applied for the over-deductions to be refunded. 12 13 What we can draw from the above explanations is that over-deductions are not necessarily the result of errors in the tax code used or an incorrect deduction being made. Some borrowers make a choice to overpay. In the case of smaller over- payments, it is likely that the vast majority of the smaller over-deductions are caused by employers making mistakes with deductions such as using wrong tax codes or deducting the wrong amounts. Other possible causes of overpayment include: the borrower instructing the employer to make additional PAYE deductions (voluntary repayment through the PAYE system) so that the borrower’s loan is repaid earlier or fluctuations in income received during the year. The proposed pay-period basis of assessment for salary or wage earners will largely eliminate these problems as incorrect deductions (over the threshold) will be advised to the employer and/or borrower and corrected earlier rather than having to wait until the year-end square-up. Recommendation That the submission be noted. WHETHER THE PAY-PERIOD BASIS COULD BE APPLIED MORE WIDELY THAN STUDENT LOANS Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee has asked whether the policy of determining student loan repayment obligations on a pay-period basis can be applied more widely across other forms of withheld income. Comment In June 2010, the Government discussion document, Making tax easier, was released for public consultation. One of the proposals was that pay-period deductions of pay- as-you-earn (PAYE) from taxpayers’ wages and salaries should be made “full and final” at the point of deduction. The proposal was to be limited to those taxpayers who were in stable employment for 11 or more months of the tax year. The reason was because PAYE deductions for taxpayers in these circumstances are typically quite accurate. Any over- or under- deductions are often to within $50 either way. Feedback received was, on the whole, against the proposal. Submitters believed that so long as there is potential for error in the PAYE system, taxpayers should be able to do end-of-year filing so the error can be corrected. Officials are currently working through the policy issues with a view to developing the proposal in a way that takes into account the concerns outlined in submissions. It is expected that a report will be sent to Cabinet in June 2011. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 14 STUDENTS WORKING PART-TIME WHILE THEY ARE STUDYING Clauses 48 to 54 Submissions (Lenore Bamfield, NZ Union of Students’ Associations, Whitireia Community Law Centre, Auckland University Students’ Association) Submitters raised three concerns with the exemption. The first is that compared with the status quo, borrowers’ compliance costs will increase and Inland Revenue will have an additional administrative function. The second concern is that as drafted, borrowers who study full-time for part of the year may be unable to access the full-time study repayment exemption. Thirdly, income earned by students during periods of non-study – for example, during the summer holidays, should be ring-fenced and exempt from pay-period repayments. Issue 1: Exemption will increase compliance and administration costs The proposed online election process for full-time students to elect the full-time study exemption, and therefore not be required to have student loan deductions made, will impose greater compliance and administration costs than the status quo. This will set up two tiers of repayment obligations between full-time students – those who know about the exemption and those who do not. The pay-period basis would be punitive as students tend to work longer hours during non-teaching periods to supplement their income. The exemption and an advertising campaign would not mitigate the unfairness of the pay-period basis. (NZ Union of Students’ Associations, Auckland University Students’ Association) Comment Officials consider that although compliance and administration costs will be incurred, these costs will be kept to a minimum. Also, without a formal election process, borrowers would face greater compliance costs in dealing with attempts by Inland Revenue to apply the student loan deduction code to their salary or wage income. Inland Revenue will ensure that the exemption available to students who are undertaking full-time study is communicated to students. This will also include but not be limited to highlighting the information on the borrower’s loan account, and in other information sent to borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue 2: Full-time study but for only part of the year The bill provides that full-time full-year students are not required to have repayment deductions made from their salary or wages. This is achieved by borrowers applying online for a full-time full-year study exemption. Submitters’ are concerned that as drafted, borrowers who begin or cease study part- way through an income year and who are under the annual repayment threshold amount will not be able to qualify for the full-time study repayment exemption. The bill requires borrowers to study for the full year and be under the annual repayment threshold. Comment Officials agree with the submitters that the exemption should be extended to students who undertake the equivalent of a full-time study workload for part of a year (for example, begin or cease study part-way through a year). However, the exemption should not be extended to part-time study involving less than a full-time study workload as this would open the exemption up to abuse by borrowers who would undertake part-time study in order to postpone their student loan repayments. To determine whether the borrower is undertaking full-time study for the repayment exemption, officials propose that this exemption adopt the same criteria used to determine whether a qualification is full-time or part-time for eligibility for the student allowances and the Student Loan Scheme, namely, the Loan Entry Threshold (LET) table. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue 3: Ring-fence income of students during periods of non-study Income earned by a student during periods of non-study should be exempt from pay- period repayments by ring-fencing this income. This would alleviate the problems with the exemption. The submitter recognises that there may be administrative issues in ring-fencing holiday work, such as the definition of “holiday work” (which could be limited to a period of 12 weeks work, whether there is a minimum number of hours needed to be worked to qualify, and the transition from holiday work into non-holiday work. There may also be issues for employers in administering the holiday work exemption. (Whitireia Community Law Centre) 16 Comment Officials agree with the concept of ensuring that the holiday period between periods of full-time study, such as the summer holidays, should qualify for the exemption. However, we do not agree with the proposal of ring-fencing the income earned during this period. As the submitter points out, administering the ring-fencing would be difficult. It would also enable borrowers to earn over the annual repayment threshold without having to make repayments, which would treat students more favourably than other borrowers and more favourably than under the current Student Loan Scheme Act. Instead, officials recommend that the legislation be amended to make it clear that the exemption applies in cases where: • the student starts drawing down their loan but the study has not yet commenced; or • the student finishes their study for the year and intends to continue next year, or next semester (after the holidays). This should address the concerns raised by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and the changes recommended by officials be accepted. 17 OVERPAYMENTS OF STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS Clause 111 Submissions (Lenore Bamfield, NZ Union of Students’ Associations) The bill precludes borrowers with other income from receiving a refund of overpaid deductions from salary or wage income. Secondly, overpayments can automatically be credited to any outstanding student loan accounts that a borrower has. Comment Overpaid salary and wage deductions The bill provides for borrowers who receive other income (regardless of whether they also receive salary or wage income as well) to square-up their repayment liability at the end of the year. Any overpayment (from whatever source) will be an excess repayment and available for refunding. The submission has identified a legislative oversight in clause 111 whereby a borrower who receives both other income and salary or wages is unable to receive a refund of overpaid loan deductions on their salary or wage income. Officials agree this is an oversight and that clause 111 should be amended to enable other income earners to receive a refund of overpaid deductions from their salary or wage income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Offsetting of refunds against outstanding debt The NZ Union of Students’ Associations had concerns regarding Inland Revenue’s ability to automatically credit any overpaid student loan payment to satisfy an unpaid amount, rather than the borrower retaining the current system of enabling the borrower to choose whether to receive the refund. However, the current system automatically assigns any student loan payment received to repay any unpaid amounts. This is to the borrower’s advantage as it reduces the borrower’s exposure to late payment penalties imposed on any unpaid amounts. When all unpaid amounts have been cleared, any remaining overpayment is assigned to repay the loan balance and the borrower is advised that they can elect to have this amount refunded if they wish. This process is continued in the bill when there is a significant overpayment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 ADMINISTRATION FEES IMPOSED BY STUDYLINK AND INLAND REVENUE Clause 181 Submissions (Phillip Baynes, Charlotte Harpin, Auckland University Students’ Association, New Zealand University Students Association, National Council of Women of New Zealand) Five submitters raised concerns over the introduction of the $40 annual Inland Revenue administration fee payable by borrowers with a consolidated loan balance of $20 or more. Two submitters stated that the underlying rationale for the fee is the belief that the student is the primary beneficiary of the loan, which ignores the significant public good that arises out of investing in tertiary education. As the bill introduces measures to reduce the costs of administration, one submitter found it difficult to understand how the increased administration fee could be justified. Students would also be expecting fees to subsequently reduce. The affordability of the fee was also a concern. The National Council of Women of New Zealand believed the fee could have a detrimental impact on low to middle income borrowers. Also, the imposition of the fee will extend the time needed to repay loans which is at odds with the aims of the bill to improve the rate and timeliness of repayments. Three submitters commented that the imposition of the administration fee is inconsistent with New Zealand’s commitment to the United Nations Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which mandates a commitment to the progressive realisation of free access to tertiary education. They also said the loan contract is an agreement between the borrower and the Government and variations to the contract requires agreement of both parties. There is no provision in the contract to impose an annual administration fee and the use of executive powers to vary the contract to impose the fee is an abuse of parliamentary sovereignty. The submitters believe introduction of the fee constitutes a breech of section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 as the imposition is effectively seizing the property of citizens. Comment The new Inland Revenue student loan annual account fee is designed to recover more of the costs of administering student loan accounts. Unlike commercial/banking practice, the Student Loan Scheme does not have mechanisms like interest to help cover operating costs. 19 The Government will continue to subsidise the annual Inland Revenue administration costs of those who are still studying and who have been charged a loan establishment fee in the same tax year. Should the administration costs change significantly, there will be a mechanism through the bill to make a regulation change to the annual Inland Revenue fee. In 2010–11, the Crown’s cost of new lending through the Student Loan Scheme is 45.3 cents for every dollar lent. What is sometimes overlooked is that the Crown meets the largest share of the costs of tertiary education through its funding of providers, through student allowances and through the subsidy involved in interest- free loans. The splitting of costs between the Government and the student (or his/her family) recognises that there is a social/public benefit from tertiary education but that individuals who have tertiary qualifications also receive a substantial benefit in terms of higher earnings and non-financial outcomes such as lifestyle. The $40 fee is not expected to raise affordability issues. By comparison, the average amount of a student loan taken out in 2009 was $6,991 ($40 represents 0.6 percent of this amount). While the fee may extend repayment times by a small amount for some borrowers (by an estimated two months), it could also encourage other borrowers to repay their loans sooner, thereby reducing the costs of the loan scheme to the Crown. New Zealand’s commitment to the United Nations Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requires the Government to move progressively (as economic resources permit) towards providing free and unrestricted access to tertiary education. The introduction of an administration fee does not explicitly bar students from enrolling in tertiary education nor is it likely that such a small administration fee would deter students, especially when loans are interest-free. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that student loans generally pose a barrier to tertiary study. OECD analysis shows that countries that allow providers to charge fees and enable students to borrow fees with government-subsidised loans tend to have good performance on measures of access to tertiary education. The Ministry of Education is of the view that the introduction of a $40 administration fee does not constitute a breach of section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act as raised by the submitters. That section upholds the right to be free from unreasonable search or seizure. The fee does not amount to “unreasonable seizure”. The Ministry of Justice has vetted the bill for any Bill of Rights implications and did not raise any concerns. In Budget 2010, the Government decided that the new Inland Revenue administration fee would apply to borrowers with new or existing loan contracts. This is to recover some of the annual costs of borrowers who currently hold a loan with Inland Revenue. For this reason, the bill contains provisions to remove student loans from the ambit of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act for both new and existing student loan borrowers. The retrospective nature of the changes also reflects the fact that the nature and form of student loans does not fit well with the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act, and that they will have their own, transparent protection under the new Student Loan Scheme Act. 20 To ensure that adequate consumer protections are maintained for borrowers, the bill: • specifies the amount of the Ministry of Social Development student loan establishment fee and the annual Inland Revenue administration fee (with any future changes to these amounts being made by regulations made under the new Student Loan Scheme Act; and • includes an obligation for the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue to make appropriate disclosures to borrowers. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 21 OVERRIDING THE CREDIT CONTRACTS AND CONSUMER FINANCE ACT Clause 214 and schedule 7 Issue: Retrospective legislation will undermine the purpose of the disclosure outlined in the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act Submission (Commerce Commission, National Council of Women of New Zealand, NZ Union of Students’ Associations) Disclosure under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act is required to: • enable a borrower to be able to distinguish between different credit arrangements; • enable borrowers to be informed on contract terms before they sign up; and • be able to monitor performance of the credit contract. Also changing the terms of the loan undermines: • the initial disclosure requirements to the loan; • the choices the borrower made in entering the contract; • students’ understanding of the rights and obligations under the loan contact; and • increases the chance of confusion amongst borrowers regarding their rights and obligations. Changing the consumer protections may undermine consumers’ confidence in the protections afforded by the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act and may undermine voluntary compliance with the Act if creditors think they can obtain a retrospective exemption if they find they have breached the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act. (Commerce Commission) Comment While student loan contracts made before 4 November 2010 are credit contracts in terms of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act, there are major differences between student loans and other credit contracts. These differences reflect the fact that student loans are a heavily subsidised form of Government financial assistance to students. For example: • Student loans are not secured. • Student loans are income-contingent (unless the borrower is overseas-based) and the loan may never be paid off if the borrower does not earn over the repayment threshold. 22 • The repayment obligations of the loan are contained in legislation and not the contract. • Student loans are interest-free for New Zealand-based borrowers so using an interest charging mechanism to recoup the costs of administering the loan is not an option for New Zealand-based borrowers. The Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act was enacted to protect consumers who enter into contracts where there is generally no other legislation present. However, student loan borrowers have the protections provided by an Act of Parliament through the Student Loan Scheme Act. The Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act provides for hardship relief if a borrower cannot meet his or her obligations under a contract. This is required because contracts usually have a fixed repayment amount, which can cause hardship for borrowers if their circumstances change. However, student loan repayments are income-based and repayments are responsive to fluctuations in income. Relief is also available in the bill for borrowers in cases of serious hardship. If the student loan continued to be subject to the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act the Government would be limited in the changes that could be made to the scheme because any changes could not be applied to existing contracts without the consent of the borrower. Seeking the agreement of all borrowers could be difficult as Inland Revenue is unable to contact some borrowers without incurring significant administration costs – for example, some overseas-based borrowers. Also, if all borrowers do not agree to the changes, different administrative treatments would be required for different groups of borrowers, making the scheme difficult and costly to administer. Furthermore, working within the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act to address student loan issues (by seeking limited exemptions each time issues arise) could lead to error and inconsistencies in that legislation over time. This could result in consumer confusion about the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act and creditor compliance with that Act. Although StudyLink and Inland Revenue disclose information to borrowers, officials have considered whether there should be greater requirements for disclosure. Accordingly, officials recommend that the following amendments be made to ensure the bill reflects the spirit and intent of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act: • that the loan manager be required to provide the borrower with a copy of the contract within six working days after the day on which the contract was entered into; • that Inland Revenue be required to disclose details of a loan balance to include: – the date and amount of any interest charged to the borrower, or any late payment interest or penalty imposed; – the date and amount of each fee charged to the borrower; and 23 – a requirement for StudyLink or Inland Revenue, as appropriate, to notify borrowers of unilateral changes to either the contract or statute that increases the borrower’s obligations if the borrowers updated address information is known. This notification must occur within seven months of the change being made. Recommendation That the submission be noted and the above changes recommended by officials be made to the bill. Issue: Prohibiting the charging of unreasonable credit fees Submission (Commerce Commission) The Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act provides protections against lenders charging unreasonable credit fees. The bill introduces an administration fee which can be changed by regulation and there is no requirement for fees charged under the bill to be reasonable. Borrowers do not have the right under the bill to challenge these fees. Comment The administration fee is based on the costs associated with collecting repayments. The proposed fee is not unreasonable. With regard to the removal of the protection for borrowers against the setting of unreasonable fees, in credit contracts the imposition of fees is imposed by the contract and the only protections available to the debtor, in the absence of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act, would be common law. However, under the Student Loan Scheme, the imposition of fees is prescribed in legislation, which can be changed by regulation or by Act of Parliament. The Government is ultimately accountable for imposing reasonable administration fees. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 Issue: Hardship rights Submission (Commerce Commission) The Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act provides protections to borrowers who are unable to meet their obligations under the credit contract due to unforeseen circumstances (including ending a relationship, illness, loss of employment or injury). To provide relief, the creditor may agree to change the terms of the contract by postponing payment or by extending the term of the loan. If the creditor does not agree with the debtor’s application, the debtor may apply to the courts for the terms of the contract to be varied. Although the bill does provide hardship provisions, they are at the discretion of the Commissioner. Comment The Student Loan Scheme differs significantly from other loans. The Student Loan Scheme is income-contingent and therefore borrowers do not have to repay their loan until they reach a certain income threshold. This feature reduces the extent to which borrowers get into financial hardship. Student loans do not have a fixed term. Some loans may never be paid off especially if the borrower has significant periods when they earn less than the repayment threshold. The bill provides relief for borrowers who face hardship by decreasing their repayment obligations (including reducing repayments to zero). Borrowers who are having difficulty meeting their repayment obligations can also apply to enter into an instalment arrangement for the repayment of debt. Officials consider these features provide sufficient protection to borrowers who find themselves in hardship. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 Issue: Prohibition against oppression Submission (Commerce Commission) Part 5 of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act provides protection if one of the parties has exercised or intends to exercise a right under the contract in an oppressive manner or uses oppressive means to get another party to enter the transaction. In contrast, the ability for the debtor (or borrower) to challenge the decisions of the Commissioner appears to be more limited than under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act. Comment For part 5 of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act to apply, the contract, lease or transaction must be oppressive or a party must have exercised a right or power under the contract in an oppressive manner. The repayment of student loan deductions is provided for by statute enacted by Parliament, which has the ability to change the Student Loan Scheme or its features if they are considered oppressive. There is also the judicial review process for the external review of a decision made by the Commissioner in order to safeguard individual interests against unreasonable administrative action taken without following proper procedures. The bill also provides rights to challenge a number of the Commissioner’s decisions on whether a borrower is New Zealand or overseas-based, whether the Commissioner’s decision regarding any relief is fair and reasonable, and the Commissioner’s determination regarding whether a significant over-deduction was made. Officials consider that there is adequate protection against the Government exercising a right in an oppressive manner or using oppressive means to get people to enter into a student loan. Recommendation That the submission be declined 26 Issue: Cancellation rights Submission (Commerce Commission) Debtors have the ability to cancel a contract within three days of being given notification. A debtor has to be formally notified of the contract terms within five days of the contract being made. This protection would be removed as a result of the amendment in the bill to exclude the Student Loan Scheme from being subject to the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act. Comment Currently applicants can cancel their student loan contract within seven working days after the date that the Loan Entitlement Advice letter was sent to them. This is consistent with the provisions in the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act. Officials agree that the right to cancel the contract within a defined period should be included in the bill so that applicants continue to receive that protection under the law. This would include the provision that if an applicant receives any loan advances within that period they must repay those advances (together with any interest) within that period. Officials recommend that this process be incorporated into the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 27 28 EXCESS REPAYMENT BONUS Clauses 115 to 121 Submission (NZ Union of Students’ Associations) The submitter has queried the impact on the excess repayment bonus in moving to a pay-period basis of assessment for salary and wage earners. Comment Borrowers who want their employer to deduct additional repayment deductions from their salary or wages can continue to do so. So that these amounts can be identified as qualifying for the bonus, the employer will apply a new tax code – a student loan additional deduction rate code, to these repayments. Borrowers who have a significant over-deduction of their repayment obligations will be able to receive a refund of this amount or apply it to the loan balance and thereby qualify for the excess repayment bonus. Minor over-deductions will not qualify for the bonus. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Other issues raised in submissions 29 30 REQUIRING BORROWERS TO PAY A DEPOSIT FOR EACH STUDENT LOAN APPLICATION Submission (Lucy Thomson-Ryan) Borrowers should be required to pay a deposit for each student loan application (based on a percentage of the application) similar to that for a home loan. Requiring a deposit would make borrowers aware of the value of the loan, how the money world works and curb their financial spending. This proposal would also reduce the financial burden on New Zealand. Comment The submission is beyond the scope of the bill. The recommendations made relate to student loan eligibility and are not within the ambit of the changes proposed in the bill which are to improve Inland Revenue’s processes for collecting student loan repayments. Furthermore, there is a risk that any requirement for an upfront payment may pose a financial barrier to people accessing tertiary education. This would be contrary to the objectives of the Student Loan Scheme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 31 LIFETIME LIMIT ON ACCESSING STUDENT LOAN FUNDING Submission (Nathan James Ngatai) The submitter refers to two Budget 2010 initiatives – the student loan 7 equivalent full-time study 2 life-time limit and the performance test. The submitter supports interest-free loans for borrowers who remain in New Zealand and the student loan performance test. The student loan life-time limit is also supported but the submitter suggests that some accommodation be made for life-long learning. Comment The submission is beyond the scope of the bill. The student loan performance test and life-time limit were part of Budget 2010 changes and were introduced on 1 January 2011. Legislation was not required as all decisions on entitlement and eligibility criteria for a student loan are made by Cabinet and incorporated into the student loan contract. Recommendation That the submission be declined 2 A student taking a normal year’s full-time study generates an “equivalent full-time student” unit. 32 FURTHER ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS Submission (National Council of Women of New Zealand) The Government should investigate the feasibility of implementing a universal basic income, providing students with a living allowance during study periods. These changes would mean that no one would need to borrow to get an education and it would be an investment in the future. Comment The submission is beyond the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 33 34 Matters raised by officials 35 36 ABILITY FOR COMMISSIONER TO RECALL THE LOAN Submission (Matter raised by officials) Supplementary Order Paper No. 200 was released by the Minister of Revenue on 14 December. The Supplementary Order Paper enables the Commissioner to exercise rights in the loan contract to recall the loan in circumstances such as the borrower not complying with an obligation for two years. Changes included in the Supplementary Order Paper should be included in the bill at the time the bill is reported back. Comment No submissions were received on the Supplementary Order Paper. Currently the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is only able to collect outstanding repayments. While this is sufficient for the majority of borrowers, there is a small minority who do not comply and for whom the recalling of the whole loan together with any outstanding interest and penalties is appropriate. Although the ability to recall the loan is available in the student loan contract, the person able to exercise this power has changed from year to year as the definition of “lender” in the contract has changed. This can lead to administrative costs in determining which organisation has the right to exercise the recall power and in relation to which part of the consolidated loan balance. Any error can be challenged by the borrower. As the most appropriate person to exercise the power to recall the loan is the Commissioner, the Supplementary Order Paper proposes that a legislative change be made to provide for this. Officials recommend that the Supplementary Order Paper No. 200 be incorporated in the reported-back version of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 37 INFORMATION TO BE PASSED FROM THE LOAN MANAGER (STUDYLINK) TO INLAND REVENUE Clause 11(2)(a) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Information transferred from StudyLink to Inland Revenue to assist with the administration and collection of student loans does not currently include borrowers’ phone numbers or the date that StudyLink advised the borrower of their loan via a loan entitlement advice letter. Changes should be made to give effect to these omissions. Comment Providing borrower phone numbers will help Inland Revenue to contact borrowers about their student loan and in the collection of outstanding repayments. Information on the date that StudyLink provided the loan entitlement advice letter is required to set up the borrower’s account with Inland Revenue and for the building of system checks to ensure loan advances cannot be made earlier than the date that StudyLink provided the loan entitlement advice. Officials recommend that the bill be amended to require this information to be transferred from StudyLink to Inland Revenue. These changes would apply from 1 January 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 38 NEAR REAL-TIME TRANSFER OF LOAN ADVANCES Clauses 9 to 15, 160 and 164 Submission (Matter raised by officials) When the bill was introduced, officials were still working through how the real-time transfer of loan advances from StudyLink to Inland Revenue would be administered. Now this transfer process has been finalised, officials propose a number of amendments to the bill to give effect to the details of this transfer process. Comment Loan advances will be transferred to Inland Revenue in a near real-time basis. This will enable the borrower to have a consolidated view of their loan balance. The changes to the process are as follows: • Inland Revenue, rather than StudyLink, will provide a statement to borrowers advising loan advances made for the period covered by the statement. • The statement will be provided to borrowers at least twice a year. The period for objecting to a loan advance will still be 31 days from the date of the statement, even though Inland Revenue has issued the statement. All objections to any loan advance made will still be dealt with by StudyLink. Officials propose that changes be made to clauses 9 to 15, 160 and 164 to provide near real-time transfer of loan advances, for Inland Revenue to issue statements, and for the objection period to be 31 days from the date the statement was issued. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 39 INTERIM AND REMAINING REPAYMENTS Clauses 76 and 88 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have identified a number of problems with the way interim and remaining payments are calculated and how interest is imposed on these payments. The proposed amendments address these issues as follows: • The provisions that deal with the calculation of interim payments (clauses 76 and 88) should provide for the interim payment amounts to be updated following the end-of-year assessment of the actual repayment obligation for the year. The provisions also need to reflect the original policy intent that the repayments apply in a similar manner to provisional tax payments. • When a borrower repays their loan during the year, the interim repayments payable during the year are limited to the outstanding loan balance at the start of the year to avoid the borrower overpaying, or a later date, to take account of loan advances drawn down during the year. The bill does not reflect this outcome and should be amended accordingly. • A new provision is required in the bill to ensure that interim payments are not required for a tax year when a borrower’s repayment obligations from either pre-taxed or other income are less than $1,000. This will reduce compliance costs for borrowers with small amounts of repayment obligations and reflects the original policy intent. • Amendments are required to provide that late payment interest can only be charged on interim repayments or remaining repayments once the Commissioner has determined the borrower’s repayment obligation for the year. Also, interest on interim or remaining repayments will only arise if the amount paid is less than the actual repayment obligation determined at the end of the year. These changes will ensure that borrowers who underpay their interim repayments are not penalised if at the end of the year it turns out that they have a lower or no repayment liability for the year. • When a borrower either estimates their repayment obligation for the year or when their pre-taxed or other income repayment obligation is $16,000 or more, they are required to take greater care in quantifying their interim repayments so they do not pay less than their end-of-year liability. This is due to the amount of revenue involved or the opportunity for abuse by these borrowers. In these situations the remaining repayments are due on the same date as the interim payments were due, and replace those interim payments. Changes are proposed to ensure that borrowers will only be subject to interest on remaining repayments not the interim payments which they have replaced. 40 These changes reflect the original policy intent to more closely align the treatment of interim and remaining repayments with provisional tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 MINOR TECHNICAL ISSUES The following matters are proposed by officials to deal with minor drafting issues. Issue: Definition of “other income” Clause 4 Submission Two problems have been identified with the definition of “other income” in clause 4 of the bill. They are: • The definition of “other income” applies only to borrowers who file returns or notify the Commissioner of their worldwide income. However, the intent was that the definition of “other income” would also apply to borrowers who are required to file returns or required to notify the Commissioner of their worldwide income under the bill but fail to do so. • A further change is required to the definition of “other income” in clause 4 to remove the reference to the term “annual gross income” and replace it with the term “net income”. Not all references in the bill to the term “annual gross income” were correct and were previously changed to refer to net income. However, this change was omitted. Recommendation That the definition of “other income” be amended accordingly. Issue: Definition of “pre-taxed income” Clause 4 Submission The definition of “pre-taxed income” in clause 4 should be changed to remove paragraph (d) which refers to personal services rehabilitation payments. These payments are made by ACC to attendant carers of disabled persons. These payments do not need to be included in the definition of “pre-taxed income” as attendant carers are required to file a return, and are treated as other income earners once their income goes over $14,000 a year. Recommendation The definition of “pre-taxed income” be amended accordingly. 42 Issue: Commissioner cancelling a special deduction rate Clause 42 Submission When a borrower has two jobs and their income from their main job is under the repayment threshold, the Commissioner can issue a special deduction rate to the borrower for their second job to take account of the unused repayment threshold on their main job. Clause 42 of the bill requires the employer to continue to apply the special deduction rate until the Commissioner notifies the employer otherwise. There is no requirement for the Commissioner to notify the employer in writing. A special deduction rate can also be issued if the borrower is in hardship or if they derive other income or has a loss for the tax year. In these instances, if the Commissioner cancels the special deduction rate, he must notify the employer in writing. To correct this legislative oversight, officials propose that clause 42 be amended to require the Commissioner to provide notification to the employer in writing. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date of clause 57 Clause 57 Submission Clause 57 requires the Commissioner to inform borrowers of the significant over- deduction threshold before the commencement of the income year. However, as a result of a legislative oversight, this clause does not come into force until 1 April 2012 and therefore borrowers will not be able to be informed of the threshold in the first year. Officials propose the bill be amended so that clause 57 applies from the date of assent to enable Inland Revenue to advise borrowers before 1 April 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 43 Issue: Definition of “annual gross income” in clauses 4 and 106 Clauses 4 and 106 Submission As currently drafted, the references to “annual gross income” in clause 106 would impose a greater liability on non-tax resident New Zealand-based borrowers than they would face as a tax-resident New Zealand-based borrower by imposing repayment obligations on their gross income instead of their net income (after expenses). To address this, officials propose that a number of minor changes be made to clauses 4 and 106 to ensure that non-tax resident New Zealand-based borrowers’ repayment obligations are based on their net income (after expenses) as occurs for tax-resident New Zealand-based borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Assessing overseas-based borrowers Clause 101(1) Submission The bill provides that Inland Revenue assesses the borrower’s overseas-based repayment obligation as soon as practical after being notified by the borrower that they intend to be overseas-based or as soon as Inland Revenue becomes aware that the borrower is overseas-based. Officials now consider that changing a borrower’s status at the point they go overseas and prior to meeting the overseas-based criteria of being absent for a continuous period of 184 or more days, is problematic. The borrower will be liable for repayment obligations when they could in fact return to New Zealand within the 184-day period and these obligations would need to be reversed. Additionally, these borrowers would have an overseas-based repayment obligation assessed, but would not be subject to interest until they met the 184-day period. Instead officials propose that clause 101(1) be amended so that Inland Revenue will only assess the borrower’s overseas-based repayment obligations when it is aware that the person has fulfilled the overseas-based criteria. This will reduce compliance costs for borrowers. 44 A further change is required to remove the requirement to include overseas-based interest on repayment obligations payable by overseas-based borrowers in their final year. Currently, borrowers’ repayment obligations for the year are limited to the loan balance on 31 March of the previous year. As a result, they pay off what they have been advised to pay for the year but due to the interest charged for the year this leaves a small amount owing, which leads to a repayment obligation in the following year. Previously, officials recommended that interest be included in the repayment obligations payable during the year. However, this method is not accurate in all cases and can lead to overpayments if the loan is paid off part-way through the year. To reduce the extent to which over- or underpayments occur, officials now consider that including interest in the calculation for the repayment obligation adds increased complexity and instead recommend that the overseas-based interest not be included in the calculation of repayment obligations for the final year as currently occurs under the Student Loan Scheme Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ability to change the repayment obligations and thresholds of overseas-based borrowers by Order in Council Clause 102 Submission There is inconsistent treatment between the method used to set the repayment amounts and thresholds for overseas-based borrowers and New Zealand-based borrowers. The legislation should be consistent for both groups of borrowers. Comment New Zealand-based borrowers’ repayment threshold (currently $19,084) and the repayment percentage (currently 10 percent) can be changed by regulation. However, the repayment amounts and repayment thresholds for overseas-based borrowers can only be changed by legislation. To ensure the legislation is consistent between the process for setting repayment amounts and thresholds between New Zealand-based and overseas-based borrowers, officials propose an amendment to enable the repayment amounts and repayment thresholds that apply to overseas-based borrowers to be changed by way of regulation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 45 Issue: Reflecting the excess repayment bonus and administration fee in overseas-based borrower’s repayment obligations Clauses 102(5) and 203(2)(a) Submission An overseas-based borrower’s repayment obligation for a year is based on the loan balance at the previous 31 st of March. However the legislation is unclear on whether the loan balance at 31 March is adjusted for any excess repayment bonus credited or any administration fee charged. To ensure the loan balance reflects the imposition of any administration fee charged or the crediting of any excess repayment bonus, officials recommend that the provisions in the bill that deal with an overseas-based borrower repayment obligation be amended to take account of these two transactions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Commissioner refraining from collecting small amounts of remaining repayments Clause 136 Submission The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 enables Inland Revenue to refrain from collecting small amounts of repayment obligations, including terminal repayments (now referred to as “remaining repayments” in the bill). This provision has been retained in the bill but an oversight has resulted in the reference to remaining repayments being omitted from the list of repayment obligations which Inland Revenue can refrain from collecting. Officials propose that clause 136 be amended so Inland Revenue does not have to collect total remaining repayments for a tax year that are less than $20. Clause 136 also provides a threshold below which small amounts are not collected. This threshold is meant to refer to amounts less than $20, which is consistent with other provisions in the bill. However, the current wording incorrectly refers to small amounts of $20 or less to be written off. Officials propose that clause 136(1) be amended to correctly refer to amounts of less than $20. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 46 Issue: Commissioner may grant relief Clause 138(3) Submission If a borrower is unable to pay any late payment interest charged, they can apply to have the interest cancelled. When the interest is cancelled, any action that occurred as a result of imposing the interest is reversed. However, as a result of cancelling the interest charged, if the borrower has excess repayments over and above their liability, the bill incorrectly provides for the amount to be refunded. This is not in keeping with the rest of the bill, which requires the excess to be first offset against late payment interest and then any unpaid amount. Any remaining amount is either credited to overseas-based interest and the loan balance, or refunded. Officials therefore propose that clause 138(3) should be amended to provide for any relief from late payment interest granted to be used to reduce late payment interest, then against any unpaid amount. Any excess should be either applied to overseas- based interest, then the loan balance or be refunded. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: 30-day grace period to pay outstanding amounts Clause 190 Submission Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, interest is calculated and charged daily on the amount outstanding. To provide some certainty to borrowers when making a payment, borrowers have 30 days from when a notice is issued to pay the amount outstanding in full, and any daily interest that has accrued between the date of notification and the date of final payment will be written-off. The bill changes the way that interest is charged. In future, interest will be calculated daily, charged monthly (at the end of the month) and compounded annually. This change provides certainty to borrowers of the amount owed and how long they have to pay the outstanding amount before interest is charged. For example, if interest is charged on the 30 th of the month, on the 20 th the borrower will have 10 days to pay before the next interest is charged. Once interest is charged on the 30 th , the borrower will have another month before the next interest is charged. 47 A legislative oversight has meant that the 30-day grace period provided in the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 has been retained in the bill. If the provision is retained in addition to the changes made to charge interest monthly, the grace period would be up to 60 days from the date of the notice being issued. This was not the intended outcome. Officials therefore propose that clause 190, which provides the 30-day grace period, should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Provisions of the Tax Administration Act and Income Tax Act that apply to this bill Clause 196 Submission Four amendments should be made to clause 196, which deals with provisions in the Tax Acts that apply to the Student Loan Scheme Bill. The first is to remove the reference to “Returns and assessments” from the title of the clause. This clause refers to a number of provisions in the Income Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act, not just to returns and assessment provisions, so these words should be removed from the clause title. The second amendment proposed by officials is to insert a new paragraph to ensure that the return provisions of the Income Tax Act and Tax Administration Acts apply to a declaration of pre-taxed income or a notification of worldwide income under the bill. This link was overlooked in drafting the bill. The third proposed change relates to paragraph (a) of clause 196. The Income Tax Act provisions that apply to the bill refer to both “taxpayer” and a “person”. However, this clause only refers to a “taxpayer” when cross-referencing the Income Tax Act. Officials propose this clause be amended to refer to both “taxpayers” and “persons”. Finally, three cross-references to the Income Tax Act should be included in the bill. The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Act limits the period when a borrower can apply for a refund. Currently, borrowers have up to eight years to have a repayment obligation reassessed if it will result in a refund. This provision was inadvertently omitted from the bill. Officials therefore propose that clause 196 be amended to refer to the relevant refund limitation provisions of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 48 Issue: Electronic communication Clauses 204 and 205 Submission Clauses 204 and 205 of the bill provide for the borrower and Inland Revenue to communicate with each other by electronic means, and also to override the requirements in the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 to seek the borrower’s consent before communicating with them electronically. There are two section references to the Electronic Transactions Act that have been omitted from clauses 204 and 205 of the bill. The references are to section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which refers to the responsibility of Ministers and officials to protect the integrity of the tax system, and section 20 of the same Act which deals with seeking a person’s consent before communicating with them electronically. Recommendation Officials recommend that clauses 204 and 205 be amended accordingly. Issue: Requirement to receive a personal tax summary Schedule 8 Submission With student loan deductions being finalised on a pay-period basis and the removal of the end-of-year square-up, the requirement in the Tax Administration Act for borrowers to receive a personal tax summary is no longer required. Accordingly, it is therefore proposed that section 33A(1)(g) of the Tax Administration Act be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 Issue: Extension of time to make a declaration of pre-taxed income Clause 68 Submission The bill enables a borrower to apply to the Commissioner for an extension of time to file a pre-taxed income declaration. The due date for the declaration is the extended timeframe to file. However, the bill does not provide a due date for an extension of time to file a declaration without the borrower having applied for one. Officials propose that when an extension of time to file a pre-taxed declaration is provided by the Commissioner without the borrower applying for it, the due date should be the extended timeframe for the declaration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rounding of payments when instalments are not divisible into equal amounts Submission The provisions in the bill that calculate remaining repayments for a borrower’s pre-tax repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation and instalments of overseas-based repayment obligations do not provide for when these payments cannot be divided into equal amounts. When this situation occurs for provisional tax, the final payment carries the difference. Officials propose that a similar provision be included in the bill and apply to interim payments, remaining repayments, and instalments of overseas-based repayment obligations that are not divisible into equal instalments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 Issue: Charging the administration fee Clause 181 and schedule 7 Submission The policy intent is that the administration fee is to be imposed on the closing balance of the account on 31 March, to enable payments and any interest charged to be taken into account. However, the administrative impact of this is that the administration fee will be imposed based on the loan balance at the close of the business day on 31 March and charged with an effective date of 1 April. The administration fee will be shown in Inland Revenue statements and the website as having been imposed on 1 April. The bill will need to be amended to reflect this administrative process. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Provisions which restrict refunds of voluntary payments made before 2006 Submission Sections 57A and 57D of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 have been inadvertently omitted from the bill. These provisions prevented borrowers from receiving interest write-offs on refunds for the 2005 and 2006 tax years as a result of the removal of interest on New Zealand-based borrowers. Officials propose that this policy is not carried forward into the bill as it would be difficult to implement for what would only be a two-year application period and affect a minimal number of borrowers. Instead, officials propose that a change be made to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and to the bill to restrict the refunding of repayments made during the 2005 and 2006 years to prevent future refunds that will be subject to the current policy. This provision will only be required for the 2012 and 2013 tax years as the statute bar will apply after this period to reassessments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 51 Issue: Small amounts of unpaid and uncollected repayment obligations Schedule 6, clause 6 Submission Under the Student Loan Scheme Act, amounts under $334 for each tax year which were not paid, were treated as unpaid debts but no late payment penalties were imposed. To transition these amounts into the structure of the current bill, these amounts should be added back to the loan balance, rather than treating them as unpaid amounts (with no interest imposed). If the borrower is New Zealand-based, no interest should be imposed on these amounts. If a borrower is overseas-based, the amounts added back to the loan balance should be subject to interest. This treatment will reduce Inland Revenue’s administration costs and be easier for borrowers to understand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Care and management Clause 215 and schedule 8 Submission When introduced, the care and management provisions in the Tax Administration Act were meant to have a wide application to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. However, the current application of the care and management provisions to the Student Loan Scheme Bill relies on finely balanced arguments around what is considered to be a “repayment obligation”. This creates an unintended risk that the Commissioner’s decisions may be challenged in the future. To address this, officials propose that a consequential amendment be made to the Tax Administration Act to clarify what is meant by repayment obligations for student loan purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 52 53 Issue: Cross-references and other minor issues Submission A number of cross-references in the bill either need updating or have been omitted, and minor wording changes are needed to ensure consistency throughout the bill and to give effect to the original intent. These changes will not change the policy intent and officials propose that these changes be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
Student Loan Scheme Bill Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on submissions on the Bill Supplementary Paper Deferring the application of some parts of the bill Excess repayment bonus Transitional rules for interim payments Threshold below which no penalties for late payment are imposed Additional deduction rate May 2011 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue CONTENTS Overview 1 Deferring the application of some parts of the bill and further simplifications 3 Issue: Late payment interest and overseas-based interest 3 Issue: Changes to the payment priority rules and period-based debt 4 Issue: $20 small balance write-off at time of assessment 5 Issue: Instalment arrangements 6 Issue: Minor changes as a result of deferring the application of the payment and assessment provisions 7 Issue: Consequential changes to other provisions as a result of the deferment of interest, penalties and payment priority rules 8 Issue: Confirming whether information provided by StudyLink is correct 8 Issue: Period within which a borrower can claim a refund 9 Issue: Administering the pay-period threshold 10 Excess repayment bonus 11 Transitional rule for interim payments 13 Threshold below which no penalties for late payment are imposed 14 Additional deduction rate 15 OVERVIEW This report outlines the changes to the bill that have resulted from Inland Revenue changing its approach to implementing the student loan reforms and supplements information provided in the officials’ report of 29 April 2011. Implementation of the policy and administrative reform package for student loans through a new loan management system has proved more complicated than expected. The complexity is due to extracting and transferring historical student loan data from Inland Revenue’s FIRST computer system to the new loan management system, and the integration of the new loan management system with the FIRST system. A high- level review of the project has indicated that attempting to complete the full project by April 2012 in the new system is unachievable. As a result, the legislative changes will now be implemented within the existing FIRST system. Some parts of the bill will need to be deferred until 1 April 2013 to enable the main policy components of the reforms to take effect from 1 April 2012. The main system changes that need to be deferred until 1 April 2013 are: • the new interest and penalty rules. However, a reduced late payment penalty rate will continue to apply from 1 April 2012; • payment priority changes; and • changes from a period-based debt approach (such as that used for tax with a tax year and taxable periods) to a whole-of-debt approach (similar to a mortgage). These changes require the bill to be amended to continue the current mechanisms for the imposition of interest and late payment penalties, the priority of how payments are allocated to meet borrower repayment obligations, and retaining a period-based accounting for debt for the 2012–13 tax year. The changes are outlined further in this supplementary report. 1 2 DEFERRING THE APPLICATION OF SOME PARTS OF THE BILL AND FURTHER SIMPLIFICATIONS Issue: Late payment interest and overseas-based interest Clauses 125, 126, 129, 130 and 131 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Changes are required to the way Inland Revenue charges and compounds interest on loan balances and penalties for late payment as a result of the student loan reforms now being implemented in the FIRST system and to ensure the major policy changes can be implemented by 1 April 2012. The changes relate to: • the way interest is imposed on borrowers; • the way interest and penalties for late payment are calculated, charged and compounded in the bill; and • the need to continue the current interest and penalty regime for the 2012–13 tax year while reducing the current late payment penalty rate that will apply. The first change is to the way interest is imposed on borrowers. Currently, interest is imposed on the loan balances of all borrowers. Inland Revenue then writes off the interest for New Zealand-based borrowers. This system will continue for the 2012–13 tax year. However, the bill currently provides that interest on loan balances only be imposed on those borrowers who are subject to interest, namely overseas-based borrowers. This process will reduce administrative costs and is easier for borrowers to understand. Although this change can be implemented in the FIRST system, it cannot be implemented until 1 April 2013. Officials therefore recommend that the bill be amended so that the changes to require interest to be imposed only on overseas-based borrowers apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. The second change is to the way interest on loan balances and penalties for late payment are calculated, charged and compounded. Currently, interest is calculated daily and charged and compounded annually whereas the late payment penalty is calculated, charged and compounded monthly. 3 The bill currently changes the calculation and charging method for interest and penalties for late payment. The bill proposes that both interest and penalties for late payment will be calculated daily, charged monthly, and compounded annually. This was based on how officials expected a loan management package would impose interest. However, as the reforms will now be implemented in the FIRST system, officials recommend that interest and penalties for late payment be calculated daily, and charged and compounded monthly. To enable other parts of the reforms to be implemented on time, officials recommend that this proposed change will need to be delayed and apply from 1 April 2013. For the 2012–13 tax year, the current practice of calculating, charging and compounding interest and penalties would remain. Finally, one of the consequences of continuing the current late payment penalty rules for the 2012–13 tax year is that the current late payment penalty rate of 1.5%, compounding monthly (equivalent to 19.56% per annum) would apply. However, the bill proposed to reduce this rate to an annual penalty of 10.6% with effect from 1 April 2012. To enable borrowers to take advantage of the lower penalty rate proposed in the bill while retaining the current late payment penalty regime, officials recommend that the late payment penalty applying to the 2012–13 tax year be reduced from 1.5% per month to 0.843% per month. This equates to an annual equivalent rate of 10.6%. These changes will not adversely affect borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Changes to the payment priority rules and period-based debt Clauses 4 (definition of unpaid amount), 129(1), 136, 187, 188 and 189 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill introduces changes to the payment priority rules for student loans in order to take a whole-of-debt approach, rather than the period-based approach used for tax. It allocates payments to current obligations first and then any remainder to repay debt. To implement the student loan reforms in the FIRST computer system, changes are required to two aspects to the payment priority rules in the bill. The first is how payments are allocated to both current period obligations and debt. The second is determining whether a period-based approach is taken (such as used for tax, using a tax year and taxable periods) or a whole-of-loan approach (similar to a mortgage) is taken to debt. The changes proposed to these two aspects of the payment priority rules are outlined below. 4 Currently, the bill allocates payments first to meet current repayment obligations. Once these are satisfied, any remainder goes to reduce any outstanding debt. Officials consider that the payment allocation method needs to be modified so the changes can be implemented in the FIRST systems. Officials therefore recommend that the existing practice mainly continue whereby payments first go to repay outstanding debt and any remainder is applied to the borrower’s current repayment obligations. This treatment will reduce the borrower’s exposure to late payment interest. However, if a borrower has entered into an instalment arrangement for the repayment of outstanding amounts, payments (other than instalments payments) would be allocated first to meet current liabilities and any remainder goes to reduce outstanding debt. This treatment ensures that the borrower fulfils one of the requirements of their instalment arrangement, of keeping up-to-date with current liabilities. The bill currently provides for a whole-of-loan approach to be taken to debt. This approach would be more in keeping with the way a mortgage operates. Although this approach could be implemented in the FIRST computer system, it cannot be done in time for 1 April 2012. Officials therefore recommend that this change apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. For the 2012–13 tax year, the current period-based approach to debt (such as that used for tax, with tax years and taxable periods) continue to apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: $20 small balance write-off at time of assessment Clause 191 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill and the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 currently provide for the $20 small balance write-off to occur at 31 March. However this requires the loan account to remain open until 31 March, when the consolidated loan balance is reduced to less than $20 before that date. The borrower should not have to wait until the end of the year for this to occur and for the loan to be closed. This inconveniences both the borrower (in receiving statements) and Inland Revenue (in keeping the loan account open). To finalise loan accounts on a more timely basis, officials recommend that the Commissioner has discretion to write off small amounts when the loan balance goes below $20, enabling the loan to be closed part-way through the year. Officials propose that these changes apply with effect from 1 April 2013. 5 This will provide certainty to the borrower and reduce compliance costs. The bill allows the Commissioner to reduce the consolidated loan balance to zero if a borrower dies or the Commissioner has reason to believe that the borrower has died. However, there is no date in the legislation on when this has to occur. Officials propose that clauses 191(a) and (b) be amended to ensure that the loan balance is reduced to zero on the date of death or the date the Commissioner considers the borrower died. These changes will need to come into force on 1 April 2013 as the current payment processing within the FIRST computer system will be retained for a further year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Instalment arrangements Clauses 130, 146 and 147 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Currently, a borrower who enters into an instalment arrangement for the repayment of student loan debt must make all the instalment payments on time before they get the benefit of a late payment penalty remission. This process differs from the way instalment arrangements work for other tax debts. The bill currently changes the instalment arrangement process to reflect the features of a loan management package. The main change was to cease the instalment arrangement if the borrower failed to pay any two instalments by the due date. With the decision to implement the student loan reforms in the FIRST system, officials now consider that amalgamating the student loan instalment arrangements with those that apply to other tax debts would simplify the process for both borrowers and Inland Revenue. Officials therefore recommend that the bill be amended to remove the requirement to cease instalments if the borrower fails to make two payments over the course of the arrangement. Instead, the process will rely on imposing the higher late payment interest rate on the total amount outstanding for the months when the arrangement is not met. The proposed change would need to be deferred a year and apply from 1 April 2013 due to the deferral of the interest changes. For the 2012–13 tax year, the current student loan instalment arrangement process will continue to apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 6 Issue: Minor changes as a result of deferring the application of the payment and assessment provisions Clauses 46, 47, 89 and schedules 3 and 4 Submission (Matter raised by officials) As the current payment and assessment provisions will have to be retained for another year, the following two areas also need to be deferred. 6-monthly interim payments The bill aligns a borrower’s student loan interim payments with provisional tax payments. For borrowers who pay provisional tax and GST, 6-monthly student loan payments will also be payable 6-monthly. With the deferral of the application of the payment and assessment provisions in the bill until 1 April 2013, the proposal to make 6-monthly interim payments must also be deferred. Instead, the current three student loan payment dates will continue for the 2012–13 tax year. Special assessments The bill provides that the Commissioner may issue an assessment of salary and wages deductions that should have been made. This provides another mechanism for collecting significant under-deductions. With the deferral of the application of the payment, assessment, and interest and penalties, the special assessment provisions also need to be deferred until 1 April 2013. Officials recommend that the application of the provisions dealing with 6-monthly interim repayments and the issuing of special assessments be deferred until 1 April 2013. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 7 Issue: Consequential changes to other provisions as a result of the deferment of interest, penalties and payment priority rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) A number of other provisions require the application to be deferred as a result of the deferral of the overseas-based interest and late payment interest provisions in the bill. For example, relief from the late payment penalty and the removal of the 30-day grace period. A number of transitional provisions also need to be added to the bill as a result of the deferred application date for some provisions. These transitional changes fall into two types. • the continuation of certain sections of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 for another year until 31 March 2013; and • the changes to enable the sections of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 to operate within the framework of the bill. These changes will be identified as part of drafting the revised version of the bill. Officials recommend that the Committee authorise these consequential and transitional changes to the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Confirming whether information provided by StudyLink is correct Clauses 9 and 10 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill enables the transfer of an applicant’s name, date of birth and IRD number from StudyLink to Inland Revenue in order to confirm that this information matches the information held by Inland Revenue. However, when the information transferred does not match with the information that Inland Revenue holds, the only message that can be advised to StudyLink is that the match failed. This results in StudyLink having to go back to the borrower and find out where the error has occurred. This imposes compliance costs on borrowers and administration costs on StudyLink. 8 To reduce these costs officials recommend that the bill be amended to enable Inland Revenue to confirm to StudyLink the fields in which an error has occurred – for example, the match failed because the date of birth is wrong. It would be impractical not to identify what part of the data was in error as it would lead to delays and increased costs for agencies and the borrower. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted and confirms that there are no significant privacy implications with the proposed amendment. Officials propose this measure apply from 1 January 2012 onwards. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Period within which a borrower can claim a refund Clauses 61(3) and (4), 123(2) and (3) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The period within which a borrower can elect to receive a refund varies depending on the residence status of the borrower – two months for overseas-based borrowers and six months for New Zealand-based borrowers. However, to administer the refund time-period effectively when a borrower changes their residence status part-way through the time period, Inland Revenue has generally provided borrowers with a six- month time-period. Officials recommend that the bill be amended to legislate for this practice and align the time-periods for all borrowers to six months, and that the amendment applies from 1 April 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 9 Issue: Administering the pay-period threshold Clause 57 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 57 of the bill provides that a borrower’s repayment obligation on salary or wage income is satisfied by the student loan deductions made from that income each pay-period. In determining whether a borrower’s repayment obligation has been satisfied, the bill requires the Commissioner to determine what is a significant over- or under-deduction for the purposes of administering the pay-period basis of assessment for salary and wage payments. When an over- or under-payment occurs and the amount exceeds the threshold, the Commissioner applies the over-payment to the loan balance and makes it available for refund or collects the under-payment through increased deductions from future salary and wage payments. If an over- or under-payment does not exceed the thresholds, no action is taken. As currently drafted in the bill, the Commissioner determines the pay-period threshold for over- or under-payments for the year. However, as only monthly information (from the Employer Monthly Schedule) is readily available to the Commissioner, and to avoid imposing more compliance costs on employers, it is proposed that the significant over- or under-deduction threshold be set based on this monthly information. If the monthly information indicates that a significant over- or under- deduction has occurred, and the Commissioner considers more information is needed, this information can be requested from the employer or the employee to determine whether an over- or under-deduction has occurred. To allow this process to occur, officials recommend that the bill be amended to enable the Commissioner to take account of other relevant information available (including Employer Monthly Schedule information) in setting the significant over- or under- deduction threshold. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 EXCESS REPAYMENT BONUS Clause 118(2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The excess repayment bonus is currently credited on 1 April, following the date the excess repayment was made. However, this may not be appropriate in all cases – for example, if the loan is repaid part-way through the year or the borrower dies or becomes bankrupt. Officials therefore recommend that the bill be amended to enable the bonus to be credited during the year in these circumstances. Amendments are also required to clearly define a borrower’s repayment obligation for calculating a finalising bonus when the loan is repaid during the year. Officials have earlier recommended that when a borrower dies or becomes bankrupt, the Commissioner should be given the discretion to apply the excess repayment bonus on a date other than 1 April. In the case of the death of a borrower, the excess repayment bonus would be credited on the date of death, or if the person is missing and presumed dead, on the date that the Commissioner reasonably believes the person to be dead. In the case of a bankrupt borrower, the excess repayment bonus should be credited on the date the borrower becomes bankrupt, which will enable the loan to be finalised following the crediting of any bonus. The discretion to apply the bonus at a date other than 1 April should apply from the date of assent of the bill. The second change recommended relates to which compulsory repayments should be taken into account in calculating the bonus if the loan is finalised part-way through the year. Officials recommend that only compulsory repayments that are due on or before the date the loan is paid off should be included in the excess repayment bonus calculation. The final change recommended relates to the adjustment once the finalising bonus has been applied to the loan. If the loan has been repaid and the finalising bonus applied for that year, any subsequent assessments or reassessments, or other information becoming available should not affect the finalising bonus. This will provide certainty for borrowers that their loan will not be reopened. However, to protect the revenue, there are two exceptions. The first is that the bonus calculation would be reopened if the borrower has purposefully withheld information or if fraud is involved. The second is when a loan is paid off part-way through the year but a borrower has a drawdown during the year, or when the Commissioner considers there is a risk that the borrower may have a drawdown before the end of the year. Officials recommend that the calculation of the bonus, and the closing of the loan account, be delayed until the end of the year. 11 These changes will provide certainty to borrowers and reduce compliance costs. However, if at the end of the year the borrower has a reduced repayment obligation, they could notify the Commissioner and have their repayment obligation and bonus recalculated, based on their actual repayments due before the final payment or on an annual basis. Officials recommend that these amendments be made to the bill and apply with effect from 1 April 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 TRANSITIONAL RULE FOR INTERIM PAYMENTS New clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) Borrowers with other income or pre-taxed income (for example, interest and dividends) are required to make interim payments during the year if their repayment obligation for the previous year is $1,000 or more. However, in the 2012–13 tax year the borrower’s previous year’s student loan repayment obligation will have been determined under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, using different terminology. For example, the current Act refers to “residual repayment obligations” rather than “other income repayment obligations” in the bill. To allow a smooth transition for borrowers from the 1992 Act to the bill, officials recommend that for the 2012–13 tax year, the bill be amended to provide that borrowers be required to make interim repayments if they meet the qualifying criteria under the terminology used in the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 13 THRESHOLD BELOW WHICH NO PENALTIES FOR LATE PAYMENT ARE IMPOSED New clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) As a result of the application of the new interest and penalty rules being delayed until 1 April 2013, the interest and penalty rules under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 will continue to apply for another year. Under the Act, borrowers are not subject to penalties for late payment if the unpaid amount is less than $334, which equates to no penalty being imposed if the penalty is $5 or less. This reduces the administrative and compliance costs in imposing and collecting small amounts. With the delay in the application of the new interest and penalties rules, officials have previously recommended in this report that the penalty for late payment be reduced from 1.5%, compounding monthly to 0.843%. One of the consequences of this change is that if the $5 threshold remains, no penalties will be imposed on outstanding amounts less than $593 ($5 / 0.00843) rather than $334 as intended. Officials therefore recommend that the references to the $5 threshold be removed and instead provide that penalties are not imposed on unpaid amounts less than $334 and that the change applies with effect from 1 April 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 14 15 ADDITIONAL DEDUCTION RATE Clause 33 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill currently provides for a special deduction rate to be imposed on the salary and wage payments of borrowers to recoup either a significant under-payment, repay outstanding amounts, or make additional payments to repay the loan (and thereby qualify for the excess repayment bonus). The bill provides that the special deduction rate is administered by way of a special tax code of “SLADR”. To more easily identify what the special deduction rate is for, officials recommend that the rate be split in two and have a special code for borrower-instigated special deductions (SLBOR) and a special code for Commissioner-instigated special deductions (SLCIR). This will enable the Commissioner to apply more easily the payment priority rules, which differ between borrower and Commissioner-instigated deductions. 1 Officials recommend that this change applies with effect from 1 April 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 1 Borrower-instigated deductions are first applied to repay any outstanding debt and any remainder goes to repay the loan. Commissioner-instigated deductions are usually tagged to specific repayments or debts and the payment is applied to this liability first and any remainder goes to repay other debts.

(Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill principally focuses on measures to improve the efficiency of the tax administration system and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers. The four key items in the bill are: • gift duty abolition; • changes to Inland Revenue’s information disclosure rules (including changes to taxpayer secrecy rules and inter-agency information-sharing rules); • changes to the tax disputes procedure; and • changes to the tax pooling rules. Other matters in the bill include changes to credit card fees and a number of remedial items, such as technical changes to the portfolio investment entity rules, which ensure existing policies function as intended. Twenty-six submissions were received on the bill, with feedback from the majority of submitters generally focussing on the four main initiatives as follows: • Submissions largely supported the abolition of gift duty. • Concerns were raised around the scope of the changes to the secrecy and information-sharing rules. • Submissions on the disputes process were largely of the view that the proposed legislative changes were not comprehensive enough. Submitters were also concerned that one proposed change raised Bill of Rights Act 1990 concerns. • Submissions on the tax pooling rules were largely favourable, although further technical amendments were requested. This report sets out officials’ detailed responses to those submissions. A number of changes to the bill, largely of a technical nature, are recommended. Officials have not, however, recommended changes to the fundamental design and structure of key policies reflected in the bill. To address a Bill of Rights Act 1990 concern, officials have recommended a change requiring the Commissioner to issue a challenge notice for taxpayer-initiated disputes (allowing the taxpayer to take the dispute to court) within four years of the dispute starting. Officials have also recommended the retention of the specific exception permitting the disclosure of non-identifying information when the Minister of Finance considers the release is in the public interest. This is because this exception will cover some situations when the release would not be permitted under the new relaxed general exception, which requires the disclosure to have a tax administration-related purpose. 2 A number of remedial matters have been raised in submissions, or by officials as a result of informal taxpayer requests. Officials have recommended remedial changes to update existing legislation, or to remedy practical difficulties with the application of recently enacted or substantially amended regimes. A number of these changes are either about to come into force or have recently taken effect and are therefore time- sensitive. As this is the last opportunity to ensure amendments are passed before the General Election, these amendments cannot be deferred to a later bill. The changes will provide certainty to taxpayers and are largely taxpayer-friendly. The resulting recommended changes include: • depreciation rates for specialised buildings (as a consequence of the Budget 2010 changes); • a GST matter related to the emissions trading scheme; • ensuring that the GST changes introduced in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010, such as the zero-rating of land and apportionment rules, operate as intended. Although these will be retrospective in application (as the new rules come into force on 1 April 2011), they are taxpayer-friendly and do not relate to matters that taxpayers are expected have taken a position on before the amendments are passed; • addressing problems with the controlled foreign company rules that came into force in 2009. The recommended solutions for these problems would be applied retrospectively to prevent unintended tax liabilities arising; and • a change to the timing provisions for use-of-money interest deductions so that the deduction of use-of-money interest is allocated to the year in which the interest is paid. 3 Gift duty abolition 4 5 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Clause 110 The bill will effectively abolish gift duty from 1 October 2011. The Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 will remain in force to allow for the collection of duties for gifts made before the date of abolition. Gift duty abolition is expected to reduce compliance costs by an estimated $70 million annually and provide administrative savings of $430,000 annually. It is expected to reduce government revenue by $1 million a year. Just 0.4% of the gifts reported to Inland Revenue each year are liable for gift duty, due to the widespread use of gifting programmes. Of nine submissions received on gift duty abolition, six expressed support for the change, while one opposed it. Submitters noted the high compliance costs, low revenue and the use of gifting programmes. Several submitters consider that gift duty is archaic and that its abolition is long overdue. The Corporate Taxpayers Group submitted that gift duty can unduly affect ordinary business transactions when it should not intuitively have application. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants estimates that the deadweight costs imposed by gift duty are as much as three times the $70 million compliance costs estimated by officials. However, it considers that the process of gift duty abolition should be carefully managed. Davenport Harbour Lawyers noted that gift duty does not prevent people from transferring their assets to other entities, but simply increases the cost of doing so. Abolition will therefore give a greater number of New Zealanders the ability to structure their affairs as they wish. Federated Farmers submitted that gift duty has been an impediment to farm succession from one generation to the next. Submitters have called for further work to be done in some related areas, notably in the area of relationship property rights and the law of trusts, and while some want to delay abolition, the general consensus is that gift duty should not be retained for these purposes. 6 TRUST USE Submissions (Davenport Harbour Lawyers, National Council of Women of New Zealand, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Trustee Services Limited) Gift duty abolition is likely to increase the number of trusts and voluntary alienations of property in general. (Davenport Harbour Lawyers, National Council of Women of New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Trustee Services) Gift duty abolition should be removed from the bill. It could be reconsidered when legislation to regulate trusts (and to strengthen relationship property rights) has been considered. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Abolition of gift duty should be delayed until after the Law Commission’s review of New Zealand trust law is completed. We are concerned that trustees may see the cessation of gifting programmes as reducing the need for annual trustee meetings, leading to an increase in non-compliant trusts. (New Zealand Trustee Services Limited) Gift duty abolition is likely to lead to a heightened awareness of the importance of good trust administration and record keeping in order to ensure the validity of trusts. It will also delineate those who have not set up their trusts for valid reasons, and trusts that do not follow correct administration procedures may be wound up. (Davenport Harbour Lawyers) The context of the Law Commission’s work on trusts needs to be taken into account in making the decision to abolish gift duty. We recommend a staged approach towards repeal, to allow for consideration of this and other factors, particularly tax avoidance issues. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Any reform of trust law will not address an increase in the number of trusts or any increase in dispositions. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The Law Commission’s Review of Trust Law seeks to address much broader issues than those potentially affected by gift duty abolition, including trust regulation, the use of trusts and judicial responses. Officials consider that gift duty is not the appropriate mechanism to deal with any inadequacies in New Zealand trust law, so the outcomes of the review are unlikely to affect the decision to abolish gift duty. Although gift duty has made gifting compliance intensive, it has not prevented people from gifting. 7 Officials see no evidence to support the claim that the abolition of gift duty will lead to an increase in the number of trusts or the value of the assets they hold. Gift duty has not prevented the considerable growth of trusts in New Zealand over the past 30 years. It should also be noted that, although gift duty abolition will reduce the compliance cost associated with gifting, there are still significant costs involved in establishing a trust, and deeds of gift will still be required to make new dispositions. Aside from cost, there are other important considerations that need to be considered when deciding whether to establish a trust, such as whether the potential settlor is willing to give up ownership and control over their assets and whether there are better ways of meeting their needs. Gifting programmes may motivate trustees to meet once each year to complete annual gifting requirements, during which time other trust matters may also be attended to. However, it is common practice for gifting programmes to be administered through correspondence between trustees, without meetings. Officials are unaware of any evidence that would suggest that the added administrative tasks related to gifting programmes have any effect on the trustees’ compliance with other aspects of trust administration. Recommendation That the concerns be noted, subject to officials’ comments, and that the requests to defer the abolition of gift duty be declined. 8 RELATIONSHIP PROPERTY RIGHTS AND SUCCESSION CLAIMS Submissions (Davenport Harbour Lawyers, National Council of Women of New Zealand, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Paul Davies Law Limited) Repealing gift duty will render less effective already inadequate remedies under the Property (Relationships) Act and the Family Protection Act. We do not oppose gift duty abolition, but consider that the impact on relationship property rights and succession claims has been underestimated by officials. Gift duty increases the likelihood that assets will be available for distribution under the Acts, as it slows down the alienation of assets. The portion of unforgiven debt under an incomplete gifting programme may in some cases be the sole source from which compensation can be ordered. Legislative amendments to the Property (Relationships) Act and the Family Protection Act should be considered to prevent dispositions that have the effect of defeating the interests of a party under the Acts. (New Zealand Law Society) We support the repeal of gift duty, but a gift of relationship property should only be effective where the parties to the relationship have received independent certified advice. (Paul Davies Law Limited) Gift duty abolition should be removed from the bill and not considered again until legislation is in place to strengthen relationship property rights (and trust regulation – discussed earlier). Existing relationship property legislation is not effective in the face of family trusts. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) The relationship between gift duty and matrimonial property rules should be considered before gift duty is abolished. A staged approach should be taken to repeal, to allow for consideration of this and other factors, particularly tax avoidance issues. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) People should be able to structure their affairs as they wish. The Property (Relationships) Act provides the ability to contract out of its provisions. The abolition of gift duty will be of huge benefit to those wishing to opt out of the Act, as they will no longer face arguments over outstanding debts under gifting programmes. Gift duty abolition will enable principles of testamentary freedom to be adhered to. Many practitioners believe the provisions of the Family Protection Act should be reviewed, as the social landscape in New Zealand is vastly different from that of the 1950s when the legislation was passed. (Davenport Harbour Lawyers) Comment The focus of these submissions was on the impact of the removal of gift duty on the property division scheme in the Property (Relationships) Act 1976, although the Law Society also submitted on the Family Protection Act 1955 and the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949. The concern is that assets transferred into trusts may not be available for property division or settling estates later on. 9 Most submitters on this matter agreed that gift duty should not be retained for the purposes of these Acts (Davenport Harbour Lawyers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Paul Davies Law Limited). Three requested amendments to the Property (Relationships) Act (National Council of Women of New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, Paul Davies Law Limited), and the Law Society requested consideration of amendments to the Family Protection Act and the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act. The effect of gift duty abolition on relationship property rights and succession claims was considered as part of the gift duty review. Officials consider that gift duty is not a means of addressing any perceived problems with relationship property and succession law, as gift duty does not prevent dispositions from occurring, though it has practical impact on how some dispositions are structured in terms of their timing. The Property (Relationships) Act, Family Protection Act and the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act are administered by the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry has advised that it does not consider changes to these Acts are required as a consequence of the removal of gift duty. The underlying philosophy of these Acts is that individuals are generally free to deal with their own property as they wish – any entitlement one person may have to the property of another does not arise until the actual event of separation or death. The main perceived problem in the relationship property context arises when property is transferred into a trust, and is no longer relationship property. However, the courts are able to consider trusts and, where appropriate, provide relief under existing legislation. For instance: • The Property (Relationships) Act allows the courts to restrain or to set aside transfers of property to trusts when there was an intention to defeat a spouse’s or partner’s claim at the time the disposition was made. \\ • If the disposition was not intended to defeat a claim, but had that effect, the courts are able to grant compensation (although in this circumstance the court cannot set aside the trust). Compensation can include other non-trust assets or the income of the trust, but does not include the capital of the trust (the power to unwind the trust could disadvantage other beneficiaries, including children of the relationship). • Section 182 of the Family Proceedings Act allows the court to vary the terms of an agreement or settlement (made before or after a marriage or civil union) if, at the end of the marriage or civil union, an applicant no longer derives the benefit he or she reasonably expected to receive from the agreement or settlement. This includes the ability for the courts to vest part of a trust in an affected partner, for their benefit. 10 There will be some cases where legislative relief is not available following the transfer of assets into a trust. However, officials consider the number is likely to be low, and there is no evidence that these cases would be significantly affected by the removal of gift duty. Further, where these cases involve joint property, the transfer of the property into a trust would have to be a combined decision. In these cases, professionals such as lawyers and accountants who provide advice on the formation of a trust should make both parties aware that the property may no longer be considered relationship property. In some cases, it may be possible that property is transferred into a trust without the knowledge of the other party, and that person only finds out when the relationship ends (for instance a house owned by one party prior to starting the relationship). As noted above, the court can provide remedies where this has occurred if it has the intention or the effect of defeating a spouse’s or partner’s claim. Further, this is consistent with the principle that individuals are generally free to deal with their own property as they wish, prior to separation or death. For instance, the law does not prevent the owner of a house selling that house because the property could later be considered relationship property, nor does it prohibit spending money that could later be considered relationship property. In the succession law context, the concern appears to be that a person may transfer property to a trust in their lifetime so that it does not fall into their estate when they die. Generally, property that is owned jointly with another person or that is disposed of while a person is alive, whether by transfer to a trust or otherwise, does not fall into their estate and is therefore not available to claimants under the Family Protection Act or the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act. This is consistent with the policy that these Acts do not restrict what a person may do with their property while they are alive, including gifting that property to another person. It is not clear why transfers to a trust should be treated differently. Remedies may be available to the estate in some circumstances, such as if a gift has been made as a result of undue influence. There is a risk that making ad hoc amendments to any of these Acts may undermine the long-standing policy that underpins them and could affect the legitimate use of trusts. For example, requiring all parties to a relationship to receive legal advice before one party to a relationship transfers assets into a trust (or makes major changes) would impose significant compliance costs on couples that have a trust for a genuine purpose, particularly when the value of the trust was relatively low. It is also likely to be unnecessary, as couples who transfer significant assets into a trust would be likely to seek professional advice. The Law Commission is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of trust law, which is expected to be completed in 2012–13. Ministry of Justice officials will consider the implications of this work, as well as any principled basis put forward by the Law Commission for dealing with property that has been transferred into trusts. The Ministry of Justice will monitor any effects of gift duty abolition to inform the government-wide post-implementation review that will be led by Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 11 LACK OF GOVERNMENT RECORDS OF GIFTS Submissions (National Council of Women of New Zealand, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In the absence of gift duty, there will be no audit trail for gifts, enabling the defeat of creditors and proceeds of crime legislation. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Financial information will be more difficult and expensive to access, requiring more intensive investigations, specialist training of public servants and encroachments on individual privacy. Gift duty provides a useful paper trail for the Ministry of Social Development and other government departments to determine eligibility for public benefits. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Comment Officials note that, due to the strict secrecy requirements of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue cannot provide details of gift statements to private entities, the Ministry of Social Development, or any other government department generally. Therefore, gift statements are not used to determine eligibility for government entitlements such as the residential care subsidy. Gift statements may be provided to the Official Assignee, who takes on the rights and obligations of bankrupts, and to the Police in relation to the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009. Gifts to trusts are made by way of deeds of gift. These legal documents are required independently of gift duty obligations in order to establish trust ownership of assets. In the absence of a deed of gift, the courts may deem the transfer to be a loan to the trust which may be called in. In the absence of gift statements, evidence will continue to exist in the forms of deeds of gift, land transfer records for real property, registration details for motor vehicles and banking records for cash transfers. Each of these independent records could be expected to show both the donor and the recipient of the gift, just as gift statements do. Officials also wish to note that, although the Official Assignee regularly accesses the gift statements of bankrupts, this rarely results in recovery of value for creditors. Of 430,000 IRD numbers for which gift statements were filed between 1 July 2001 and 28 May 2010, less than 0.003% went into bankruptcy. The Official Assignee has recovered a total of $1.5 million from trusts in the past two years. In the same period, an overall total of $500,000 was recovered from all entities using the insolvent transactions provisions under the Insolvency Act 2006, and “virtually none” of this has related to book debts under gifting programmes. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 12 IS GIFT DUTY ABOLITION A TAX CUT FOR THE WEALTHY? Submissions (Federated Farmers, National Council of Women of New Zealand) New Zealand’s wealthiest citizens have a continuing economic advantage of transferring assets to trusts, and as major beneficiaries of recent tax cuts, a further move to relieve them of costs is unfair. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Abolition of gift duty will cost the Government just 0.003% of total tax revenue, while relieving the private sector of $70 million in compliance costs. Gift duty has been an impediment to farm succession from one generation to the next. Although farmers must have land assets, this does not mean they have high incomes, with recent data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry showing meagre incomes for farming, with poor rates of return and increasing agricultural debt. (Federated Farmers) Comment Officials note that gift duty applies only to aggregate gifts over $27,000, made by a person in any 12-month period. Therefore, abolition affects only those who have assets greater than this value and who wish to give up their legal ownership of them. It has been noted that gifting programmes are widely used; therefore gift duty is rarely incurred, often only by mistake. The extent to which abolition can therefore be considered a tax cut is limited to the $1.5 million (before administration costs) that it raises annually, resulting from approximately 900 gift statements. The real savings will be in compliance costs (an estimated $70 million each year). The benefit of these costs goes to private practitioners who assist with drawing up deeds and filing gift statements. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 13 GIFT DUTY ABOLITION AND ITS POTENTIAL EFFECTS SHOULD BE WIDELY COMMUNICATED BY THE GOVERNMENT Submissions (Davenport Harbour Lawyers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Trustee Services Limited) The Government has a moral obligation to widely communicate the benefits and implications of gift duty abolition so that people may take advantage of the opportunity to provide protection for their families. (Davenport Harbour Lawyers) The Government has not done enough to ensure practitioners and commentators are aware of the impacts of gift duty abolition. (New Zealand Trustee Services Limited) The Government should make a clear public statement about the areas of law affected by gift duty abolition and how these areas will operate in the absence of gift duty. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In its oral submission, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants expressed concern that abolition of gift duty may be interpreted as Inland Revenue’s approval of all gifting arrangements, therefore a public statement on the nexus between gifting and tax avoidance should be made. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Information on the proposed gift duty abolition has been published on Inland Revenue’s policy website. Several press statements and a media conference have been given by the Minister of Revenue, resulting in considerable media coverage. Officials consider that the comprehensive Regulatory Impact Statement on gift duty abolition, available to the public on Inland Revenue and Treasury websites, provides adequate description of the areas of law affected by gift duty abolition and the action various government departments intend to take in response. Immediately following enactment, Inland Revenue will publicise the change through its Tax Information Bulletin and it will issue a fact sheet detailing the impacts of abolition. Other government departments would need to consider appropriate means of communication depending on the relevance of gift duty abolition to their areas of responsibility. Inland Revenue is currently considering publishing a technical statement to clarify that gift duty abolition will in no way validate all gifting arrangements, nor will it, in and of itself, affect whether an arrangement is considered to be avoidance. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 14 TAX AVOIDANCE OPPORTUNITIES Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There are a number of tax avoidance opportunities that may arise in the absence of gift duty. These include: • ability to split income with people on lower incomes; • ability to transfer income to loss-making entities; • ability to transfer assets in order to meet minimum thresholds for the financial arrangement rules and the foreign investment fund rules; • ability for someone with a tax liability to divest themselves of the means to pay and then to claim hardship; and • ability to make charitable donations via others so that a higher tax rebate may be claimed. Comment The key feature of all the avoidance practices raised by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants is that gift duty does not prevent them. Legal title to assets (as well as any income they generate) transfers immediately when a gifting programme is set up. The outstanding debt, progressively forgiven, is of no assistance in remedying these avoidance behaviours. Gift duty can be considered to be a barrier only to the extent that the compliance costs of gifting programmes may deter some people. However, the potential tax savings of these arrangements are likely to far outweigh the costs of a gifting programme. The submission noted that there is uncertainty about whether the above practices may constitute tax avoidance as defined in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Gift duty abolition, in and of itself, will not affect whether an arrangement is considered to be avoidance. Inland Revenue is currently considering publishing a technical statement to clarify this. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, subject to officials’ comments 15 GIFT DUTY COULD BE TEMPORARILY RETAINED, BUT THE THRESHOLDS RAISED AND THE REQUIREMENT TO FILE NON- LIABLE GIFT STATEMENTS REMOVED Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) While we welcome gift duty abolition, a staged approach should be taken to allow more time for various issues to be further considered. Full abolition should be deferred, and in the interim, the threshold at which gift duty becomes payable should be raised to $80,000, in line with inflation. The requirement to file non-liable gift statements should be removed. Comment The key benefits of gift duty are thought to relate to the slowing down of gifting. If abolition were to be phased in, and the threshold raised in line with inflation to $80,000, this would speed up gifting to the extent that there would be little benefit in retaining it at all. It would mean that a couple could each gift $80,000 each year, so a property valued at $300,000 would take as little as 13 months to completely gift, instead of six years. The real compliance costs of gift duty relate to engaging a practitioner to draw up the deeds required by a gifting programme. The submitter’s proposed changes would still require practitioners to facilitate a market-value sale, draw up a deed of acknowledgement of debt and annual deeds of forgiveness of debt, although fewer annual deeds would be required. The result would be that much of the compliance costs of gift duty would remain in place. The underlying policy problem of gift duty’s relative ineffectiveness at preventing asset stripping would not be addressed by the submitter’s alternative proposal. The potential effects of gift duty abolition were well considered during the gift duty review, involving eight government agencies. As a result, officials see little benefit in delaying abolition. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 CREDITOR PROTECTION Submission (Paul Davies Law Limited) We support gift duty abolition, but are concerned about the effectiveness of current legislative provisions to allow the courts to claw back dispositions at the request of an affected creditor. The relevant law should be considered including an absolute right to set aside a gift within a period of time. Comment Three existing statutes contain provisions to allow the claw-back of dispositions for the benefit of creditors: • Sections 204 and 205 of the Insolvency Act 2006 allow the Official Assignee to automatically cancel gifts made within two years before adjudication, or within five years if the bankrupt cannot demonstrate solvency at the time the gift was made. • Section 292 of the Companies Act 1993 gives the Official Assignee similar powers but over shorter timeframes (6 months and 2 years). • Subpart 6 of the Property Law Act 2007 empowers the courts to set aside property dispositions if there was an intention to prejudice the interests of a creditor-applicant. This provision is not time-limited. In the context of these existing provisions, officials do not consider that any new creditor protection measures are necessary at this time. The Ministry of Economic Development has committed to monitor future cases brought under these Acts, and a government-wide post-implementation review will consider any effects resulting from gift duty abolition. Recommendation That the concerns be noted. That the submission to reform creditor protection laws be declined. 17 WILL GIFT DUTY ABOLITION REDUCE COMPLIANCE COSTS? Submission (New Zealand Trustee Services Limited) Gift duty abolition will increase the need for trust administration activities such as trustee meetings and record-keeping, therefore compliance costs may increase, rather than decrease by the $70 million estimated by officials. Comment Officials see no basis for the contention that gift duty abolition will increase the need for trust administration activities. In the absence of gifting programmes, regular trustee meetings will remain necessary for proper trust administration. However, the estimated $70 million reduction in compliance costs considered solely the average fees charged by practitioners to draw up an annual deed of forgiveness of debt, and to file this with Inland Revenue along with a gift statement. As gifting programmes will no longer be necessary, deeds of forgiveness will no longer be required. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 18 LEGAL DEFINITION OF “GIFT” Submission (New Zealand Trustee Services Limited) There is no legal definition of a “gift”. Any gift over $27,000 is considered to be “extraordinary” and court decisions will be necessary to clarify this area of the law. Comment Officials contacted Trustee Services to better understand their concerns, and were advised that their concern is that without gifting programmes, gifted assets may be subsequently considered by the courts to be loans. Trustee Services also advised that “extraordinary gifting” is a term used on the Work and Income website. The Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 defines “dutiable gift” solely for the purposes of that Act. The legal definition of a gift is based on case law, and officials understand that there is considerable clarity in this area. The courts recognise gifts made by deed, by delivery or by declaration of trust. In the absence of a gifting programme, practitioners would be expected to draw up a deed of gift to ensure that ownership has passed at law. This is a more straightforward process than setting up a market-value sale, drawing up a deed of acknowledgement of debt and then drawing up annual deeds of forgiveness of debt, as is the process for a gifting programme. While "extraordinary gifting" is not a generic legal term, "excess gifts" are referred to by the legislation under which the Ministry of Social Development administers the Residential Care Subsidy. Entitlement to the Residential Care Subsidy is determined in accordance with the Social Security Act 1964 and the Social Security (Long-term Residential Care) Regulations 2005. Part 8 of the Regulations define a gifting period that commences five years before the date of the means assessment. Any gifting above $5,500 in each year of this five-year period (a maximum of $27,500 over the five years) will be added back into means-testing. In addition, section 147A of the Security Act 1964 provides for instances of deprivation to be considered and adjustments made to the financial means assessment as a result. For example, outside the gifting period of the last five years, there is a gifting allowance of $27,000 in each year. Any amounts gifted above $27,000 are considered to be "excess gifts" and may be added back into the assessment of assets for Residential Care Subsidy eligibility. Regulation 9B lists further examples that qualify as deprivation of assets in accordance with section 147A of the Social Security Act 1964. There is no time limit on the Ministry of Social Development's discretion to consider adding back assets that applicants have divested prior to commencement of the five-year gifting period. The Ministry of Social Development advises that this provision is applied regularly in practice. 19 The Ministry of Social Development advises that it is working to better- educate financial advisors, solicitors and accountants of the deprivation of assets provisions that apply to the Residential Care Subsidy and that there is no change to the allowed gifting levels for Residential Care Subsidy as a result of gift duty abolition. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 20 Changes to Inland Revenue’s secrecy rules 21 22 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS The bill proposes changes to two areas of Inland Revenue’s information disclosure rules. First, relaxing the taxpayer secrecy rules for tax administration purposes and secondly, in relation to Inland Revenue’s ability to share information with other government agencies. Nine submitters commented on these aspects of the bill. A number of submitters supported the goals of the amendments, being to improve speed, accuracy and administrative efficiency. Generally, submitters were concerned to ensure that taxpayer information continues to receive appropriate levels of confidential treatment and that the changes will not negatively affect voluntary compliance. Concerns were also expressed about the protection of information once it has been passed from Inland Revenue to other government agencies. Officials recommend the retention of the specific exception permitting the disclosure of non-identifying information when the Minister of Finance considers the release to be in the public interest. This is because this exception will cover some situations where the release would not be permitted under the new relaxed general exception, which requires the disclosure to have a tax administration-related purpose. 23 CHANGES TO TAXPAYER SECRECY RULES Clause 58 Issue: Clause 58 secrecy changes should not proceed at this time, particularly where there are no effective safeguards Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Before the decision to amend the secrecy rules is made, Parliament should give careful consideration to how such a change will affect voluntary compliance. We do not consider that the criteria set out in proposed section 81(1B) produce effective limits on the Commissioner’s ability to distribute information. Integrity of the tax system is an amorphous concept. A Standard Practice Statement is not binding on Inland Revenue and therefore it is incumbent on Parliament to provide clear legislation that gives taxpayers some certainty. Comment Officials agree that voluntary compliance is an important consideration. The criteria set out in the proposed section 81(1B) specifically include voluntary compliance as a factor to be considered in deciding whether to make a disclosure, which sufficiently protects the integrity of the tax system. Officials note the comments in relation to the Standard Practice Statement. The purpose of this document is to set out the process by which the Commissioner will administer the amendments and provide some examples to give guidance to officials and the public. This is to act as an interpretive aid and to enhance transparency. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Rules to be included in standard practice statement should instead be in legislation Submission (KPMG) We do not disagree with any of the examples set out in the Commentary to the bill. Our concern is ensuring consistency of the application of the discretion across different Inland Revenue staff and offices. The proposed Standard Practice Statement is a useful first step but we would prefer to see these rules set out in legislation to ensure they have full legal effect, with appropriate penalties for a breach. 24 Comment The proposed Standard Practice Statement is intended to give both Inland Revenue staff and the public guidance on how the rules will be applied in practice, including setting out the process for assessing whether a disclosure is appropriate under the new rules. The relevant rules for assessing a potential disclosure are contained in the primary legislation (new section 81(1B)), namely that it is for the purpose of executing (or supporting the execution of) a duty of the Commissioner, and it is considered reasonable having regard to the purpose and to the specific considerations set out in the legislation. We therefore consider that the legislation does contain the relevant rules. The Standard Practice Statement acts as an interpretive aid and process guide, rather than containing further rules. As to penalties, section 81 retains the primary obligation of Inland Revenue officers to maintain secrecy, subject only to the legislation Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The Commissioner should issue strong guidelines in relation to the proposed changes Submission (Ernst & Young) The Commissioner should issue strong guidelines as to taxpayers’ rights and ability to access the information accessed or exchanged under the proposed relaxation of the secrecy provisions in section 81. Comment Officials note that it is not clear from the submission whether the submitter is referring to clause 58 or 59. In relation to clause 58, Inland Revenue is issuing a Standard Practice Statement setting out process and some examples of disclosure categories. In relation to clause 59, officials agree that matters relating to taxpayers’ rights and ability to access their information should be addressed as part of a Memorandum of Understanding between Inland Revenue and the agency accessing their information. This point is expanded on further in the comment on the Privacy Commissioner’s submission. Officials further note that explanatory material around both clauses will be published by Inland Revenue in a Tax Information Bulletin item following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 25 Issue: Proposed section 81(1B)(b) should be replaced with a provision that refers to specific situations Submissions (Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed amendments are inappropriately broad and should be targeted towards specific situations. The amendments provide Inland Revenue with a very broad discretion and the factors to which it must have regard would impose very little practical restriction on the information Inland Revenue could communicate. For example, Inland Revenue could decide, as part of an investigation into a non-complying taxpayer, to communicate to that taxpayer specific confidential information relating to its competitors. (Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed amendment would also expose corporate taxpayers to the risk of severe commercial consequences if their secret information is disclosed. Two categories of particular concern are commercially sensitive material (for example, in relation to a proposed transaction) and information that a corporate taxpayer holds about others (for example, customers and employees). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Secrecy remains the primary obligation in section 81. This primary rule is subject to a number of existing exceptions set out in the legislation, including a general exception permitting disclosures for the purpose of carrying into effect the Inland Revenue Acts. The amendment seeks to introduce some more flexibility into the general exception, to enable sensible administrative decisions, while still retaining the primary secrecy obligation. We do not consider that a targeted, or list, approach is flexible enough. Such an approach would only cover the specific situations on the list and would not be able to be extended or varied for similar or new circumstances. In the case of new or varied situations arising, Inland Revenue would be required to seek further legislative amendment. The Standard Practice Statement will allow Inland Revenue to use a “specific circumstances” approach to examples, while retaining the flexibility to also make disclosures in new situations that meet the criteria set out in the legislation. In relation to the concerns raised in the context of the examples, officials note that such a scenario is addressed in the Standard Practice Statement. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 26 Issue: The Commissioner should be required to obtain consent or a court order before releasing information Submission (Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group) If it is not considered possible to put statutory parameters around the circumstances in which Inland Revenue can override the confidentiality of the taxpayer, another form of protection is required. We suggest an appropriate mechanism would be to require Inland Revenue to obtain consent for the disclosure from the taxpayer to whom the information relates. If consent is not given and Inland Revenue still wishes to make the disclosure, Inland Revenue should be required to apply to the District Court or High Court for an order permitting the disclosure. Such application should be on notice to the taxpayer. Comment Such a process would be far more restrictive than the current rules. None of the currently permitted disclosures require Inland Revenue to seek the consent of the taxpayer or consent of the courts. It appears that the submitters may be particularly concerned about disclosures such as those which have occurred during litigation. Such disclosures occur in a specific litigation context and have been considered permissible by the Supreme Court under the existing secrecy rules. The proposed changes do not affect that decision. Officials also note that the proposed new section 81(1B) includes the commercial impact of a communication as a factor to be considered before any disclosure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Develop categories of information that can be released depending on the category of persons seeking the information Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We can envisage situations when Inland Revenue would have good reason to share the identity and address of individuals but not other information such as income details. In such instances, if the information is able to be transferred, it should be subject to a law that only allows the transfer where the recipient agency can provide an assurance that the information will not be provided to other government agencies or third parties. Given the number of information-matching agreements already existing it is highly likely that without any on-transfer rules Inland Revenue information would be networked to a large number of other government entities. 27 Another category where information could be released is when there is some impediment to the taxpayer communicating with Inland Revenue themselves. There are certain procedures in place already in relation to allowing someone to act on a taxpayer’s behalf, however something more limited might apply. Inland Revenue needs to be sure that the taxpayer has given their authority for such disclosure. Comment Officials do not consider that legislating particular categories of information disclosure is appropriate in the context of disclosures undertaken in the execution, or in supporting the execution, of the duties of the Commissioner. The intention of the amendment is to provide more flexibility to the already existing general exception, allowing the Commissioner to make sensible administrative decisions. Officials consider that requiring such disclosure to fit within specific legislative categories is too restrictive and will lead to further legislative complexity. Such an approach would mean that a legislative amendment would be required every time a new category of disclosure was developed, even when such disclosure was merely a variance of something already done. The submitter appears in part to be referring to disclosures under the proposed new section 81BA (disclosures to government agencies). As discussed further below, issues around the treatment of information transferred under this provision will be dealt with by way of Memorandum of Understandings between Inland Revenue and the recipient agency. This will cover the issue raised of on-transferring information. Officials agree that one category of information that may be able to be released under the proposed section 81(1B) is information relating to a taxpayer where that taxpayer faces some impediment in communicating directly with Inland Revenue, and wishes for some limited assistance from a support person (without giving that support person the more substantial access available via the nominated person or agent approach). Officials agree with the submitter that it is important to ensure in such situations that the taxpayer has consented to the limited disclosure to their support person. Recommendation That the submission be declined, except for the situation of a taxpayer facing an impediment. 28 Issue: Inland Revenue should not have the ability to release taxpayer information to justify its actions Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill commentary envisages that Inland Revenue could make public information about a taxpayer if it decided it had been slighted in the media. In the recent banking cases, ANZ took proceedings against Inland Revenue to prevent it disclosing information about ANZ transactions in litigation between Inland Revenue and BNZ and Westpac. The Commissioner regarded this as necessary to carry the Inland Revenue Acts even though ANZ had not made any public statements and was not part of the proceedings. Comment The disclosure referred to by the submitter was undertaken in the course of litigation, rather than in the context of a media disclosure, making it a very different scenario. The key issue in the litigation referred to was whether the Commissioner, in defending proceedings brought by one bank, could use information it held about business affairs of other banks. The Commissioner had included such documents in his discovery affidavit (being an affidavit required pursuant to the discovery orders made by the courts), claiming confidentiality for the documents, but listing them as documents held by Inland Revenue that were relevant to the proceedings. The Supreme Court held that the Commissioner was entitled to so respond to the discovery order. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: If Inland Revenue considers it has been unfairly slighted in the media, provision can be made for the taxpayer to agree to Inland Revenue providing its perspective Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Currently Inland Revenue cannot respond when a taxpayer is casting aspersions in the media. If the taxpayer were able to waive their secrecy rights and did not do so this would give the media and the public an indication of the weight that should be placed on the taxpayer’s statements. This assumes that Inland Revenue would be able to say that the taxpayer has not waived their right to secrecy. Consider that Inland Revenue has demonstrated that it is not above making a pre-emptive strike even when the particular taxpayer is not involved. 29 Comment Officials consider it unlikely that a taxpayer, having made damaging comments about Inland Revenue in the media, would then agree to Inland Revenue disclosing information relating to their affairs. In addition, the changes proposed to section 81 do not provide a general ability for taxpayers to waive secrecy. Inland Revenue is not proposing to make pre-emptive media statements. Media comment is only envisaged when the taxpayer has made incorrect statements that are considered damaging to the integrity of the tax system. Such comment is likely to be extremely limited – for example, a statement to the effect that the taxpayer has not disclosed all the relevant facts or information. Officials further note that any comment in the media would require careful consideration, even when it was considered appropriate under the criteria in the proposed section 81(1B). The Standard Practice Statement contains an example working through the issue of disclosure to the media. Authority for media disclosures is likely to be restricted to Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner level. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inland Revenue should publish appropriately redacted adjudications reports Submission (Ernst & Young) Given the increasing trend for tax disputes to be determined without public court hearings or decisions, the Commissioner should publish appropriately redacted adjudications reports to promote better information and transparency for taxpayers. Making this information available in forms that do not prejudice taxpayer confidentiality would better inform taxpayers about the basis of the Commissioner’s views on a range of technical matters. Taxpayers would therefore be better informed in taking their own tax positions. Comment This matter has been raised with Inland Revenue previously. Officials are considering whether redacted adjudication reports could be published, taking into account the need to protect the interests of both the taxpayer and the Commissioner. The Commissioner is concerned to ensure that any publication would not elevate the status of adjudication decisions above what they are – which is that they are simply specific decisions on one taxpayer’s facts, having regard to the arguments made in that single dispute, and they are not binding rulings. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 30 Issue: Adding a reference to the Privacy Act to clause 58 Submission (Privacy Commissioner (supplementary submission)) We understand that the intent is to operate the section with reference to the Privacy Act. For the avoidance of doubt the Committee could consider adding a sub-clause to clause 58 making such consideration a requirement (for example, “whether the Privacy Act permits the communication of the information”). Such a provision would not assist corporate taxpayers but would provide additional assurance to individual taxpayers that their privacy will be properly considered. Comment Clause 58 already contains a requirement to consider the personal and commercial impact of any proposed communication. This is intended to encompass both individual privacy concerns and also corporate commercial considerations. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act is not currently subject to the Privacy Act, and is generally more restrictive of disclosure than the Privacy Act. Officials do not consider there is any reason to amend this situation. The secrecy rules are sufficiently strict that adding another layer of mandatory considerations is unnecessary and would add administrative complexity and cost without significant benefit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clause 58(4)(c) should be removed from the bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 58(4)(c) proposes the repeal of section 81(4)(j) of the Tax Administration Act. Section 81(4)(j) provides that the Minister of Finance may authorise the communication of information of a general nature that does not reveal the identity of any taxpayer when such a disclosure is reasonable and practicable, and is in the public interest. This section may still be required in certain circumstances and should not be repealed. Comment The repeal of section 81(4)(j) was considered appropriate on the basis that disclosures of general, non-identifying information could be made pursuant to the proposed new rule in section 81(1B). The intention was not to remove this ability but rather to transfer the ability to assess the release of generic information to the Commissioner. Officials consider however, that there are some situations when section 81(4)(j) would permit disclosures that would not be permitted by the new section 81(1B) and the section should 31 therefore be retained. This is because the existing provision allows generic disclosures when the Minister of Finance considers the disclosure is in the public interest. This is a less restrictive test than that contained in proposed section 81(1B) where the disclosure must be related to a duty of the Commissioner. An example of where section 81(4)(j) might be used is when another agency is seeking aggregate information to help it assess the success of some initiative it has undertaken. The information may be sought on an ad hoc, one-off, or regular basis. Such disclosure has no purpose related to executing or supporting the execution of a duty of the Commissioner but might be assessed as being in the public interest. The information sought is aggregated, therefore does not identify any individual taxpayer. In this situation, disclosure would not be permitted under section 81(1B) but would be permissible under section 81(4)(j). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The tax system extorts compliance Submission (Andrew Sheldon) “Voluntary compliance” is a contradiction in terms. The tax system is not voluntary. Comment Voluntary compliance is a term used to indicate that taxpayers determine their tax obligations in the first instance. It does not mean that the decision to pay tax is voluntary or without compulsion. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 32 CHANGES TO INFORMATION SHARING RULES Clause 59 Issue: Notification, verification and consent to sharing should be required under proposed section 81BA Submission (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Inland Revenue has been known to hold incorrect information and its processes are subject to human error. Before sharing a taxpayer’s information with another government department the taxpayer should be informed, verify the accuracy of the information and provide consent. Comment Officials acknowledge there will always be a small risk that incorrect information is held and transferred. Such information may be transferred under existing information-matching arrangements. The amendments do not mean that it is more likely that information will be incorrect. It is proposed that there be a Memorandum of Understanding between Inland Revenue and the recipient agency (which is currently the case for existing information matches and exchanges) that will address the ability of individuals to access and correct their information. Requiring individuals to verify and give consent before their information is exchanged would add considerable administrative complexity and cost. In addition, certain individuals may not consent to their information being exchanged in circumstances where this is likely to lead to an adverse outcome (including detection of fraud). Requiring consent would significantly detract from the efficiency gains that are likely to result from this proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposed section 81BA should be removed and replaced with an information-matching provision Submission (Privacy Commissioner) We support the goals of speed, accuracy and administrative flexibility, however believe these can be met through the existing information-matching provisions in the Privacy Act. The new framework is unnecessary and likely to be resource-intensive to set up. It will allow an as yet unknown amount of information to be shared with as 33 yet unidentified agencies. The existing information-matching framework would provide a robust and flexible mechanism for the information exchanges that Inland Revenue would like to make. Information matching is not suitable for all types of information-sharing but will work well for this case based on the information received from Inland Revenue. Comment Officials agree with the Privacy Commissioner that information matching, while suitable for some forms of information exchange, is not always suitable. Inland Revenue’s experience is that information-matching programmes are expensive to develop and administer and are not always flexible enough to meet the needs of agencies, particularly in the delivery of joined-up services. Officials do not consider that information matching provides the necessary flexibility in this case. The proposed new information exchange framework will allow proactive provision of information which is problematic under the information-matching regime. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposed section 81BA needs more explicit controls Submission (Privacy Commissioner) If the framework proceeds there should be more explicit controls on how information is shared under it. There are some safeguards but more are needed. A sub-clause should be included that requires a written agreement between Inland Revenue and the agency receiving the information. The sub-clause should specify the details (about how the sharing will work and what safeguards are in place) that must be included in the written agreement, namely: • the agency/agencies that can receive the information from Inland Revenue; • the purpose for sharing the information (including any thresholds to be crossed before the sharing can occur); • the use that can be made of the information; • the specific information that can be transferred; • how the security of the information will be maintained; • details of how the information transfer will be managed; • how agencies will provide for individuals to access and correct their personal information; • how the agencies will seek to ensure the accuracy of the information; • controls on the secondary disclosure of the information; 34 • what happens to the information when it is no longer needed (retention periods); • how the public will be notified of the information sharing; • how individuals will be notified before any actions are taken as a result of the information sharing; and • how the information sharing will be monitored or reported on (for example, internally or to the Privacy Commissioner). Comment Officials agree that this is a sensible approach. In practice officials had anticipated that a Memorandum of Understanding would be entered into between Inland Revenue and the recipient agency (as currently occurs in relation to information matching and information-exchange arrangements). Officials therefore agree that it is appropriate for such a requirement to be included in the legislation and that the legislation specifies considerations that the Memorandum of Understanding will cover. Each Memorandum of Understanding will be negotiated with each department separately following the enactment of this proposed provision. Rather than including the full list as set out in the drafting suggested in the Privacy Commissioner’s submission however, officials consider a new paragraph including the requirement for a Memorandum, and a summary of the matters to be covered in the Memorandum, would be sufficient. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Proposed section 81BA has no safeguards for the encouragement of voluntary compliance Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We are opposed to the current form of the amendment as it does not provide any legislative safeguards for the encouragement of voluntary compliance. We appreciate there are some advantages to taxpayers in not having to provide the same information to multiple agencies, but we see little in the way of safeguards. There is no assurance that the information transferred will be used for the correct purpose – for example, some agencies such as Quotable Value and New Zealand Post now sell information derived from the public. There is no assurance that once the information is transferred to another entity that they will be constrained by the requirements that apply to Inland Revenue. Some of Inland Revenue’s information has commercial value and could be on-sold or on-disclosed by other agencies. 35 Comment Proposed section 81BA specifically includes a number of hurdles that must be met for an agency to seek access to Inland Revenue’s information. Voluntary compliance is a key area of concern to Inland Revenue. Therefore there is a requirement in proposed section 81BA(3)(a) that the Minister must be satisfied that the provision of information to another agency will not unduly inhibit the provision of further information to Inland Revenue in the future. The matter of subsequent treatment of information by the recipient agency will be dealt with in the Memorandum of Understanding between Inland Revenue and the recipient agency. It is clearly not in Inland Revenue’s interest that information accessed via this framework be subsequently sold for commercial gain by another agency. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Information passed between government entities should only be information that does not disclose the identity of the taxpayer Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We are not opposed to the transfer of information from Inland Revenue to other government entities if the identity of the taxpayer is not revealed (i.e. the information is provided in aggregated form). Comment There is already provision for Inland Revenue to provide information to a range of government departments in a range of specific circumstances. In most cases this is not restricted to aggregated or non-identifying information. The intent of clause 59 is to provide a framework under which Inland Revenue can provide information to other government entities to enable either enhanced service provision to the individual, or increased efficiency of government service (for example, avoidance of entitlement overpayments). Restricting the information-sharing framework to non-identifying or aggregated information would not enable the framework to meet this intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 36 Issue: Safeguards that apply when information held by Inland Revenue should also apply to agencies receiving information Submission (KPMG) The framework outlines useful steps to ensure only appropriate information is shared with other agencies. However, the treatment of the information once received by the other agency is also of critical importance. The safeguards that protect information when it is held by Inland Revenue should also apply to the recipient agency, with sufficiently stringent penalties for misuse of the information. Comment The issue of subsequent treatment of information by the recipient agency will be dealt with in the Memorandum of Understanding between Inland Revenue and the recipient agency. It is clearly important from Inland Revenue’s perspective that information accessed via this framework is treated appropriately by the recipient agency. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clause 59 should be reviewed to ensure taxpayers do not suffer in any way as a result of Inland Revenue information being made available to other departments Submission (Hutt Valley Community Law Centre) Taxpayers provide their information to Inland Revenue on the trust that this information will be kept in confidence. In giving this information to Inland Revenue taxpayers are assured that they have no reason to fear it will be given to anyone else, or used for any other purpose. Clause 59 would be a detour from the initial objective of taking that information from taxpayers and would thereby constitute a breach of the trust with which the information was given. The provision should be reviewed to ensure that taxpayers do not suffer in any way as a result of any disclosures to other departments. It is hoped that such access to details and information by others will not be used to the detriment of the taxpayer. Comment Officials agree that taxpayers expect and receive a high degree of confidentiality around the information they provide to Inland Revenue. Officials note that Inland Revenue already discloses or shares a range of information for a variety of reasons under existing legislation. 37 Officials anticipate that many uses of the proposed framework will enable the provision of better, more timely services to individuals. There will, however, be some uses that result in some detriment to a taxpayer, the most likely being if they are receiving some entitlement or service to which they are not entitled. The framework cannot (and should not) exclude such disclosures. These types of disclosure already occur under existing information-matching programmes, albeit in a more constrained and cumbersome way. Officials also note that there is potentially some benefit to such individuals – for example, they will not be accumulating significant debts that will need to be repaid, perhaps with penalties. There will also be administrative gains. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Threshold of “uneconomic” in proposed section 81BA is too high Submission (Matter raised by officials) The threshold requiring that the provision, collection or verification to or by the requesting agency is “uneconomic” set out in subparagraph 81BA(1)(a) is too high and should be amended. Comment This aspect of the threshold test in proposed section 81BA is intended to ensure that sharing under the new framework only occurs when there are cost efficiencies, either to the agencies involved or to individuals (through the reduction of duplication of information provision). Officials consider that the term currently contained in the bill, that the provision, collection or verification to or by the requesting agency is “uneconomic” is too high and could be interpreted to allow information sharing only when it was unaffordable for the requesting agency to collect the information separately. The test is not intended to be so onerous. Officials consider that a more appropriate test of inefficiency should be substituted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 38 Disputes 39 40 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Eight submissions were received on the changes to the tax disputes process contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Submissions were received on wider concerns with the disputes process generally as well as the changes proposed in the bill. Of these wider concerns, two were most prevalent: • that taxpayers should have a unilateral right to opt out of the disputes process; and • that the Commissioner should be subject to more legislated timeframes. Officials understand the concerns giving rise to these submissions – that taxpayers are being “burnt off” by an overly long and elaborate disputes process. However, officials disagree with submitters that legislation is the best way of addressing these concerns. Inland Revenue has very recently introduced fundamentally revised systems to administer disputes. These processes are set out in two standard practice statements (SPSs) and include improved documentation, bilateral opt-out guidelines and most significantly, independently facilitated conferences. It is anticipated that the revised administration will result in a more efficient and satisfactory process, particularly for smaller disputants. The Minister of Revenue has agreed that these SPSs should be given an opportunity to work and has requested that a further review take place in two years – once the revised administrative systems have been given time to “bed in”. If significant taxpayer concerns then remain, further legislative measures can be considered at that time. 41 REMOVAL OF THE SMALL CLAIMS JURISDICTION OF THE TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY Clauses 43(5), 63, 65, 73, 74, 90–93, 97, 98, 100, 101 and 103–107 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society, KPMG) The small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) should be maintained and the procedure for small claims should be reformed. The repeal of the small claims jurisdiction does not address the underlying problem of excessive costs for smaller disputants. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society, KPMG) The Committee should instruct officials to proceed with the development of a low- cost fast-track process to resolve small-sum tax disputes. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) The process for using the small claims jurisdiction should be streamlined or, alternatively, taxpayers should have access to an informal hearing process that does not follow legal or technical rules and is non-precedential. (KPMG) New Zealand should consider the adoption of a simplified tax disputes process for small claims, such as exists in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) Comment Submitters generally agree that the existing small claims procedure does not work as originally intended. There are several possible reasons for this, including the lack of appeal rights and the limited means by which a disputant can elect to use the small claims jurisdiction. Officials agree that smaller claims should generally be handled differently from complex, larger ones. However, we do not agree that separate legislative and court processes are required to resolve problems with smaller claims. Instead, we consider that good administrative practices, coupled with the inherent flexibility of the TRA as a hearing authority, provide the appropriate outcome. As a commission of enquiry, the TRA has considerable flexibility in its procedures, including allowing a taxpayer to represent themselves or be represented by their accountant. The TRA has the ability to ask questions to ensure that the “right” result is reached, irrespective of the expertise of the presenting parties. Following recent administrative changes set out in Inland Revenue standard practice statements (SPSs), a dispute under $75,000 will involve the following steps: 1. Commissioner issues a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). 42 2. Taxpayer responds with a notice of response (NOR), which can be a short document/statement. 3. A conference (facilitated by a senior independent Inland Revenue officer) will take place to provide an opportunity for the parties to discuss the key concerns and reach a settlement, if possible. 4. If the dispute is unresolved, the taxpayer is able to take the case directly to the general jurisdiction of the TRA. The recent SPSs also include guidelines for the length of the Commissioner’s NOPA. For example, when a dispute involves less than $5,000 of core tax, the NOPA should not exceed 5 pages in length, and when the dispute concerns a single issue, the NOPA should not exceed 10 pages. It is anticipated these shorter NOPAs will further reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Officials consider that the process outlined is appropriate for a small dispute. Having a process more truncated than this would defeat the objectives of the disputes process to ensure that cases are well-prepared – and the respective parties’ positions understood – before the case goes to court. Officials do not consider comparisons with overseas jurisdictions to be particularly helpful in this context. The procedures for small claims in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada were discussed in the disputes issues paper released in July 2010. The paper noted that New Zealand has a unique tax disputes resolution system that requires various steps in the process to be completed before the issue of an assessment. The same point was also noted in the submission from New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society. Although a specialist process appears to be appropriate in the systems of some other countries, within the New Zealand system, officials consider that administrative solutions are preferable to a separate legislative system for small claims. Finally, it is important to recognise that a “small” claim does not necessarily equate to a “simple” claim. Some claims involving relatively small amounts of money raise complex legal issues that may have significant precedential value to the particular taxpayer or to a wider section of the taxpayer community (for example, a specific industry group). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 43 THE “CHALLENGE NOTICE” AND OPT-OUT FOR TAXPAYER- INITIATED DISPUTES Clauses 67 and 70 Submissions (KPMG, Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Hutt Valley Community Law Centre, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) The proposal to introduce a “challenge notice” should not proceed. Because the proposals do not provide any certainty that a challenge notice will be issued at all, they effectively require the Commissioner to give “permission” before the taxpayer can issue a challenge in the courts. This breaches section 27(3) of the Bill of Rights Act 1990, which protects a citizen’s right to bring civil proceedings against the Crown in the same way as civil proceedings against individuals. The current section 138B provides taxpayers with certainty of access to the courts and should be retained. The suggestion in the Commentary to the bill that the changes proposed by clause 70 would level the playing field between taxpayers and the Commissioner is incorrect because the Commissioner is not compelled to take various steps in the process and the Commissioner has various rights under the process (such as the ability to apply to the court for a truncated process) that are not afforded to taxpayers. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) The provision is potentially retrospective because it does not carve out disputes that have already begun. (Russell McVeagh) If the challenge notice provision is to proceed, the Commissioner’s refusal to issue such a notice should be a disputable decision that can itself be challenged. (Ernst & Young) Comment The changes in clauses 67 and 70 are designed to ensure that, unless an exception applies, the full process is followed irrespective of whether the Commissioner or the taxpayer initiated the dispute. It is intended that the challenge notice be equivalent to an amended assessment for taxpayer-initiated disputes; that is, the final step in the process that launches the challenge right (a right to begin litigation). Officials consider this is still an appropriate objective. The changes are not intended to provide a block to taxpayers appearing before the courts. However, officials have been advised by Crown Law that the disputes process cannot be indefinite without raising Bill of Rights Act 1990 concerns, and the lack of statutory timeframes in the taxpayer-initiated disputes process does raise the theoretical possibility of the process stagnating. 44 To address these concerns, officials consider that a timeframe should be introduced for the proposed challenge notice. The timeframe should be set to ensure symmetry between the taxpayer-initiated and Commissioner-initiated disputes processes. We therefore recommend that the Commissioner should be compelled to produce a challenge notice within four years of the commencement of the dispute (that is, the issuing of the taxpayer’s NOPA). The timeframes set out in the relevant SPSs anticipate the disputes process being completed well within this four-year period. However, to make the timeframe shorter could provide a perverse incentive for taxpayers to begin disputes because they would be guaranteed a faster outcome than under the Commissioner-initiated process. This is an important consideration given that many taxpayer-initiated disputes are complex and may involve difficult questions of interpretation, including how the general anti- avoidance legislation applies. This is to be expected, as the benefit of a taxpayer- initiated dispute is that it protects the taxpayer from the imposition of penalties. Another consideration is that the Commissioner is required to allocate resources to audit functions as well as disputes. The recommendation would therefore allow this resource to be allocated over a four-year period, irrespective of the genesis of the dispute. Having a timeframe for the issue of a challenge notice would not be effective without a sanction being in place for a failure to comply. Officials consider that, if a challenge notice was not issued in time, the Commissioner should be deemed to accept the position set out by the taxpayer. This should address the points raised in the Ernst & Young submission. Officials recommend that this issue be reconsidered in two years’ time, along with the review of the administrative changes proposed by the Minister of Revenue. Officials agree with the Russell McVeagh submission that the revised rules should only apply to disputes where the taxpayer’s NOPA is received after the enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions calling for the removal of the challenge notice provision and reinstatement of the existing section 138B(3) be declined. That submissions raising concerns about the Bill of Rights Act 1990 be accepted and addressed by imposing a four-year statutory timeframe on the Commissioner for issuing a challenge notice. That this recommendation be reviewed by officials in two years’ time. That the relevant provisions only take effect for disputes begun after enactment of the bill. 45 REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THAT EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES APPLY Clauses 43(7), 64 and 71 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) Section 138E(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to ensure the taxpayer may dispute the Commissioner’s refusal to issue the requisite section 89K(1) notice. (Ernst & Young) The proposed amendment to the “disputable decision” definition should be clarified to make it clear that taxpayers are entitled to challenge the Commissioner’s discretion without having to go through the disputes process first. The submission also questions whether the “disputable decision definition” should still refer to section 89L. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) The Commissioner should be required to make a decision on whether to accept late documents within one month. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) Comment The amendments to section 89K are designed to introduce a new limb to the “exceptional circumstances” test. The Commissioner will have the discretion to accept dispute documents submitted out of time when the taxpayer has a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process. If the Commissioner refuses to exercise the discretion in the taxpayer’s favour, it is intended that the taxpayer will immediately be able to challenge that decision in the TRA. This is to avoid the substantive dispute (if it is to continue) being unduly delayed by the discretionary decision itself being taken through the disputes procedure or judicial review proceedings. Submitters are concerned that the legislation does not adequately reflect this policy, and have indicated there is some confusion over whether the whole disputes process is required to be followed in these circumstances. Officials agree that clarification is required. This will be achieved by stating that the Commissioner’s decision under section 89K is, for the purposes of the specific challenge right, treated as a disputable decision. As noted under the next submission heading, it is intended that the Commissioner will publish guidelines on what is considered to be a “demonstrable intention to dispute”. 46 Officials agree that a timely decision by the Commissioner is desirable and that the Commissioner should be required to make a decision on whether to accept late documents within one month of receiving the document. As suggested by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society submission, failure to do so should allow the taxpayer to exercise their discretion to have the decision (or lack of) reviewed by the courts. With regard to section 89L, the provision that decisions made under that section are not “disputable” has been moved in the bill to section 138E(1)(e)(iv). Officials are comfortable that this amendment will result in the status quo being maintained. Recommendation That the submission that there is a one-month time limit on the Commissioner’s decision be accepted. That the submission that the wording of the specific challenge right be clarified be accepted. That the submission relating to whether “disputable decision” definition should still refer to section 89L be declined. 47 ACCEPTING LATE DOCUMENTS Clause 64 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commissioner should have a general discretion to accept late documents and should not be limited by the proposed “intention to dispute” test or alternatively the Commissioner should have a discretion to extend the deadline by which a document must be provided. If the “intention to dispute” test is to be retained, the legislation should clarify how this test applies or at a minimum, Inland Revenue should issue guidelines to clarify the issue. Comment Officials do not consider that a general discretion to accept late documents or extend deadlines is appropriate. This would have the potential to render deadlines meaningless and allow tax disputes to stagnate indefinitely. If a general discretion were permitted, it could also be inadvertently applied differently in different cases, leading to unfairness and uncertainty in the process. The “intention to dispute” test has been proposed as a way of ensuring that taxpayers with a genuine grievance are not denied advancing their dispute because of procedural technicalities. To protect the integrity of the tax system, timeframes must be robust and only relaxed in exceptional cases. To this end, Inland Revenue, as proposed by the submission, intends to release an interpretation statement on the “intention to dispute” test after enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined in part. That an Inland Revenue interpretation statement be issued on the “intention to dispute” test to clarify how the test applies. 48 SCOPE OF THE EVIDENCE EXCLUSION RULE Clauses 70 and 72 Submission (Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The evidence exclusion rule contained in section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and modified by clause 72 of the bill should also apply to disputes that are subject to the fast-track procedure introduced by clause 70 of the bill. Comment The evidence exclusion rule (EER), as modified by clause 72 of the bill, applies to limit the parties to the issues and propositions of law contained in their respective statements of position (SOP). This means the parties cannot raise new issues or propositions of law in a hearing authority (unless leave of the relevant hearing authority is obtained), but are not limited to the facts and evidence in their SOP. Submitters generally support the amendment to the EER. However, some have suggested that the rule should also apply to disputes that are subject to the fast-track procedure introduced by clause 70 of the bill. This procedure effectively provides taxpayers with an ability to begin a dispute and then have immediate access to the courts in two set circumstances: • when the dispute is materially identical to a dispute that the taxpayer has engaged in for previous periods (and that dispute is before the courts); • when the taxpayer is correcting a position that is dependent on a position adopted by another taxpayer (for example, a company is adjusting its income because losses it has received from another company have been disallowed). The new fast-track procedure is being introduced to expedite access to the courts for disputes that are identical to existing court cases. This is designed to allow these ancillary disputes to “catch up” to the substantive dispute in the expectation that, once the ancillary dispute reaches court, the court will use its powers to consolidate the two proceedings. It is therefore anticipated that both disputes will be heard “as one” and the EER will apply in a consistent manner accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 49 DRAFTING MATTERS Clauses 68, 69 and 70 Issue: Whether the wording in clauses 68 and 69 is sufficiently clear as to which challenge is relevant Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) The wording in proposed clauses 68 and 69 should be amended to “the day on which that challenge ...” to clarify that the relevant challenge is the challenge to the Commissioner’s decision under section 89K, not any other challenge between the parties. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting changes should be made to proposed section 138B(4)(c)(ii) Submission (Russell McVeagh) Proposed section 138B(4)(c)(ii) should be redrafted so that it correctly applies when a taxpayer is affected by a position taken by another taxpayer. Comment Proposed section 138B(4)(c)(ii) is designed to provide a direct equivalent for taxpayer-initiated disputes to section 89C(k) (which applies to disputes initiated by the Commissioner). The wording used in the bill reflects this by reproducing the section 89C(k) wording. However, officials agree that the last part of the wording: “...the Commissioner has made, or is able to make, an assessment...”, may not be clear in the context of adjustments proposed by a taxpayer. The suggestion that the reference point should be “the subject of court proceedings” seems appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, to the extent that the wording relates to disputes already before the courts. 50 OTHER MATTERS RAISED ON DISPUTES Issue: No opt-out right exists in Commissioner-initiated disputes Submissions (KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) Taxpayers should be given a legislative right to opt out of disputes initiated by the Commissioner. This would allow taxpayers the opportunity to progress the matter directly to court in situations when the taxpayer sees little benefit from engaging in the full disputes process. This opt-out right could take effect either immediately after the exchange of the NOPA and NOR (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh) or after the conference phase (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society). Taxpayers in disputes of less than $50,000 should have the right to opt out at any time. (KPMG) Taxpayers should have a right that mirrors the Commissioner’s ability to apply to the High Court to have the process truncated. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) Comment The submissions for legislating for a taxpayer opt-out reflect a concern that taxpayers are “burnt off” by the full disputes process. To address these concerns, Inland Revenue recently published revised SPSs on the administration of the disputes process. These SPSs include guidelines on when the Commissioner will agree to opt out of the disputes process, so the dispute can progress straight to court. Criteria for the Commissioner agreeing to opt out include that the core tax in dispute is $75,000 or less. Under the guidelines, an opt-out will also be agreed to if a materially identical dispute is either before the courts or has previously been considered by Inland Revenue’s Adjudication Unit. Although submitters consider reliance on administrative practices to be inferior to a legislative right, officials are concerned that legislating for administrative practice can have unforeseen consequences and result in further litigation about the application of any new provision. It is expected that the revised administrative practices (as set out in the SPSs) will result in a more satisfactory disputes process for taxpayers. The Minister of Revenue is aware of the competing arguments and has requested that a review of the effectiveness of the administrative opt-out guidelines (and other key administrative measures) be conducted in approximately two years’ time. 51 Officials do not agree with the suggestion that taxpayers should have a right to apply to the High Court for an order that the process be truncated. The provision that allows the Commissioner to make such an application is rarely used in practice. When it is used, it is either as a revenue-protection provision, which prevents taxpayers from unduly delaying the process when they know that the Commissioner’s four-year statutory time-bar may work in their favour, or as a cost-saving mechanism when there are numerous substantially similar disputes that are not suitable for test-case treatment. The new opt-out guidelines are likely to result in more cases being truncated and therefore less need for the taxpayer to apply to court. In addition, taxpayers now know when the Commissioner will agree to a truncated process, providing comfort about whether a particular dispute will go through a truncated or the full disputes process. In cases when the dispute is not specifically covered by the opt-out guidelines, taxpayers will still be able to request that the Commissioner agree to opt out. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The Commissioner should be subject to more statutory timeframes in the disputes process Submissions (KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) There are numerous steps in the disputes process when the Commissioner is not under any explicit timeframe for advancing the dispute. Leaving these intermediate timeframes to administrative practice is harmful to the integrity of the tax system because delay can result in increased costs for the taxpayer through the accumulation of legal fees and use-of-money interest. Also, there are no effective sanctions for failure to meet administrative timeframes. The Commissioner should be subject to roughly the same legislative timeframes that the Tax Administration Act 1994 places on taxpayers. Comment The recently released Inland Revenue SPSs set out timeframes for each intermediate step of the disputes process. If these administrative timeframes are not going to be met, approval from a senior Inland Revenue manager is required. This increased accountability on Inland Revenue staff has resulted in timeframes being met in all but a few instances. In those instances the documents have been issued as soon as possible after the timeframe has lapsed. 52 Administrative timeframes allow Inland Revenue staff to appropriately allocate resources to particular disputes. If rigid statutory timeframes were in place, there is a risk that smaller disputes will be reprioritised, and potentially extended out, to ensure that larger disputes meet the statutory timeframe. It is also worth noting that, although timeframes are not provided for each step of the disputes process, the Commissioner is nevertheless subject to the four-year statutory time-bar for amending assessments. Given that most disputes arise following an Inland Revenue audit of past years’ activities, adhering to this time-bar will in many cases be sufficient motivation for the Commissioner to advance the dispute in a timely manner. The Minister of Revenue has requested that the effectiveness of administrative timeframes in the SPS be reviewed in two years’ time. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The test case provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be repealed Submission (Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The current test case procedures set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be repealed and any test case situations should be dealt with through the High Court’s general jurisdiction to stay proceedings in tax matters. Comment In the 2010 issues paper, Disputes: a review, officials signalled (as noted in the Corporate Taxpayers Group submission) that their preferred option was to continue to have a tax-specific test-case procedure, but one where test-case designation and other relevant matters is determined by the High Court. Ministers agreed that this option should be more fully explored with the Ministry of Justice to ensure that the appropriate balances are struck between efficient test-case designation procedure for tax cases and the workload of the High Court more generally. This has not yet proceeded because of other tax work programme priorities. However, it is anticipated that further consultation will result in changes to the test-case rules in a future tax bill. Officials believe that repealing the existing rules would create unnecessary confusion in the short-term, if repeal were to be used as a temporary solution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 Issue: Use-of-money interest should be suspended in certain circumstances Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) Use-of-money interest should be suspended for the course of a dispute (PricewaterhouseCoopers); if the Commissioner fails to meet an imposed deadline (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society). Comment Use-of-money interest (UOMI) is a “no fault” concept, designed to be administratively workable by ensuring that exceptions are kept to a minimum. Suspending UOMI for the period of a dispute could therefore be seen as a mechanism for encouraging non-compliant taxpayers to “stop the clock” by engaging in the disputes process. Suspending UOMI when the Commissioner fails to meet an administrative deadline would not recognise the fact that some administrative deadlines relate to periods when both parties to a disputes exert a certain degree of control, such as the conference. For example, a blanket suspension of UOMI for a failure by the Commissioner to advance to the next stage of the dispute following the conference would not take into account the fact that taxpayers can also delay the process. In any event, the Commissioner does exercise a degree of discretion when quantifying UOMI. If an undue delay in the process is attributable to Inland Revenue, remission of UOMI will be considered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 54 Issue: Whether, in a dispute that does not involve the exchange of SOPs, the Commissioner should be limited in court to the “grounds of assessment” and the taxpayer to their legal grounds for dispute Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants/New Zealand Law Society) When a dispute is truncated, there needs to be a statutory rule which limits the Commissioner to grounds of assessment and an equivalent rule limiting taxpayers to their legal grounds for dispute. Comment Currently there are two sets of rules, depending on whether SOPs have been exchanged as part of the dispute: • If SOPs have been exchanged, the evidence exclusion rule will apply to limit the parties on the issues and propositions of law that can be raised in court. • If SOPs have not been exchanged, there are no statutory limitations on matters that can be raised. Officials consider this to be a generally desirable outcome – parties are either bound by their court documents or their SOPs. A truncated disputes process is a means of getting a dispute to court faster than it would otherwise. In these circumstances, it is logical for the court documents to be the most important feature of the dispute. The taxpayer’s argument is set out in their Notice of Claim (in the TRA) and the Commissioner’s argument is set out in the Notice of Defence. The court holds the parties to the content of those documents unless there are sound reasons for deviating from them. To limit the Commissioner to the grounds on which an assessment is reached would result in one party (the Commissioner) being bound to a pre-court document, with the other party (the taxpayer) producing their first “binding” document as part of the court process. Such a rule could see the taxpayer raise an issue for the first time as part of the Notice of Claim. If the Commissioner were bound to the grounds of assessment, the court’s approval to respond would presumably have to be sought. Although having the issues in a dispute identified early is consistent with the policy behind the disputes process, officials do not consider that binding only one party to their pre-court documents is a desirable way of achieving this aim. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 55 Issue: Whether the disputes resolution process meets its stated policy objectives Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The current disputes process is ineffective as a resolution process and the policy objectives of the disputes process are not being met. The Government should carry out a review of the effectiveness of the disputes resolution process and consider changes accordingly. Comment The current disputes resolution process reflects the recommendations of the Richardson Review undertaken in the early 1990s. Although many concerns have been raised about the administration of the disputes process and how much of the process should be explicitly legislated for there have previously been no serious suggestions that the fundamentals of the process should be revisited. Administrative changes recently introduced by Inland Revenue and the legislative amendments proposed in the bill should significantly improve the effectiveness of the disputes process and better align it with its stated policy objectives. As mentioned previously in this report, the Minister of Revenue has requested a further review of the effectiveness of the process in approximately two years’ time. Such a review would, as a matter of course, consider how the process is working within its policy objectives. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The consequences of breaching the evidence exclusion rule are not set out in the bill Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill should set out the consequences of breaching the EER, particularly, whether the omission of an issue from a SOP means that the relevant party is excluded from raising it in further proceedings. Comment Officials consider this issue to be reasonably clear. The proposed drafting of the EER (in section 138G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, as amended by clause 72) provides that the “Commissioner and the disputant may raise in the challenge only the 56 issues and propositions of law that are disclosed in the Commissioner’s and disputant’s statements of position”. Section 138G(2) provides a hearing authority with a discretion to allow new issues or propositions of law to be raised in certain circumstances. There have been numerous court cases that have referenced the EER. Most of these revolve around a party trying to exclude the other disputant from advancing a proposition on the basis that it is “new”. This appears to confirm that the starting presumption is that entirely new issues or propositions of law will be excluded from court proceedings unless an exception applies. Officials consider the wording of the legislation, as applied by the courts, provides sufficiently clear consequences for breaching the EER without the need for specific legislation on the matter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Should the taxpayer or Commissioner be required to produce a SOP Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Given that both the NOPA and the SOP are required to cover the same issues and propositions of law, SOPs may not serve any useful function and are potentially an exercise in repetition. As a result, the SOP should not be a legislative requirement. Instead, the NOPA or NOR, with further submissions after the conference phase should suffice for the adjudication process. Comment Officials agree there can be some repetition in the content of a NOPA/NOR and SOP. However, it is considered that the SOP is an important document in focussing the dispute for the adjudication process and any subsequent court proceedings. If a dispute has gone through the conference phase, it is likely that some issues have been resolved and those that are remaining have been further refined. Having the NOPA or NOR supplemented by further submissions, as the submission suggests, may result in longer documents that contain redundant material. In any event, a degree of repetition does not necessarily equate to significant time or compliance costs for the disputants. Having a single SOP that contains all the relevant issues and propositions of law to which the EER applies is considered preferable to supplementing the initial disputes documents, which may have been superseded by subsequent discussions. 57 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether the entire disputes process, particularly the administrative functions of the Commissioner’s Adjudication Unit, should be legislated for Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The approach favoured by Inland Revenue and reflected in the bill, that legislative change be kept to a minimum, provides taxpayers with little certainty about how disputes will proceed. Leaving parts of the disputes process open to the discretion of the Commissioner is harmful to the tax system. Having an uncertain process discourages taxpayers from challenging the Commissioner’s view, particularly when the courts have held that the Commissioner is not bound to follow non-statutory parts of the process. The disputes process should therefore be legislated as far as practically possible. Consistent with this view, the adjudication phase should be legislated for to provide taxpayers that do engage in the entire process the opportunity for the arguments to be independently reviewed within Inland Revenue. Comment Officials consider that a disputes process that is guided by statute rather than rigidly controlled by it is preferable in most instances. One of the main recommendations of the Richardson Committee was that disputes should have every opportunity to be resolved before reaching the courts. Key to this are the adjudication and conference phases of the process, which could be compromised by adherence to inflexible statutory processes. Other considerations include: • More legislation leads to more disputes about the scope of the legislative provisions, resulting in substantive disputes being delayed by ancillary litigation about the process. • Disputes that take the longest are generally more complex and can have the highest potential revenue impact. In these cases it is more important to focus on the resolution of the dispute rather than adhering to detailed statutory rules about the process (which could also cause unnecessary delays for smaller disputes). • Strict timeframes around latter parts of the process may encourage Inland Revenue staff to “front-load” the dispute, lessening the possibility of an early resolution. 58 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether the Commissioner and the taxpayer should be allowed to apply jointly to the High Court for a consent order to extend the time period for the Commissioner’s NOR Submission (Ernst & Young) Section 89L should be amended to allow taxpayers and the Commissioner to make joint applications to the High Court for a consent order to extend the time period for the Commissioner to provide a NOR. Comment Under section 89H, if the Commissioner does not provide a NOR within two months of receiving the taxpayer’s NOPA, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the taxpayer’s position. Officials agree in theory with there being an ability to extend the response period in appropriate circumstances. Because it would be a joint submission, taxpayers would still retain a considerable degree of control over when the NOR was to be received. However, this is not an issue that has been consulted on as part of the amendments in the bill. Given the concerns expressed in submissions about timeframes, officials consider this issue should be subject to the full generic tax policy process. It is therefore a matter that we suggest be included in the anticipated review of the disputes process in two years’ time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 59 Issue: The Commissioner should publish redacted adjudication reports Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When an adjudication occurs, Inland Revenue should publish the adjudication report in redacted form so that taxpayers can understand the legal outcome and reasoning on those facts, while still protecting the identity of the taxpayer concerned. Comment Inland Revenue is considering the competing arguments for publishing redacted adjudication reports. However, given that adjudication itself is not legislated for, there seems little benefit in legislating for publication of the subsequent reports. As such, officials consider this is a matter that is best dealt with through ongoing dialogue between the Institute and the relevant areas of Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 60 Tax pooling 61 62 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Clauses 33 – 35 and 79 Five submissions were received on tax pooling. In general the submissions were supportive of the amendments proposed. Some technical issues were raised. A number of further amendments are recommended by officials, to either clarify the proposed legislation or make further changes. Issue: Pooling provisions in the bill generally Submission (Tax Management New Zealand) The proposals in the bill are unduly bureaucratic and burdensome to both the private and public sectors. They will require Inland Revenue to incur precisely the kinds of low productivity costs the Government is trying to drive out of the public sector. The concerns expressed in the Regulatory Impact Statement can be met in ways which meet the objective of not exposing the Government to undue tax risk, while reducing costs. Comment Officials consider the proposed amendments deal with the concerns raised in the Regulatory Impact Statement by removing the restrictions for taxpayers who use their own funds. Taxpayers who purchase funds will be allowed to acquire these on the expectation of having tax to pay which will shift Inland Revenue’s focus from checking the vast majority of tax pooling transfers to only needing to check a very small minority. Additionally, when over-purchases occur the proposed amendments provide for the over-purchased funds to be used by the taxpayer in one of three different ways without having to revisit the original transfer request with the tax pooling intermediary. The reduction in compliance costs of the proposed amendments will be significant for intermediaries, tax agents, taxpayers and Inland Revenue, while still balancing the need to protect the revenue base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 Issue: Early balance dates and the 60-day limit Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) We support the extension of the 60-day time limit for the transfer of tax pooling funds but consider that it should be extended to 90 days. (Tax Pooling Solutions) The time limit for using tax pooling to pay current year income tax should be further extended to 80 to 85 days at a minimum. The 75-day time limit is still an issue in a leap year. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The time limit for using tax pooling to pay current year income tax should be further extended to 85 or 90 days. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) Comment Officials note that the purpose of the amendment is to deal with problems with some early balance dates (mostly December balance dates) and that the amendment was specifically requested by submitters. Officials agree that the proposed time limit will still be a problem for some early balance dates in a leap year. Officials propose that it is appropriate that an amendment is made so that in a leap year, for some early balance date taxpayers, the time limit is 76 days. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that in a leap year, for October, November and December early balance date taxpayers the time limit is 76 days. Issue: Removal of the 60-day time limit to access deposit funds for associated persons Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions) Taxpayers who want to access funds held by a tax pooling intermediary to meet their provisional or terminal tax liabilities must do so within 60 days of their terminal date to use the funds at backdated credit dates. New section RP 17B(4)(b) provides that the time limit will no longer apply for “own funds” provided the taxpayer is not overdue in filing their return for the tax year. The proposed removal of the time limit for own funds is supported. However, the 60-day time limit should also be removed with respect to funds deposited by a member of the same group of companies, partner in the same partnership or other related party described in section 173M(2)(a)-(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 64 If a person makes a tax payment directly to the Commissioner rather than into a tax pool, section 173L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows excess tax to be transferred to related parties at the date the tax was paid. There is no time limit on such transfers. There should be the same ability to make transfers to related parties from funds deposited in tax pooling accounts. Imposing a time limit on the use of funds deposited in a tax pool by a related party unfairly disadvantages taxpayers who deposit into tax pooling accounts. Comment Officials agree that an amendment to remove the time limit for own funds should be extended to apply to a member of the same group of companies based on the membership of the group at the time of deposit or purchase, and use of the tax pooling funds. This is because companies in the same group operate as one economic entity and often will make one deposit into a tax pooling account for the benefit of all their group members. Group companies often will not know their exposure to tax until inter-group transactions are completed, including end-of-year loss offsets and subvention payments. This makes it very difficult for group companies to determine when and how much they should deposit individually, but they will know globally what their tax exposure is. Officials agree that as currently drafted, the proposed amendments would only allow the depositing group member to use the deposit as its own funds. The other members would be treated as having acquired the funds if they use them. Officials consider the benefits of the 66% commonality provisions in the Income Tax Act for group companies should not be constrained by the pooling rules as this would create compliance costs for group companies. This will ensure tax pooling is consistent with the practice by group companies to make provisional tax payments directly into the tax account of only one member and following the filing of the all of the groups’ tax returns, request transfers within the group to allocate the payments following the elections to make loss offset sand subvention payments. In the absence of this amendment, group companies would have to make individual deposits into a tax pooling account, creating unnecessary compliance costs that do not arise if payment is made directly to the Commissioner. In both situations group companies should have the same treatment apply. Non-group companies, partners in a partnership and other related parties are not treated as the same economic entity and cannot make loss offsets or subvention payments. These entities are able to make their own deposits and use these funds to pay their own taxes and (with the changes proposed in the bill) will be able to continue to do so with fewer restrictions than currently apply. Extending the use of deposits to include other associated taxpayers as suggested would not be appropriate. It would create compliance risks and administrative burdens on intermediaries, tax agents and the Commissioner over who would be authorised to instruct an intermediary to ask the Commissioner to make a transfer, and who the Commissioner would be able to discuss this with should there be a problem with a transfer. If this time limit were removed for non-group companies, partners in a partnership and related parties, the pooling regime would be undermined. It would result in tax pooling funds being able to be used to meet tax obligations of related parties that the related party could not obtain itself from a tax pooling intermediary if the time limit to file income tax returns were missed. For example, if a taxpayer failed to file their tax return by the due date, they are not able to use tax pooling after 60 days (the bill proposes 75 days) have passed from their terminal tax date. If however the taxpayer 65 were able to transfer backdated pooling funds to an associate, that associate could then transfer the funds back to the taxpayer after they were received. This circumvents the tax pooling rules by misuse of the transfer rules. If an associated person were to receive backdated tax pooling funds, these would not be their own deposit. This would create inequities between associated taxpayers and non-associated taxpayers, who acquire other taxpayers’ funds as the bill proposes restrictions to how purchased pooling funds can be used if these are not applied to meet income tax obligations. Additionally it would allow associated taxpayers to meet historic tax arrears (for example PAYE, GST and Child Support) through the use of another taxpayer’s tax pooling deposits which is proposed to be restricted to “own” deposited funds only. Administrative burdens would also be imposed upon tax pooling intermediaries to keep detailed records of all deposits that are transferred to associated persons. Disclosures would be required by intermediaries at the time of the transfer of funds from the tax pooling account and a verification process would need to be applied by Inland Revenue to check each transfer to ensure that the parties are related. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Obligations that cannot be quantified Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions) The proposed amendment to allow a taxpayer to transfer funds from a tax pooling account to its taxpayer account in anticipation of an income tax obligation that cannot be quantified at the time of transfer is supported. Such transfers are currently rejected due to “excess funds”. Section RP 19B clearly only applies when a taxpayer purchases funds from a tax pool for expected tax liabilities. It does not apply when a taxpayer transfers funds that it has deposited itself. This, along with the reference to the transfer of the “amount of the funds deposited by the person under section RP 18” in section RP 17B(7)(b), suggests that there are not intended to be any restrictions on the transfer of funds deposited by a taxpayer into a tax pool itself. A taxpayer should be able to transfer all of its own funds to its taxpayer account at any time, regardless of whether the taxpayer currently has any obligation in respect of the anticipated tax liability or such a transfer would result in “excess funds”. This is the correct approach. The beginning of section RP 17B(7)(b) refers to the transfer of funds from a tax pooling account to “meet an obligation to pay tax”. A taxpayer who expects to incur tax liabilities that are not yet quantified does not have an “obligation” in respect of such liabilities so, as drafted, this section would prevent a taxpayer transferring the total amount of funds that it deposited into the tax pool if that amount was in excess of 66 its then current tax obligations. This means that taxpayers can transfer purchased funds to meet expected tax liabilities but cannot use their own funds to do so. Comment The submitter states that a taxpayer cannot use own funds to pay more tax than they owe. This is not correct. However, taxpayers who buy funds will only be able to transfer what they owe (subject to new section RP 19B which allows taxpayers to use funds in a pooling account towards the payment of a future liability if certain criteria are met). The amendments mean that people who use their own funds will be able to transfer the total amount of their deposit as long as they do so within 75 days of their terminal tax date if they have not filed their tax return, or at any time if they have filed a return. Officials consider that the provision should be clarified so that it is clear that an exception is being made and to clarify the relationship between sections RP 17B(7)(b) and RP 19B. That is, section RP 17B (7)(b) is subject to section RP 19B. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Transfer of purchased tax pooling funds that become “excess tax” Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions) Proposed section RP 19B(5)(b) states that if a transfer under section RP 19B results in excess tax, the amount is “transferred with an effective date that is no earlier than the date on which the Commissioner received the later request”. It is unclear what the “later” request refers to. There appears to be only one “request” – the request to transfer the funds from the tax pooling account. Presuming that this is the “request” referred to in section RP 19B(5)(b), that is unfair to transfer the funds with an effective date no earlier than the date of the transfer request. The Commissioner has had the use of those funds from the original date of deposit and the taxpayer has paid interest to the intermediary to purchase funds with that effective date. Such excess tax should retain its effective date and, if it is refunded to the taxpayer, the Commissioner should pay use-of-money interest to the taxpayer from the effective date until the refund date. If it does not, the Commissioner would receive a windfall gain and compliant taxpayers would be unfairly penalised. Comment Officials note that the reference to “later” date refers to the use of tax pooling funds that have not been applied to meet income tax obligations. For example, if a taxpayer owes $5,000 provisional tax and expects their terminal tax will be $10,000, they will be able to purchase $10,000 at backdated credit dates and have this transferred to their tax account. If, when they file their return, their tax obligation turns out to be only 67 $7,500, they will have a $2,500 credit resulting from purchased tax pooling funds. The proposed amendments allow this $2,500 to be transferred to meet other non- income tax obligations, or transferred to other taxpayers. However backdating the credit date of the $2,500 would create a compliance risk. Taxpayers could deliberately over-purchase tax pooling funds to deal with their own or associated taxpayers’ tax debts that tax pooling should not be used for, such as child support obligations. Additionally, such transfers would also undermine the effective date restrictions contained in the transfer rules by circumventing these through over- purchasing tax pooling funds. The proposed amendment will not restrict taxpayers from using purchased tax pooling funds at backdated credit dates to meet their own provisional tax or income tax obligations. Officials will ensure that the explanatory commentary of the proposed rules contains examples to ensure that this is made clear. Officials note that taxpayers will continue to receive use-of-money interest on any excess tax refunded to them or that is unable to be applied at backdated effective credit dates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New effective dates Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) Clause 34 amends section RP 19(3) by extending the situations when a taxpayer who requests a transfer to their account from a tax pool cannot have that transfer effective from the date that the money was deposited in the pool. Current section RP 19(3) allows the effective date to be the date the amount was actually deposited in the tax pool so long as the 60-day limit is met (proposed to be extended by the bill to 75 days). The proposed change would make the effective date of a transfer of funds not originally deposited by the person to be no earlier than the date the obligation of the person to pay the tax arises. The intention of this change appears to be to prevent taxpayers using tax pooling to eliminate imputation credit account deficits. This change is inappropriate from a policy perspective. There is no reason why a taxpayer who discovers, say in June 2011, that they have an imputation credit account debit at say 31 March 2010, should not be able to remedy that debit by acquiring a tax pooling deposit with an effective date before 31 March 2010, say 15 January 2010. The Government has had the tax since 15 January 2010. Comment Tax pooling is not intended to be used to meet further income tax obligations that arise when an imputation credit account has a debit closing balance at the end of an 68 imputation year. Making the change as suggested will circumvent the imputation credit account rules which do not allow for backdated payments to meet or eliminate further income tax obligations. In addition, making the change as suggested would create a compliance risk. That is, there would be no incentive for companies to ensure their imputation credit accounts are nil or in credit as at 31 March if they can use tax pooling at retrospective dates to correct debits. This would result in taxpayers borrowing funds from the Government to pay shareholders dividends with imputation credits attached. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Establishing an “obligation” to pay tax before requesting a transfer to taxpayer’s own tax account Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) Clause 33(3) of the bill proposes to replace subsection RP 17B(4) of the Act. The general purpose of the replacement is to remove certain obstacles to taxpayers requesting transfers to their own accounts from a tax pool, which have given rise to unfair and arbitrary outcomes. However, the most significant unnecessary obstacle is retained. This is the requirement that before a taxpayer requests a transfer from the tax pool into a person’s account, the person must have established an obligation to pay tax. Accordingly there is no reason for the Government to refuse to accept a transfer of any amount of tax from a tax pool to a taxpayer account to pay provisional or terminal tax, provided the time limit is met (applicable only if a taxpayer is using a deposit acquired from another person). Removing the requirement for taxpayers to establish an obligation before requesting a transfer will greatly reduce the amount of checking and liaising required by Inland Revenue, intermediaries and agents. Proposed section RP 17B(4) should therefore be amended by replacing the words “satisfy an obligation for” with the word “pay”. We note the concerns expressed at paragraph 22 of the Regulatory Impact Statement, and are confident that they can be met in other ways. In particular, the restrictions on requesting transfers from a tax pool should be subject to the same transfer rules that restrict transfers of excess tax. At present, the rules applying to transfers from a tax pool are significantly more onerous. (Tax Management New Zealand) Taxpayers should not have to establish an “obligation” to pay tax before requesting a transfer to their own tax account. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 69 Comment Officials consider the proposed amendments deal with the concerns above by providing no limit/restriction for using a taxpayer’s own funds, provided the tax return for that tax year is received by the due date. The return is necessary for reasons of voluntary compliance and revenue forecasting. For purchased funds the proposed pooling amendments will allow taxpayers to make purchases on the expectation of owing tax. If a taxpayer over-purchases funds they will be allowed to use these funds to meet other obligations with certain restrictions on using backdated credit dates. These restrictions are necessary as the transfer rules do not allow taxpayers to use funds at backdated credit dates that have been purchased from other taxpayers, and tax pooling should not be able to be used to achieve this outcome. Otherwise taxpayers could purchase funds and obtain backdated effective dates to use them to meet obligations that tax pooling was never intended to meet. Officials consider such use would undermine the transfer rules, and create revenue risks and disincentives to voluntary compliance. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Restrictions on transfers Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) Clause 33(7) imposes limits on the amount a person can request to be transferred to their own account from a tax pool. For example, if the person is acquiring a deposit made from another person to pay terminal tax, the maximum amount they can ask to be transferred is the amount of terminal tax payable. There should not be a restriction on the amount that a person can transfer. Comment Officials consider that having no restrictions on using purchased tax pooling funds is a compliance risk. It removes the incentive for non-compliant taxpayers to be compliant as they know they can avoid all of the consequences by buying another taxpayer’s funds. The consequences referred to are late payment penalties and use-of- money interest that would otherwise be payable. It would also provide opportunities for taxpayers to pay tax arrears that tax pooling is not intended to meet – for example, unpaid child support obligations. Additionally, the general transfer rules would be circumvented by allowing more purchased funds than the tax the taxpayer owes to be transferred at backdated credit dates. If a taxpayer can transfer more purchased funds at backdated credit dates, these could be transferred to associated taxpayers to meet 70 their obligations – for example, historic tax arrears, which tax pooling is not intended for. Officials consider that the proposed amendments to allow taxpayers to use excess purchased funds, with certain restrictions, deal with the issues appropriately, while balancing the risk to the revenue base of misuse of the transfer rules to avoid interest and penalties that pooling cannot be used to mitigate. These restrictions will not apply to taxpayers who deposit their own funds (if they meet their return filing obligations), because if the taxpayer had made a deposit of those funds into their own tax account instead of a tax pooling account, they would be able to use them at the date of deposit to meet any of their own tax obligations without restrictions. It is therefore only appropriate to apply the same treatment to taxpayers who make their own deposits into a tax pooling account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Own deposit funds and return filing requirement Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) Tax pooling requests funded by a taxpayer’s own deposit should not be subject to a “return filing” restriction. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The return filing requirement is not appropriate. If taxpayers are seeking to transfer their own funds from the tax pool to their individual tax account, they should be able to do so freely. It is nonsensical to impose any restrictions on such a transfer, when taxpayers are free to transfer other tax overpayments between different tax types and periods without any return filing restriction. Subsection (4) should only apply to transfers of tax deposits acquired from other taxpayers. It is not clear what is meant by the words “their return filing requirement”. Presumably the requirement is to have filed the income tax return for the year in question before the request is made, whether or not on a timely basis. If section RP 17B (4) continues to apply to transfers of money deposited by the person requesting the transfer, the nature of the “return filing” requirement should be explicitly stated. (Tax Management New Zealand) Comment Currently there is a time limit on the use of a taxpayer’s own deposit funds (the funds that a taxpayer deposits into a pooling account themselves). Taxpayers must access their own deposits in pooling accounts within 60 days of their terminal tax date in order to apply the pooling the deposits against an income tax liability effective at the date at which the deposit was originally made. 71 The amendment proposed in the bill removes this time restriction for “own deposit funds” subject to a return being filed on time. The return filing restriction ensures that pooling users and non-pooling users are treated equitably in terms of return filing obligations. In addition, removing the restriction on using “own funds” creates a compliance risk that pooling users can delay the payment of tax indefinitely when they do not file their tax return by the due date. It would remove the incentive to file and pay. Tax pooling should not provide an incentive for a lesser standard of compliance with return filing obligations by users as opposed to non-users of pooling funds. The same applies to users who make their own deposits as opposed to those who purchase funds. The proposed amendments also provide consistency with the general transfer rules which also contain restrictions on some credit transfers if a tax return is not filed at the time of the request. For example, if provisional tax has been overpaid, it generally cannot be refunded until the tax return is filed to establish the amount that has been overpaid. The return filing requirement applies only to the tax year for which tax pooling funds are intended to be used. This will be made clear in the explanatory item that officials will prepare, and will include examples. Officials note that there would be other issues with removing the time limit and having no return filing restriction. For pooling monies the Government’s revenue is not recognised until the earlier of the return being filed or the pooling funds being released into the taxpayer’s account. Removing the 60-day rule will remove any incentive for pooling funds to be released quickly and as a consequence the Government will be reliant on a return in order to book or recognise the income. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 72 Issue: Application of pooling rules to voluntary disclosures Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) We support the extension of the tax pooling rules so tax pooling funds can be used to satisfy an increased liability resulting from a voluntary disclosure when there has not been a previous assessment. (Tax Pooling Solutions) Tax pooling should be extended to voluntary disclosures by taxpayers who have not filed tax returns. A taxpayer who does not realise that a tax liability exists and therefore does not file a return will not be able to use tax pooling when the error is discovered and a voluntary disclosure is made. Officials should consider linking of the requirement to the penalties regime so that it applies when the taxpayer is not subject to a late payment penalty – then the requirement to have filed a return should be waived or alternatively there may be merit in having a rule which considers a taxpayer’s compliance history. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) It is inequitable that tax pooling is not extended to a person who makes the error of thinking that they have no tax to pay at all (whether RWT, income tax or some other tax), and therefore does not file a return or make a self-assessment. It is nonsensical and bad policy to deny a person the right to use tax pooling (which reduces but does not eliminate the amount of interest on late paid tax which the person has to pay) at the same time as excusing the person entirely from paying late payment penalties. (Tax Management New Zealand) In many cases, the amendments deny taxpayers the ability to use tax pooling if they have not complied with their tax obligations. This imposes (a) an arbitrary punishment for the underlying offence, which will already have been subject to an intended and carefully calibrated penalty; (b) a very significant administrative burden for Inland Revenue, taxpayers, accountants and tax pooling intermediaries. Any request to use tax pooling must be vetted by Inland Revenue to ensure that the taxpayer has been compliant in the relevant respects. If they have not been, the request should be rejected. Under current practices, Inland Revenue will not provide any information to the intermediary as to why the rejection has occurred. The result is that rejected requests to use tax pooling, which make up a very small proportion of the total, require all requests to be vetted, and result in a need for personal intervention in a system which should work mechanically and inexpensively. (Tax Management New Zealand) Comment Officials agree the proposed amendments do not resolve the issue for all taxpayers. Officials consider that proposed new section RP 17B(3)(ab) – which will allow for pooling funds to be used for a voluntary disclosure when there has not been a previous assessment, provided the relevant return has previously been filed for the year – should be accompanied by a Commissioner discretion and apply only in limited circumstances. 73 In exercising the discretion, the Commissioner would have regard to the compliance history over the previous two years (filing and paying) and other factual information available to the Commissioner at the time (such as whether the person cannot reasonably have been expected to have known of their obligations). This ensures that in exercising discretion the Commissioner is satisfied that each occasion of non- compliance is not a deliberate act or a continuation of failures because of the taxpayer’s inadequate or poorly applied internal controls. The taxpayer should be required to have the ability to use pooling funds confirmed to them in writing before backdated pooling funds are used. Officials suggest that the ability to use tax pooling when making a voluntary disclosure when no return has been filed should be limited to income tax and RWT because tax pooling cannot be used for all other tax types except if an amended assessment has been made. If a taxpayer has not filed a non-income tax return then an amended assessment would not result from a voluntary disclosure and hence tax pooling should not be available in these cases. Otherwise the integrity of the tax pooling system and voluntary compliance would be affected by creating a disincentive to comply with non-income tax return filing obligations because tax pooling could be used at a later date through a voluntary disclosure. The exception proposed for RWT is to address the concerns raised by submitters that Inland Revenue does not require an RWT payer to file a nil return if no RWT has been paid. Other tax types require the taxpayer to file a nil return. Since the use of tax pooling for non-income tax revenues is based on amending a previously filed return, it is appropriate to extend the use of backdated tax pooling funds to RWT where no return was filed because the taxpayer believed that they had no liability to pay RWT. Officials consider that this proposed Commissioner discretion should be reviewed after one year, with specific regard to the impact of the discretion on voluntary compliance and administration cost to Inland Revenue. Officials will ensure that explanatory material prepared in relation to the proposals contains specific examples of where it is likely that the discretion will apply. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 74 Issue: Definition of “amount of tax” Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions) We support the proposed amendment to the definition of “amount of tax”. Comment The definition of “amount of tax” is currently restricted to the five withholding payments set out in that section. This was not the intention. Amendments made in 2009 intended to extend the definition to include amended assessments of most taxes, where the initial liability is increased. The proposed amendment therefore aims to reflect the policy intent that amounts of income tax, FBT and GST are included within the definition for the purposes of the pooling rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transfers within tax pooling accounts Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions) Section RP 18(2) should be amended to clarify the beneficial ownership of tax deposits that have been transferred from one taxpayer to another but which remain in the tax pool can be transferred. Comment Officials consider that the appropriate way to address this concern is for tax pooling intermediaries to deal with this in the commercial contracts entered into with clients who are buyers and sellers within the intermediary’s tax pool. The provisions around holding funds in trust are obligations imposed on intermediaries and the Commissioner will not know that a depositor has sold their funds to another client of a tax pooling intermediary. That is a commercial transaction which is outside the responsibility the Commissioner is charged with in administering a tax pooling account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 75 Issue: Section RP 19B – requirements Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand) Section RP 19(B) should apply regardless of whether taxpayers have met other obligations. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The “good behaviour” restrictions in proposed section RP 19B(3) should be removed. It is arbitrary and untargeted for taxpayers to be denied the ability to use tax pooling for such non-compliance. Proposed section RP 19B(4) should not be enacted. (Tax Management New Zealand) Comment Section RP 19B(3) ensures that the Commissioner has all of the necessary information when a request for purchased tax pooling funds is received to determine what the taxpayer’s provisional tax obligations are, as these are generally based on prior year terminal tax obligations from tax returns. Not having prior year tax returns when taxpayers wish to use purchased pooling funds would prevent the Commissioner from being able to process tax pooling transfer requests until the return is filed, unnecessarily creating a large administrative burden and compliance costs for taxpayers and intermediaries. Officials consider that the clarity around this requirement is desirable to avoid these burdens and costs. Section RP 19B(4) ensures that any backdated credit date for purchased funds is limited to the tax year in which the funds are used. Otherwise taxpayers would be able to circumvent other specific provisions – for example, by meeting unpaid imputation closing balances in prior tax years before the dates the imputation rules allow, or paying historic tax debts, such as child support, or transferring the funds to associated taxpayers to meet their unpaid historic tax debts. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 76 Issue: Disclosure to pooling intermediaries by Inland Revenue Submission (Tax Management New Zealand) The bill proposes a number of changes to section 81, generally with the aim of allowing exceptions to the secrecy requirement where appropriate (clauses 58 and 59). There is a much more fundamental issue regarding secrecy than those dealt with currently in the bill. The issue is the basis on which Inland Revenue communicates with tax agents. Tax Management New Zealand, tax agents and Inland Revenue currently spend much more time than necessary dealing with situations when Inland Revenue believes that a taxpayer has not met the requirements for a tax pool transfer. Inland Revenue will not discuss with tax pooling intermediaries any matter concerning a taxpayer which does not pertain directly to a tax pooling request. In particular, when Inland Revenue rejects a tax pooling request, it usually will not tell the intermediary why. The intermediary must go to the taxpayer or their agent to find out. Inland Revenue justifies this on the basis of the secrecy obligation in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It will, on the other hand, discuss a person’s tax matters with their accountant or their lawyer as freely as if they were discussing those matters with the person themselves. There is no statutory basis whatsoever for this breach of the secrecy obligation. The only basis for it is that the person has authorised their accountant or lawyer to act on their behalf. It is entirely appropriate and sensible for Inland Revenue to recognise that authorisation. The problem we are experiencing is that the responsible officials are not prepared to apply that recognition of an agency relationship to tax pooling intermediaries. There is no basis for that. The matter should be dealt with by Inland Revenue recognising its error and communicating with properly authorised tax pooling intermediaries to the extent necessary to make the tax pooling system work. However, if Inland Revenue really does not believe it can do that, the matter needs to be dealt with by amending the law. Logically such an amendment would have to deal with all taxpayer agents, not just tax pooling intermediaries. Comment Officials note that an amendment as proposed by the submitter (i.e. having the same status as tax agents in this regard and having access to tax payment details) does not have clear support from other submitters. Officials also note that Inland Revenue already has well-established processes which ensure that appropriate information is provided to tax pooling intermediaries and that contact with taxpayers and their authorised tax agents occurs in a timely manner to resolve any tax pooling transfer issues. Section 81 imposes a statutory obligation of secrecy on Inland Revenue officers which requires a specific legislative exception before taxpayer-specific information can be released to any third parties. This is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system and the perception of that integrity by taxpayers. The amendments to section 81 in the bill maintain the primacy of the secrecy obligations while allowing the Commissioner flexibility to fulfil tax administration duties. 77 That said, officials consider that the existing proposed amendment to the secrecy rules that relate to the Commissioner’s ability to disclose information for tax administration purposes (clause 58 of the bill) would enable the provision of more information to a tax intermediary and enable the Commissioner to disclose information for the purpose of resolving the query. Officials will include this as an example in the proposed Standard Practice Statement. Officials also note that the proposed amendments to remove restrictions for “own funds” and allowing purchased funds to be transferred on the expectation of a tax debt will significantly reduce the number of transfers that currently need to be queried. This will substantially reduce the amount of interactions currently required with tax pooling intermediaries. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Technical and drafting issues Submission (Tax Pooling Solutions) 1. Section RP17B(4)(a) refers to transfers being made “within 75 days from their terminal tax date”. It implies that the transfer must be made between the terminal tax date and the date 75 days later and cannot be made prior to the terminal tax date. It should be amended to read “on or before the date 75 days after their terminal tax date”. 2. Section RP 17B(4)(b), as amended by the bill, refers to funds being deposited by the taxpayer itself. This is inconsistent with other sections of the Income Tax Act which refer to intermediaries making a deposit in a tax pooling account “on behalf of” a person (for example, sections RP 17B(1) and RP 18(1)). Section RP 17B(4)(b) should be amended for consistency. 3. Sections RP 19 and 21 of the Income Tax Act refer to the tax pooling intermediary asking the Commissioner for transfers and refunds from the tax pooling account respectively. In practice, Inland Revenue always takes transfer and refund instructions from the intermediary’s trustee and has confirmed to us in writing that they would never take instructions directly from the intermediary. This helps protect intermediaries’ clients from fraud and is relied on by a number of our clients. The legislation should be amended to reflect current practice. Comment Drafting issue 1 Officials agree that the suggested clarification is appropriate. 78 Drafting issue 2 Officials agree that a clarification is appropriate to reflect that the taxpayer’s intermediary makes the deposit of the taxpayer’s funds into the tax pooling account on behalf of the taxpayer. Drafting issue 3 Officials note that the tax pooling rules do not require a tax pooling intermediary to use an independent trustee, only that taxpayers’ deposits are held in trust. Additionally at least one intermediary has chosen not to use an independent trustee and it would not be appropriate to remove this choice by requiring intermediaries to only provide instructions to Inland Revenue via a trustee. Recommendation Drafting issue 1 That the submission be accepted. Drafting issue 2 That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Drafting issue 3 That the submission be declined. Issue: Deductibility of interest Submission (Ernst & Young, Tax Management New Zealand) Section 120OE of the Tax Administration Act should be amended so that none of the section DA2 general limitations can apply to limit deductibility. (Ernst & Young) Clause DB 3B of the bill should be amended to ensure that when a person pays to acquire a deposit, the portion of that payment that is deemed to be interest should be deductible under section DB 3B. (Tax Management New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that to the extent that fees paid to a tax pooling intermediary to purchase funds represent the interest component, they be deductible to the taxpayer. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount able to be deducted by a taxpayer should be treated as taxable income to the intermediary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 79 Issue: Amendments, to and reversals of, incorrectly requested transfers Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials propose an amendment to section RP 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that the Commissioner can decline to process, or amend, or reverse a tax pooling transfer. Comment Currently, when taxpayers ask their intermediaries to process transfers that do not comply with the tax pooling rules Inland Revenue will decline to process the transfer or amend the transfer to comply with the tax pooling rules. But in cases when a tax pooling transfer is found to be incorrect after it has been processed, Inland Revenue will amend the transfer or reverse it. The Commissioner’s authority to do so is inherent in that the transfer was not requested, or processed, in line with the tax pooling rules. For the avoidance of doubt, officials consider that the Commissioner’s ability not to process, amend or reverse a tax pooling transfer should be explicitly set out in the tax pooling rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Additional amendments required Submission (Ernst & Young) Section RP 17 of the Income Tax Act will need additional amendments to achieve the stated objective of extending access to tax pool funds for taxpayers with increased liabilities. Comment Officials consider that the proposed provision meets the policy intent and that no amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 Other tax administration matters 81 82 AUTHORITY FOR THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE TO IMPOSE FEES FOR CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS Submission (Ernst & Young) There should be legislative clarification that the proposed 1.42% fee for paying amounts by internet or telephone credit card transfers is not a “tax”, “penalty” or “interest” and that it should be deductible if there is an appropriate taxable business nexus. Comment Clause 80 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to charge a credit card fee on tax and social liability transactions. However, individuals based overseas who wish to pay their student loan and child support liabilities via credit card will not be charged the fee. This is to encourage compliance. Clause 80 describes the credit card fee as a “fee for the service” which differentiates it from a tax, penalties or interest. Whereas tax is a Crown imposition the fee charged on credit card transactions in respect of tax and social liabilities is not – it is a fee passed on to taxpayers for using a credit card as a method of paying their tax or social liabilities. Whether the credit card fee is deductible or not should be determined by current rules on deductibility. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 84 Remedial matters 85 86 SHAREHOLDER CONTINUITY: DIRECTORS’ KNOWLEDGE PROVISION Clauses 38 and 87 Issue: Support for amendments to the directors’ knowledge provision Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Russell McVeagh) Submitters support the amendments to the directors’ knowledge provision as simplifying a provision which has been difficult to apply. Comment Officials are pleased that submitters are supportive of the amendments, which are intended to provide more certainty and clarity on the scope of the directors’ knowledge provision (section YC 15 in the Income Tax Act 2007 and section OD 5(5) in the Income Tax Act 2004) and provide more ease of application. This is achieved by removing minor off-market transactions, i.e. share transactions occurring outside a recognised stock exchange, from the scope of the provision. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The directors’ knowledge provision should be repealed Submission (Ernst & Young) The directors’ knowledge provision should be completely repealed in order to achieve the stated aims of removing uncertainty and reducing compliance costs. Comment Officials note that the objective underlying the amendments is to provide clarity and certainty to the existing provision. A complete repeal would require further consideration by officials and would not be consistent with the policy intent underlying the provision, which is that it is an anti-avoidance rule to prevent the structuring of share transfers to take advantage of the shareholder tracing concessions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 Issue: Structure of directors’ knowledge provision Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The section structure of the directors’ knowledge provision with conditions precedent set out in subsection 1(a), followed by an exclusion, should be changed as it makes interpretation difficult. Instead, the section should be replaced with a structure which sets out when the section applies and when it does not apply. Comment Officials acknowledge that the structure of the directors’ knowledge provision does not provide ease of interpretation in certain areas. However, it is unclear that replacing the section with the structure suggested by the submitter would remedy this issue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Alternative approach suggested Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) While it is acknowledged that amendments are required to the provision, it is submitted that the proposed amendments in the bill will create more complexity and uncertainty. The submitter suggests that the provision should instead be amended to exclude listed companies from its scope and provide that certain types of off-market transactions, such as dividend reinvestment plans and employee share schemes, are automatically ignored. Comment Officials disagree that the amendments contained in the bill will create more complexity and uncertainty than the status quo. The amendments will have the effect of providing that certain types of off-market transactions, such as dividend reinvestment plans and employee share schemes, are disregarded under the provision (subject to meeting the relevant thresholds). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 88 Issue: The word “sale” in new section YC 15(1)(b)(iv) should be replaced Submission (Russell McVeagh) The word “sale” in new section YC 15(1)(b)(iv) should be replaced by “transfer”, so that the section applies to transfers that are made for no consideration, such as gifts, settlements on trusts and inheritances. Comment Officials agree that transfers which are made for no consideration should also be included within the scope of new section YC 15(1)(b)(iv). This is consistent with the policy intent underlying the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The phrase “the company’s shareholders” in new section YC 15(1)(b)(v) should be replaced Submission (Russell McVeagh) In new section YC 15(1)(b)(v), “the company’s shareholders” should be replaced by “any person”, so that the section applies to a transfer of shares to a person who is not a shareholder prior to the transfer. Comment Officials agree, as the policy intent is that the section should apply to a transfer of shares to a person who is not a shareholder prior to the transfer – for example, employees. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 89 Issue: Certain transactions not covered in new section YC 15(1)(b)(v) Submission (Russell McVeagh) In new section YC 15(1)(b)(v), the word “transfers” does not pick up the issue or cancellation of shares, or the granting of options over shares. Comment Officials agree that the section should apply to other transactions involving shares, such as issues, cancellations, and the granting of options over shares. The policy intent is that the section should cover these types of transactions when the company is one of the parties. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Employee share schemes when shares are issued to a trustee Submission (Russell McVeagh) The situation when shares are issued under an employee share scheme to a trustee of a trust which then (at a later time) transfers those shares to employees should be specifically addressed, as it would not be covered by the current wording of new section YC 15(1)(b)(v). Comment Officials understand that the above situation is a common occurrence. Accordingly, we agree with the submission given that it is consistent with the policy intent that minor off-market transactions such as employee share schemes should be covered by section YC 15(1)(b)(v). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 90 Issue: Clarification of scope of new section YC 15(1)(b)(v) Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The wording of proposed new section YC 15(1)(b)(v) means that it could apply to both on- and off-market transactions. Comment The policy intent is that subparagraph (v) should cover off-market share transactions involving the company as a party which in aggregate are less than 5 percent of the shareholding in a company in the income year. Officials consider that drafting changes arising from submissions should help to ensure that the legislation reflects the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarification on measurement of 5% limit in new section YC 15(1)(b)(v) Submission (Ernst & Young) Further clarification is required on the time at which the 5% limit referred to in new section YC 15(1)(b)(v) is to be measured. Comment The policy intent is that measurement of the 5% limit is on an income-year basis. Officials consider that this is clear from the drafting of the new section. Officials would also note that section YC 15 as a whole applies at a time when a company does not meet the requirements of a continuity provision but for the application of the tracing concessions contained in sections YC 10 and 11. This is stated under section YC 15(1)(a). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO TAX STATUS OF NEW ZEALAND SUPERANNUATION FUND Issue: Support for amendments Clauses 21, 39 and 40 Submission (Guardians of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund) We support the remedial amendments to clarify the New Zealand Superannuation Fund’s tax status. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarification that the Crown is resident in New Zealand Clause 39 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal to clarify that the Crown is resident in New Zealand for tax purposes should not proceed because it is unnecessary and may result in unintended consequences or conflict with other enactments. Comment The amendment clarifies that the Crown is a resident of New Zealand. Under New Zealand’s tax treaties, a condition for obtaining treaty benefits (such as lower withholding tax on foreign dividends) is that the recipient of the income must be resident in the other country. In 1995 the OECD Model Tax Convention was amended to clarify that a government of a country was resident in that country. The Commentary to the Convention states that the 1995 amendment conformed to the existing understanding of most OECD countries. Since 1995, New Zealand’s treaty practice has been to include the OECD Model Tax Convention wording in its treaties. However, pre-1995 treaties do not always have this wording. This can leave the situation unclear. Amending New Zealand’s domestic residence rules would be a useful clarification. 92 In terms of consequences for other branches or divisions of the Crown, it should be noted that this change simply codifies our current understanding that the Crown is resident in New Zealand, so it is difficult to see how this conflicts with other enactments. The proposed change to the residence rules will not affect the existing tax obligations or exemptions of other instruments of the Crown. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting Clause 39 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The drafting should be changed from “Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand” to “Her Majesty in right of New Zealand in public office”, or to “the Crown”. Comment We consider that either “Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand” or “the Crown” would be acceptable. However, we note that the term “Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand” is consistent with the reference to Crown-owned banking groups in proposed clause 57 of the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 93 PIE REMEDIALS Issue: Definition of “land investment company” Submission (KPMG) The definition of “land investment company” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to accommodate intra-group financing between land investment companies and PIEs in the same tax group. Comment Officials agree that the PIE rules should accommodate intra-group financing between land investment companies and PIEs in the same tax group. Officials note that there are a number of ways this could be achieved. For example, the desired outcome could be achieved by amending the definition of “land investment company” (as suggested by the submitter) or by amending the grouping rules in subpart IC of the Act. Both would achieve the same result. Officials recommend that the drafters of the bill determine the best method for addressing this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Single investor class for a listed entity Submission (KPMG) When a listed entity becomes a multi-rate PIE there should be no restriction on the number of investor classes the entity can have. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Section HM 14(2) requires that if an entity is a company listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand, it must have only one investor class of which each investor must be a member. This restriction should only apply to listed PIEs. Accordingly, we recommend that section HM 14(2) be amended to allow a listed entity that becomes a multi-rate PIE to have more than one investor class. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 94 Issue: Voluntary payments of tax by a multi-rate PIE Submission (KPMG) Section HM 45(1) should be amended to enable multi-rate PIEs to make voluntary tax payments even if an investor does not reduce their interest in an investor class of the PIE. Comment Officials agree with the submission. There is no policy reason to prevent multi-rate PIEs from making voluntary payments independent of whether an investor reduces their investment in a PIE. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Re-entering as a PIE (five-year rule) Submission (KPMG) The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have the discretion to waive (or reduce) the five-year restriction on re-entering the market as a PIE in circumstances where a fund loses PIE status, such as a result of an event outside of their control. Comment Officials see no reason to relax the five-year rule. The five-year rule prevents entities from becoming a PIE for five years if the entity failed to meet the investment or investor requirements. Accordingly, the five-year rule provides an appropriate incentive for PIEs to operate within the eligibility criteria. Nevertheless, the submitters have raised an important issue concerning the rules that apply when a PIE no longer meets the eligibility criteria and the consequences of this. Officials will consider these issues further. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 95 Issue: Loss of PIE status under section HM 25 Submission (KPMG) The date of the loss of PIE status specified in section HM 25(2) should be amended to be consistent with the date that operated before the PIE tax rules were rewritten. Comment Officials agree. Section HM 25(2) specifies the date of the loss of PIE status as the last day of the first quarter or, the last day of the second quarter – depending upon whether the failure to meet the requirements was significant and within the control of the entity. However, the provision that applied before the PIE rules were rewritten (section HL 15(2)), provided that the date for loss of PIE status was the first day of the following quarter in which the entity ceases to be eligible to be a PIE. This change should be retrospective to the commencement of the rewritten PIE rules (1 April 2010). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Notice requirements to exiting investors Submission (KPMG) The PIE rules currently require a PIE that performs its tax calculations quarterly to provide an investment statement to any investor that leaves the PIE. The notice must be given by the end of the month following the quarter in which the investor exited the PIE. This should be amended to apply only when the PIE has elected to treat the investor as a zero-rated investor (i.e. it has not made a voluntary tax payment in respect of the investor). 96 Comment Official agree with the submission and recommended an amendment to section 31C(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to resolve the issue. If the PIE has made a voluntary payment of tax on behalf of the investor, that investor does not need to include the income in their tax return. There is therefore no need for the PIE to provide income details to the investor in such a short time-frame. It is reasonable for PIEs in this situation to provide investor statements in the same time-frame required for non-exiting investors – by the 30 June that follows the relevant income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Māori authorities receiving imputation credits from PIEs Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A provision should be inserted in subpart OK to provide a credit to a Māori authority credit account when a Māori authority is attributed imputation credits by a PIE. Comment Official agree with the submission. Such an amendment would bring the treatment of Māori authorities in line with the treatment currently afforded to companies through section OB 9B, which provides that companies that are attributed imputation credits by a PIE receive a credit to their imputation credit accounts. The amendment will allow a Māori authority to effectively pass on imputation credits that it receives, thereby avoiding any double taxation. Officials recommend the amendment be made retrospective to the beginning of the PIE regime, 1 October 2007. This will require amendments to both the 2004 and 2007 Income Tax Acts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 97 Issue: Prescribed investor rate – proposed new section HM 57B(1) Clause 20 Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed new section HM 57B(1) should refer to sections BC 2 to BC5 as well as to section BD 1(5). Comment Official see no reason for new section HM 57(1) to refer to sections BC 2 to BC5 (the core provisions). The core provisions in part B of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to the entire Act. If reference was made to the core provisions, in this way, it would set a precedent for other new sections. This was not what was intended. The reason that section HM 57(1) refers to section BD 1(5) is to exclude it when a recent migrant calculates their prescribed investor rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Grouping of listed PIEs for GST purposes Clause 22 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is required on whether or not the proposed limitation on the ability of listed PIEs to group with other companies for income tax purposes should also apply to their ability to group register for GST purposes. Comment New section IC 3(2C) provides that a listed PIE can only group with its wholly owned subsidiaries. Officials agree that this limitation should not prevent a group of companies that includes a listed PIE from grouping for GST purposes provided they meet the other relevant criteria. This amendment would bring the grouping of listed PIEs for GST purposes in line with the treatment currently afforded to multi-rate PIEs. Accordingly, officials consider that an amendment to section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is warranted to allow listed PIEs to be part of a group for GST purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 Issue: Potential double-counting of taxable income Clause 19 Submission (BDO Wellington Limited) The remedial measure to ensure that taxable income is not double-counted should be made retrospective. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The bill amends the PIE rules to ensure taxable income is not double-counted when calculating a person’s prescribed investor rate. This amendment currently has an application date of 1 April 2011. However, the possibility of this double-counting income has existed from the introduction of the PIE regime, 1 October 2007. Accordingly, we agree this remedial measure should have retrospective effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Investor size requirements – charities Submission (Tyndall Investment Management) Registered charitable trusts should be permitted to hold more than 20 percent of a PIE. Comment Officials see no mischief in allowing a registered charitable trust to hold more than 20 percent of a PIE, nor should a charity be required to invest alongside at least 19 or more persons in each investor class, provided that all income derived by the charity is exempt under sections CW 41 or CW 42, which relate to the income of charities. If this submission were accepted it would allow a charity to control a PIE. This would be contrary to the general principle that PIEs should be widely held. Previous submissions on this issue have been declined on this basis. This restriction prevents a person from controlling a PIE and using it as their own personal investment vehicle, as this could provide a tax advantage compared with investing directly. 99 However, after further consideration, officials consider that there is no mischief in allowing a charity to control a PIE if that income would be exempt regardless. The income would not be taxed whether income was derived directly or through a PIE. The mischief that the requirement to be widely held avoids, is therefore not apparent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Section LS 2 – tax credit for trustees in a multi-rate PIE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section LS 2 should be amended to enable trustees who have chosen to have a non- zero prescribed investor rate (PIR) to receive a tax credit. Comment There is currently an error in section LS 2 that means a trustee who has chosen to have a non-zero PIR is unable to receive a tax credit for tax paid by the PIE when the PIE flows income through to the trustee. Section LS 2 requires that the trustee’s income must not be deemed excluded income by section CX 56. However, CX 56(2) states that section CX 56 does not apply to trustees who have chosen a set rate. Consequently, an amendment to section LS 2 should be made to correct this error, therefore enabling trustees to receive a tax credit. This change should be retrospective to the commencement of the rewritten PIE rules (1 April 2010). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 100 Issue: Section HM 6(1)(a) – “other persons” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The words “other persons” should be omitted from section HM 6(1)(a). Comment The reference to “other persons” is not necessary and its removal will enhance the clarity of the section. The removal of “other persons” will also make section HM 6(1)(a) better reflect the principles found in sections HG 1 and HG 2, which relate to the tax treatment of joint ventures and partnerships. This change should be retrospective to the commencement of the rewritten PIE rules (1 April 2010). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HM 36(1) investor class Submission (Matter raised by officials) The words “and an investor class” should be omitted from section HM 36(1). Comment The reference to “and an investor class” is not necessary and its removal will enhance the clarity of the section. This change should be retrospective to the commencement of the rewritten PIE rules (1 April 2010). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 Issue: Calculating transitional residence prescribed investor rate Clause 20 Submission (Matter raised by officials) An addition should be made to the proposed new section HM 57B, providing that section CW 27 should also be disregarded for the purposes of calculating a person’s prescribed investor rate (PIR). Comment Transitional residents (taxpayers who satisfy the requirements of section HR 8(2)) are able to treat foreign-sourced investment income as exempt under section CW 27. This reduces their New Zealand taxable income, enabling them to potentially select a lower PIR. This is not appropriate as PIEs are able to derive income from New Zealand. Officials therefore recommend that proposed new section HM 57B be amended so that the transitional resident exemption does not affect an investor’s PIR. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Calculating amounts attributed to investors Clause 17 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Further clarification is required for the proposed new change to section HM 36(3)(e)(i) specifically whether “ongoing” fees relate to the fund or the investor. Comment The bill replaces the words “ongoing management and administration” in section HM 36(3)(e)(i) with “ongoing management or ongoing administration”. Officials recommend making a remedial change to clarify that “ongoing” refers to fees that are ongoing for the fund, not for the investor. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 Issue: Revenue account investors in PIEs Submission (Matter raised by officials) Revenue account investors that derive exempt income under sections CX 56B and CX 56C, which relate to distributions from PIEs, should not be allowed a deduction for the cost of their shares or units. Comment Officials recommend making a remedial amendment to clarify that revenue account investors cannot obtain a deduction for the cost of their shares or units when they are not taxable on the proceeds of those shares or units under sections CX 56B or CX 56C. As the proceeds of the shares or units are not taxed, their purchase should not be deductible. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 103 LISTED PIES – GROUPING OF TAX LOSSES Clause 22 Submission (Ernst & Young) The wording of proposed section IC 3(2C) “the PIE owns 100%” should be re-written as “the listed PIE owns 100%”. Comment Officials consider that it is implicit in the wording of the proposed section that “PIE” refers to “listed PIE”. Furthermore, the wording is consistent with that used in the section of the Act which contains restrictions on the grouping of multi-rate PIEs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 104 IFRS PROVISIONS Overview of submissions The Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill includes remedial amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) legislation included in the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007. The original legislation primarily affects the spreading of income and expenditure on financial arrangements. There were some minor aspects relating to other matters. All the remedial amendments in this bill in respect of IFRS relate to financial arrangements. It is not intended that these changes represent a fundamental shift in policy regarding the original legislation. One submission suggested a ground-up rewrite of the legislation but it is not considered that is required at this point and any such move would need to be subject to wide consultation. Issue: Integral fees where the modified fair value method applies Clause 8 Submission (Ernst & Young) Subparagraphs EW 15(1)(a)(i) and EW 15(1)(b)(i) should be amended in a manner similar to that proposed in clause 8 of the bill for subparagraphs EW 15(1)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii). The submitter has not provided a rationale for its proposal. Comment For IFRS taxpayers, the modified fair value spreading method is based on the fair value method. The consideration for the fair value method is defined to ignore non- integral fees (which is an accountant’s term). The consideration for the modified fair value method should also ignore non-integral fees, but this was inadvertently not specified in the original legislation. The amendment is to correct that error. The modified fair value method is not available to non-IFRS taxpayers and therefore amendments as proposed by Ernst & Young to the methods used by non-IFRS taxpayers are not relevant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 105 Issue: Anti-arbitrage rules for the use of the fair value method Clause 9 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed amendment included in the bill should be extended to provide for: • a method that follows the fair value methodology provided for in IFRS; • an alternative method, if the alternative: – has regard to the purposes of the financial arrangement rules under section EW 1(3); and – is for a financial arrangement similar to one to which the method in Determination G29 may apply; and – results in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from those that would have been allocated using the method set out in Determination G29. The amendment should also be extended to apply to the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment Several amendments were made in 2009 to the anti-arbitrage rules. These rules are intended to prevent income and expenditure from being deferred or advanced on two financial arrangements which are in a designated hedging relationship (an accountant’s term). However, in amending the rules the ability to use the fair value method for financial arrangements that are used to hedge other financial arrangements (being agreements for the sale and purchase of property in foreign currency subject to a determination method) was inadvertently denied. The amendment proposes to correct this error, allowing the fair value method to be used in these circumstances. The correction will be on very specific terms and we are not proposing to alter the application of the anti-arbitrage rules or the taxation of the agreements for sale and purchase of property in foreign currency under Determination G29. The submitter’s first two proposals go further than the remedial nature of the amendment intends, as the discussion in the submission is focused on agreements for sale and purchase of services and other financial arrangements similar to those dealt with by Determination G29. The widening of the scope of the rules in relation to other financial arrangements needs to be the subject of the usual tax consultative process and is outside the scope of these remedial amendments. Consideration of those matters will be given by officials at the earliest opportunity. Officials agree with the third submission that the amendments be extended to apply to the Income Tax Act 2004. 106 Recommendation That Corporate Taxpayers Group’s first two submissions be noted, and that the third submission that the amendments be extended to apply to the Income Tax Act 2004 be accepted. Issue: Timing of base price adjustment when changing from fair value method to another method Clause 10 Submissions (Ernst & Young) Clarification is required as to the date at which the base price adjustment calculations must be performed and the date at which taxpayers must be treated as having paid market value amounts for the financial arrangements under section EW 46B. Section EW 46B should also be amended to remove or replace the reference to the “date of change”. Comment When taxpayers change from the fair value method to another spreading method they are required to perform a base price adjustment (BPA). The current rules state that this BPA is to be performed when the change of method occurs. The intended meaning of this is for taxpayers to perform the BPA at the end of the relevant income year; however, it is apparent that the current wording does not make this clear and is causing some confusion. Accordingly, the bill was intended to clarify this rule by explicitly stating that the BPA calculation is to be performed at the end of the income year in which the change of method occurs. However, section EW 46B was not amended in the bill and officials agree that amendments are necessary to give proper effect to the proposal. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Review of subpart EW Submission (Ernst & Young) Subpart EW should be generally reviewed in relation to application of its provisions. 107 Comment Officials understand the nature of the submission to be a complete review of the rules for financial arrangements even though it is stated very briefly. A complete review of the rules would require considerable work and is not currently on the tax policy work programme. In the meantime the remedial changes should proceed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 108 USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY Clauses 5, 6, 82, 83, 96 and 97 Issue: Agree with the proposal Submission (KPMG) We support clarifying that use-of-money interest payable to Inland Revenue is deductible. Comment The amendment clarifies that use-of-money interest (UOMI) is deductible for tax purposes. The clarification will ensure that the policy intention when the UOMI rules were introduced is met, namely, that UOMI is deductible and that it ensures consistency, in particular between companies (for whom interest is generally deductible) and other taxpayers. The amendment will ensure symmetry in treatment for tax purposes so that UOMI is both taxable and deductible. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date of the proposal Submissions (BDO Auckland, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Staples Rodway Taranaki Limited) The application dates for the new sections DB 3B (of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007) and section DB 2 (of the Income Tax Act 1994) in the bill should be changed so they apply retrospectively from the enactment of the Act without any limitation. Inland Revenue should provide assurances it will amend any previous assessments when requested by taxpayers when UOMI has not been claimed (under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). (BDO Auckland) The ability to claim deductions for UOMI in respect of the 2005–06 to 2009–10 income years should not be restricted to those who had claimed deductions in returns filed by 23 November 2010 (or in relation to the 2009–10 income year, had not filed their returns by that date). (Ernst & Young) Taxpayers who have incurred UOMI (under the Tax Administration Act 1994 or the earlier Income Tax Act provisions) should be entitled to claim a deduction for any UOMI that has not already been claimed. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 109 The changes to the deductibility of UOMI should apply to taxpayers who sought the deduction in a notice of proposed adjustment rather than through a tax position taken in a return of income. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who have conceded the deduction in Inland Revenue’s favour should be entitled to have their assessment reopened. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should also apply to taxpayers who at the date of introduction of the bill have a live dispute with Inland Revenue regarding the deductibility of UOMI. (Staples Rodway Taranaki Limited) Comment As currently drafted the amendment will apply retrospectively from the 1997–98 income year (the start of the UOMI rules) to taxpayers who have claimed deductions for UOMI in returns filed before the date of introduction of the amending legislation. The amendment will also apply to the 2010–11 and later income years. To eliminate a taxpayer’s exposure to shortfall penalties, a taxpayer can file a return on a conservative basis and then file a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) on a less conservative basis. As penalties are calculated by reference to the tax position taken in a self-assessment, rather than in a NOPA, the risk of shortfall penalties applying is negated. As noted in the Institute’s submission, a taxpayer who does not claim a deduction for UOMI in their return but does so in a subsequent NOPA, would not benefit from the amendment. Officials agree with the submission and recommend the application date be changed to allow the amendment to apply also to taxpayers who claim a deduction for UOMI in a NOPA filed before 24 November 2010 (being the date the bill was introduced). Officials do not agree with submissions proposing that the application date should be changed to allow a deduction for all taxpayers who have been subject to UOMI since 1996. Such an amendment could mean a large but unquantifiable number of assessments would need to be reopened. We are also concerned about the unbudgeted fiscal cost of such an amendment. If people have already claimed a deduction for UOMI, the amendment will not affect Budget forecasts; that is not the case for new deductions that have not previously been claimed. Recommendation That the submission that the application date should be changed to allow the amendment to apply also to taxpayers who claim a deduction for UOMI in a NOPA filed before 24 November 2010 be accepted. That the submissions proposing the amendment should apply to all instances when the taxpayer has been subject to UOMI since 1996 be declined. 110 Issue: Time limitations on refunds should be turned off Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The respective provisions of subpart RM that imposes the time limitations on refunds should be turned off. Comment Under section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the Commissioner may refund tax if the four-year period for the amendment of an assessment has not ended. The four- year period can be extended to eight years in certain circumstances – for example, if the refund arises from a clear mistake or simple oversight of the taxpayer. These amendments apply retrospectively from the 1997–98 income year (the start of the UOMI rules). Officials agree the time limitations on the Commissioner refunding tax should not apply to prevent these amendments being effective. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Relationship with the general limitations Submissions (BDO Wellington Limited, Ernst & Young) If the policy intention is that UOMI should be tax deductible for all taxpayers, the proposed legislation should override the employment limitation. (BDO Wellington Limited) Deductibility of UOMI should not be subject to any section DA 2 general limitations and all such limitations should be expressly excluded. (Ernst & Young) Comment As currently drafted, the amending provision overrides only the capital limitation. Officials agree with the BDO Wellington submission that the proposed legislation should also override the employment limitation. In addition, we consider the private limitation should be overridden. This will mean the new section is consistent with section DB 3 which allows for the deduction of expenditure incurred in calculating or determining tax liabilities. Recommendation That the first submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. That the second submission be declined. 111 Issue: Timing of the deduction Submissions (BDO Auckland, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Sections EF 4(2) to (4), EF 5 (2) to (4) and EF 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which set out the rules for determining in which income year UOMI is assessable or deductible, should be repealed. (BDO Auckland, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be clarification as to how the references to income years are intended to interact with section EF 5 (or its predecessors) and whether they refer to the income years to which the UOMI would be allocated or those in or for which the underlying income tax or other liability arose. (Ernst & Young) Comment As noted in the comments on the application date previously, currently the deduction is allocated to the same year to which the tax liability relates, the following year or to the income year following the income year in which the Commissioner issues the notice of amended assessment. If there is a dispute involving court proceedings which is eventually resolved in the Commissioner’s favour, the current rules could inappropriately allocate the deduction to a year many years earlier than the year in which the interest is paid. The current rules also inappropriately allocate a deduction to the year of assessment in cases when the taxpayer simply fails to pay any relevant tax when the UOMI may not be paid until much later (if at all). Officials recommend that the timing provisions be amended to provide for the deduction of UOMI in the year in which the UOMI is paid. We think this approach provides taxpayers with certainty on this issue and deals appropriately with the problematic cases described above. Importantly, a paid approach is also consistent with the timing of assessability – UOMI is assessable in the year the Commissioner pays the interest. Officials have discussed this issue with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, which is comfortable with this approach. When a payment is received by Inland Revenue it is first allocated to interest (in accordance with section 120F(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). If the taxpayer is paying their debt off over time, deductions may need to be made in more than one year which officials acknowledge may increase a taxpayer’s compliance costs. However, we consider that the approach recommended above is more taxpayer- friendly and appropriate than delaying the deduction of the UOMI until all of the debt has been paid. Therefore, officials agree with the submission that sections EF 4(2) to (4) (which set out the timing for the assessability of UOMI) and sections EF 5 (2) to (4) and EF 6 (which set out the timing for the deductibility of UOMI) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be repealed. 112 Officials do not consider that this amendment should be retrospective. We are concerned that there could be disputes currently in progress on the timing of the deduction and do not want to interfere with that process. These amendments should therefore apply for the 2011–12 and later income years. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 113 INTER-CORPORATE DIVIDEND EXEMPTION Clause 4 Issue: Application of the extension of the inter-corporate dividend exemption for Māori authorities Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Group is highly supportive of the removal of the common balance date requirement from section CW 10. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 1. The amendment should not apply retrospectively to Māori authorities. Alternatively, a Māori authority should be able to elect whether the amendment applies retrospectively. 2. A Māori authority should have the right to elect prospectively that the section does not apply to a future dividend. Many Māori authority groups are made up of a Māori authority that is a company and a wholly owned corporate subsidiary or subsidiaries that may have different balance dates. The proposed change will produce the following three unintended consequences and will adversely affect many Māori authorities that are companies and the members of those Māori authorities. • The effective tax rate imposed on a Māori authority will differ depending on whether that Māori authority is a trust or a company. • Members of a Māori authority that is a company will receive less cash from any distributions than would the beneficiaries of a Māori authority that is a trust and will suffer tax at the company rate of income derived by the Māori authority’s subsidiary or subsidiaries. • The retrospective application of the proposed change may mean that Māori authorities may, unwittingly through no fault of their own, have treated distributions incorrectly and underpaid provisional tax. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The amendment to section CW 10 has two policy objectives: • to facilitate the movement of capital within a wholly owned group of companies, without taxation being a distortionary or inhibiting factor; and 114 • to reduce unnecessary compliance costs upon those companies having differing balance dates that use non-dividend methods to move capital around the wholly owned group company. These costs arise because at present, if the wholly owned groups of companies do not have the same balance date, the exemption in section CW 10 does not apply. The amendment seeks to remove this common balance date requirement, as it is considered to serve no useful policy purpose. In relation to the application of section CW 10 to Māori authorities, and the points raised in the submission, officials note that it is intended that the exemption in section CW 10 for dividends should apply to a Māori authority group that consists of a wholly owned group of companies. Submissions 1 and 2 – PricewaterhouseCoopers 1. The removal of the common balance date requirement should not apply retrospectively to dividends derived by a Māori authority. Alternatively, that a Māori authority should be able to elect whether the amendment applies retrospectively. 2. Alternatively, that a Māori authority should be able to elect whether the amendment applies retrospectively. Officials agree that the removal of the common balance date requirement from section CW 10 is intended to benefit taxpayers and not create an adverse consequence. We agree with the submitter that this amendment could give rise to adverse consequences for provisional tax and the ratio of Māori authority credits attached to distributions to members. Officials agree that the amendment should not apply retrospectively for a Māori authority, and consider this should be made explicit in the application rule. Officials do not consider that an elective approach to address retrospectivity is appropriate, as it is intended that section CW 10 should apply generally to a wholly owned group of companies that are all Māori authorities. Submission 3 – PricewaterhouseCoopers 3. A Māori authority should have the right to elect prospectively that the section does not apply to a future dividend. The submission seeks a change to the policy for the taxation of Māori authorities, to the effect that section CW 10 should not apply to wholly owned groups of companies consisting of Māori authorities. The submission is made on the basis that the exemption for a dividend under section CW 10 will result in less cash being available for members and gives rise to a difference in the effective rate of tax applying to Māori authorities, depending on the whether the authority is structured as a trust or a company. 115 Officials consider this submission is seeking a change in policy for the application of the company taxation rules to Māori authorities. In addition, officials do not agree that amendment to section CW 10 will result in an adverse effect on either: • the tax burden of a Māori authority that is a company; or • the quantum of cash received by a member of a Māori authority. A policy objective of the Māori authority rules is to ensure that the passing of income through these entities does not unduly give rise to income tax disadvantages for their members. A comparison of the effect for a Māori authority (a company or a trust) deriving an exempt or assessable dividend from a subsidiary company is set out in Table 1. The table assumes that the same cash dividend is paid and maximum imputation credits are attached to the dividend. Table 1: Year 1 Dividend exempt MA Co Dividend assessable MA Co Dividend assessable MA trust Subsidiary Co Cash dividend paid 700700 700 IC attached 300300 300 Māori authority Net income 01000 1000 Income tax liability 0195 195 Less tax credit for IC 0195 195 Terminal tax 00 0 Tax loss to carry forward (converted imputation credits) 0538 538 Māori authority account balance at year end \*\* 300130 130 Cash available to distribute to members 700700 700 \*\* Māori authority credit 170 attached to taxable distribution Table 1 illustrates that: • The exemption under section CW 10 does not affect the amount of cash that a Māori authority may distribute to its members. • There is no difference in the tax borne by a Māori authority when comparing the derivation of an exempt or assessable dividend. In each case, the underlying tax is borne by the Māori authority, and no additional tax is borne by the authority. • The benefit of the imputation credits attached to all dividends derived by a Māori authority (whether exempt or assessable) is recorded in the Māori authority credit account, and is available to attach to taxable distributions to members. 116 Therefore, officials do not agree with the submitter that section CW 10 has an adverse effect on Māori authorities or members, and consider that the submission should be declined. Recommendation That: • The submission from the Corporate Taxpayers Group in support of the amendment to section CW 10 be noted. • The submission from PricewaterhouseCoopers that the amendment should not apply retrospectively to Māori authorities be accepted. • The submission that alternatively, a Māori authority should be able to elect whether the amendment applies retrospectively be declined. • The submission that a Māori authority should have the right to elect prospectively that the section does not apply to a future dividend be declined. Issue: Grouping of attributed CFC net losses Clauses 22B–22H Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section IQ 4 should clarify that the effect of section IQ 2B must be taken into account in determining the amount of attributed in controlled foreign company losses that may be made available and used within a wholly owned group of companies. Comment The new CFC rules enacted in late 2009 introduced a policy change from comprehensive taxation of CFCs to taxation of their passive income only. As a result of this change, it was decided that losses accumulated during the period of comprehensive taxation should effectively be given less than their normal value when used during the period of taxation of only passive income. Section IQ 2B contains the transitional rules to achieve this effective write-down of past losses. Section IQ 2B applies to losses arising from the earlier taxation regime and carried forward under section IQ 1B. It is also intended that section IQ 2B should apply to a profit company in a wholly owned group of companies that receives the benefit of a grouped attributed CFC net loss. 117 This policy intention is implied in the calculation in section IQ 2B, because it adjusts losses arising under the comprehensive taxation rules by reference to the ratio of the group’s total (old) comprehensive income to the group’s attributed (passive) income. The policy reason for this rule is to prevent losses being transferred to obtain a tax advantage for the group as a whole. Therefore section IQ 4 (grouping of attributed CFC losses) should be amended to provide consistency with section IQ 2B, to clarify that: • section IQ 4 applies after the loss company has applied section IQ 2B; and • if a loss company in a wholly owned group elects to make attributed CFC net losses available to a profit company in that wholly owned group, section IQ 4 should take into account the effect of section IQ 2B in determining the amount of loss made available or used within the wholly owned group. As this amendment provides further clarification for the operation of section IQ 2B, officials consider this amendment should apply to all income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, with a savings provision for taxpayers who have taken a tax position prior to the date of report-back of this bill, based on the current wording of section IQ 4. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 118 BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNT RULES Clauses 29 and 31 Issue: Definition of “tax liability” Submission (Ernst & Young) The definition of “tax liability” in proposed new sections OE 7(7)(b) and OP 101(4C)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended. Comment The bill makes various technical and drafting changes to improve the clarity of the branch equivalent tax account (BETA) rules and achieve consistency with the position under the Income Tax Act 2004. These include changes to clarify the formula for converting excess BETA debits – amounts covered by a valid election but not needed to offset an income tax liability – into a tax loss. As currently drafted, the formula in the bill refers to the amount by which the valid election exceeds the income tax liability “for the attributed CFC income”. The submitter correctly points out that the reference should instead be to the income tax liability of the relevant company, allowing for the offset of current-year domestic losses. This would be consistent with the position under the Income Tax Act 2004. Corresponding changes should also be made to sections OE 7(6) and OP 101(4B). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section OE 7(8) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section OE 7(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will become redundant following enactment of the bill and should be repealed. Comment Once the amendments in this bill are enacted, sections OE 7(3) and OE 7(3B) will achieve the outcome that section OE 7(8) is intended to achieve. Accordingly, section OE 7(8) will become unnecessary. It should therefore be repealed with effect from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The bill already provides, at clause 31(7), for the equivalent repeal of section OP 101(5). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 119 REMEDIAL AMENDMENT TO THE THIN CAPITALISATION RULES Clause 13 Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed change to the section FE 6 definition of “adjust” to refer to group finance costs should be expressed as applying only prospectively – for example, for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2011 (at the earliest). Comment There is an amendment in the bill to close a potential loophole in the thin capitalisation rules. The thin capitalisation rules prevent multinational groups from taking excessive interest deductions in New Zealand and were broadened in 2009 to apply to New Zealand-headquartered multinationals. At that time, an exemption was provided if total interest deductions were less than a minimum amount. The minimum threshold should have been calculated for an entire group of companies. We consider that this is the only interpretation that would make the exemption apply sensibly, but this is not reflected in the legislation. That is, the minimum threshold is currently calculated separately by each company within the group. The bill fixes this problem, with effect from the date of the bill’s introduction. The submitter has requested that the amendment not apply until enactment of the bill, or later. We consider there is a balance to be struck between allowing taxpayers to rely on the law as in force on the one hand, and protecting the tax base from opportunistic behaviour on the other. Some taxpayers may be unaware of the measure in this bill or of the fact that the existing legislation is not effective, and so may take a tax position (file tax returns) on the basis of the law as written until the amendment is in force and they see a new copy of the Act. This is perfectly reasonable behaviour. However, other taxpayers who have become aware of the potential loophole since the publication of the bill may take advantage of it between introduction and enactment. A compromise position which has been suggested to us by the Committee’s independent advisor and which we are partly in favour of is to keep the current application date (the date of the bill’s introduction) in general but prevent the amendment applying to tax positions taken before enactment of the bill. 120 We are proposing a slight variant of this position which would stop the amendment applying to a tax position taken before the report-back date of the bill. This would more effectively prevent opportunistic behaviour. There is some risk that some taxpayers acting in good faith could be caught unawares by the amendment (if they file a tax return before enactment). However, since the provision in question is quite technical and likely to apply only to taxpayers with commercial and business acumen, we consider this to be unlikely. We think it is a reasonable assumption that these taxpayers or their advisors who have to apply the provision (either in its current or amended form) would be aware of a tax bill that had been introduced. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that officials’ alternative recommendation (that the amendment applies from the date of introduction but not to tax positions taken before the report-back date of the bill) be accepted. 121 CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANY REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Some controlled foreign companies with income from a liability are taxed on that income when expenditure from the liability would not be deductible. This should be remedied. Comment New controlled foreign company (CFC) rules were introduced in 2009. Under those rules, investors in a CFC are taxed on the “passive” income of the CFC, such as interest or royalties. Other (active) income is not taxed. We have become aware of a CFC that has had income from a liability. This is unusual, but has occurred because of a large foreign exchange gain on money the CFC has borrowed (the gain is larger than the interest expense on the loan). Under the CFC rules, this income from a liability is treated in the same way as passive interest income and is therefore taxable. This tax treatment aligns with the treatment of financial arrangement income for domestic companies. However, special features of the CFC rules mean that foreign exchange losses on the same debt would not be deductible in the case we have seen. This differs from the tax treatment accorded to domestic companies. This leads to an outcome in which every foreign exchange gain that exceeds interest expense is taxable, but any losses are non-deductible. Assuming movements in the exchange rate broadly average out over time, this leads to substantial amounts of tax being paid even though there is no gain ever realised. In the specific case we have seen, the tax liability is likely to be tens of millions of dollars. There may be cases when it is appropriate to recognise income and deny deductions, but this case does not seem to be one of them. We therefore recommend a remedial amendment to ensure that, in appropriate circumstances, income from an exchange rate gain on a liability may be either ignored or offset against corresponding losses in other years. The amendment would apply retrospectively, to prevent unintended tax liabilities from arising. We would make it clear that the amendment is an interim solution. The problem is affecting taxpayers now, so should be solved quickly but further consultation over time may lead to an improved legislative solution in future. We therefore recommend that the change should apply only temporarily (until the end of the 2012–13 income year) while further work is undertaken on the underlying policy issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 Issue: Foreign shares held by active insurance CFCs Submission (Matter raised by officials) Under the CFC rules, a New Zealand insurance company that uses a controlled foreign company (CFC) to conduct an insurance business offshore can apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a special exemption from the CFC rules. This is provided as a temporary measure until more detailed rules are developed for applying an active income exemption to active financial CFCs. A core part of running an insurance business is investing in financial markets. This helps to ensure that the insurer has sufficient income to pay their policyholders when claims are made. Under the existing exemption for insurance CFCs, income from bonds held by qualifying insurance CFCs will be exempt, but income from foreign shares will not. An exemption should be added to the foreign investor fund rules for foreign portfolio shares that are held by an insurance CFC that obtains the special CFC exemption. Comment Under the existing tax rules, we “look through” CFCs (including active CFCs) and attribute income from foreign shares held by a CFC as though the New Zealand investor held the foreign shares directly. In contrast, CFCs that hold bonds are treated as holding the bonds themselves. As a consequence of this approach a New Zealand insurance company with an insurance CFC will be required to attribute income from any foreign shares that are held as part of the CFC’s insurance business. This result is inconsistent with the fact that no New Zealand tax will be payable on bonds when these are held by insurance CFCs that qualify for the special exemption. Because the core business of insurance CFCs involves making investments in financial markets, it is not appropriate to tax foreign shares or bonds when these investments are used to support the insurance business. One condition for getting the special exemption is that the CFC’s investments must be commensurate with the insurance policies that the CFC sells in its jurisdiction. This prevents the CFC from holding an excessive amount of investment assets. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would be able to revoke the exemption if this occurred. The treatment of offshore insurance income will be reviewed in the context of the taxation of passive income earned by financial institutions. Officials intend to begin work on this later this year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 123 REMEDIAL CORRECTION: FIXED-RATE SHARES AND COMPARATIVE VALUE METHOD Submission (Matter raised by officials) As part of the 2009 international tax reforms, dividends received by companies generally became exempt. An exception was fixed-rate shares held by companies which were defined as “fixed-rate foreign equity”. As part of this change an existing reference to “fixed-rate shares” was replaced with “fixed-rate foreign equity”. This unintentionally limited the provision to fixed-rate shares held by companies (whereas previously it also applied to individuals and trustees). We recommend a retrospective remedial amendment be made to correct this. A secondary issue is that there are a few references to “fixed-rate shares” in other parts of the Income Tax Act that are not mentioned in the definition of a fixed-rate share. It is therefore unclear whether this definition applies to these sections, and if so, which parts of the definition would apply as the definition of a “fixed-rate share” can have slightly different meanings in different parts of the Act. Some cross- references should be inserted to clarify this. Comment The fair dividend rate method, which is the standard way of taxing offshore portfolio investment, is not available for certain debt-like investments referred to in the legislation as “non-ordinary shares”. The definition of a non-ordinary share is contained in section EX 46(10). Section EX 46(10) used to refer to “fixed-rate shares”. This was changed to “fixed-rate foreign equity” in 2009, which had the unintended consequence of limiting the provision to fixed-rate shares held by companies (whereas previously it also applied to individuals and trustees). The unintended change should be reversed or some individual and trustee taxpayers will be under-taxed. Others (particularly those who make losses) will be over-taxed. The reversal of the change should be retrospective, but should optionally not apply to people who have taken a tax position before enactment. This would ensure that taxpayers would not face any additional tax, whether they had been applying the rules as they were intended to be applied or applied them in accordance with the unintended change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 124 REWRITE AMENDMENTS Issue: Thin capitalisation – apportionment of interest Clause 13 Submission (Ernst & Young, Matter raised by officials) The wording of section FE 6(3)(a)(i) should be amended to apply prospectively. (Ernst & Young) The effect of section FG 8(2) of the 2004 Act should be restored to section FE 6 as an addition to clause 13 of the bill. (Matter raised by officials) Comment In relation to the submission raised by Ernst & Young, the amendment corrects an obvious cross-reference error to section FE 14, which is a provision that is unrelated to section FE 6. The correction is necessary because the cross-reference to section FE 14 is obviously incorrect as the subject matter of section FE 14 is unrelated to the provisions of section FE 5. Under the transitional provisions of the 2007 Act, where a legislative provision is unclear, taxpayers are directed to the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act to assist in interpreting the unclear provision in the 2007 Act. The corresponding provision in the 2004 Act cross-refers to the corresponding provision for section FE 3 in the 2007 Act. In relation to the matter raised by officials: section FG 8(2) of the 2004 Act provided that, in relation to a wholly owned group of companies, the interest apportionment provided for under section FE 6 could be allocated electively across companies within the group of companies. This matter is a rewrite maintenance item, as it has the effect of restoring a provision inadvertently omitted from the 2007 Act, which provided a compliance cost reduction measure for wholly owned groups of companies. Officials consider this concessional measure should be restored to the 2007 Act with application from the 2008–09 income year. Recommendation That the submission from Ernst & Young be declined. That the matter raised by officials be accepted. 125 Issue: Thin capitalisation and on-lending concession Clause 14 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young) The Group is supportive of the proposed amendment in clause 14 to ensure that the on-lending concession also applies to corporate taxpayers, as is the case in the Income Tax Act 2004. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section FE 12(1) should be rewritten as “the debt percentages of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group and world wide group are calculated under the rules set out in sections FE 13 to FE 1I”. (Ernst & Young) Comment Officials agree that the drafting of section FE 12 could be improved, and that the suggested wording is a useful aid for the drafter’s consideration. Recommendation That the submission that the drafting for the amendment to section FE 12 should be improved be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Foreign tax credits Clause 23 Submission (Ernst & Young) In addition to the amendments proposed to section LJ 1(2)(a), similar amendments are required to other provisions to ensure consistency throughout all relevant provisions. Consequential amendments would also be required within sections LJ 1(1), LJ 2 and LJ 5 and YA 1 “foreign-sourced amount” to ensure consistency in the drafting. Comment This amendment replaces the words “not derived from New Zealand” with “sourced from outside New Zealand”. The amendment is made to correct an unintended change in outcome in the legislation, and arises from a recommendation made by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. 126 The change in outcome identified by the Panel was that the existing words “not derived from New Zealand” excluded the possibility that an amount of income could have a source in a foreign jurisdiction and in New Zealand at the same time, because two different source rules applied. The Panel concluded that the 2004 Act allowed a foreign tax credit for foreign tax paid on income even if the income was also sourced in New Zealand. Officials consider that the concept of “foreign-sourced amount” should not be amended. This term is fundamental to the operation of the policy of taxing income in New Zealand on a source and residence basis. In particular, if a non-resident derives a foreign-sourced amount it is not taxed in New Zealand. Therefore, the term “foreign-sourced amount” cannot possibly include income having both a New Zealand and foreign source. Officials also consider that it is unnecessary to amend the concept of “segment of foreign-sourced income” to include a reference that it is sourced from outside New Zealand. The use of that concept in sections LJ 1(1), LJ 2, LJ 5 and LJ 7 is to connect the income with the foreign source with the foreign tax paid on that income. Whether that income is also derived from New Zealand is irrelevant for that purpose, and would likely serve to confuse the reader. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Further income tax payable for debit balance in imputation credit account Clause 28 Submission (Ernst & Young) The formula proposed to be inserted in section OB 67 by clause 28 does not operate appropriately. The proposed new section OB 67(2) should be rewritten as “in relation to two tax years that are consecutive, the liability for further income tax at the end of the second tax year is reduced by the first year adjustment” and paragraph (a) should be deleted from the proposed new section OB 67(2B). The proposed amendment to section OB 67(5) is not then required and should be deleted. 127 Comment Officials agree that the drafting for the amendment to section OB 67 could be improved, and that the suggested wording is a useful aid for the drafter’s consideration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Rewrite Advisory Panel recommendations Submission (Matter raised by officials) The following unintended changes in law identified by the Rewrite Advisory Panel should be corrected by further remedial amendments and be included in this bill. Comment Base price adjustment calculation – sections EW 31(4) and DB 11 The Rewrite Advisory Panel has identified that, in section EW 31(4) (in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts) and its related deduction provision in Part D, it is unclear whether the provision produces the same outcome as the corresponding provision in the 1994 Act. Section EW 31(4) of the 2004 and 2007 Acts requires a taxpayer to perform the base price adjustment for a financial arrangement on disposal or maturity of that financial arrangement. The base price adjustment is a “wash-up” calculation, which requires a taxpayer to compare total cashflows (received and paid) under the terms of the arrangement against the income and deductions from that arrangement. If the base price adjustment produces a negative result, the negative amount is treated as interest expenditure. The “normal rules for deductibility of interest” are applied to determine whether that negative amount is deductible (i.e. incurred in deriving income, or carrying on a business, or incurred by certain companies). If any part of that negative result is not deductible under the “normal rules of deductibility for interest”, then an automatic deduction is allowed to the extent the remaining negative amount represents a “reversal” of assessable income derived in prior years or in the current income year. The Panel considers that it is unclear whether the 2007 and 2004 Acts provide the automatic deduction for a “reversal” of assessable income and that both Acts should be amended to remove this uncertainty, with retrospective effect to the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. 128 Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusion and its recommendation on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Leases with inadequate rent – section GC 5 2007 Act The Rewrite Advisory Panel has considered a submission that the scope of section GC 5 has been narrowed by using the term “a property” rather than the term “any property”, as in its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act. The submission argued that the section could be read as constrained to leases of real property. The Panel did not agree with the submission but suggested that section GC 5 be clarified to ensure that it is clear from the outset it applies to leases of real and personal property. Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusion and recommendation that the wording of section GC 5 should be improved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Lump sum payments on the occasion of retirement – sections DC 1 and EA 4 The Panel has considered a submission relating to section DC 1 of the 2004 and 2007 Acts. This provision allows a deduction of lump sum payments made on retirement if they are not deductible under any other provision of the Act. The Panel has concluded that the provision contains an intended change in the timing rule when compared with the 1994 Act, and that change should be identified in the schedule of intended changes in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts. The Panel has also recommended that a form of savings provision be available if a taxpayer has taken a tax position based on the wording of the 1994 Act. Under the 1994 Act, the corresponding provision to section DC 1 was amended in 2002. This amendment was to permit payments of monetary remuneration in the form of lump sum retiring payments made within the 63 days following the end of an income year to be deductible in that income year if the expenditure had been incurred and deductible in that income year. However, section DC 1 and its corresponding earlier provisions did not apply to monetary remuneration as this is deductible on the basis it is incurred in carrying on a business. The courts have identified a few limited circumstances to which section DC 1 applies. Examples of the types of payments that the courts have identified as deductible under this provision are: • a payment to secure a restraint of trade (i.e. a capital payment, and a capital receipt for the former employee); 129 • a payment for expenditure incurred after the business has ceased (normally not deductible); and • an ex gratia payment to a retiring employee (an ex gratia payment deductible under this provision has no connection to employment, nor is it incurred in carrying on a business). As none of these types of payment are capable of being within the 63-day rule, the connection of section DC 1 to the 63-day rule is inappropriate, and the rewrite of the provision stated the deduction is timed on a payment basis. The Panel agrees this is the appropriate basis of timing these types of payments. Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusion and its recommendation to amend the intended changes schedule in the 2004 Act. However, officials consider that as there would then be no difference between the 2004 and 2007 Acts for section DC 1, it is unnecessary to note section DC 1 as an intended change in the 2007 Act. Officials agree with the recommendation to provide an appropriate savings provision for a taxpayer who has taken a tax position based on the wording of the 1994 Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Meaning of employee – sections RD 3, OB 1 “employee” and OB 2 The Panel has agreed with a submission that section RD 3 of the 2007 Act contains an unintended change in law affecting the meaning of “employee”. A consequence of this unintended change is that shareholder-employee is not subject to fringe benefit tax because a shareholder-employee is not within the meaning of “employee”, as defined in section YA 1 of the 2007 Act. An employee is defined in the 2007 Act, broadly, as person who is entitled to receive income that is subject to PAYE. A shareholder-employee of a close company (company with five or fewer shareholders) may elect to opt out of the PAYE rules in relation to drawings taken from the company in anticipation of a salary being subsequently declared. A shareholder-employee who opts out of the PAYE rules should be subject to the FBT rules. The Panel and officials agree that the 2007 Act does not achieve this outcome. The Panel has recommended that the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively to the beginning of the 2008–09 income year to correct this unintended change. The Panel also recommends that the amendment include a savings provision for taxpayers who have adopted a tax position based on the existing wording within section RD 3 for the period up to the Panel’s decision on 30 November 2011. Officials agree with the conclusions and recommendations of the Panel for this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 130 Calculation of taxable income and loss grouping – section BC 5 and IP 4 The Panel has considered a submission that the meaning of “subtracting an available tax loss from net income,” does not mean the same thing as “offset against net income”. In addition, the Panel has also considered a consequential submission that the part-year loss grouping rules may not restrict the use of part-year losses to not more than the net income of the group company for that same part-year. The Panel did not agree with the submitter that there is an unintended change, but did note that the drafting of the part-year loss rule in section IP 4 could benefit from a minor clarification. Officials agree with the Panel that there is not an unintended change, and also that he clarity of the part-year loss rule in section IP 4 could be improved with effect from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Available subscribed capital account – section OZ 5 The Panel agrees with a submission that section OZ 5(1)(d) of the 2007 Act contains an unintended change. The change has arisen because the adoption of a positive phrasing for the provision in the 2007 Act has inadvertently resulted in a reversal of the outcome for the provision. The Panel recommends that the drafting in section OZ 5(1)(d) be corrected retrospectively to the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Officials agree with the conclusion and recommendations of the Panel. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor maintenance items referred to Rewrite Advisory Panel Submission (Matter raised by officials) The following minor drafting matters should be corrected by further remedial amendments and be included in this bill, with application to: • the 2008–09 and later income years for amendments to the 2007 Act; and • the 2005–06 and later income years for amendments to the 2004 Act. 131 Section Act Amendment CD 32 ITA 2007 Correction to cross-reference.

Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 132 GST CHANGES Overview The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 enacted a number of changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, including: • strengthening the GST rules to prevent “phoenix” fraud schemes by requiring vendors to zero-rate certain transactions that involve land; • simplifying the change-in-use rules; and • amending the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” to provide greater clarity over when GST applies to residential and commercial accommodation. In the process of implementation consultation that followed enactment of the new rules, a number of issues have arisen that require legislative clarification. The following recommendations seek to ensure that the rules enacted by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) 2010 Act operate as intended. As the changes are for the purpose of clarifying the rules, it is recommended that most changes apply retrospectively. Issue: Section 21F – input tax adjustment on disposal of goods or services Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 21F of the GST Act should be amended to take into account the new zero- rating rules. Comment Section 21F of the GST Act, which applies to supplies made on or after 1 April 2011, governs the availability of an unclaimed portion of the input tax on disposal of goods or services. Thus, if a person has used goods or services for mixed purposes and has not claimed the full input tax deduction, the person may be entitled to an additional input tax deduction if they dispose of those goods or services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The amount of the deduction that is available under the provision is calculated by reference to a formula. However, although the formula works as intended when the GST is charged at the standard rate on both the acquisition of goods or services and their subsequent disposal, it provides an incorrect result when the original acquisition or the subsequent disposal have been subject to GST at the rate of 0%. 133 Officials recommend that section 21F be extended to situations when the goods or services have been acquired or sold at the rate of 0%. It is recommended that the proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Entitlement to input tax deductions when the change in use is a result of the changes in the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) The change-in-use adjustment rules (as they apply to goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011) should be amended to allow input tax adjustments to be made when the change in use occurs as the result of the changes to the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwellings”. Comment Accommodation provided by GST-registered persons is generally taxable unless it is expressly treated as an exempt supply. The GST Act exempts the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”, but not accommodation that is in a “commercial dwelling”. The main reason for exempting the supply of accommodation in a dwelling from GST, as described in the 1985 White Paper on Goods and Services Tax, was to ensure that those in rental accommodation were not disadvantaged compared with owner-occupiers. For this reason, the definition was intended to apply to situations when there was a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. This goal was arguably not being achieved because of the potentially wide interpretation of the definition of “dwelling”. To ensure the clarity of the definition, the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” were amended in section 2(1) of the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. The new definitions will have an effect, from 1 April 2011, of reducing the number of supplies that will be treated as exempt supplies of dwellings. Consequently, some suppliers of accommodation that were treated as exempt before 1 April 2011 will be required to start charging GST in respect of those supplies after 1 April 2011. 134 If a supplier has been treated as making exempt supplies of accommodation before 1 April 2011, they were likely not able to claim input tax deductions in respect of their acquisitions. If these suppliers are required to charge GST on their supplies after 1 April 2011, they should be able to claim input tax deductions on those previous acquisitions so that the GST cost is not unduly borne by the business. An example is a GST-registered person who has several properties that are leased – some which were previously within the “dwelling” definition and some which were not. Under the narrower definition all properties will be in the GST net and will therefore give rise to GST when supplied as accommodation. In some cases, the GST liability will also be a result of the $60,000 registration threshold having been reached. It is recommended that the proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section 78F – the requirement to provide a registration number of the recipient Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 78F should be amended to require a GST-registered recipient to provide their registration number to the supplier. Comment The new zero-rating rules, which will apply from 1 April 2011, will require a supply that involves land to be zero-rated for GST purposes when both the supplier and the recipient are registered for GST and certain other conditions are met. As part of the process, section 78F requires the recipient to provide a statement in writing to the supplier on whether they are or expect, among other things, to be registered for GST. In contrast, section 75(3B) requires the supplier of a zero-rated supply to maintain sufficient records to enable the registration number of the recipient to be ascertained. Officials recommend that two sections be reconciled by amending section 78F to require the recipient to also provide their registration number (if they are registered for GST) to the supplier. 135 It is recommended that the proposed change should apply from the date of enactment of the Taxation (Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Information requirements for zero-rating transactions that involve undisclosed agencies Submission (Matter raised by officials) The GST Act should be amended to allow an agent for an undisclosed principal to make limited representations to the supplier for the purposes of the zero-rating rules. Comment To help the supplier decide whether a supply of land should be zero-rated, section 78F requires the recipient to provide to the supplier the information regarding their registration status and intentions in respect of land. Officials have also recommended earlier in this report that the recipient should provide the registration number to the supplier. In making their acquisitions, a purchaser may use an agent to acquire the goods or services on their behalf. In some situations, the agency may be done on the basis that the identity of the de facto purchaser (i.e. the principal) will remain unknown to the supplier. The purpose behind the undisclosed agency will be defeated if, in order to zero-rate the supply of land, the undisclosed principal has to reveal their identity and provide their registration details to the supplier. Moreover, since in undisclosed agency situations the supplier will be unaware of the identity of the recipient, the supplier will not be able to satisfy the requirements in section 75(3B) to maintain sufficient records to enable them to ascertain the name and address of the recipient and the registration number of the recipient. To ensure that the information requirements for the zero-rating rules do not obstruct commercial practices, it is recommended that when an undisclosed agency is involved, the name, address and registration number of the recipient is not required to be provided to the supplier but: • The agent for the undisclosed principal must be registered for GST at the time the binding agreement for sale and purchase is concluded. • The agent will be required to maintain the name, address and registration number of the principal. 136 • The supplier must maintain the name, address and registration number of the agent. It is recommended that the proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exclusion of certain dwellings from zero-rating rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The GST Act should be amended to deem the supply of land that falls under section 14(1)(d) to be separate from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. Comment Section 14 lists supplies that must be treated as exempt supplies for GST purposes and includes a sale by the registered person, in the course of or furtherance of their taxable activity, of a dwelling that has been used for making supplies of accommodation for a period of five years or more before the date of supply. The new zero-rating rules which apply from 1 April 2011 will require a supply that involves land to be zero-rated if certain conditions are satisfied. In theory, a sale of land that falls under section 14(1)(d) would also be zero-rated if it were supplied as part of a larger supply of land. There are no policy reasons for zero-rating rather than exempting such supplies of land used for dwelling. Therefore, it is recommended to amend the legislation to deem the supply of land that falls under section 14(1)(d) to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. It is recommended that the proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 137 Issue: Section 21B – input tax deductions in respect of taxable use by partnerships Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application of section 21B should be extended to situations where the person’s partnership uses the goods and services for making taxable supplies. Comment As part of the changes enacted in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010, section 21B allows a registered person to claim input tax deductions for goods and services purchased by them before registration. The section applies when, before becoming a registered person, a person acquires goods and services that were subject to GST, and later registers for GST and uses the goods and services for making taxable supplies. In some situations the person may, however, conduct their business through a partnership and allow the partnership to use, in making taxable supplies, the goods and services that were acquired by the person when they were not registered. To ensure that the business choice of acting through a partnership does not prevent the input tax from being claimed, it is proposed to extend the application of section 21B to situations where the person’s partnership uses the goods and services for making taxable supplies. It is recommended that the proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting amendment in section 11(8C) Submission (Matter raised by officials) A drafting amendment is required in section 11(8C). Comment New zero-rating rules introduced by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 apply to supplies made “on or after” 1 April 2011. 138 Section 11(8C) which allows, subject to certain conditions, to elect to apply the new rules before 1 April 2011, refers to the time of supply that is “after” 1 April 2011. To ensure consistency with related provisions in the Act, section 11(8C) should be amended to refer to “on or after” 1 April 2011. It is recommended that the proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of the definition of “principal place of residence” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “principal place of residence” should be amended to clarify that it has different respective meaning under the zero-rating and apportionment rules. Comment A number of provisions in the GST Act, namely those concerned with the definition of “dwelling” and the zero-rating of supplies that involve land, use the term “principal place of residence”. However, although the term used is the same, it is intended to have slightly different meanings within the context of different provisions. Thus, in the context of the definition of “dwelling” the “principal place of residence” is intended to mean premises which are being supplied as accommodation to a person and which the person occupies as their main residence for the duration of the agreement. In the context of the zero-rating provisions, the “principal place of residence” is intended to indicate land which is used by its owner or their relatives as their main place of residence. Section 2(1) is the definitions section of the GST Act. Among other things, it defines the “principal place of residence”, as the term should be understood in the context of the definition of “dwelling”. However, owing to an oversight, the definition is also stated to apply to the zero-rating provisions in the GST Act. It is recommended to amend the definition of “principal place of residence” by deleting references to the zero-rating sections of the GST Act. The proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 Issue: Application of the definition of “land” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “land” should be amended by deleting references to the apportionment rules sections of the GST Act. Comment For the purposes of the recently enacted zero-rating rules, to reduce any uncertainty regarding which transactions should be treated as involving “land” and to ensure that most land-related supplies that give rise to “phoenix” fraud concerns are zero-rated, section 2(1) was amended to include a new definition of “land”. The new definition of “land” is very broad. The term “land” is also used in a number of provisions concerned with the apportionment of input tax. In the context of those sections, “land” is intended to be interpreted more narrowly. Owing to an oversight, the definition of “land” in section 2(1) is also stated to apply to the apportionment provisions in the GST Act. It is recommended to amend the definition of “land” by deleting references to the apportionment sections of the GST Act. The proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 140 GST TREATMENT OF CERTAIN EMISSIONS UNITS TRANSACTIONS Submission (Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd, New Zealand Oil and Gas Ltd) Contracts between gas suppliers and gas purchasers where one element of the consideration is a future supply of emissions units give rise to valuation and timing issues. These issues could be addressed by allowing parties which are GST-registered and fully taxable to agree the value of goods and services. Comment Businesses which mine natural gas for domestic consumption have an obligation under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to surrender emissions units to the Crown. Some of those businesses supply gas to large industrial consumers, including electricity generators. A number of suppliers are requiring their customers to pay consideration for their gas supplies in both cash and emissions units. This is illustrated by the diagram below. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 values a supply by reference to the market value of the consideration paid for it. This would be straightforward if the emissions units were supplied straight away – the value of the supply of gas would be the cash paid and the value of the emissions units. Valuation difficulties arise here because the emissions units are to be supplied in the future – potentially as long as 15 months after invoicing for the supply of gas. It is difficult to value the future supply of emissions units – the price of emissions units varies according to supply and demand, and there are few derivative transactions in emissions units in New Zealand which could be used as a reference. When one GST-registered business makes a taxable supply of goods or services to another GST-registered business (which acquires that taxable supply for the purpose of making taxable supplies itself), the output tax liability of the supplier is exactly matched by the input tax liability of the recipient. Accordingly, the value at which that supply takes place is largely immaterial from a revenue perspective. Gas miner Industrial customer Supply of gas (monthly) Consideration - $ (monthly) + emissions units or $ (annually) Annual transfer of emission units to Crown to meet ETS liability 141 This is already recognised in provisions which deal with transactions between associated persons when the recipient acquires the supply for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Our view is that this principle can be extended to the situation raised by the submitters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 142 DEPRECIATION MATTERS – SCHEDULE 39: “FISH PROCESSING BUILDINGS” Submission (Deloitte) Schedule 39 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to include “fish processing buildings”. Other assets that should also be considered for inclusion are “grandstands and other racecourse buildings” and “tannery buildings” affected by acid. Comment This submission relates to changes introduced in Budget 2010 legislation and has effect from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. Officials agree with the submission concerning “fish processing buildings” and “tannery buildings” affected by acid. Schedule 39 lists items that are special excluded depreciable property – i.e. buildings that are excluded depreciable property are similar to buildings with estimated useful lives of less than 50 years. Special excluded depreciable property continues to be depreciable at its existing depreciation rate after the 2011–12 income year. According to historic depreciation rates, “fish processing buildings” have a diminishing value depreciation rate of 6%. This is in line with other items currently listed in schedule 39. In addition, officials understand that “fish processing buildings” are similar to “buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels”, which have an estimated useful life of 33.3 years. Consequently, fish processing buildings should be included within the schedule 39 list of special excluded depreciable property. “Tannery buildings” affected by acid are regarded as having an estimated useful life of 33.3 years and therefore should also be included in schedule 39. The current depreciation rate for “grandstands and other racecourse buildings” is based on an estimated useful life of 50 years. Therefore, these buildings should not be included in schedule 39. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, in relation to fish processing buildings and tannery buildings affected by acid. 143 “TAX ADVISOR” DEFINITION Issue: Inconsistencies arising from the definition of “tax advisor” Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to address inconsistencies arising from the fact that legal practitioners are not within the definition of “tax advisors”. Amendments should be made to allow: • Legal practitioners to make statutory declaration required for “tax contextual information” when claiming the non-disclosure right in respect of tax advice documents. This is a procedural change, and it does not affect the scope of the non-disclosure right nor the requirement to disclose tax contextual information. • A defence to the imposition of a penalty for not taking reasonable care of reliance on a legal practitioner’s advice, consistent with the existing rule for reliance on a tax advisor’s advice. Comment Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Non-disclosure right should apply, however the Commissioner obtains the information Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The non-disclosure right should apply, however the Commissioner obtains the information, whether directly under the Commissioner’s powers or through exchanges of information with other government departments. Comment Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 144 REFUND OF OVERPAID TAX PAID ON BEHALF OF POLICYHOLDERS Issue: Amendment required Submission (Deloitte on behalf of TOWER Limited) Change is needed to the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow the refund of overpaid tax paid on behalf of policyholders for tax liabilities created under the former taxation rules for life insurance business. Comment Officials have discussed the question of refunding overpaid tax balances with the taxpayer concerned. The solution proposed by the submitter raises broader policy questions about the extent to which tax credits created by tax payments, for example – imputation credits, should be generally refundable. Officials consider that the submitter’s proposed solution requires additional thought and should not be included in this bill at this time. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 145 WORKING FOR FAMILIES – DEPENDENT CHILDREN’S INCOME Submission (Matter raised by officials) A change is required to remove an anomaly in the legislation relating to income assessed for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits. Legislation was enacted in 2010 to take into account a dependent child’s investment income that is above a threshold of $500 a year when determining eligibility for WFF tax credits. Eligibility for WFF tax credits is based on “family scheme income”. The current legislation counts the children’s income in both the family scheme income of the principal caregiver and then again in the family scheme income of their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. Therefore, it is counted twice. Section MB 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to prevent such double counting of the dependent children’s income. Comment The amendment will remove an anomaly in the legislation and ensure that the dependent children’s income for the WFF tax credit purposes be counted once for a family unit. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 PROCEDURE IN DISTRICT COURT WHEN DEFENDANT ABSENT FROM NEW ZEALAND Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 159 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be updated to refer to filing a “notice of claim” rather than posting a “duplicate or sealed copy of the summons”. Comment Section 159 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that: ... in an action in a District Court for the recovery of tax, if the defendant is absent from New Zealand or cannot after reasonable inquiry be found, service of the summons may, with the leave of a District Court Judge, be effected by posting a duplicate or sealed copy of the summons in a letter addressed to the defendant at the defendant’s present or last known place of abode or business, whether in New Zealand or elsewhere. The provision refers to the posting of the duplicate or sealed copy of “the summons”. However, the current District Court Rules 2009 provide that a plaintiff starts a proceeding by filing a “notice of claim”. 1 The use of the word “summons” appears to relate to rule 74 of the District Court Rules 1948 whereby ordinary and default actions by a plaintiff were begun with a form of summons and plaint note. It appears updates to section 159 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 were overlooked when the changes were made to the rules governing civil procedure used in the District Court under the District Courts Rules 1992 and subsequently the District Courts Rules 2009. This means that that when the Commissioner is making an application pursuant to section 159 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, an additional application is required requesting that the Judge consider that the words “Notice of Claim” be substituted for “summons” in section 159. The words “the summons” in section 159 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be replaced with “a notice of claim”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 1 Rule 2.10 District Court Rules 2009. 147 ERROR IN THE DRAFTING OF THE MĀORI AUTHORITY TAX TABLE Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is needed to correct an error in the tax rates in the Māori authority tax table in the Income Tax Act 2007, as a result of tax rate changes made by the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010. Comment Table 4 of schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the resident withholding tax rates for taxable Māori authority distributions. The “default” rate, which applies when a member has not provided their IRD number, is the maximum personal marginal rate of 33%. When an IRD number has been provided, the withholding rate is the Māori authority rate of 17.5%. These rates are correct. However, Table 4, in setting out the conditions for which the lower rate can be used, provides that the distribution “does not meet the condition for the 0.38 rate in row 2”. The reference to the 38% rate is an incorrect reference to the previous highest marginal rate. This reference was overlooked when the personal tax rate changes announced in Budget 2010 came into force. In other words, following enactment of the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010, there is no 0.38 rate in row 2. To avoid any confusion, and to remedy an obvious error, officials submit that the reference to the “0.38 rate in row 2” be amended to the “0.33 rate in row 2”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

The changes are intended to ensure that non-resident investors in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) are taxed on their foreign-sourced and New Zealand-sourced income in roughly the same way that they would be taxed if they invested directly. This will significantly reduce the tax rates that apply to non-residents investing into PIEs, thereby making investment in PIEs more attractive to non-residents. In turn, this could facilitate the establishment of an international investment funds domicile in New Zealand. Currently, non-resident investors in PIEs are taxed at 28 percent on their PIE income, irrespective of whether the income is earned from foreign or New Zealand assets. This means that they are over-taxed in comparison with the tax rates that they would face if they invested directly in those assets. In particular, in the case of direct investment by a non-resident into foreign-sourced assets, the income is not subject to New Zealand tax. This is because of the general principle underlying the tax system that non-residents should only be subject to tax on their New Zealand-sourced income. The SOP seeks to amend the bill by effectively introducing two new categories of PIEs that entities can elect into (and which both residents and non-residents could invest in). The first category of foreign investment PIE is one that invests the vast majority of its funds offshore (a “zero rate foreign investment PIE”). Foreign investors in this category of PIE face a 0% tax rate on all of their attributed income. The second category is one that invests its funds both in New Zealand and offshore (a “variable rate foreign investment PIE”). Foreign investors in this category of PIE face various tax rates, depending on the source and type of the income. The rationale for having two categories is that it provides flexibility to both PIEs and non-residents in terms of deciding whether to invest into foreign or New Zealand assets. A further reason for having two categories is to accommodate the wide range of systems that PIEs use to administer their investments. 4 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS The following 14 parties made submissions on the bill: • AMP Capital • Appello • Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG) • Ernst & Young • Fonterra • Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ (ISI) • Kiwi Bank • KPMG • MinterEllisonRuddWatts • New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants • New Zealand Law Society • New Zealand Superannuation Fund • PwC • Russell McVeagh All submissions supported the policy underlying the proposed changes and the direction of the proposed reform. A number of substantive policy issues were raised. These are discussed in the first section of this report. In addition, submitters recommended numerous other changes in order to address technical issues with the proposed rules and to ensure that PIEs can make the proposals work without too much difficulty. These are discussed in second section to our report. 5 MAIN POLICY ISSUES RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS Issue: Approved Issuer Levy Clause 18H Submission (ISI, Fonterra, KPMG, Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PwC, MinterEllisonRuddWatts & New Zealand Superannuation Fund) The 1.44% rate that approximates the Approved Issuer Levy (AIL) on financial arrangements should be reduced to 0%. This would be consistent with proposed legislation in the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill to exempt AIL from certain widely held bonds. Alternatively, if this is not accepted, AIL should only be applied to the interest that is attributable to non-residents. Both realised and unrealised gains on financial arrangements should be treated as foreign sourced income and not subject to tax. If AIL is applied to the capital gains on financial arrangements (as in the current bill), it should only be imposed on the net amount derived from all financial arrangements. Comment Officials do not agree that the 1.44% that approximates AIL on financial arrangements should be reduced to 0%. The proposal to apply 0% AIL on certain widely-held bonds that is contained in the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill is deliberately narrow in its scope. Applying a 0% rate to interest attributable to non-residents in foreign PIEs would extend the scope of the proposal and give rise to some fiscal risk. However, officials agree that the 1.44% that approximates AIL should only apply to interest that is attributable to non-residents and should not apply to the capital gains on financial arrangements. This reflects the treatment that non-residents would have received if they had received the interest directly. Recommendation That the submission to extend the 0% AIL proposal to interest attributable to non- residents in foreign PIEs be declined. That the submission to apply the 1.44% that approximates AIL to interest only be accepted. 6 Issue: NRWT Option – pass unimputed dividends on to investors within two days Clause 18D Submission (ISI, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants & CTG) In order to withhold non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) from unimputed dividends received by foreign investment PIEs, the proposed supplementary order paper requires that such dividends are paid on to non resident investors within 2 days of receipt. The requirement to pass on the unimputed dividends so soon after they are received may impose significant compliance costs on some funds. The two day requirement should be extended to allow time for funds to pool dividends and pay these amounts out as part of a single distribution quarterly or six monthly rather than immediately post receipt. Comment Officials agree with the submission. PIEs should be given more flexibility to distribute and withhold NRWT on unimputed dividends. An amendment should be made that allows foreign investment PIEs to withhold NRWT from unimputed dividends if the dividends are paid to non resident investors before the PIE is required to pay its tax liability. In most cases this means the dividends would need to be distributed within 1 month of the end of the tax year. If the distribution of the unimputed dividends is not made within 1 month of the end of the tax year the PIE would be liable to pay tax on dividends (rather than withholding NRWT). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Making the FITC regime available for foreign investment PIEs Submission (Fonterra, KPMG, CTG & New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regime should be made available to foreign investment PIEs. This would provide foreign investors with the same tax treatment on fully imputed dividends received from New Zealand resident companies as they would have received if they had invested directly. 7 Comment In principle officials agree that the FITC regime should be recreated in the foreign PIE rules as it would provide consistency with direct treatment. However, the FITC tax rules are technically complex. In essence, they ensure that, for certain equity investments in New Zealand resident companies by non-residents, New Zealand tax is limited to 28%. To achieve the same result for non-resident investing through a foreign investment PIE, would be very complicated. Therefore, given this complexity and the short timeframe, we are not confident that it is feasible to design rules that would work appropriately and could be administered by PIEs. To do this properly would require more time and consultation. Submitters have provided officials with some useful material that could form the basis of a proposal for future consultation. It is recommended that officials consult on a proposal to recreate FITC through foreign investment PIEs with a view to including it in a later tax bill. Recommendation That the proposal to extend FITC to investments through foreign investment PIEs not be proceeded with at this stage but is considered for inclusion in a future tax bill. Issue: Land investment companies Clause 18H Submission (ISI, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants & Ernst & Young) A foreign investment variable rate PIE should be allowed to invest in land investment companies. Comment Officials agree that foreign investment variable rate PIEs should be able to have some exposure to New Zealand land investments. This can be achieved through investments in “land investment companies” (essentially companies that have land as their only asset). However, officials have some concerns if a foreign investment PIE were allowed to hold 100% of a land investment company resident in New Zealand. The concern is that the foreign investment PIE could find methods to transfer otherwise non-deductible expenditure to an entity it owns that is able to utilise the deduction. 8 Therefore it is recommended that an amendment be made that allows a foreign investment PIE to hold up to 20% of a land investment company resident in New Zealand. This is consistent with the general principle in the PIE rules that PIEs can generally own up to 20% of any entity invested into. Foreign investment PIEs would be able to own up to 100% of a land investment company resident outside of New Zealand. For similar reasons, it is also recommended that PIEs should only be allowed to own up to 20% of an entity that is not PIE but could qualify for PIE status. Recommendation That a foreign investment PIE be allowed to: • hold up to 20% of a land investment company or an entity that is not a PIE but qualifies for PIE status; and • hold up to 100% of land investment company resident outside new Zealand. Issue: Increased de minimis – 5% and 1% Clause 18H Submission (CTG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Appello & New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed de minimis thresholds should be increased to ensure that foreign investment PIEs can successfully operate within the regime. Specifically, the 1% de minimis for New Zealand equities that track a global index should be increased to 5% regardless of whether the fund tracks a global index, and the 5% de minimis for assets producing New Zealand sourced interest income should be increase to at least 10%. Comment The proposals as currently drafted would allow a foreign investment PIE that has the vast majority of its investments offshore to apply a zero percent rate for its offshore investors. This represents a big simplification benefit for these PIEs. However, there are two de-minimis concessions in the rules as currently drafted. The first would allow the PIE to have up to 5% of its assets as New Zealand sourced financial arrangements – provided that they provide a return that is short-term or cash in nature. This is designed to provide the PIE with sufficient liquidity to run its day-to-day operations (e.g. funding redemptions, paying expenses etc). The second de-minimis concession allows the PIE to have up to 1% of is assets as New Zealand equity. This would allow a PIE that tracked a global index (of which New Zealand makes up less than 0.1%) to continue to apply a zero percent rate to all the returns to non-residents. 9 Officials do not agree with the submission to increase the 5% de-minimis for New Zealand financial arrangements. Officials consider that the 5% de minimis for assets producing New Zealand sourced interest income is sufficient to ensure the foreign investment PIEs can hold enough cash reserves to meet applications, redemptions and day-to-day expenses, without disqualifying the foreign investment PIE. Furthermore, officials consider the current 1% de minimis for New Zealand equities that track a global index is generous given New Zealand’s share of the global index is only about 0.06% (according to MSCI indices). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Wholesale fund – incoming flowing through should retain character Submission (KPMG, ISI, Fonterra & New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The supplementary order paper does not address the “flow through” of income from a wholesale PIE to a retail PIE. The income of the wholesale fund should retain its character when allocated to the retail PIE. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The income allocated to a foreign investment PIE from a wholesale PIE should be treated as if the foreign investment PIE earned the income directly. This prevents income earned from foreign investments made by the wholesale PIE in New Zealand being re-classified as New Zealand sourced income when it is allocated to the foreign investment PIE. However, officials understand that some wholesale PIEs will not be able to provide this ‘flow through’ treatment of income. Therefore, an amendment to allow this treatment should be elective. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 Issue: Exclusion from the source rules should be broadened Clause 18H Submission (NZ Law Society & Russell McVeagh) A further exemption from the source rules should be made so that income of a foreign investment PIE does not have a New Zealand source merely because a contract is made or performed in New Zealand. Comment Officials do not consider a further exemption from the source rules is necessary. While it is possible that the current source taxation rules do not operate appropriately in all cases, aspects of these rules are being considered separately as part of the current review of non-resident investment in New Zealand limited partnerships. The exemption as currently drafted would prevent offshore income earned by a foreign investment PIE being given a New Zealand source simply because the PIE operates a business in New Zealand. This exemption would appear to be sufficient to enable the new foreign PIE regime to operate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 MINOR POLICY ISSUES RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS Issue: Relaxing the restriction on expense deductibility for non-resident investors Clause 6B Submission (Fonterra & KPMG) As currently drafted, a foreign investment PIE will not be allowed to claim a deduction for expenses incurred in relation to its foreign investors. This mirrors the treatment of a non-residents investing directly in New Zealand equities and debt. However, this may not be the appropriate comparator. Instead a more appropriate comparison is a non-resident investors investing in a New Zealand company. Non- resident investors in a New Zealand company will incur costs from making and holding investments – including fund administration and management costs. These costs will predominantly be incurred by the company in relation to the shareholder and the company will be able to claim a deduction for them. Therefore, deductions should be allowed for expenditure relating to non-resident investors in foreign investment PIEs. Comment Officials disagree with the submission. The appropriate comparator is if the non- resident had invested in the New Zealand securities directly and had directly incurred administration and holding costs. These costs would not be deductible against the income derived from the securities (e.g. dividends or interest) as the income would be taxed on a gross basis (e.g. NRWT or AIL). It is therefore not appropriate to allow a deduction for these costs if the person chooses to incur the expenses via the PIE rather than directly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 Issue: Broaden the allowable amounts of income that have a New Zealand source Clause 18H Submission (Russell McVeagh & New Zealand Law Society) For the purposes of the 5% de-minimis that applies to zero rate foreign investment PIEs, the allowable amounts of income that have a New Zealand source should be broadened to include all income from financial arrangements, and not only interest income. Furthermore, amounts from call accounts should be included as allowable amounts. Currently drafted, the supplementary order paper allows only interest income from financial arrangements with a term 90 days or less. A call account has no term, and therefore arguably does not meet this requirement. Comment Officials consider that the foreign investment PIE should be allowed to hold New Zealand sourced derivatives and other similar financial arrangements (separate from the 5% de-minimis) if they relate to its foreign holdings (for example, a derivative that removes currency risk in relation to foreign shares). This is appropriate as the financial arrangement can be seen as part and parcel of the offshore investment. Officials also agree that call accounts should be included as an allowable amount in the 5% de-minimis as the income from these is likely to be used for managing day-to- day expenses. Recommendation That the submission allow foreign investment PIEs to hold New Zealand sourced derivatives be accepted in part. The derivatives that should be permitted are those that relate to the foreign investment PIEs foreign holdings. The submission to allow an amount from a call account to be included as an allowable amount in the 5% de-minimis also be accepted. 13 Issue: Rules should allow non-residents to invest in other widely held investment vehicle Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants & New Zealand Superannuation Fund) The proposed rules should allow non-residents to invest in other widely held investment vehicles such as limited partnerships and unit trusts. Comment The submission is beyond the scope of the current proposals and raises a number of complex policy issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The definition of what a foreign investment PIE can invest in should be extended Clause 18H Submission (New Zealand Superannuation Fund) The definition of what a PIE can invest in should be extended to cater for private market activity like private equity and infrastructure investments where a fund may hold greater than 20% interest in a particular investment. Comment PIEs are designed to be passive investment vehicles and are therefore generally restricted to owning only portfolio interests in companies. This is to prevent PIEs from earning active income from running businesses. We do not consider this rule should be any different for foreign investment PIEs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: Round tripping – Section EX 29(6), anti-avoidance provision Clause 10C Submission (CTG, KPMG, Ernst & Young & New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The current exemptions from the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules exemptions do not apply when the FIF holds an interest in a foreign investment PIE. Due to information constraints this rule should not apply. An individual investor is not likely to be aware of what investments their Australian company may hold and obtaining the information may be administratively complex. The provision does not set a minimum holding by the FIF in a foreign investment PIE investment and therefore the investment may not be separately identified in the company’s publicised accounts. Officials are concerned that a resident would be able to invest into an Australian company that is exempt from the FIF rules with the FIF then receiving zero-rated offshore income (or 1.44% on NZ based interest), making the resident only liable for income tax on actual dividends received from the Australian company. A better approach would be to address this issue through the avoidance provisions. In addition, the rules do not work appropriately for transitional residents. Comment After further consideration, officials agree that proposed section EX 29(6) (and consequentially, section CQ 5(6)) is unnecessary. There is very little risk that investors could gain significant tax advantages through exemptions in the FIF rules by investing in a foreign company that then invests in a foreign investment PIE in practice. However, officials will monitor this. If this amendment is made, we do not consider that a specific anti-avoidance provision or other replacement for section EX 29(6) would be necessary. Recommendation That the submission to remove section EX 29(6) be accepted. 15 Issue: Section HM 55D – Investor requirements Clause 18H Submission (New Zealand Law Society & Ernst & Young) If an investor does not meet the non-residence requirements, or does not provide the PIE with certain information to ensure the person qualities as a non-resident investor, the PIE must treat the person as a non-resident and apply a 28% tax rate. This treatment is appropriate when there is a failure to provide the necessary information. However, this treatment is not appropriate in regards to the non- residence requirement. The PIE should not be required to look behind the investor’s representations and determine whether they qualify as a foreign investor. This treatment should be the same as when resident notifies an incorrect prescribed investment rate - the PIE should apply the rate they have been given. Comment Officials agree that a PIE should not be required to look behind an investor’s notification of foreign investor status. If a resident notifies a foreign investment PIE that they are a notified foreign investor, the PIE should be able treat the investor according to their notification. The consequences of any misrepresentation should fall on the investor under section CX 56 (where PIE income is taxed to the investor in certain circumstances). Officials recommend that the submission be accepted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 16 Issue: Merge the proposed categories of foreign investor PIEs Submission (CTG & MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The new foreign investment PIE rules enable funds to elect into two categories of PIE. The first category of PIE is the zero rate foreign investment PIE that can have both resident and non-resident investors and derive mostly foreign-sourced income, but with a de minimis of 5% for New Zealand-sourced interest income and 1% de minimis for holding New Zealand shares. The second category of PIE is the variable rate foreign investor PIE that can have both resident and non-resident investors and both New Zealand and foreign-sourced income. Much of the complexity with the current proposal derives from the creation of the two classes of foreign investment PIE. A further complication is the need to track different income types and applying different tax rates within the foreign investment variable rate PIE. Therefore, the two categories of foreign investor PIEs should be merged, with a zero percent rate for all income except unimputed dividends. This would greatly simplify the regime. Alternatively, the foreign investment PIE rules should apply to classes within a multi- rate PIE. This could be done by extending the definition of foreign investment PIE to include a multi-rate PIE which has an investor class that meets the requirements of that definition. Comment Officials disagree. The policy rationale for developing the foreign investment PIE proposal was to allow the tax treatment of investors in a PIE to match that of a direct investor. In the case of a PIE that invests in New Zealand assets, this is necessarily complicated due to the range of rates that apply to different direct investments. Merging the two types of PIE so that a 0% tax rate applied to most New Zealand investments would compromise this principle and would amount to a tax concession. On allowing the foreign PIE rules to apply to classes within a multi-rate PIE, officials note that this is currently possible within the existing proposal. A multi-rate PIE would be able to elect to become a foreign investment PIE but operate only some classes under the new regime to cater for notified foreign investors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 17 Issue: Standard NRWT rate for unimputed dividends Clause 18B Submission (CTG) Under the current proposal NRWT rate on unimputed dividends will be 15% or 30%, depending on whether the investor is resident in a double tax agreement (DTA) country. The NRWT rate on unimputed dividends should be 15% regardless of whether the investor is a resident in a DTA country. Given that New Zealand’s DTA network is expanding, providing two rates is an over-complication. Comment The aim of the foreign investment PIE rule was to tax a non-resident investor in a PIE as if they had invested directly. For an investor from a non-DTA country this would mean any unimputed dividends should be taxed at 30%. Officials do not see any reason to depart from this principle. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemptions from New Zealand tax Clause 18H Submission (New Zealand Superannuation Fund) There should be an exemption from New Zealand tax, including AIL, for notified foreign investors’ share of New Zealand sourced income that arises from investing any surplus cash with New Zealand financial institutions. Comment For a zero rate foreign investment, officials consider that the 5% de minimis should adequately cater for investment of surplus cash. For other foreign investment PIEs that have a portfolio that includes investment in New Zealand debt, officials consider that New Zealand tax should continue to apply. This is consistent with the treatment of a direct investor investing in New Zealand debt. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 TECHNICAL ISSUES RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS Issue: Application date for the variable rate option Submission (KPMG) There are two application dates for entities choosing to be a foreign investment PIEs, date of enactment for the zero rate foreign investment PIEs and 1 April 2012 for the variable rate foreign investment PIEs. An entity that can implement the relevant system changes by 1 April 2012 should be allowed to apply the foreign investment PIE rules from the start of a quarter for example 1 October 2011. Comment To correctly apply the foreign investment PIE rules the entity would need to have its system changes made from the day they become a foreign investment PIE. It would not be enough for a PIE to have the necessary upgrades in place by 1 April 2012, as investors may wish to leave the PIE during the year, which would trigger a tax calculation. An earlier application date would also place additional pressure on Inland Revenue to release its specifications and upgrade its systems which would increase administrative costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Flexibility of application of denying deductions Clause 6B Submission (KPMG & MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The PIE industry uses different systems and therefore there needs to be flexibility to allow the PIE to achieve the end result of denying deductions for notified foreign investors. The current drafting requires the PIE to deny the deduction before the income is attributed to an investor. This forces the PIE to make two different calculations and drives the need to identify and split the income and deduction up front. Some existing PIEs would prefer to be able to make the adjustment for the deductions by way of add back. 19 The denial of deductibility comes at the wrong stage of the calculation because, under the calculation rules, it is not until there is a net amount of income in each class that amounts can be attributable to each investor. To correct this, we suggest that section DB 54B(1) is modified to deny the deductibility at the investor class level. Alternatively, a PIE should be able to apply the variable rates directly to the unimputed dividends and interest income. Comment Officials agree that foreign investor PIEs should have flexibility in how the effective denial of deductions is achieved. How the denial of deductions is achieved will clearly differ depending on the systems of the PIE. The legislation is not intended to prescribe how a foreign investment PIE derives the correct result, provided the end result is equivalent to the result that would be achieved by applying proposed section HM 35C. Officials will clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin that is published after the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Zero rate on unimputed dividends attributed to notified foreign investors Clause 18B Submission (KPMG) A foreign investment PIE that attributes unimputed dividends to a notified foreign investor will be required to calculate tax on that income, a 15% rate for investors in countries with which we have a double tax agreement and a 30% rate for other investors. The unimputed dividends will be sourced from untaxed (i.e. capital gains) or foreign income that exceeds the FIF income calculated under the fair dividend rate. This type of income, if earned directly by non-residents, would not be taxed in the investor’s hands. Further, foreign tax credits associated to foreign sourced income may not be fully utilised. 20 Comment Officials do not agree with this submission. If unimputed dividends attributable to a non-resident investor and derived by a foreign investment PIE were taxed at zero percent, it would make the tax treatment of such dividends derived by a foreign investment PIE tax favoured compared to unimputed dividends derived directly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transitional residents investing in variable rate foreign investment PIEs Submission (KPMG) There does not appears to be any policy reason why a transitional resident investing in a foreign investment variable rate PIE should not be afforded notified foreign investor treatment. Comment Officials disagree. Transitional residents (essentially new residents to New Zealand) are provided a four year exemption on their foreign sourced investment income. New Zealand sourced investment income is fully taxed to transitional residents from day one. Therefore, if a transitional resident invests in a foreign investment PIE that derives New Zealand sourced income, the PIE should pay tax in relation to the transitional resident on the basis they are a New Zealand resident. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-resident trustees be notified foreign investors Submission (KPMG & Ernst & Young) There is no reason why a non-resident trustee of a trust that is not a foreign trust (a “New Zealand trust”) should barred from being a notified foreign investor in income years where there is no New Zealand settlor of the trust. 21 Comment Officials do not agree. If the submission were accepted, New Zealand resident beneficiaries could receive the benefit of the treatment designed to apply to non- residents. For example, if the trust had offshore investments that would normally be subject to tax on an imputed 5% return under the fair dividend rate rules, because the trustee was treated as a notified foreign investor the tax would be reduced to zero. This is not the correct result. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Change of residency status Clause 18H Submission (MinterEllisonRuddWatts, KPMG, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, & PwC) The treatment of change of residency status in the supplementary order paper is not clear. Comment It is important that the foreign investment PIE rules handle situations where investors change their status midway through a year. This can happen in two main ways. First, a resident investor can change part-way through a year to being a non-resident investor (entitled to be a notified foreign investor). The second is that a notified foreign investor can become a New Zealand resident investor part-way through a year. The policy underlying the bill as currently drafted is designed to strike an appropriate balance between accuracy of tax treatment and sufficient flexibility for foreign investment PIEs. The intention of the rules as drafted is that, for resident investors that become non-resident, the PIE upon notification of the change of status should be able to treat the investor as a notified foreign investor from the day of notification, if they are able to do so, but no later than the start of the next tax year. If the investor has misrepresented their status to the PIE by indicating that they are a non-resident when in fact they are a resident, the rules should ensure that the income attributable to the period where the PIE has treated them as a notified foreign investor should be taxable to the investor as if they were a resident (with credits for any tax paid at the PIE level). 22 For a non-resident investor that becomes a resident investor, the policy of the rules as drafted is that, upon notification, the foreign investment PIE has the choice of changing the investor’s status immediately or waiting until the beginning of the next tax year to do so. If the PIE waits, the investor can continue to be treated as a notified foreign investor for the tax year and any income that is attributed to the investor during this transitional period is not subject to further tax at the investor level. Amongst other things, this is to handle situations when residency applies retrospectively, i.e. due to the application of the 183-day rule. A number of very useful submissions have been received on clarifying the provisions to ensure that they meet these policy objectives. These will be taken into account in redrafting these provisions to clarify the policy intention. Recommendation That the submissions be noted and taken into account when the provisions are redrafted. Issue: Non-portfolio FIF exclusion from notified foreign investor status Submission (KPMG & New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exclusions for persons who cannot be a notified foreign investor should also include persons that hold 10% or more interest in a non portfolio FIF. Comment Investors that are not subject to the current FIF rules, because they own more than 10% of the foreign company and are not subject to the CFC rules because they do not have a controlling interest, currently have an exemption from the FIF rules for investments in eight of our biggest trading and investment partners (e.g. USA, UK, Australia). Under the rules, as currently drafted, it would be possible for these investors to invest into a foreign company who is resident in, for example, Australia, which in turn invests in a foreign investment PIE. The foreign investment PIE could apply a 0% rate to this investment and the New Zealand resident investor could ultimately pay no New Zealand tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 23 Issue: Reporting amounts inclusive of non-deductible expenses Submission (KPMG) There is no tax effect when the zero rate is applied to either the gross assessable income or net taxable income so the PIE should not need to adjust for denied expenditure. Comment The PIE income tax return contains a declaration to the correctness of the information. Allowing the PIE to record non-deductible expenses would not be appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined Issue: Section HM 71B is overreaching Clause 20F Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants & KPMG) In order to become a foreign investment PIE an entity must currently meet the conditions of HM 8 to 17 and HM 20. This requirement is much stricter than the entry rules for normal PIEs, which only requires the conditions of sections HM 8 to HM 10, HM 17, HM 18 and HM 20 to be met. It is unclear if the exemptions to sections HM 14 and HM 15 provided by sections HM 21 and HM 22 are taken into account for the entry rule. The reference to HM 55B in the entry rules is confusing as only section HM 55(2)(f) is relevant to entry into the foreign investment PIE regime. Comment HM 71B should be amended to be more consistent with the current PIE entry rules. This would address the concerns raised in submissions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 24 Issue: Section HM 55H(3)(b) Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed rules provides breach rules if a foreign investment PIE fails to meet the modified criteria of section HM 55B. However, there does not appear to be any rules governing when a foreign investment PIE breaches the normal PIE rules. Comment A foreign investment PIE is a type of PIE, consequently the normal breach rules that apply to PIEs will also apply to foreign investment PIEs. No specific rules are required. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Section HM 71B – electronic elections Clause 20F Submission (Ernst & Young) An entity that is not currently a PIE is able to electronically elect to be a foreign investment PIE under section 31B of the Tax Administration Act. However, this option is not available to entities that are already PIEs. They are required to ring or write to Inland Revenue to elect to become a foreign investment PIE. In addition, the cancellation of foreign investment PIE status should also be able to be performed electronically. Comment A foreign investment PIE is only a type of PIE and so does not warrant the development of a specific election system. The costs of such a system would outweigh the benefits. 25 Cancellation of PIE status is currently done electronically. While a notification of a PIE changing its type is done manually. Officials see no reason to change this for foreign investment PIEs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section HM 55B – restrictions on non-New Zealand investments Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) Section HM 55B(2)(a) states that a foreign investment PIE cannot hold land in New Zealand and that section HM 11(a), which provides that a PIE can invest into land, does not apply. Section HM 11(a), however, does not have any territorial limitation. It is therefore unclear whether a foreign investment PIE is allowed to own non-New Zealand land. A similar issue arises with sections HM 55B(2)(c) and (d), which also relate to income from land. Comment Officials agree that, as drafted, these restrictions are unclear. The intention is that a foreign investment PIE should not be able to own New Zealand land directly but should be able to own non-New Zealand land directly. We recommend that the section be amended to clarify this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HM 55B – no prohibition on rights or options in land Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) As drafted, there is no prohibition on a foreign investment PIE having a right or option in land. Given the general restrictions on direct investment in land, whether this is intended or not should be clarified. 26 Comment Officials consider that a foreign investment PIE should not be able to directly own rights or options over land. The scheme of the PIE rules is that rights or options over assets are allowed only if investing in the underlying asset is also allowed. Foreign investment PIEs are unable to own land, therefore they should also be unable to own options or rights in land. Recommendation That the rules be amended so foreign investment PIEs are unable to own rights or options in land. Issue: Section HM 55B – no restrictions on type of income for certain foreign investment PIEs Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) A general requirement for a PIE is that is must only earn passive income. This requirement is turned off for certain kinds of foreign investment PIEs. Whether this is intended should be clarified. Comment Officials agree that all foreign investment PIEs should essentially be portfolio investors. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HM 55D – Requirement to provide information Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) Entities that are non-natural persons should be able to invest in foreign investment PIEs but may be prevented from doing as they are unable to provide the required information – they cannot provide a date of birth, for example. This should be accommodated. 27 The meaning of “country code” is not clear and should be clarified. Comment Officials agree and will clarify the rules accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HM 55D – restriction on resident trustees of foreign trusts Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young, Fonterra & MinterEllisonRuddWatts) New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts should be able to be notified foreign investors. Comment Officials disagree. If the submission were accepted, New Zealand resident beneficiaries of foreign trusts could in certain circumstances effectively pay no tax on investment income earned through foreign investment PIEs. This is not appropriate. It is acknowledged that in certain situations this will not produce the correct result for non-resident beneficiaries of foreign trusts. It is difficult to see how this could be addressed given that trusts can have a mixture of New Zealand resident and non- resident beneficiaries. Furthermore, officials recommend that non-New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts also be unable to elect notified foreign investor status for the same reason. Recommendation That the submission be declined and that the legislation be amended so that non-New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts cannot elect notified investor status. 28 Issue: Section HM 55E – ceasing to be a transitional resident Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) A provision is required that sets out how to treat an investor that ceases to be a transitional resident partway through a year. Comment The problem highlighted by the submitter occurs when a transitional resident ceases to be a transitional resident part-way through a tax year. Strictly, if such a transitional resident had invested in a zero rated foreign investment PIE, they would move to a 0% PIE tax rate that applied to resident investor at the same time. This would give rise to compliance costs for foreign investment PIEs and the taxpayer. Therefore, officials recommend that transitional residents that cease to be eligible for the 0% tax rate can continue to use the 0% tax rate until the beginning of the next tax year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interaction with double tax agreements Submission (Ernst & Young) There should be an express provision providing how New Zealand’s domestic law and double tax agreement residence provisions work, especially in dual residence situations. Comment It is considered that the relationship between New Zealand’s domestic law and the application of its double tax agreements in relation to determining residence (in particular, in dual residence situations) is clear under existing law. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 Issue: Section HM 55G – meaning of interest income Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) The meaning of “interest income” and how it interacts with the financial arrangement rules and the concept of “interest” in the NRWT rules should be clarified. Comment The submission is noted but officials do not consider that this will give rise to issues in practice. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Section HM 55G – how interest income should be measured and valued Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is needed on the time or times the types of interest income must be valued and how this should be done. Comment Officials note that the test is an asset test, not an income test. It is not necessary to measure income in order to meet the requirements of the de minimis. However, officials agree that the 5% de minimis test should only be required to be satisfied at the end of each quarter. If a breach occurs, the foreign investment PIE should have another quarter to rectify the breach. This is consistent with the other breach provisions in the PIE rules. Recommendation That the 5% de minimis test will only be required to be satisfied at the end of each quarter and if a breach occurs, the foreign investment PIE will have another quarter to rectify the breach . 30 Issue: Section HM 55G – PIE income cannot be foreign sourced Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) It is unclear how attributed PIE income could be a foreign sourced amount. The introduction to proposed section HM 55G refers to allowable amounts of New Zealand sourced income, however paragraph (c)(i) includes foreign-sourced amounts. Comment Officials agree and recommend the section be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: HM 55H(3) reversion to a multi-rate PIE Clause 18H Submission (Ernst & Young) All foreign investment PIEs should lose foreign investment PIE status (i.e. become ordinary multi-rate PIEs) if they fail to meet the relevant criteria of proposed section HM 55B. Comment Officials agree. Proposed section HM 55H(3), as written, only applies to foreign investment PIEs that derive New Zealand and foreign sourced income. It does not apply to foreign investment PIEs that derive only foreign sourced amounts. This is incorrect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 31 Issue: HM 44 – Partially imputed dividends Clause 18D Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants & Fonterra) It should be clarified that the NRWT option is available for partially imputed dividends as well as entirely unimputed dividends. If a foreign investment PIE does not use the NRWT option for a partially imputed dividend, a 0% rate should apply to the extent the dividend is imputed and a 15% or 30% rate should apply to the extent it is unimputed. Comment Officials agree that should be clarified. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Sections HM 41 and HM 44: Incidence of NRWT liability Clauses 18B and 18D Submission (Fonterra) Proposed section HM 44B and proposed table 1B of Schedule 6 need to be redrafted to clarify that a notified foreign investor is liable for the NRWT charged, not the foreign investment PIE. Comment Officials agree. It should be clear that if the NRWT option is selected, the tax is withheld from the payment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 32 Issue: NRWT option – labelling of the dividend on-paid Clause 18D Submission (Fonterra) The proposed option for foreign investment PIEs to deduct NRWT on unimputed dividends rather than paying tax at the PIE level should be reworded so that it is clear that when the foreign investment PIE pays the dividend that it receives to its investors, the amount paid is an amount equivalent to the dividend received (rather than the dividend itself). Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: PIE timing rule Submission (Fonterra) A listed multi-rate PIE is not able to access the special timing rule available to multi- rate PIEs. Comment Officials consider that the result sought by the submitter is already achieved in the current PIE rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 33 Issue: Tax calculation – notional classes Clause 16E Submission (New Zealand Law Society) When calculating their tax liability foreign investment PIEs should treat notified foreign investors in a particular class separately from other investors in that class. As currently drafted, the notified foreign investors in all separate classes of the foreign investment PIE would be treated as part of the same class for the purposes of the tax calculation. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Portfolio investor proxies (nominees) Clause 16D Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As currently drafted portfolio investor proxies (PIPs) (essentially nominees acting on behalf of investors) that invest into a foreign investment PIE on behalf of a non- resident investor would be required to undertake the same tax calculations and perform the same obligations as if the PIP were a foreign investment PIE. Given some PIPs will not have the requisite systems to do this, this should be made optional. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 34 Issue: Consequences if zero rate PIE breaches criteria before 1 April 2012 Clause 18H Submission (PwC) It is unclear what the consequences are for a zero rate PIE that breaches the zero rate PIE criteria after formation and before 1 April 2012. Comment Officials agree that the rules as currently drafted are unclear in certain circumstances. If the zero rate foreign investment PIE breaches the relevant criteria after 1 April 2012 it is clear that they become a variable rate foreign investment PIE. However, variable rate foreign investment PIEs cannot exist until 1 April 2012. Therefore, it is recommended that the rules be amended that if a zero-rate PIE breaches the relevant criteria before 1 April 2012 they should become a multi-rate PIE. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Tax rate for non-residents that are not notified foreign investors Submission (PwC) A new provision should be created to ensure that it is clear that a foreign investment PIE must apply the 28% rate to income attributed to a non-resident until the time they elect to become a notified foreign investor. Comment Officials consider that it is already clear, under the rules as currently drafted, that that a non-resident would have a 28% rate applied before they elected to be a notified foreign investor. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 35 DRAFTING ISSUES Submitters also made a number of useful drafting suggestions. These will be taken into account during the redrafting process.
Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 November 2011 Inland Revenue Department Contents Executive summary 1 1. The policy development process 4 2. The New Zealand tax system and how it compares internationally 9 3. Policy challenges 27 4. Administration of the tax system 39 Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 1 of 49 Executive summary As Minister of Revenue you are accountable for the overall working of New Zealand's tax system and for the Inland Revenue Department. In addition, tax policy decisions are made jointly by yourself and the Minister of Finance. Our key advice is that New Zealand’s tax system is in a good place. The tax bases are broad, robust and provide reliable sources of revenue to fund Government programmes. The broad tax bases and the relatively low tax rates make the tax system among the most coherent in the OECD. This helps in ensuring that the tax system is relatively efficient and fair. As well as having a coherent tax policy the tax administration functions well – as demonstrated by the conclusions of various external reviews. This underlines the main point that a good tax system is not just about good policy. Both tax policy and tax administration must be working well for us to have a good tax system. Key issues and challenges While the tax system is in good shape there are a number of key issues and challenges that will need to be considered in the short- to medium-term. These are summarised below and covered in more detail in later chapters. Fitting the tax policy work programme into the Government’s broader economic objectives Inland Revenue and the Treasury agree upon the tax policy work programme with the Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Finance. A key challenge will be to ensure that the tax policy work programme fits into the Government’s broader economic objectives. Early next year officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury will discuss the tax policy work programme with Ministers to ensure that this happens. This is discussed further in chapter 1. The tax system and abating social assistance Given fiscal constraints, reform of Working for Families and other forms of social assistance that abate with income is likely to be a key issue for this and future governments. When evaluating reform in these areas it is important to consider how tax fits in. There are a number of competing goals in this area that cannot be easily reconciled. For example, Working for Families tax credits provide substantial assistance to many low and middle-income families. However, to keep this assistance affordable it is necessary to abate the assistance as income increases. This increases the effective marginal tax rate of recipients and, therefore, inevitably affects work incentives. In a fiscally constrained environment there is no clear solution to this problem. Any reform will require a trade-off between the level of assistance, who it is targeted to and Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 2 of 49 work incentives. These are difficult tradeoffs which will need to be worked through in making any changes in this area. This is discussed further in chapter 2. Maintaining a coherent tax system The broad-base, low-rate framework that underpins New Zealand’s tax system is one of the most coherent in the OECD. There are some major benefits in having a coherent framework. Maintaining such a framework means ensuring that changes to specific parts of the tax system are evaluated according to their effect on the tax system as an integrated whole. New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate framework is not the only coherent tax system. Different governments with differing distributional objectives might reasonably choose different frameworks. But a priority is in ensuring that any framework is coherent and that taxpayers cannot avoid paying their fair share of tax. Two alternative coherent systems that could be adopted have been considered in various reviews. These are a Nordic system (currently in place in Norway) or a system that incorporates an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) and a rate of return allowance (RRA), as suggested by the recent Mirrlees Review in the United Kingdom. Common to both of these alternative systems is a significant reduction in the taxation of capital relative to labour. There are pros and cons to all three coherent approaches, and which one is most appropriate for a country will, to a large extent, depend on the special characteristics of that country. Inland Revenue considers that the current broad-base, low-rate framework is the best available coherent tax framework for New Zealand. But this system works less well if the top personal tax rate is too much higher than the company rate. While arguments can be made for adopting a Nordic or an ACE/RRA system, a large onus of proof should be shifted before moving to either of these approaches. It is important for the Government to make a choice on the framework that should apply because, until this is done, it is difficult to evaluate the pros and cons of more specific tax changes. This is discussed further in chapter 3. Inland Revenue in a digital age Inland Revenue’s IT systems are based around FIRST – a system developed specifically for Inland Revenue in the early 1990s. Since then, the functions of Inland Revenue have grown and are now much broader than simply collecting taxes. They include administration of Working for Families and KiwiSaver, and the collection of student loans and child support. The growth in the ambit of Inland Revenue’s functions and changes in public expectations have resulted in FIRST becoming a significant constraint on the department’s operations. Inland Revenue has a strategy to address this which it will implement progressively over the next 10 years. This is a substantial investment (with estimated spending between $1.0 and $1.5 billion). An important priority is ensuring that this new investment programme works well. Over the next few years before the programme is fully implemented, Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver policy changes with complex system implications will be constrained. This is discussed further in chapter 4. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 3 of 49 Delivery of core functions in a constrained fiscal environment The Government’s fiscal position is likely to be under significant pressure for some time. To assist in managing this, departments (including Inland Revenue) can be expected to deliver more for less. Inland Revenue has already been able to identify and deliver considerable savings over the past few years, while continuing to deliver against our performance measures but this has become progressively more difficult. Inland Revenue’s future baselines will require us to provide significant efficiency savings. Some of this can be achieved by making existing policy and operational frameworks more efficient. Nevertheless, the level of efficiencies necessary to stay within our future baselines is likely to require some difficult tradeoffs. We will face pressures to reduce service levels or make changes in some policies. Some of this will involve capitalising on the efficiency opportunities that technology change provides such as dealing with customers and intermediaries electronically rather than over-the-counter, by telephone or by letter. The efficiency benefits that can be achieved through increased electronic contact are significant but they will be reduced or even eliminated if existing communication channels remain at current levels. We face some difficult challenges in this area. Some legislative or policy changes may be required and these are likely to be controversial. This is also discussed in chapter 4. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 4 of 49 1. The policy development process Since 1994, tax policy has been developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). This is a very open and interactive process which helps ensure that tax policy changes are well thought through. A good tax policy process is an essential ingredient for a good tax system. We believe that the GTPP is a good process which is valued by the private sector. You should be aware that the consultation that takes place under the GTPP will add to the time it takes to develop tax policy but this helps towards good and stable policies being developed. As part of the GTPP there is a published tax policy work programme. Developing a new work programme will be a top priority early in the New Year. There are also a number of tax bills that have lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament prior to the election. Ministers will need to reconsider their reinstatement. The tax policy consultative process The GTPP was introduced to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives. Another key feature of the process is that it builds external consultation and feedback into the policy development process, providing opportunities for public comment at several stages. Consultation throughout the policy process contributes to greater transparency of policy- making, allowing the Government to set out the policy objectives of proposals and the trade-offs it has made in developing them. Therefore it helps the public to understand the rationale behind Government policy proposals. It also helps to ensure that when Ministers are making policy decisions they are fully informed of different views and can judge them on their merits. The consultative process cannot, of course, be used for changes that require immediate action to protect the revenue base. It would not be possible to move quickly and, at the same time, to engage in wide consultation on changes to close a recently identified loophole, for example, or to block a scheme that is losing the country hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. New Zealand’s tax policy consultation process is well-regarded internationally. For example, the Australian Board of Taxation in its 2007 review of Australia’s tax consultation system, which included a multi-country survey of how consultation is handled elsewhere, made extensive reference to New Zealand’s consultative process. In the course of the review, representatives of the Board visited New Zealand to talk with officials and the private sector about our process, as it was identified as a best practice model on several occasions in its survey. Within New Zealand, the GTPP is widely accepted as the way to make tax policy, and tax professionals and professional associations expect it to be used, as a matter of course. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 5 of 49 Indeed, the Australian review cited as one of the main success factors in the operation of the New Zealand system, ―a view shared by key officials and external stakeholders that they all need to contribute constructively in the best interests of the New Zealand tax system and economy. This leads to cooperation, assistance and frank dialogue both on parties’ contribution to consultation and other processes‖. The increasing opportunity for consulting on tax policy has resulted in growing numbers of individuals and organisations making submissions on proposed changes, whether these are set out in a consultation paper or introduced in a taxation bill. The downside is that the consultative process makes the process lengthier and requires greater policy, private sector and parliamentary resources. New Zealand has a private sector which is particularly well informed on tax policy issues. In large part this is a legacy of the open and constructive policy debates that have flowed from the GTPP. There has in the past been less engagement with the academic community than is true for some other countries. In recent years, however, this has been changing. Victoria University together with Inland Revenue and the Treasury organised a conference on tax policy in February 2009 which brought together a set of international experts to consider possible fundamental tax reforms for New Zealand. This led to the formation of the Tax Working Group (TWG) which drew together leading tax practitioners, academics and tax officials to debate tax reform options. The TWG reported to the Government in January 2010. This was a time-intensive major review of taxation both for policy officials preparing papers for the Group and for the individual members of the Group. But it provided an opportunity for very open debate on major tax policy reform options. It helped guide tax reforms in Budget 2010. Other bodies have also considered tax policy issues as part of a wider set of policy issues. These have included the Job Summit, the Capital Market Development Taskforce which reported to the Government in December 2009 and the Savings Working Group which reported in January 2011. These wider bodies have also considered important tax policy concerns. These can be challenging to work through quickly because tax changes are often very difficult to examine on a one-off basis. Because tax policy changes can affect the overall coherence of the tax system, a detailed understanding of the tax system and how it fits together is necessary to understand the full ramifications. Servicing these various committees has absorbed an increasing amount of tax policy resources. Developing a new tax policy work programme One of the first steps for the new Government in relation to the GTPP is to develop a three-year revenue strategy that is effectively linked with the Government’s economic and fiscal strategy. The next stage is the development of a rolling tax policy work programme that gives effect to the revenue strategy. At present, the work programme covers an 18-month period. Developing the work programme involves scoping broad policy proposals and prioritising and sequencing the development of initiatives. We also look at budgeted resource requirements, the time needed to develop, legislate for and implement initiatives, and the modes of consultation and communication to be employed throughout the process. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 6 of 49 This stage of the GTPP culminates in a joint report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the Treasury to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue recommending a tax policy work programme. Once approved, the work programme becomes a detailed tax policy plan between the Government and the two departments. We will be reporting to you and the Minister of Finance on possible measures for the tax policy work programme early in the New Year. The work programme is generally made public, attracting strong interest from the tax and business communities, to whom it provides greater certainty and an understanding of the Government’s direction in tax policy. As time passes and the work programme is updated, and new policy initiatives are added to it, there is a risk that there will be more items on the programme than can be progressed during the 18-month period. It is therefore important that when items are added to the work programme, existing priorities are reviewed to ensure that the Government’s expectations across the work programme are met. The work programme in recent years To reflect Government priorities, the focus of the tax policy work programme over the last three years has been on lifting productivity and growth and reducing New Zealand’s vulnerability to economic shocks. Tax reforms have focused on improving incentives to work, save and invest, improving the fairness, coherence and integrity of the tax system, boosting New Zealand’s international competitiveness and helping to ensure that we deliver a good tax system that is ―value for money‖. In addition, an urgent priority was responding quickly to make sure that the tax system was not impacting unfairly on taxpayers affected by the Canterbury earthquakes. Work programme priorities over the last three years have included: Budget 2010. This was a significant tax package that reduced income tax rates across-the-board, increased GST and broadened the tax base in a number of areas (including the removal of depreciation on most buildings). The package was designed to be broadly revenue neutral, with the GST increase and the base-broadening measures paying for the income tax rate reductions. Business transformation. This involves moving from Inland Revenue’s current paper-based tax administration system to a more electronic and smarter administration. Various streams of work have taken place, including changes to the treatment of student loans and changes to secrecy and privacy rules. Servicing groups considering tax reform measures. These have included the Jobs Summit, the Capital Market Development Taskforce, the Tax Working Group and the Savings Working Group. International Tax Review. This has involved extending an active business exemption to New Zealanders that have significant but non-controlling interests in foreign companies, tax changes to remove the 2% Approved Issuer Levy that applies to non-resident investments in certain widely issued bonds. These measures are contained in the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced in October 2010. In Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 7 of 49 addition, New Zealand has signed double tax agreements with Australia, the United States, Singapore, Turkey and Hong Kong. Child support. This has involved changes to the child support rules to reflect better the actual cost of raising children today and to take account of the degree of shared care between two parents and the income levels of both parents. These measures are contained in the Child Support Amendment Bill introduced in October 2011. Income sharing. The Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill, which proposes that each partner in a relationship caring for children under 18 be taxed on an equal share of their combined income was introduced in August 2010. The Canterbury earthquake. Inland Revenue responded quickly to a variety of operational and policy concerns that arose following the earthquake. Various Orders in Council were developed to help those affected, including the provision of interest relief and flexibility on due dates. There were also legislative responses, including changes affecting depreciation, insurance claims, rollover relief, timing changes and income and tax relief. Developing a new tax policy work programme will be a top priority for both Ministers and officials. Setting priorities The work programme must balance the resource requirements of the Minister of Revenue’s main tax policy initiatives against those required for initiatives introduced by other Ministers – for example, in the areas of social policy or sector assistance – which can have substantial tax implications. It must also allow room to meet private sector concerns when tax legislation is identified as causing unintended practical problems. Finally, there is an increasing demand for tax policy resources to be allocated to international tax areas such as OECD work and trans-Tasman tax matters, a reflection of the increasing extent to which New Zealand must take into account international tax trends in setting its domestic rules. Given the many areas of Government policy that have tax implications, the complexity of tax issues and the finite resources available to deal with them, it is essential for Ministers to discuss and set out their tax policy priorities. Since many areas of government raise important tax policy issues, the allocation of tax policy resources is likely to affect the Government’s ability to use tax to pursue non-tax policy objectives, especially in economic development and social policy. It is therefore desirable for Ministers in those areas to be clear about the implications for the tax policy work programme of policy developments in their portfolios. The legislative programme Five bills lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament on 20 October in anticipation of the general election. These are the: Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 8 of 49  Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced on 14 September 2011. The bill covers changes to returns filing and record- keeping requirements, an increase in the minimum employee and employer contribution rates for KiwiSaver, and the deductibility of expenditure on software development if the software cannot be used and the project is abandoned. The bill has had its first reading and has been referred to Select Committee.  Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill introduced on 7 September 2011. The bill covers changes to improve the efficiency and fairness of the student loan scheme and encourage borrowers to take greater responsibility for their loan repayments. It includes measures to improve current loan repayment levels, removes the ability to offset losses against a borrower’s net income, reduces the repayment holiday period to one year, and requires borrowers to apply for the repayment holiday. The bill has had its first reading and has been referred to Select Committee.  Taxation (Income-sharing Tax Credit) Bill introduced 16 August 2010. The bill provides for the sharing of income for tax purposes by a couple who are caring for children. The bill has been reported back by Select Committee and is awaiting its second reading.  Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced on 26 October 2010. The bill continues the reform of New Zealand’s international tax rules by allowing an active income exemption for joint ventures and other significant New Zealand shareholdings in foreign companies that are not controlled by New Zealand firms. The bill has been reported back by Select Committee and is awaiting its second reading.  Child Support Amendment Bill introduced on 5 October 2011. The bill covers a range of changes to improve the scheme, including changes to the child support formula and to the rules relating to payment, debt and penalties. The bill is yet to have its first reading. If not reinstated, these bills will lapse. Ministers will need to consider the reinstatement of some or all of these bills when Parliament reconvenes.

The New Zealand tax system and how it compares internationally This chapter examines New Zealand’s tax system and benchmarks it against the tax systems of other countries. In particular, it comments on some of the likely economic efficiency and distributional effects of New Zealand’s tax settings. The main objective of taxation is to raise revenue to fund the Government’s expenditure. This should be done in a way that is considered to be fair. Tax is, however, costly to impose. There are direct costs associated with administration and compliance, but also costs associated with distortions in people’s behaviour. Almost all taxes distort behaviour. For example, the imposition of a personal income tax may result in a person working less than they would have in the absence of the tax. Alternatively, a person may choose to pursue less education because of the tax as they will not benefit as much from the higher salary that more education would bring. These distortions often affect economic growth and productivity. That said, a tax can still distort behaviour even though it does not affect economic growth or productivity. For example, in a small open economy like New Zealand, taxes on saving might, at least in theory, have little effect on GDP or growth while still being quite distorting. The same could potentially be true of a stamp duty on housing or high taxes on certain goods but not others. Distortions arise because of the way a tax induces people to do things that they would not desire in the absence of the tax. To minimise these distortions, New Zealand has adopted a tax paradigm generally characterised as ―broad-based, low-rate‖ (BBLR). The fundamental idea is to have a broadly defined tax base, which allows tax rates to be lower, thereby reducing the costs associated with taxation. Low personal tax rates, for example, minimise the disincentive to work created by an income tax. Further, having low rates and a broad base reduces biases between different forms of saving. Key observations Our overall impression is that the New Zealand tax system generally performs well. It is not in need of major overhaul. It raises revenue to finance Government spending in ways that are relatively fair and efficient. New Zealand gains the bulk of its revenue from three main taxes: company income, personal income and GST. It has removed very inefficient taxes on transactions and turnover that many other countries have. Tax as a proportion of GDP is slightly below OECD averages and has declined markedly over the last few years. An important choice for the Government is whether it wishes tax revenues to increase, decrease or remain reasonably steady over time. New Zealand has, like other countries, faced a cyclical decline in tax revenue as a result of the global financial crisis but there were also important policy steps which reduced tax revenue between 2004–05 and 2009–10. New Zealand’s fiscal position and ageing population are Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 10 of 49 likely to create fiscal constraints which limit the scope for tax cuts without offsetting tax increases in the short- to medium-term. This and the fact that tax changes must be seen to be fair mean that tax changes are unlikely to be a ―silver bullet‖ for driving economic growth. It is likely that cuts in distorting taxes will need to be balanced by increases in other distorting taxes unless substantial cuts in Government spending are possible. The most recent available data suggests that by OECD standards New Zealand obtains a relatively large share of its tax revenue by way of taxes on income and profits (including company and personal income taxes). These are among the taxes that the OECD has identified as being worst for growth. But New Zealand does not have certain other taxes which the OECD includes in the ―worst for growth‖ territory and does not look particularly out of line when these other taxes are included. New Zealand’s three main tax bases (personal tax, company tax and GST) all have broad bases, allowing substantial amounts of tax to be collected at modest tax rates. These settings are designed to reduce the costs of taxation. For the personal income tax and GST, New Zealand has low rates but high revenues compared with other OECD countries. Our company tax rate remains higher than the OECD average despite the recent reduction to 28%. There are pros and cons in reducing the company tax rate further. While revenue from company tax is also relatively high compared with other OECD countries, it has reduced markedly in recent years. We need to monitor whether this is simply a cyclical downturn or evidence of a structural fall in company tax revenues. New Zealand performs well in terms of tax administration, and compliance costs are likely to be broadly average or slightly below other OECD countries. When considering progressivity and redistribution it makes little sense to look at New Zealand’s tax system in isolation. A substantial amount of redistribution in New Zealand takes place through transfer payments and, in particular, Working for Families. For the most recent year data are available, tax progressivity for a single individual without children seems broadly consistent with OECD averages. But there are big differences in average tax rates for households with and without children. A single income earner household with two children pays a very much lower average tax rate than a single income earner household with no children. The difference between these households is bigger in New Zealand than for any other OECD country. This reflects the fact that much redistribution in New Zealand is targeted at households with children. This is arguably a relatively targeted and hence cost-effective way of redistributing income. While New Zealand generally has low personal rates of tax, individuals can face considerably higher effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) as a result of abating social assistance (especially through Working for Families). High EMTRs will distort decisions, reducing incentives to work and upskill, and limiting the scope for people to change their circumstances. However, relatively low numbers of individuals are subject to very high EMTRs which means that these high EMTRs may be less distorting than is sometimes thought. There are difficult tradeoffs in making changes in this area. Reducing EMTRs will either mean reducing assistance to needy families, or increasing costs. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 11 of 49 New Zealand and the rest of the world New Zealand’s BBLR approach is reflected in the graphs below. Despite modest tax rates, New Zealand collects reasonably large amounts of revenue from its major tax bases. Our GST base, in particular, is very broad. (See figure 1) Including resident and non-resident withholding taxes, we obtain about 90 percent of our tax revenue from personal and corporate income (or other similar taxes) and GST. In particular, we have largely removed taxes on transactions or turnover that international reviews such as the Henry Review in Australia and the Mirrlees Review in the United Kingdom have identified as being particularly inefficient. Tax as a percentage of GDP For the 2009–10 year, New Zealand’s tax revenue amounted to 31 percent of GDP. (See figure 2) This placed New Zealand slightly below the OECD average. 1 One obvious change relative to figures reported in our previous BIM (2008) is that New Zealand’s tax revenue as a percentage of GDP has fallen significantly in recent years from 35.1 to 31.0 percent of GDP since 2007. 2 This is considerably larger than the fall experienced by OECD nations on average; the OECD-average fell 1.5 percentage points from 35.4 percent to 33.9 percent. 1 Note that some countries, such as New Zealand, tax welfare payments while others do not. This can create apparent differences in tax collected as a percent of GDP. 2 The actual figure reported in the previous BIM was 36 percent. The OECD has since revised the figure for the 2007–08 year to 35.1 percent.

But there have also been significant tax reforms enacted since 2008 that will also be reflected in this reduced tax to GDP ratio. We estimate that about 2.5 percentage points of this decline is attributable to policy changes with the remainder attributable to the global financial crisis. There have also been significant increases in transfers through changes in Working for Families and the introduction of KiwiSaver. The combined effect of the transfer and tax policy changes is shown in figure 3.

To a large extent, the personal tax changes between 2004–05 and 2009–10 were financed by returning ―fiscal drag‖. Over the later 1990s and early 2000s average tax rates increased. When inflation and real wages increased, tax brackets were not adjusted to keep average tax rates unchanged. This is commonly referred to as fiscal drag. After the October 2008 cut in the bottom marginal tax rate and the increase in personal tax thresholds and further April 2009 cuts, average tax rates for PAYE earners were returned to their levels 10 years previously. The October 2010 tax cuts further lowered average tax rates but were, of course, offset by an increase in the rate of GST. (See figure 4) An important question for the Government is whether it wishes to return fiscal drag by adjusting the personal tax scale as future inflation and real wage growth pushes people on to higher average tax rates. When looking ahead, we are obviously in a tight fiscal position. The Government now faces a significant deficit and an ageing population which between 2009 and 2050 is expected to increase the cost of New Zealand Superannuation by approximately 3 percent of GDP. This will constrain choices for the near future – without a significant cut in public services, any tax cuts are likely to have to be funded from tax increases elsewhere. A substantial cut in the company tax rate, for example, would need to be funded through higher personal tax rates or GST, or possibly some new tax base. Base broadening may also provide additional funding, but New Zealand’s tax bases are already very broad.

(See figure 5) 3 This is largely because – unlike other OECD countries – New Zealand has no social security tax or payroll taxes. The OECD considers that taxes on corporate and personal income along with social security taxes and payroll taxes are those which are most harmful to growth. Often the economic incidence of social security taxes will fall on employees and may have similar effects to an income tax in distorting labour supply decisions. 4 Since social security taxes, unlike an income tax, do not tax savings and investment income they will not, however, distort savings or investment decisions. 5 New Zealand has the third highest proportion of tax on income, profits and capital gains within the OECD (behind Denmark and Australia), but it is broadly in line with other countries once social security contributions and payroll taxes are taken into account. GST, company tax and income tax collections Compared with most OECD countries, New Zealand has relatively broad bases for GST, company income and personal income. These taxes collect substantial revenue as a percent of GDP despite relatively modest rates. A country that has a broadly defined tax base will collect more in tax as a fraction of GDP compared with a country with the same 3 The data for New Zealand reflect the year to 30 June 2010. The recent reduction in income tax rates and the increase in the GST rate that were made as part of Budget 2010 will have moved New Zealand away from taxes on income and profits towards consumption taxation relative to data reported in figure 5. 4 If an individual benefits directly from his or her own social security contributions, these taxes may be less distorting than taxes on labour income. 5 Exactly where to group different taxes is not clearcut. A GST also reduces the purchasing power of wages and largely falls on labour income. However, it also reduces the purchasing power of wealth at the time the tax is introduced and is, in part, a lump sum tax on wealth.

This indicates that New Zealand has been relatively successful in implementing the BBLR taxation paradigm. As shown in figure 6, in 2009 New Zealand’s GST collections amounted to 8.5 percent of GDP – the sixth highest in the OECD. 6 New Zealand’s GST rate at the time was 12.5% – the sixth lowest in the OECD (excluding the United States, which has no GST). This shows that New Zealand’s GST base is comparatively very broad. The recent rise in the rate of GST will, of course, increase GST collections as a percent of GDP. Another measure of how broadly defined a country’s GST base is the ―c-efficiency‖ ratio. This compares the revenue actually collected from a country’s GST to that which would have been raised if the ―standard rate‖ of tax were applied to all consumption. Internationally New Zealand has the broadest GST base in the OECD. (See figure 7) 6 This is similar to the 9 percent of GDP figure reported for 2006–07 in our last BIM.

For example, New Zealand does not allow interest deductions for a person’s own house and does not provide very large tax incentives for retirement savings. Again, this reflects New Zealand’s BBLR paradigm. 7 The top personal tax rate was lowered to 33% as part of the 2010 Budget.

This reduction in personal tax collections is likely to be largely the result of personal tax cuts. (See figure 8) Another reason for the high tax take from personal income tax despite the modest top tax rate is that the tax scale is relatively flat. The top tax rate begins applying at a low level of income (1.5 times the average wage) and the difference between the top and bottom tax rates is relatively small (25.5 percentage points in 2009 and 22.5 percentage points due to the Budget 2010 tax cuts). One concern about a high top personal marginal rate is that it results in higher average tax rates on able individuals which may encourage talented New Zealanders to leave or discourage talented non-residents from coming to New Zealand. The most recent OECD data suggests that New Zealand has a very mobile labour force and has the third highest level of domestically-born individuals living abroad. (See figure 9) Company tax is also an important part of New Zealand’s tax base. In 2009, New Zealand collected 3.3 percent of GDP in company tax, the sixth highest in the OECD. At that time, New Zealand’s company tax rate was the seventh equal highest in the OECD, although it has since dropped to 28%. There has been a reasonably large decline in company tax as a percentage of GDP from the previous BIM, when company tax was 5.8 percent of GDP. A small part of this decline will be explained by the decrease in tax rate from 33% to 30% at the start of the 2008–09 income year. For the remainder, we need to monitor whether this is simply a cyclical downturn or evidence of a structural fall in company tax revenues. (See figure 10) Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 18 of 49 Even given its recent reduction, New Zealand’s company tax rate remains higher than average for the OECD. At the beginning of the 2011–12 year, the average company tax rate among the OECD was 25.5%. (See figure 11) One reason for potential concern about New Zealand’s relatively high company tax rate is that this may make it less attractive for foreigners to invest into New Zealand. This has been cited as a potential concern by recent tax reviews. A recent survey found that, on average across different studies, a 1 percentage point cut in the company tax rate leads Figure 10: Company income tax rates and revenues (2009, in percentages) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Norway Australia \* Luxembourg Korea Czech Republic Portugal \* Switzerland New Zealand New Zealand (2011) Netherlands Italy Sweden Slovak Republic United Kingdom Israel Poland \* Belgium Greece \* Canada Ireland Denmark Japan Hungary Spain United States Finland Turkey Slovenia Austria France Germany Iceland Chile \*\* Mexico \*\* Company income tax revenue as % of gross domestic productCompany income tax rate (2009) Note: Countries are ranked from highest company income tax revenue as % of gross domestic product to lowest. \* Data is for 2008 \*\* Company income tax revenue not available Source: OECD, KPMG’s Corporate and Indirect Tax Rate Survey 2009 New Zealand Figure 11: Historical trends in statutory company tax rates (in percentages) 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 1981198219831984198519861987198819891990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011 AustraliaNew ZealandUnited StatesOECD unweighted averageEU-15 unweighted average Source: OECD Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 19 of 49 to a 3.72 percent increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) 8 . However, there are many significant non-tax factors which affect FDI and these differ between countries. It might be expected that investment into many other countries may be much more sensitive to tax than investment into New Zealand, because of New Zealand’s small size and geographic isolation. Taken at face value, the studies would suggest that cutting New Zealand’s company rate from 33% to 30% in 2008 would have boosted FDI by about 11 percent (a difference of about 5.5 percent of GDP from about 50 percent to roughly 55.5 percent of GDP). In fact, since 2008 there has been a small decline in FDI, although it is difficult to know what would have happened in the absence of the tax change and international turmoil in recent years with the global financial crisis. Other things considered, one would have predicted the company rate cut would have had some effect in boosting FDI but the data provide no evidence of an upswing. (See figure 12) It is too early to see the effects of the more recent cut in the company rate from 30% to 28%. The effects of this on boosting FDI will be more difficult to disentangle because of changes to the depreciation rules and to the thin capitalisation rules. These policy changes will have tended to have an offsetting effect on FDI. This underlies an important point. Tax is not a ―silver bullet‖. There are many factors besides tax that determine people’s behaviour. While taxes do distort behaviour in significant ways and should be levied in the fairest and least distorting way possible, tax can be a blunt instrument for attaining wider economic goals. This is likely to be especially true in a constrained fiscal environment if cutting one tax means increasing others and if fairness concerns prevent the Government from making the tax system more efficient but less progressive. 8 De Mooij, R . and S.

We understand that the apparent decline in New Zealand’s position is because of a change in the survey method rather than evidence of increasing costs of doing business. Our own research on small-to- medium enterprises suggests that compliance costs for these firms fell by 1.3 percent over the period from 2004 to 2009. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 21 of 49 A significant component of ―ease of paying taxes‖ is the total time a particular type of firm is expected to take in complying with its tax obligations. In the 2012 survey, New Zealand ranks in the middle of the OECD with 172 hours. (See figure 13) This includes 24 hours to allow for the recent increase in the GST rate. Excluding this one-off adjustment New Zealand would rank 14 th with 148 hours; below average, but only just. The time for taxpayers to comply is clearly something that needs to be monitored and keeping compliance costs low is an important focus for future tax reform. Figure 14 shows the cost of raising 100 units of revenue across the OECD. New Zealand is somewhat below the average, with an administrative cost of $0.88 to raise $100 of revenue for the 2009–10 year. However, these costs have been increasing over time – in 2007 the cost was $0.75 per $100 of revenue. To a large extent, the higher costs of collection are likely to reflect the combined effects of policy changes and the cyclical Figure 13: Total time to comply in hours per year (2012) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Switzerland Ireland Norway Finland Australia United Kingdom Sweden Netherlands Canada France Denmark Iceland Belgium Austria New Zealand United States Spain Germany Turkey Greece Korea, Rep.

As discussed further in chapter 4, the department has made significant cost savings recently which will reduce the costs of raising revenue. 9 Progressivity New Zealand has a fairly flat income tax scale. The top tax rate applies at 1.5 times the average wage. Many other countries have top personal tax rates that are both higher and apply at a higher level of relative income. At first impression, it might appear that New Zealand operates a relatively unprogressive tax system, but this story is incomplete. There are many ways to redistribute income; using the income tax system is just one of them. New Zealand delivers a large amount of redistribution through the Working for Families programme of tax credits. It is really the progressivity of the income tax system and transfer systems together that is relevant. Moreover, other taxes including payroll taxes and social security taxes can affect progressivity. For individuals without children, New Zealand does not appear out of line with the OECD in terms of progressivity. Direct comparisons of progressivity are difficult, but a common method for comparing progressivity among nations is to compare ―average tax wedges‖ at different income levels. A person’s average tax wedge is the sum of taxes likely to be borne by employees less cash transfers (such as Working for Families) as a fraction of total labour cost. Table 2 compares the tax wedge for a single earner with no children earning 67, 100 and 167 percent of average weekly earnings (AWE).

A low cost does not necessarily mean a high level of efficiency. It could also mean that a country could be doing little to collect taxes that are legally due. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 23 of 49 For 2010 (the 2010–11 year in New Zealand), the difference between tax wedges for someone on 67 and 167 percent of AWE is similar to the average for the OECD (see the bottom line of table 2). The progressivity of the system in New Zealand is markedly affected by family status. New Zealand provides significant transfers to lower-income families with children through the Working for Families programme of tax credits. Figure 15 shows that the bottom 50 percent of households, on average, do not pay any ―net tax‖ (excluding GST). Ideally, GST and other taxes would be included in the data but this information is not available. Net tax is defined as income tax paid less cash transfers received. For example, if a household pays $10,000 in tax but receives $15,000 in Working for Families tax credits, the household’s net tax will be -$5,000. Tax payments made by those on higher incomes have an important role in funding Government spending. Another example of the redistributive impact of Working for Families is shown in figure 16. It shows the difference between tax wedges for a one-earner household earning 100 percent of AWE with two children and no children. While it is standard for a household with average earnings and two children to be taxed less heavily than a similar household with no children, for New Zealand this difference is greatest. Moreover, in New Zealand there has been a large increase in transfers targeted at households with children as shown by the increase in this difference since 2000.

Source: The Treasury Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 24 of 49 Importance of Working for Families From the above information, it should be no surprise that Working for Families is an important source of income for families with children. Working for Families payments can be very large in dollar terms and are paid to thousands of households. Any reforms could therefore have considerable impact.

These payments can make up a large portion of a household’s income. For example, for 81,500 non-beneficiary households, Working for Families payments made up 20 percent or more of their disposable income in 2010–11. Including beneficiary households increases this number to around 210,000. 10 The effects of Working for Families are shown in figure 17 for a two-parent household with two children under 12. Figure 17 also shows how much net tax a one-earner household with two children pays. Until such a household earns roughly $47,500, it receives more from Working for Families than it pays in tax – that is, it has a negative net tax bill. Working for Families payments fully abate at $92,000 of income, at which point such a household is paying tax of about $24,500 and has disposable income of about $67,500. Working for Families and work incentives Working for Families has two significant effects on work incentives. A large portion of the payments are only available to those in work for a reasonable number of hours a week. For households where neither parent works, this provides a strong incentive to seek employment. However, the abatement of payments as family incomes increase can raise ―effective‖ marginal tax rates (EMTRs). That is, for every extra dollar earned, a large portion is lost due to tax or reduced entitlements to Working for Families. Figure 18 shows, for example, that a one-earner couple with one child earning $55,000 faces an EMTR of 53%. A $1 pay rise will therefore provide a $0.47 increase in disposable income. 10 In this calculation a household is considered a beneficiary household if it received any amount of beneficiary income during the year.

This limits the ability of households to take initiatives to change their circumstances. There are no easy solutions to this problem. Reducing high EMTR rates either requires providing less assistance or involves abating social benefits more slowly, which could be costly. Thus, there is an unavoidable trade-off between keeping costs to a minimum in delivering desired levels of assistance to low-income families and work incentives. Although some taxpayers do face high EMTRs, they are few in number. Estimates for the year ending 31 March 2012 are shown in figure 19. The figure shows EMTRs taking into account tax and ACC earner premiums, abatement of benefits, the accommodation supplement, Working for Families and also including child support and student loan payments but not childcare subsidies or student allowance abatement on parental income. It is an open question whether child support (which is meeting a parental obligation) and student loan payments (which reduce a student’s future liability) should be seen as equivalent to taxes so the information shown in figure 19 is likely to be a ―worst case‖ scenario. 11 At present there are 3.38 million individual taxpayers in total. Of these, about 120,000 (3.4 percent) face EMTRs over 60%, 120,000 (3.4 percent) face EMTRs between 50% and 60%, and 160,000 (4.5 percent) face EMTRs between 40% and 50%. Slightly more than 88 percent of taxpayers face EMTRs below 40%. Thus, while EMTRs are very high for some, it is a relatively small percentage of the population. If the payment of child support and student loans is excluded when calculating EMTRs, over 92 percent face EMTRs that are below 40%. 11 Because student loans are interest-free, there will be some element of ―tax‖ in required payments. 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 45,000 50,000 55,000 60,000 65,000 70,000 75,000 80,000 85,000 90,000 95,000 100,000 105,000 110,000 115,000 120,000 Over 120k 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000 400,000 450,000 Number of people Income in dollars Figure 19: Effective marginal tax rate distribution (2011-12\*) (includes tax, ACC earner premium, benefit abatement, Working for Families, accommodation supplement, child support, & student loans) %60 or more \[50% to 60%) \[40% to 50%) \[30% to 40%) Less than 30% EMTR faced \* EMTR data modelled on 2010 incomes using the 2011-12 tax scale.

Policy challenges In our view, an important policy challenge is ensuring a coherent ongoing tax policy framework. We have a relatively coherent system which makes it relatively difficult for people to escape their intended tax liabilities but maintaining coherence is a challenge. Ours is not the only possible coherent tax system. Governments with different distributional objectives and different views on the importance of promoting economic efficiency and growth may reasonably come to different judgements about how progressive the tax system should be. There are coherent frameworks which can respond to different political judgements on this issue. There are also coherent frameworks that tax capital and labour income in different ways that have been discussed in a number of recent reviews. In this chapter we examine what we see as three leading contenders for coherent structural approaches (or paradigms) for designing tax policy. There are pros and cons with each of them. Key considerations include whether it is viable to continue with a broad alignment of tax rates and whether it is desirable to cut tax rates on investment and saving. Deciding on the over-arching structure of the tax system is the most fundamental tax policy decision a government can make and is a key tax policy choice for the Government. Until decisions are made on this matter, it is difficult to focus tax policy work on many important detailed design issues. Given that New Zealand is starting from a much better place than most OECD countries, we think there should be a substantial burden of proof exercised before moving from our current broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) policy paradigm. Fundamental tax reform runs a risk of making things worse and less coherent. Moreover, given some features of the New Zealand economy, we believe that our BBLR structure is particularly well-suited to New Zealand. Characteristics of a good tax system Tax policies are generally judged against a series of sometimes conflicting criteria, that have been well-rehearsed in past tax reviews (see, for example, the report of the Victoria University Tax Working Group in New Zealand). 12 These include: Efficiency and growth: Taxes should be efficient and minimise impediments to economic growth. Equity and fairness: The tax system should be fair. This involves both horizontal equity (fair treatment of those in similar circumstances) and vertical equity (fair treatment of those with differing abilities to pay tax). 12 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future; Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group – p15. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 28 of 49 Revenue integrity: The tax system should minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage and provide a sustainable revenue base for the Government. Fiscal adequacy: The Government should raise sufficient revenue to meet its requirements. Compliance and administration costs: These should be kept to a minimum. Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. Coherence is really a means of satisfying the other objectives outlined above rather than being an end in itself. The importance of the coherence criterion has been emphasised by the Mirrlees Review when it stated: The tax and benefit system should have a coherent structure based on clearly defined economic principles. There should be a clear vision of the ideal system, in which the various elements fit properly together and from which unnecessary distortions have been eliminated. 13 A coherent tax system needs to fit together. For example, it is common internationally for governments to decide that personal income should be taxed at a set of increasing marginal tax rates. For such a system to be coherent it is vital that the statutory tax rates on personal income should ―stick‖. The tax system loses coherence if this progressive tax system can be circumvented by, for example, individuals sheltering income in trusts or companies. Similarly, the tax system loses coherence if there are arbitrary differences in the ways that different forms of savings or investment are taxed. Any practical tax system is likely to lead to some cost in terms of reduced efficiency and growth because taxes affect whether and how hard people work, whether they train to increase their skills, whether they invest in risky but potentially profitable activities and how much they save and invest. The less coherent taxes are, the bigger these costs are likely to be by biasing people and firms to act in ways that would not be sensible in the absence of tax considerations. A lack of coherence also makes the tax system unfair because people in similar circumstances can pay very different amounts of tax and because tax breaks are often of most benefit to the well-advised and wealthy. A lack of coherence provides fertile ground for tax avoidance and arbitrage schemes. It makes the tax system a much less secure base for financing Government expenditure and tends to make the tax system more costly to comply with and administer than would otherwise be the case. New Zealand’s tax system must be broadly understood and seen as reasonable by the New Zealand public. If it is not, it will not be sustainable and generally will inevitably be changed. A coherent tax system helps ensure that the tax system is understood and viewed as reasonable. 13 Institute for Fiscal Studies, Tax by Design: the Mirrlees Review, chapter 20, Conclusions and Recommendations for Reform, p. 470. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 29 of 49 Deviations from coherence which at first may seem small can matter. The adverse impacts of a non-aligned set of tax rates were documented in Inland Revenue’s BIM in 2008 and were also a key concern of the recent Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group. This lack of coherence has been largely removed through the recent alignment of the top personal tax rate with the trustee tax rate and the reduction in the gap between the top personal rate and the company rate. We believe that New Zealand’s BBLR tax system is one of the most coherent in the OECD. There are however coherent alternatives that have been implemented in other countries (notably Norway) or suggested in overseas tax reviews. These differ in the extent to which they tax residents on their capital relative to their labour income and how heavily they tax non-residents on their investment into a country. These issues have figured prominently in reviews of taxation in New Zealand and in other countries (including Australia and the United Kingdom). A key goal of successive governments has been productivity. Productivity requires that capital and labour are put to their best uses and this is best served by reducing, as much as possible, biases in the way that different forms of capital and different forms of labour are taxed. We believe that taxing different activities as neutrally as possible within some coherent framework is likely to be critical for efficiency and productivity and probably more important than the choice between coherent frameworks. Coherent tax policy options Coherent tax policy options include:  a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR), broadly aligned system (the New Zealand paradigm);  a Nordic tax system; and  the Mirrlees approach. Broad-base, low-rate broadly aligned system (the New Zealand paradigm) The New Zealand system applies a broad consumption tax across as many forms of consumption as possible and a broad income tax over most types of income. By keeping tax bases broad, the GST and income tax rates are kept relatively low. This minimises economic distortions. Arguments about the breadth of the GST base are largely independent of choices between the three coherent tax schemes outlined above and the breadth of the GST base is not discussed further in this BIM. Under New Zealand’s BBLR framework, income from both capital and labour is taxed at progressive marginal rates aimed at providing a fair way of taxing those with different capacities to pay tax. As much as possible, this scheme is aimed at ensuring that all income (both capital and labour income) is taxed at the marginal tax rates of New Zealanders. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 30 of 49 An important issue is how to apply a consistent framework to income earned through entities such as trusts and companies. In New Zealand, income earned through trusts can be retained within a trust and taxed as ―trustee income‖. This is a final tax. However, scope for tax sheltering has been removed for most taxpayers by aligning the trustee tax rate with the top personal tax rate. Income earned within companies is taxed at the company rate, subject to a full imputation system. When company profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends, imputation credits are provided for company tax that has been paid. Company profits end up being taxed at the marginal rates of shareholders. If the company tax rate were too far below the top personal rate, this system would break down by allowing personal income to be sheltered within companies. Even though income would eventually be taxed at shareholders’ rates upon distribution, there would be important timing benefits. But at current tax rates, where the gap between the company rate and top personal rate is only 5 percentage points, the scope for sheltering is limited. The company tax rate also provides a final tax on non-residents investing into New Zealand through companies. The New Zealand system achieves coherence very simply. Even within its BBLR paradigm, it has been possible to alter the balance in favour of taxing capital less heavily and labour more heavily by increasing the rate of GST and lowering income tax rates. A GST taxes labour income. 14 It reduces the real goods and services that can be purchased out of the income earned by providing an extra hour of work just like a labour income tax would. Of course there are both efficiency and equity issues that need to be considered when undertaking this sort of tax rebalancing. Similar issues need to be thought through when there is any rebalancing which reduces tax on capital income and increases tax on labour income. It should be acknowledged that New Zealand’s tax system falls short of ensuring that all income is taxed at personal tax rates in a fully consistent fashion. The fact that the company tax rate is less than the top personal rate provides some timing benefits when income is accumulated in companies. The portfolio investment entity (PIE) system also provides some tax advantages. For example, the capped PIE rate means that individuals on the top marginal tax rate are taxed at 28% rather than their higher rate of 33% on income accumulating in PIEs. But by OECD standards, these are relatively small inconsistencies. Nordic tax system Continental European countries generally have high ratios of tax to GDP and wish to subject labour income to relatively high levels of taxation, especially when social security taxes are combined with personal income taxes. Given the mobility of capital, especially between countries in close economic and geographic proximity, such high rates of tax 14 A GST also taxes the wealth that people have on the day the tax is introduced by reducing its purchasing power. A GST is sometimes characterised as a tax on labour income combined with a lump-sum tax on wealth. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 31 of 49 applied to capital income have proven unsustainable. Accordingly, most EU countries have introduced some form of reduced taxation for capital income. The Nordic countries, especially Norway, have attempted to do this in a coherent manner by explicitly taxing all forms of capital income at a lower rate than labour income. Capital income includes forms of income which are a return on invested capital including interest, dividends, rental income and the return on capital invested in a business. Labour income is income from personal effort including salaries and wages as well as the returns from the owner of a closely held business working in that business. 15 Generally the system applies a lower rate of tax on income from capital than is applied to labour income. The system therefore requires rules to distinguish capital and labour income. Distinguishing capital from labour income has proven difficult to achieve in practice. Initially Norway treated widely held and closely held companies differently with all income in widely held companies treated as capital income while income from closely held companies was split into labour and capital components. But this became problematic as it was much more advantageous to be treated as ―widely held‖. In response to these problems, Norway recently revised its system to treat all companies alike. Companies are taxed at the capital tax rate. Shareholders receive returns (by way of dividends or capital gains) below a ―normal‖ or ―risk-free‖ return without any additional shareholder tax. Returns above this are taxed in shareholders’ hands at the capital tax rate. This means that the amount that approximates labour income ends up being double taxed at the capital tax rate. This approximates tax at the top rate of labour income tax (given the particular tax rates chosen by Norway). This is a clever method of ensuring that companies cannot be used to shelter labour income from high rates of labour income tax. Capital and labour income must still be separated for unincorporated businesses. Non-residents are taxed on capital income derived through Norwegian companies at the capital tax rate of 28%. Mirrlees Review proposal The Mirrlees Review has proposed major revisions to the tax system in the United Kingdom. It has proposed that taxpayers be able to claim a deduction for a risk-free return on most forms of savings. This is referred to as a rate of return allowance (RRA). This ends up having similar effects to completely exempting capital income from tax. Thus, the Mirrlees Review proposal can be thought of as equivalent to an extreme Nordic tax system with a zero tax rate on capital income. The aim of effectively exempting capital income from tax is to reduce taxes on savings and to reduce biases between different forms of saving. 15 Interestingly, Norway’s ―low‖ capital tax rate of 28% is equal to New Zealand’s company rate and not too far away from New Zealand’s top personal marginal tax rate of 33%. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 32 of 49 Businesses would face a substantially lower average rate of tax as they would only be taxed on amounts in excess of the risk-free return. This would be achieved by providing an allowance on corporate equity (ACE) equivalent to the risk-free return. Income in excess of the risk-free return would be subject to normal tax rates. The effect of these systems would be to eliminate taxation for marginal investments, while continuing to impose tax on economic rents (that is, returns over and above those required to induce investment). Reasons for choosing between the three options In choosing among the three options, two fundamental design issues are raised:  How heavily should New Zealand be taxing non-residents on their investments into New Zealand?  How heavily should New Zealand residents be taxed on their capital income relative to their labour income? Taxing non-resident investment into New Zealand One of the key features of company taxation is that it taxes non-residents investing into New Zealand. A potential concern with company taxation is that it can discourage investment into New Zealand. In small open economies like New Zealand, foreign investors will demand comparable returns to those that can be obtained from investing elsewhere. For example, if foreign investors can earn 6% after-tax from their investment in other countries, they will not accept less from investing into New Zealand. A company tax rate of 28% would drive up the required pre-tax rate of return on investments in New Zealand to 8.3%. Thus, company taxation will tend to drive up the before-tax returns that companies need to earn in order to provide an attractive after-tax return to foreign investors. This reduces investment and New Zealand’s capital stock. With fewer computers, tractors, factories and so forth, New Zealand labour becomes less productive than it would otherwise be and workers earn lower wages. Thus, high taxes on inbound investment generated by a high rate of company tax can end up hurting New Zealanders. Moreover, standard economic theory suggests that these taxes can be more harmful to workers than would be taxes on their labour income that collected the same amount of revenue. By itself, this suggests a theoretical argument for eliminating company tax altogether. However, some firms investing into New Zealand may be earning ―economic rents‖ associated with firms locating themselves in New Zealand. These are returns over and above those required for them to invest in New Zealand. These economic rents can arise because many non-resident firms invest into New Zealand in order to sell to the domestic market, (rather than export into world markets). This can generate returns significantly in excess of those that the foreign firm demands in order to invest. Taxing these economic rents at the company rate of 28% may still provide the foreign firm with an after-tax return above that which they would require to invest into New Zealand. In these cases the company tax rate of 28% (or even a significantly higher rate) will be borne by the foreign firm. To reduce the rate to zero would provide a windfall gain to foreign shareholders and may do little to affect foreign investment in New Zealand. To the extent that reducing the company rate reduces Government revenue, this is likely to Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 33 of 49 put upward pressure on other tax rates. This has the potential to make New Zealanders as a whole worse off. New Zealand residents – how heavily to tax capital relative to labour income The second issue is how heavily should New Zealand residents be taxed on their capital relative to their labour income. There are two key arguments that can be put forward for lower tax rates on capital income. First, any tax on capital income lowers after-tax returns and tends to provide a tax bias discouraging savings. There are economic models where any tax on capital income is a ―bad thing‖ but other economic models where some taxes on capital income are desirable. While determining the most efficient tax rate on capital income is far from being resolved, there is reasonably common agreement amongst economists that high taxes on savings may be inefficient. A second reason for cutting tax rates on capital income is to reduce tax biases between different forms of savings (such as whether one saves in a traditional interest-bearing bank account where the full nominal interest is taxed, or perhaps through acquiring an owner- occupied house or a rental property). Clearly, the lower the capital tax rate the lower will be the tax distortions between different forms of saving. Effects of the different options If these were the only considerations, there would be pros and cons in a shift from our BBLR system in a Nordic direction. If the tax rate on capital were to fall, it would reduce a tax bias against inbound investment and reduce disincentives to save. At the same time, it would reduce our ability to tax economic rents. On the surface, a shift in the direction of the Mirrlees Review proposals would seem preferable. This would, in theory, eliminate any bias against investment into New Zealand and also any bias against saving. At the same time it would continue to allow us to tax economic rents. But the Mirrlees Review suggestions are largely untested. There are likely to be large costs in a small country like New Zealand being the first to implement such a new system. A shift in either the Nordic or Mirrlees Review directions would reduce revenue from taxes on capital income. As the Mirrlees Review suggestion is effectively to eliminate capital taxation, the revenue reduction in this case would be large. Thus, merely looking at how these various options alone affect inbound investment or savings is very partial. If other taxes are required to replace the forgone revenue, the relevant question is how distorting these replacement taxes are likely to be relative to the taxes they are replacing. The main options would appear to be higher rates of tax on income (or labour income with a Nordic tax system) or a higher rate of GST. These taxes will create their own inefficiencies. For example, high rates of labour income tax can encourage talented people to leave New Zealand or discourage people from taking risks or acquiring new skills. It encourages people to work in untaxed ways at home rather than in ways that produce taxable income. This can lower productivity. It is important to note that it is not only taxes on capital income but also taxes on labour income that can lower productivity. A key consideration is how large the benefits of a move in a radical new direction are likely to be. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding this issue but a study by Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 34 of 49 de Mooij and Devereux (2009) quoted by the Mirrlees Review suggested that a shift to an ACE system in the UK and increasing value added taxes (GST) to replace the revenue forgone would boost long-run investment by 6.1 percent, wages by 1.7 percent, employment by 0.2 percent, GDP by 1.4 percent and the welfare of a typical consumer by 0.2 percent of GDP. Welfare gains can be much lower than any increase in GDP because much of any additional GDP accrues to foreigners and extra work or extra savings will have an opportunity cost. Practical considerations When considering the pros and cons of a switch to a radical new tax system, it is important to note that much of the devil is in the detail of possible reform options. A case in point is Norway’s new method for taxing companies. The aim is to double tax labour but not capital income earned through companies. In practice, anti-avoidance provisions have meant that there can be considerable double taxation of risky income earned through companies. This can penalise those who invest in risky but potentially high-return investments. The Mirrlees Review proposals are harder to grapple with because they are largely untested although Belgium has introduced an ACE company tax system. We expect there would be many difficult issues to work through. In particular, it may be hard to define equity satisfactorily and to prevent international tax avoidance with such a scheme. We understand that there have been considerable tax avoidance pressures in Belgium. Scope for international tax arbitrage can occur when a country adopts a different conceptual basis for taxation from other countries. Such arbitrage can give rise to unexpected losses of tax revenues. Features unique to New Zealand New Zealand has the following unique features that influence its tax policy environment relative to other countries:  It is geographically isolated from major markets – this implies that it is less likely to attract export industries by lowering its company tax rate on non- residents.  It is likely that FDI into New Zealand may be less sensitive to tax given that we are a long way from world markets and hence New Zealand is less likely to be a venue for a global business. Instead, most FDI into New Zealand may be directed at businesses serving the domestic market.  It is likely to have much more location-specific economic rents than would be true of less isolated countries. (Foreign firms operating in New Zealand tend to sell to the local market which makes economic rents less mobile and more easily taxed. By contrast, a small landlocked country in Europe may have limited scope for taxing economic rents because if it tries to do so, firms can relocate and supply much the same market from just outside the border.) Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 35 of 49  It has a high mobility of labour. This implies that New Zealand may suffer disproportionately from having high personal tax rates applied to labour income.  The structure of the tax system (the imputation system and the low top personal rate) makes simplification through rate alignment feasible in New Zealand, while in other countries the benefits from rate alignment are simply not practically attainable.  New Zealand has a singularly broad and efficient GST. In the past this has made increasing the rate of GST and lowering income taxes a more attractive way of switching from taxing capital income to taxing labour income than it would be in most other OECD countries. However, increasing the rate of GST further is likely to make it more difficult to maintain a relatively broad GST base. These features of the New Zealand tax system all make a BBLR approach for New Zealand more attractive than it might be for some other countries. Structural implications of the three approaches The three alternative tax systems have different structural implications:  Under New Zealand’s BBLR system, the trust tax rate needs to equal the top personal tax rate. If these rates are allowed to diverge, (as in the 2000 to 2010 New Zealand system), the system loses coherence and is vulnerable to tax avoidance activity as documented in our previous BIM. In addition, the BBLR works best if (as at present) the company rate and top personal rate are not too far apart. Countering tax avoidance when tax rates diverge markedly requires the introduction of complex anti-avoidance rules to prevent deferral or avoidance of tax for certain types of personal income earned through companies.  Under the Nordic system, there is scope for differentiation of tax rates on capital and labour. Norway’s design results in a company tax rate that is approximately half the top tax rate on labour income. However, Norway’s system relies on maintenance of a fixed relative set of rates and needs a distinction between capital and labour income to be implemented for unincorporated businesses. Moreover, coherence requires tax on capital gains.  The system proposed in the Mirrlees Review allows for a zero effective tax impost on marginal investments while still taxing economic rents. A key question is the viability of making this tax system work. Policy issues with the approaches Important policy issues underlie the choice for New Zealand among the approaches. These include: Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 36 of 49  the viability of continuing with a broad alignment of tax rates; and  whether it is desirable to cut tax rates on investment savings. 1. Alignment of tax rates The major question concerning the longer-term viability of the New Zealand tax policy paradigm is whether international pressures will force a wider divergence between the company and top personal tax rate. Among OECD countries there has been a continuing trend toward lower company tax rates, although the aggregate share of company tax as a percentage of total tax collected has not fallen worldwide. Even with the recent reductions in the company tax rate, New Zealand has moved from having one of the lowest company tax rates in the world to one that is above the average tax rate internationally. The key questions are whether these factors will drive New Zealand to further reduce its company tax rate and, in particular, whether any patch-ups to make a less aligned system work would become so cumbersome and unattractive that it would be sensible to abandon the BBLR framework. Setting the company tax rate The company tax rate has a dual role in supporting domestic tax settings on individuals while taxing non-residents on income sourced from New Zealand. Tradeoffs are involved in setting the company tax rate. As discussed earlier, too high a rate could discourage efficient investment. It also increases tax biases between different corporate investment options and creates transfer pricing pressures. Too low a rate fails to tax immobile economic rents adequately and increases pressures from arrangements designed to shelter income from personal tax. As noted above, New Zealand’s particular situation appears to render reductions in the company tax rate less beneficial in attracting investment than they might be in other jurisdictions. Reducing the company tax rate may increase investment by making it more attractive for firms producing for a regional or world market to locate in one country in the region rather than another. But being a long way from other markets is likely to make investment less sensitive to the company rate. It reduces the numbers of firms that are likely to locate themselves for reasons other than supplying the domestic market. At the same time there are probably higher costs than for other less isolated countries through forgoing tax on immobile economic rents. This suggests that New Zealand should not be leading the international charge in moves to lower its company tax rate. At the same time, transfer-pricing and thin-capitalisation pressures are likely to mean that New Zealand’s company rate cannot get too far out of line with other countries. Whether recent trends in cutting company tax rates will continue is an open issue. OECD countries face significant pressures to maintain and increase revenues following the global recession and in anticipation of significant demographic-based pressures on health Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 37 of 49 and pension costs. Most of the possible base-broadening has already been squeezed out of corporate tax systems, so that cuts in the company tax rates would need to be compensated for out of taxes that more obviously bear upon individuals. Whether this is feasible in an era of continuing spending pressures is questionable. Setting the personal tax rate In addition, New Zealand faces pressures to keep the top personal tax rates lower than other countries. Setting the top personal tax rate involves a trade-off between fairness and efficiency objectives. A higher top rate applied to higher income taxpayers may be seen as desirable by a Government keen to fund transfers to lower-income taxpayers. On the other hand, higher tax rates reduce work effort and the incentive to invest and save. New Zealand has to be concerned about taxes on labour because of its high mobility of labour. An important factor in boosting productivity in New Zealand is likely to be ensuring that it is attractive for New Zealanders to upskill, take risks and for highly productive individuals to remain in the country. Higher marginal tax rates on labour income would reduce these incentives. Alignment need not be exact to have a stable system. It is critical to align the top personal tax rate and the trust tax rate as the trust tax rate is a final rate. This means that any tax benefit achieved is a permanent benefit. The compounding of this benefit over time means that a substantial after-tax gap can emerge between the returns on an investment made through a trust and the same investment held directly by an individual. A moderate gap between the top personal tax rate and the company rate is sustainable due to New Zealand’s imputation system. Imputation ensures that the total amount of tax paid on income earned through a company and distributed as a dividend is the same as that paid if the income were earned directly. Differences are timing, not permanent benefits. When the gap between the company tax rate and personal tax rates is not too large these benefits are insufficient to affect behaviour. On the other hand, if the gap is too large, complex mechanisms are required to prevent recharacterisation of income. Taxation of capital gains on shares would also be necessary in such a case to prevent recharacterisation of dividends as sales of shares giving rise to capital gains. This means that New Zealand’s broadly aligned BBLR approach remains viable under current tax settings. However, complex patch-ups would be necessary and ultimately its viability would be called into question if there were a desire to either lower the company tax rate substantially or to increase personal rates of tax substantially. 2. Incentives to save and invest Moving in the direction of either a Nordic tax system or the Mirrlees Review proposal would boost incentives to save and invest. At the same time replacement taxes are likely to increase biases in other areas. Key downsides a Government would need to address are the perceived fairness of giving large tax cuts to those with high levels of capital assets and large amounts of capital Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 38 of 49 income, and how to replace the forgone personal and corporate tax revenue. Would the Government be willing, for example, to reduce spending or boost income tax rates on labour income or the rate of GST in order to introduce an ACE and RRA system? If the Government is not willing to raise tax rates elsewhere or do other things to bridge the fiscal gap, the benefits of any moves in this direction are largely academic. This is perhaps the key question that a Government considering fundamental reforms would need to address. Conclusion While there is no ―ideal‖ tax system, we believe that New Zealand’s BBLR broad- alignment paradigm continues to be viable and remains the best path for New Zealand to follow at present. A critical issue for the New Zealand tax system over the past decade has been coherence. Large economic distortions are likely to arise when tax systems are not coherent. Misalignment of rates has led to significant levels of tax avoidance activity. Looking around the world, it is very hard to be confident that replacing New Zealand’s current largely coherent tax system and bringing in an alternative would improve the performance of the tax system. Indeed, there is a substantial risk it would perform more poorly as a stable source of revenue that has broad public acceptance. The fact that we have a tax system that works well suggests a high onus of proof in altering our basic tax settings. A key issue is that New Zealand’s tax system must be broadly understood and seen as reasonable by the New Zealand public. If it is not, it will not be sustainable and it will inevitably be changed. Unsustainable tax reform is the worst kind of tax reform. Perhaps the most fundamental tax policy question you need to consider is whether at least over the next three-year period you wish to retain New Zealand’s BBLR broad- alignment paradigm. It is important to confirm whether or not the Government is continuing with the current policy settings or wishes to redesign the tax system in a fundamental way. Resolving this matter would allow businesses to plan their affairs with more certainty about future tax implications, and tax policy resources would be freed to work on addressing concerns that have arisen within this basic framework. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 39 of 49 4. Administration of the tax system A well functioning tax system that supports the Government’s fiscal, economic and social objectives requires good tax policy settings. But good tax policy alone is not sufficient. It is necessary to consider as a whole the entire tax system, including how the policy is applied in practice and how the tax system is administered. A good tax system requires good tax administration as well as good tax policy. In New Zealand responsibility for administering the tax system falls largely on Inland Revenue. The issues and challenges of that role are the focus of this chapter. After briefly summarising Inland Revenue’s core functions and outputs, this chapter outlines our view on what Inland Revenue needs to deliver if it is to support a good tax system. It then assesses how Inland Revenue measures up against that requirement. Various measures indicate we are currently performing well in carrying out our core tasks. However, that needs to be caveated by our need to manage some key pressure points: continuing demand for our services, issues with our core IT systems and the need for improved management of the portfolio of Crown debt and receivables that Inland Revenue manages. As we look into the future we are likely to need to manage these pressure points in a constrained fiscal environment with a significant reduction in our Vote baselines. In addition, we are in the process of significant business change as we respond to technological change and changes in service expectations. This will require significant changes in the way Inland Revenue operates, supported by some policy changes that may be controversial, and a substantial investment in our IT systems. In this environment Inland Revenue will be constrained over the next few years in the extent to which we will be able to deliver policy changes that have complex implications for our core IT system. Finally, the chapter notes that re-establishing ourselves in Christchurch following the Canterbury earthquake is an urgent priority for Inland Revenue. Core functions and outputs For the year ended 30 June 2011, Inland Revenue collected 70 percent of total Government revenue and 77 percent of total tax revenue. 16 Total staff at 30 June 2011 numbered 5,511 (measured in full-time staff equivalents). Constitutionally, tax can only be levied in accordance with laws enacted by Parliament. Inland Revenue has an obligation to levy tax in accordance with the law to the best of our ability. We also have an important obligation to maintain confidentiality of people's tax affairs. The Commissioner has statutory independence from Ministers to ensure we are able to levy tax and carry out our duties independently. We also administer KiwiSaver and a range of social policy initiatives which are not part of the tax system but are generally administered using the infrastructure put in place to collect tax. The Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, jointly with the Treasury, provides advice to Ministers on tax policy and assists with the management of tax legislation through Parliament. 16 Notes to the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand; page 53 Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 40 of 49 What Inland Revenue needs to be For New Zealand to have a good tax system, Inland Revenue needs to be a world-class revenue organisation, recognised for service and excellence. To achieve this we need to provide: a) Service with speed and efficiency Obligations and entitlements should be established and finalised as quickly as possible. Without speed and certainty compliance costs and risk increase, adversely affecting productivity by reducing incentives to work, save and invest. A tax system with speed and certainty makes New Zealand a more desirable place to invest into and out from. b) Compliance with the law and value for money This provides tax revenue at the lowest possible cost, thereby supporting the Government’s fiscal objectives and in turn reducing New Zealand’s external vulnerability while maintaining the social services that the country provides. How Inland Revenue measures up Being a world-class revenue organisation is a challenging objective. In general Inland Revenue is a high-performing department. A formal review of Inland Revenue was carried out in May 2011 under the Performance Improvement Framework by the State Services Commission, the Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Review concluded that: Over the range of services it delivers, Inland Revenue is, on balance, a very well managed department. It displays admirable strengths in both its policy advice functions and in much of its operations. It has a big brain and a strong body. (Page 5.) Of the 33 performance ratings made, Inland Revenue was ruled: Strong 10 Well placed 16 Needing development 4 Weak 0 The areas rated as needing development largely related to Inland Revenue’s ability to manage ongoing business change and, in particular, its business transformation challenge — including upgrading its technological capability. The other main area of concern was debt management. Inland Revenue recently participated in an international tax administration benchmarking exercise coordinated by the United Kingdom Revenue and Customs Authority and run by CapGemini Consulting. We were ranked in the top three (out of 10 participating Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 41 of 49 countries) for 26 of the 42 indicators used in the benchmarking study that are comparable and allow robust interpretation. Inland Revenue was the highest ranking tax administration for seven of these indicators. Over recent years, significant progress has been made and the department has put in a solid performance. While the OECD expressed some reservations about the robustness of the analysis, a recent OECD study (based on the 2008–09 data) suggests that New Zealand performs somewhat better than average on administration costs for revenue collected (88 cents to collect $100 of revenue). The results of this study are discussed in more detail in chapter 3. Also, Inland Revenue’s own surveys of customers show a reasonably high degree of satisfaction with Inland Revenue’s performance. For example, the survey results for the 2010–11 year indicate that:  87% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the overall quality of Inland Revenue’s service in the voice, counter, and correspondence channels; and  92% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with Inland Revenue’s online service channel. 17 In addition, New Zealand Management Magazine this year ranked Inland Revenue as the second most reputable government department. This was based on a range of criteria, including having a clear and compelling vision for the future and consistently delivering customer promises and service. Pressure points The overall picture is of a well functioning department that plays a critical role for the Government and is one of the main interfaces between the Government and the public. Nevertheless, there is significant room to continue improving performance, pressure points that need to be managed in doing so, and considerable opportunities and challenges over the next few years. These are managing growth in demand for services, systems problems and better management of Crown debt and receivables Inland Revenue administers. Growth in demand Inland Revenue’s role has expanded over recent years. In the early 1990s Inland Revenue became responsible for administering the child support and student loan schemes. More recently we have taken on some significant new or changed Government programmes, including: the enhanced programme of Working for Families tax credits, paid parental leave, interest-free student loans and KiwiSaver. In addition, there has been a substantial increase in the underlying demand for more traditional services as indicated in table 3. 17 The Online Customer Satisfaction Survey began in the second quarter of the 2010-11 year. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 42 of 49 Table 3: Traditional taxpayer services provided Description 2005–2006 2010–11 Change % Change Customer base 6.3m 7.1m +0.8m 12.7% Phone calls answered 3.7m 3.9m +0.2m 5.4% Self-help services 5.1m 16.0m +10.9m 213.7% Tax returns processed 7.7m 8.0m +0.3m 3.9% Payments processed 7.7m 8.1m +0.4m 5.2% Total tax revenue\* $46.8b $46.8b 0 0.0% Total tax debt $3.5b $5.5b +$2b 57.1% Revenue assessed via audit $1.0b $1.4b +$0.4b 40.0% Cash collected – debt activities\*\* $1.7b $2.5b +$0.8b 47.1% Student Loans collections $487m $691m +$204m 41.9% WfFTC disbursements $1.5b $2.7b +$1.0b 80.0% KiwiSaver funds to providers nil $2.9b n/a n/a Child Support collections $349m $412m +$63m 18.1% \* Note: During this period total tax revenue peaked at $51.9 billion in 2007–08 (11% up on 2005–06). \*\* Includes cash received from tax pooling. Also, the way people want to interact with Inland Revenue is changing. Increasingly people expect to be able to deal with us electronically. This is illustrated by the growth in registrations for online services – as indicated in table 4 below. Table 4: Electronic services 2008–2009 2009–10 2010–11 Total registrations for online services (cumulative) 360,003 619,932 964,904 To a significant extent this increase in demand has been met from Inland Revenue’s existing funding through ongoing efficiencies. System issues Inland Revenue’s IT systems are based around FIRST, an IT system built specifically for Inland Revenue in the early 1990s. While this system continues to operate efficiently in delivering its core tax functions, the growing ambit of Inland Revenue activities and changes in public expectations have resulted in the system becoming a significant constraint on the department’s operations. This can only be addressed by a programme that combines progressive technological and systems changes with a transformation in the operation of Inland Revenue’s business (involving people, processes and policy). This will inevitably take time. This means that over the next few years Inland Revenue’s Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 43 of 49 ability to deliver quickly any policy changes with complex system implications will be especially constrained. The issue is covered in more detail below under the section on ―Business change‖. Debt Inland Revenue administers a portfolio of Crown debt and receivables totalling $23.4 billion (June 2011). This is obviously significant in terms of the Government’s overall balance sheet. The nominal value of the debt is broken down as follows: $ billion Student Loans 18 10.7 Child Support penalties 1.7 Tax yet to be due 5.5 Overdue tax 5.5 23.4 Overdue tax has increased from $2.9 billion in June 2005 to $5.5 billion (an increase of 89%). In 2009 the Auditor-General recommended a number of measures to improve Inland Revenue’s debt management. These are being implemented and in Budget 2010 Inland Revenue was provided with additional funding of $10.2 million per annum in 2010–11 to improve debt collection, increasing to $17 million in the out years. This has enabled improved performance in this area. During 2010–11 we collected $115 million in cash against a target of $100 million, with a return of $9.50 for every $1 spent (above the target of $7.70 for every $1 spent). The focus is on preventing people falling into debt and contacting them early to assist them if they go into debt. Debt aged less than one year has decreased by 8.2 percent over the last year, but total debt still increased by 7 percent in 2010–11. This needs to be an area of continued focus. Delivering value in a changing environment In addition to managing these pressure points, to build a world-class revenue organisation we need to capitalise on opportunities and rise to the challenges of: a) the fiscal environment; and b) business change at a time of rapid technological advances. The fiscal environment – delivering more for less The Government’s fiscal position is likely to be significantly under pressure for some time. To help manage this, departments (including Inland Revenue) are expected to deliver more for less. Inland Revenue reacted quickly to lower its administrative costs in response to the Government’s tight fiscal position. Over the last three years we have: 18 The $10.7 billion is the amount of the student loan balance – not the arrears. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 44 of 49  delivered $116 million of gross value for money savings — returning $36 million to the Crown and reinvesting $80 million back into Inland Revenue to manage cost pressures and target key strategic priorities;  reduced our staffing levels by 630 FTEs 19 (excluding Budget 2010 initiatives); and  achieved 89 percent of performance standards in 2008–09, 97 percent in 2009–10 and 84 percent 2010–11 (the year the Christchurch earthquake affected the achievement of some performance measures). Our current and forecast baselines for Vote Revenue fall significantly over the next four years. Within these reduced baselines we are required to absorb future remuneration pressures. This is significant given that salaries and wages make up more than half of our baseline expenditure. In addition, fixed costs that are difficult to reduce (depreciation, capital charge, accommodation rental and information technology costs) make up more than one-third of our baseline. To date we have been successful in providing efficiency savings by making existing policy and operational frameworks more efficient. For example, we are in the process of reviewing where our staff are located to ensure a level of service appropriate to local areas while maximising economies of scale. We expect ongoing savings from these and similar measures. Nevertheless, the level of efficiencies necessary to meet future baseline pressures is likely to require changes in some policies. This will allow us to capitalise on the efficiency opportunities that technological change provides. In many cases it is much more efficient for Inland Revenue to deal with customers and intermediaries through electronic channels rather than by paper, telephone or counter services. The average service costs for customers per contact vary significantly as illustrated below: 20 Telephone $28.84 Correspondence $40.45 Counter $35.12 The benefits and savings available through electronic contact should be significant, but they would be considerably reduced (and may even add costs) if existing communication channels remain at current levels as new electronic channels are developed. Some legislative or policy changes may therefore be required (for example, no longer issuing refunds by cheque). These policy changes are likely to be controversial. We are mindful that our efficiency targets cannot be met at the cost of lower tax collections. Our tax compliance strategy is based on ensuring that long-term sustained voluntary compliance is the behavioural norm. We rely on taxpayers making their payments and claiming their entitlements in full and at the right time — and most of them do. Times of significant change for Inland Revenue, such as we are currently experiencing, can pose some risks to compliance. However, our ability to maximise voluntary compliance and address non-compliance is increasing in terms of both our 19 For the period June 2009 to June 2011. 20 The average service costs per electronic contact are not currently available. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 45 of 49 capabilities and the technologies available. In particular, our compliance responses are becoming increasingly targeted and effective. There are opportunities, through increased investment by the Government, to raise revenue and in doing so also increase the integrity of the tax system. In addition, over the last 18 months we have been working with the Ministry of Social Development and the Department of Internal Affairs to explore joint opportunities for a more efficient and effective approach to service delivery. A guiding principle for this work is building services around customer need, rather than the structure of government agencies. Jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have shown that improved customer service and more efficient investment are possible from service transformation interventions. The Service Transformation Programme, led by the Ministry of Social Development and supported by the Department of Internal Affairs and Inland Revenue, was recently established. In the short term, the programme will direct the development of best practice service delivery technology and processes through a common standards approach, and the alignment of service delivery initiatives across the three agencies. It is intended that other government agencies will become involved with the programme in future if the approach proves to be successful. In addition to the core programme, Inland Revenue is implementing a number of service transformation initiatives. These include iGovt logons, and a joint call centre in Christchurch with the Ministry of Social Development. Service Transformation is a priority for us and should result in improvements to the way we deliver services. Business change To meet the demands of a changing environment our business needs to be transformed. For this transformation to be successful, system changes and operational changes are required. To enable operational change some policy changes will also be necessary. System changes Revenue authorities throughout the world are high and increasing users of information technology. Inland Revenue is no exception. Our system is based on FIRST — an integrated system that was purpose-built for Inland Revenue in the early 1990s. FIRST is our core operating system. It identifies and registers taxpayers by number, calculates tax liabilities, amounts owing or refunds due, handles returns, correspondence and ensures that tax totals are recorded for Crown revenue purposes. Connected to this core system are separate satellite systems dealing with, for example, KiwiSaver and online services used by tax agents and taxpayers, as shown in diagram 1. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 46 of 49 Diagram 1: FIRST and satellite systems The main concerns are:  FIRST was purpose-built for Inland Revenue. The modern approach is to use general systems with multiple users – which provides greater efficiency and reliability.  FIRST is an integrated system. A change in one part of it can affect any other part (and any part of the satellite systems to which it is connected). It is like a house full of appliances connected to electricity by a cable full of intertwined wires. When you change or disconnect one wire it can be difficult to tell what appliances in the house will be affected. Careful testing is required for every change to the FIRST system. This makes changes to implement new policies time-consuming and expensive.  FIRST is an old system. When it was built Microsoft was a start-up firm and there was no internet. It does not therefore cope well with demands for online access.  The system connecting FIRST with the satellite systems has reached its use- by-date and needs replacement.  Many of the satellite systems are also old and ill-suited to modern online requirements. To meet the demands of a world-class revenue organisation, one of the key things we need to do is move, over time, to a new system architecture. Over the last few years we have invested in the key capabilities of the FIRST system and are now satisfied that it can continue to deliver the core functions it was originally designed to deliver for approximately 10 more years. Nevertheless, significant investments in IT will be required over that time to move the system architecture onto a more sustainable basis FIRST Connecting system KiwiSaver ... Online Services ... Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 47 of 49 that can deliver future requirements. Decisions on this will be a key concern for Ministers over the next few years. Our proposed strategy carried out over the next 10 or so years focuses first on maintaining current systems to support volume growth and ensure stability. This will include replacing the system that connects FIRST with the satellite systems. The next priority is disentangling the integrated nature of the FIRST system, making the overall system more modular so that changes to one part do not affect others — in effect separating the intertwined wires so that each can be worked upon individually. This will enable us to implement policy changes in a more efficient and timely manner. Once that is achieved, current constraints on implementing policy changes (current requirements will consume much of our resources until 2014) will be relaxed. We will then be able to use this modernised IT architecture to deliver better and more efficient services to the public. There is a difficult balancing act here. We need to continue to develop within the FIRST system to ensure that current services can be delivered (for example, collection of student loans and child support), at the same time redeveloping FIRST to meet the challenges of a new environment. Until substantial progress is made on this programme Inland Revenue will be significantly constrained in its ability to deliver policy changes with complex system requirements or to capitalise on opportunities electronic communications offer to deliver efficiency savings to meet budgetary requirements. Operational changes Our view is that the focus of Inland Revenue should increasingly move away from the management of routine administrative processes towards activities that add value, such as faster responses and giving customers greater certainty. This means that, over time, resources should move from correcting inaccuracies in data and processes to getting it right upfront and using those resources to identify and correct non-compliance and provide better support to taxpayers. For this to be achieved Inland Revenue needs operational excellence in the management of the administrative processes which are the bulk of our business. Without these core processes running smoothly and professionally it will not be possible to achieve the efficiency outcomes that the Government and Inland Revenue desire from tax administration. There are a number of measures underway to support operational excellence. Inland Revenue is moving to deploy operational management tools to improve services and streamline process. These tools will allow us to improve efficiency and to reduce duplication. They will also allow us to meet the operational savings targets set by the Government. Using these tools will require significant change in Inland Revenue’s structure and processes and there will be a need to focus on these changes in the near term. Inland Revenue is also changing to provide front-line services that meet local needs. This means providing local counter services when this is appropriate and serves a local need. Services that do not need to be performed locally are being managed centrally. Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 48 of 49 This enhances efficiency and provides operational savings to support the Government’s goals. As well as these operational improvements it is necessary to manage the continuing pressure associated with our annual peak season — which includes most of the first quarter of each financial year. While increased management focus on this area in recent years has ensured success, it has come at the cost of affecting delivery of other goals. It requires the diversion of specialist resources from other business areas (such as correspondence, debt and return collection) to help respond to peak season demand for telephone services. This work distracts from delivering the high-value activities desirable in an efficient tax administration. Operational excellence will not be achieved by continuing with current processes. We will need to capitalise on opportunities created by technological change. These include automating routine processes to allow both taxpayers and Inland Revenue to focus on value-added activities, using e-channels and providing taxpayers with efficient self- management options. Change will be required not only by Inland Revenue, but also our customers and third parties such as software developers. Technology is changing quickly with increased flexibility to tailor products to individual needs. Inland Revenue cannot realistically provide the flexibility and targeted products now expected. Inland Revenue therefore needs to work closely with the private sector, including commercial entities such as payroll firms that will intermediate between Inland Revenue systems and the various individual needs of the public. To make this a reality, policy changes will be required. We also need to continue to find ways of working more efficiently across government — including working more closely with other government departments. Where appropriate, this could include greater sharing of information. While further progress in this area is worth exploring, there are a number of complex issues that need to be carefully considered — including taxpayer secrecy and IT integration concerns. Canterbury earthquake The Canterbury earthquake created an urgent need for Inland Revenue to respond to problems faced by taxpayers. Inland Revenue responded quickly with Orders in Council and legislative amendments dealing with the most urgent problems facing taxpayers. At the same time our own operations were severely affected. Christchurch is Inland Revenue’s second largest operation with approximately 700 employees. Christchurch staff were operating from a four-year old, seven-story building. It suffered moderate damage in February and June and has been unoccupied since February. It remains in the CBD red zone. Required repairs include a minor re-levelling of the building core by 8cm which has not been done in a building of this size in New Zealand. Timeframes for this repair work and getting the building operational are uncertain. Inland Revenue is currently operating from 23 temporary sites, providing seating for nearly 700 staff. Our Contact Centre of 150 agents has not been operational since February which has required work to be relocated nationally. There are also around 60 Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2011 Page 49 of 49 staff on secondment to a range of agencies, including the Ministry of Social Development and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. In addition, many staff are working from home. Re-establishing ourselves in Christchurch continues to be an urgent priority for the department.
April 2011 Fact sheet – Earthquake depreciation issues The Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks have resulted in the destruction of buildings, plant and equipment. This has given rise to three issues with the application of the depreciation rules. This fact sheet provides detail on proposed changes to depreciation rules announced by Government: • Depreciation recovered when the insurance proceeds exceed the tax book value of the destroyed asset • The timing of “deemed” sale of destroyed assets, and • The deductibility of any loss when a building is not destroyed by an event beyond the owner’s control, but has to subsequently be destroyed as a consequence of such an event. The proposed amending legislation is expected to be enacted in July or early August this year and will be effective from 4 September 2010. Accordingly affected businesses should confirm the amending legislation before finalising their income tax positions. Depreciation recovered rollover There can often be a cash flow issue caused by depreciation recovered where insurance proceeds 1 exceed the tax book value of destroyed depreciable fixed assets where there is an intention to replace those assets. This is particularly the case when the assets are insured for replacement. In the context of the Canterbury earthquakes and insurance recoveries, the Government has decided that it is appropriate to provide an election to roll qualifying depreciation recovered over into the tax value of the replacement asset. The proposed details are: • Rollover relief will be allowed on depreciation recovered arising from insurance proceeds in respect of the Canterbury earthquake and its aftershocks; • The election is on a class basis. There are two classes of depreciable fixed assets: 1. buildings together with fit-out; and 2. “other” (i.e., plant and equipment); • The fixed asset is replaced by new or second hand assets (the rollover assets) in the same class by the end of the taxpayer’s 2015–16 income year; and 1 Insurance includes an amount of insurance, indemnity or compensation received for the loss or destruction of a business asset. • If the insured fixed asset was a building, the replacement building is located inside the zone of responsibility of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Agency, which is currently envisaged to encompass the area covered by three territorial authorities – Christchurch City Council, Selwyn District Council, and Waimakariri District Council. The amount of rollover relief available depends on the degree to which assets are replaced. This is to be determined by comparing the cost of the destroyed assets with the cost of the replacement assets. The first step in this process is to ascertain the ratio (on a per class basis) of net depreciation recovered for that class to the total cost of destroyed assets in that class. (Net depreciation is the residual amount after deducting from gross depreciation recovered of that class any amount of loss on disposal of that class as a result of the earthquake). This ratio is then applied to the cost of the replacement asset to ascertain how much depreciation recovered can be incorporated into the adjusted tax value of that new asset. Example 1 Non-building fixed assets destroyed by the earthquake had a cost of $1 million, and the net depreciation recovered was $300,000. The replacement assets were acquired over two years at a cost $400,000 per year, and then only $800,000 of replacement assets were acquired (even though the taxpayer originally expected to spend well over $1 million on the replacement assets). Rollover into the first $400,000 of assets acquired is 400,000 x 300,000 / 1,000,000 = $120,000. Likewise rollover in the next year is another $120,000, making a total of $240,000. The balance of $60,000 is brought to income as explained below. Process The asset owner elects to use the rollover relief by advising Inland Revenue in writing that they have qualifying depreciation recovered that they are deferring pending their reasonable expectation of replacing the fixed asset by the end of the 2015–16 income year. This election must be sent to Inland Revenue by the later of: • the date the tax return is filed for the year that the depreciation recovered would otherwise have been recorded in, using the new timing rule below, or • 30 September 2011 Once an election has been made, the owner must use the rollover relief against the next relevant replacement assets purchased in subsequent years. The owner also has to advise, again in writing with their income tax return, when the replacement asset(s) have been acquired and the deferred depreciation recovery offset into their adjusted tax values. If the owner chooses to apply the rollover relief, the rollover asset’s “total deductions” are increased by the amount of depreciation recovered that has been rolled-over into that asset and therefore its “adjusted tax value” is reduced by the amount. Further, where straight line depreciation is used for the rollover asset, “cost” for this depreciation calculation is the actual cost less any depreciation rolled- over (by reducing the “adjusted tax value” the correct basis will already have been ascertained for diminishing value depreciation). This will require a specific legislative override. If the destroyed asset is not actually replaced, then to the extent that deferred depreciation recovered has arisen (see the proposed new timing rule below) it is brought to account as income at the earlier of: • The asset owner’s 2015–16 income year • The income year in which the owner made a decision not to replace the destroyed asset, or • Any year in which the owner goes into liquidation or bankruptcy. Example 2 In February 2011, a 31 March balance date firm’s building is destroyed in the earthquake. The building originally cost $3 million. The book value is $2 million, reflecting accumulated depreciation of $1 million. The replacement insurance proceeds are $6 million and the insurance company “delivers” the replacement building on 15 June 2014. In the absence of any rollover relief the building owner will have depreciation recovered taxable income of $1 million (see below for the timing of this). The insurance proceeds over the $3 million cost price are still a tax free capital gain. The difficulty is that the building owner has received insurance proceeds of $6 million to rebuild but at a 28 percent company tax rate has a $0.28 million tax liability on the $1 million depreciation recovered. The building owner is left with $5.72 million to meet the reconstruction cost of $6 million. Extra funds are required to meet the cost of the building. This proposal will allow the owner to roll the depreciation recovered into the replacement building. Presuming that the insurance proceeds became, as a result of negotiations, capable of being reasonably estimated on 30 June 2011, the new rule (again see below) would time the depreciation recovered into the year ended 31 March 2012. However, with the tax return for this 31 March 2012 year the taxpayer files a written election to defer the depreciation recovered pending acquiring the replacement building. Therefore the depreciation recovered income is suspended for taxation purposes. For the 31 March 2013 and 2014 years this income stays suspended. The replacement building is delivered on 15 June 2014. The 31 March 2015 tax return will include this new building at a cost of $6 million, and, immediately upon acquisition, it will have an adjusted tax value of $5 million. However, for straight line depreciation purposes, its cost will be $5 million. If the building is depreciable, the usual months in the year formula applies. Again notice will have to be filed with the 31 March 2015 tax return advising that the deferred depreciation recovered income has been rolled into the tax base for the replacement asset. When the replacement asset is sold the difference between the adjusted tax value and building cost, in this case $1 million, will be clawed back as depreciation recovery income (provided it is sold for at least $6 million). Therefore the tax liability associated with disposal of the destroyed building has been rolled forward until disposal of the replacement building. Timing of deemed “sale” of destroyed assets There is also concern around the timing of the “deemed sale” when an insured asset is written off and that results in depreciation recovered because the insurance proceeds exceed the asset’s tax book value (cost less accumulated depreciation). Presently this “sale” arguably occurs at the date of the event that gave rise to the write-off. However, the insurance proceeds may not be quantifiable until months or even a year later and, quite likely, especially in the case of the Christchurch earthquake, in a different tax year. This presents compliance and administration problems, and potentially cause a taxing event retrospectively once the insurance proceeds can be quantified. Following more general tax and accounting practice, the Government proposes that this “deemed sale” occurs when the insurance proceeds can be reasonably estimated. Although this is proposed to be effective from 4 September 2010, this is a general amendment to the underlying generic legislation, and is not limited to the Canterbury earthquakes. Losses on buildings After the central New Zealand floods of 2004 the Income Tax Act was amended to allow a generic write off for any loss on buildings that were destroyed by an event beyond the owner’s control (and floods and earthquakes are good examples of such events). After the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake submissions were received that this provision should be extended to cover the situation where the building has to be destroyed as a result of such an event, even if the building itself was relatively undamaged or repairable. Examples include where the building has to be demolished to allow the land underneath the building to be remediated, or to allow for another building to be demolished. The Government agrees with these submissions and will table an amendment to achieve this. Again, although this proposed amendment is expected to be effective from 4 September 2010, this is a general amendment to the underlying generic legislation, and is not limited to the Canterbury earthquakes. Demolition costs In October 2010 the Minister of Revenue announced that the law would be clarified so that disposal and demolition costs incurred in relation to insured buildings irreparably damaged by the earthquake would be dealt with as part of the disposal of the asset. These changes were made by way of Supplementary Order Paper 187 to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 which was enacted on 20 December 2010. The changes ensure that the disposal and demolition costs of an insured earthquake damaged building are in effect deductible. Revenue account buildings Rollover relief will also be provided in respect of insurance proceeds for buildings held on revenue account when these are replaced with buildings inside the zone of responsibility of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Agency. Similar rules to those detailed above for depreciation recovered rollover for buildings will apply.

The document included various options for updating the child support scheme, including revising the current child support formula to better recognise shared care, and to take into account the income of both parents and the current expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. The current incentives for child support payments to be made – and made on time – were discussed, and various suggestions made about how these could be improved. A dedicated website for online consultation summarised the main options considered in the discussion document and asked readers to answer a series of questions based around those options. Respondents were also able to provide comments in key areas. Written submissions on the same issues were also received through the normal policy submission process. The purpose of this report is to set out the detailed results of the online consultation. It also provides a summary of the main themes and concerns raised in both the online consultation and in written submissions. These are supported by representative examples of actual comments received. Broadly speaking, there is majority support for the main options canvassed, with the majority of submitters supporting, in particular, comprehensive change. There are, however, some areas where a significant minority opinion also exists, indicating that views on the specifics of any possible change do differ considerably. This is not surprising given the inherent potential for conflict in the child support area. Some of the comments received did not fall strictly within the area of child support, but do have relevance when considering family relationships more generally and will therefore be referred to relevant Government departments and organisations for their consideration. Who took part in the consultation? Online consultation There were 2,272 participants in the online consultation. They comprised: • 834 receiving parents (37%); • 753 paying parents (33%); and • 685 “other” parties (30%), including those who both pay and receive child support, other family members, members of representative organisations and advocates in child support policy such as lawyers and academics. 2 Written submissions A further 112 written submissions were received through the usual policy consultation process. These submitters included paying and receiving parents, special interest groups, lawyers, academics and other various interested parties. As not all of these submitters were able to be identified as falling into one of the above three categories, they have not been included in the above chart. Likewise, given written submissions do not correlate with the questions asked in the online consultation, they are not included in the quantitative results contained in this report. They have, however, been well represented in the summaries of comments received highlighted in this report. 685 "other" 30% 753 paying parents 33% 834 receiving parents 37% 3 CHAPTER 2 Expenditure for raising children Under the estimates of expenditure for raising children in New Zealand outlined in the discussion document, child support payments would, under a revised formula, continue to increase in line with parental income to reflect the fact that people with higher incomes generally spend more on their children. A cap on parental income for child support purposes would also be retained. Since the recent research undertaken indicates that raising teenagers is more expensive than raising younger children, a revised formula could recognise two main age categories – 0 to 12 years and over 12 years (as well as a mixed age category). Results of online consultation Q1: Do you think that child support payments should: • vary, depending on the income of the parents? or • be based on a fixed estimate of how much expenditure is needed to raise a child in any situation? Vary, depending on the income of the parents 54% Be based on a fixed estimate of how much expenditure is needed to raise a child in any situation 46% 4 Q2: Do you think child support payments should be higher for teenagers than for children aged under 13? Yes, child support payments should be higher for teenagers than for children aged under 13 58% No, child support payments should not be higher for teenagers than for children aged under 13 42% Note: The view that child support payments should be higher for teenagers than for children under 13 was particularly prominent amongst receiving parents, with 79% believing payments should be higher for teenagers, compared with 36% of paying parents. Q3: Do you think there should be an income cap for the purposes of calculating child support payments? No, there should not be an income cap for the purposes of calculating child support 40% Yes, there should be an income cap for the purposes of calculating child support 60% Note: The view that there should be an income cap for the purposes of calculating child support payments was particularly prominent amongst paying parents, with 87% believing there should be a cap, compared with 32% of receiving parents. 5 Q3(a): If you think there should be an income cap, what do you think the income cap should be? Summary of comments on expenditure for raising children Estimated expenditures The majority of responses supported the view that child support payments should vary depending on the income of the parents. However, a significant number also supported the view that payments should instead be based on a fixed estimate of how much it costs to raise a child. For those that held the latter view, some felt that this would offer parents the opportunity to make more discretionary contributions. Commenting on using up-to-date information on the expenditure for raising children (in particular, using the “expenditure for raising children chart” provided in the discussion document) 1 in a revised child support formula, some submitters felt that the figures were either too high or too low. Several submissions noted the often high costs involved with maintaining contact with children, particularly when they lived in different locations. Also, there was concern that the types of expenditure used to compare households with equivalent living standards did not adequately reflect the variety of households’ lifestyles and how these might vary. Some submitters also asked for clarification on the methodologies used in calculating the estimated expenditure figures, and how the calculations might interact with other Government payments. They recommended that welfare payouts such as Working for Families received by parents should be included when calculating income for child support purposes. On a similar theme, one submission suggested that while tax credits were taken into account in the expenditure on children calculation, who received those tax credits was not adequately taken into account when apportioning the expenditure between the two parents, as the receiving parent generally receives the credits as they are the primary caregiver. 1 See page 46 of the discussion document. Only for the paying parent 11% A cap for the combined income of both parents 40% A cap for each parent's income 49% 6 Child support varying depending on the age of children There was general agreement with the proposition that expenditure on teenagers was higher than for younger children. A number of comments, however, suggested that child support payments should be higher for children under 5 – owing mostly to costs associated with childcare for younger children, or alternatively owing to lost work opportunities in caring for the children directly. Some submitters therefore called for three different age brackets to be introduced. An income cap Many comments supported the retention of an income cap, reflecting the fact the additional spending becomes more discretionary as income increases. It was also noted that having a cap means that parents still have the incentive to earn extra income without fear that this will be taken into account for child support purposes. Other themes noted Some expressed concern that the paying parent often had no say in how child support payments are used by the receiving parent and that funds intended for the child could be diverted to the caregiver. On the other hand, many receiving (as well as some paying) parents commented that they often bear the vast majority of the costs in raising a child, and that this is not reflected in the child support payments they receive or are entitled to receive. Some suggested that the child support scheme can result in power and control heavily favouring one parent at the expense of the other. This perceived imbalance appears to have a significant effect on the relationship between the parents and, in some cases, a child’s relationships with his or her parents. Some submissions indicated that, as a default position, the amount of child support being assessed by the formula should be halved, leaving the rest as a mix of discretion, voluntary contribution and cooperation between the parents. Other responses included: • that the income of the family unit (when either parent has re-partnered) should be taken into account. Also, many paying parents (and their family members) felt that children from a new relationship are not sufficiently taken into account when calculating child support payments; and • a recurring concern about the perceived ability of paying parents who are self- employed to manipulate their income for child support purposes in order to minimise payments. 7 Comments on expenditure for raising children 2 Estimated expenditures “The objective should be, insofar as it is possible, to afford the child the level of financial security they would otherwise have enjoyed had the relationship of their parents continued harmoniously. Consequently, fixed estimates of expenditure may drastically over- or under- estimate the level of expenditure that is required. Furthermore, any such determination would have to be made by the State.” “Support the comments about the costs the non-custodial parent has – eg, small children can share a bedroom but teenage boy and girl each need own bedrooms when staying with non- custodial parent. Children’s income should be congruent with the lifestyle of the parents, ie high income with high income parents otherwise they are socially economically dislocated from parent; reinforces that both parents have an obligation to support their children.” “Child Support should be based on how much it costs to raise a child of a set age with each parent contributing their amount based on time spent with children and who is responsible for costs.” “I believe costs do change/increase with the age of children but payment should be assessed on that and not how much the paying parent earns.” “I pay child support, I also pay for school fees, clothing, piano lessons, doctors fees, sport fees etc. As I am the only responsible working parent these payments should be taken into account when calculating child support payments.” “The parent that raises the child most of the time will always be paying more therefore their income should not be included in any child support formula.” “The child support system proposed attempts to treat the parents as if they are still together allocating income earned by both to support their children. In some situations IR pays Working for Families tax credits to parents raising children. The amount of child support payable to be allocated between the paying and receiving parents should be reduced by the amount of Working for Families tax credit received by the receiving parent.” “It is essential that the true cost of raising a child is factored into the support payments so that paying parents are paying for the child only and not the receiving parent’s lifestyle.” “This assumes that both parents pay equally for the cost of raising children. Under many “shared care” arrangements including my own, the non-custodial parent makes no (not a single $) contribution to any costs like school fees, uniforms, clothing, sports, hobbies, holiday care, after-school care, books, presents, doctor visits etc. How will this formula encourage shared costs?” “Your cost of raising a child estimates are too high.” “The current system is flawed in that the paying parent has no say in how the receiving parent spends the child support money. This money should only be spent on essentials for the child/children.” 2 These comments, and those that follow in this report, are representative examples of comments received in the online submission and written submissions. Apart from where indicated by square brackets they are represented verbatim. 8 “While it is important to think about the over-arching costs of raising a child, the determination should also include who is actually paying the costs. In a perfect world both parents would contribute equally to the costs, but in my situation the non-custodial is assessed to pay the minimum and expects me to pay for everything, including the costs of access visits.” “You can use the fixed expenditure. Some people just wouldn’t be able to afford it.” Child support varying depending on the age of children “The payments should be a fixed estimate providing it takes into consideration who is doing the caring and paying of expenses for the child/ren. Single parents like myself should not have our income included as the paying parent does not contribute to the expenses. The expenditure costs for a teenager increases and the payments should reflect that. There should be no income cap because those in high incomes would be able to provide \[the\] same opportunities as those who remain married.” “I think that one of the most expensive age brackets is actually under 5, as babies need nappies, if they are in child care this often can cost a lot, and if you are unable to breastfeed you have to buy formula. I think that the cost of infants is often forgotten or underestimated.” “3 AGE BRACKETS PLEASE! A bracket for children 0-5 and 5-12 years as well as children over 12. Once children start school the expenses increase considerably once the child requires school uniforms annually (kids 5-12 grow very quickly, requiring shoes and clothes far more often). Once a child is school age, they have costs for food, school lunches, school trips, sports etc. They are more expensive again than preschoolers.” “I think under-5s are equally as expensive as over 13s, ie childcare costs, rate of physical/developmental growth and meeting associated needs, etc. I think where one parent is the primary caregiver it is not a full “shared care” arrangement/the caregiving parent's income should not be relevant for child support purposes as it's naturally distorted/different from that parent's true earning potential/there are opportunity costs/long-term career impacts for parents choosing to work part-time at home.” “I'm not sure about how much more expensive it is to raise teenagers. On a basic level it is more expensive, however if both parents work (and don't qualify for childcare allowances) the cost of fulltime childcare can exceed $300 per week.” An income cap “Having a realistic cap means that the contributing parent can work hard, get promotions, work overtime or generate any extra income without the fear that that extra income will simply be lost to Child Support. When I say realistic I mean that child support should never be calculated on more than twice the average wage.” Other comments “The expenditure should be based on the real cost of raising a child in whatever circumstances they live – ie, if they live with a mother who is married to a new partner and raising children in a shared environment, then the combined income of the new family should be taken into account.” 9 “What is not recognised in this formula is other dependants: the chart should not discriminate between your spend on a child living with an ex partner (for whom you pay child support) to children/ dependants you provide for post this relationship. The current system is divisive and one-sided, as a result it creates deep resentment not necessarily from the paying parent but from other family members that quite rightly recognise an unfair and unjust system.” “Self-employed and business persons’ income should be assessed by a govt-approved accountant. Currently evidence of income is provided by \[a\] person’s own accountant and in my experience – very much down-scaled.” 10 CHAPTER 3 Shared care The discussion document suggested a greater level of recognition being given to lower levels of actual and regular care of a child by paying parents. This could be achieved by lowering the current deemed shared-care threshold, which is based on care for 40% of nights. Other issues considered included how best to measure the care of children for this purpose, and whether Inland Revenue should be able to rely on a parenting order from the Family Court or a parenting agreement between the parents. Results of online consultation Q1: Do you think that the current “40% of the nights” test for shared care should be lowered to include other levels of regular care? No, the current threshold should not be lowered 31% Yes, the current threshold should be lowered 69% Note: The view that the current threshold should be lowered was particularly prominent amongst paying parents. Some 90% of paying parents felt that the threshold should be lowered, compared with 44% of receiving parents. 11 Q1(a): If you think it should be reduced, at what level do you think care should be recognised? At a sin gle level set at 1/3 of care 11% At a single le v e l lo w e r than 1/3 of care 8% On a tiered basis down to 14% of care 62% On a tiered basis down to 1/3 of care 19% Q2: Do you think the number of nights a child spends with a parent is the best measure for working out whether there is shared care? No, the number of nights spent is not the best measure 54% Yes, the number of nights spent is the best measure 46% Note: Of the 54% who believed that the number of nights spent was not the best measure for working out whether there is shared care between parents, 73% felt that the total time spent with a child was the best measure. 12 Q3: Do you think that Inland Revenue should be able to rely on a parenting order or a parenting agreement to establish the number of nights a child spends with each parent? No, Inland Revenue should not be able to rely on a parenting order or agreement 36% Yes, Inland Revenue should be able to rely on a parenting order or agreement 64% Summary of comments on shared care Reduction in the current shared care threshold Most submitters agreed that the care threshold at which recognition is given for child support purposes should be reduced from the current deemed threshold of 40% of nights, although a small minority considered that anything less than equal care should not qualify for recognition. It was widely considered that paying parents are often incurring significant costs in caring for their children and these need to be recognised. Various concerns were expressed about lowering the existing threshold, both in terms of the rates used and the way the threshold might apply. These included: • That providing recognition at levels as low as 14% was too generous to the paying parent, in particular when the majority of everyday and other significant one-off costs were still being borne by the receiving parent. • The fact that one of the options for shared care noted in the discussion document applies a single fixed percentage reduction over a range of levels of care. As costs are likely to vary within this range, it is argued that the recognition given should vary accordingly on a sliding scale. • That use of a sliding scale would result in arguments between parents over who had care of their child for each day. In addition to creating uncertainty and animosity between parents, this could also result in significant administrative difficulties. • The lack of alignment with the equivalent Working for Families threshold was also noted. 13 How to best recognise “care” for child support purposes A large number of submitters still felt that the number of nights a child spends with a parent is the best method of establishing care levels. Not only does overnight care invariably necessitate the provision of care, travel and food, but it is also easy to establish (albeit conflict on this issue does still exists when parents do not agree). A large number of submissions, however, commented that other factors, in addition to the number of nights a child spends with a parent, should be considered in establishing the best measure for working out levels of care between parents. In particular, the importance of the total time (and not just nights) that a parent spends with the child was stressed. Significant time spent with other caregivers such as grandparents and other family members was also mentioned. Some suggested that a combination of other factors in addition to time spent could be taken into account when establishing shared care, for example, who makes key decisions in respect of the child and who usually bears the financial burden. Reliance of parenting orders and agreements Many submitters agreed that Inland Revenue should be able to rely on a parenting order or agreement to establish the number of nights a child spends with each parent, but considered that parents should be able to rebut such a presumption when it could be shown that the parenting agreement or order was not being followed in practice. Presumption of shared care Although beyond the scope of the discussion document, the question of paying parents’ ability to have contact with their children, and a desire on the behalf of paying parents to automatically share care of their children, was evident in comments received on shared care. Many comments were made to the effect that shared care should ideally be the default position for not only child support, but also for care more generally. Some concerns were raised, however, guarding against adopting this proposition automatically – in particular where there is a history of domestic violence between parents. No child support payments if 50/50 care A number of submissions commented that in cases of equal care (50% each) there should be no need for any sort of child support payment. 14 Comments on shared care Reduction in shared care threshold “With a fairer shared-care formula, perhaps a lot more non-custodial parents may have more input into the child or children's life.” “Child support is not fair when you have your kids for 39.9% of the nights in a year and have to pay the other parent and don’t receive any support back from them. I still have to feed, clothe, transport my children, I take them to the doctors when sick, to sports activities when required. I take a large active involvement in my children and spend a lot of money towards family activities. I also have to work, pay my mortgage, my power bills not to mention gas, telephone and HP payments. Where’s my help!” “It's fine to say oh yes, I have them x amount of nights and provide a room and dinner/breakfast BUT who is actually paying for the “other” costs of raising a child such as school fees, childcare, clothing, shoes, doctors and medicine, dentist, sports etc...” “There are times when the level of day-time care is so significant it allows the main night-time carer to work full-time without incurring childcare costs, yet the lesser carer does not have “shared care”. However, these unusual situations are able to be addressed through the existing admin review process. I think unless care is 50/50 or very nearly and all costs are split 50/50, it is very difficult to have a fair shared-care arrangement where costs are split in proportion to care/income levels.” “The 14 % from 52 to 103 is far too low. It should be about 33%. Also a legal parenting agreement between parents endorsed by a justice of the peace would be better, as this allows changes which reflect life changes without clogging up the court systems.” “Many ‘unethical’ parents will do whatever it takes to maximise the child support they get from the paying parent. One way they can achieve this is by ensuring the paying parent never has the children enough to reach the threshold for shared care. Having a tiered system would go some way to ‘levelling the playing field’.” How to best recognise “care” for child support purposes “Children can feel more comfortable to sleep in ‘their own’ bed each night, however this doesn't mean that care isn't shared. Where do the kids go during the day? Who picks them up from school? Who gives them their dinner?” “Overnight care is much more expensive than daytime care – as in order to provide overnight care, a parent must also maintain separate bedroom facilities for that child. Also, the majority of showering, food and laundry expenses will be paid by the parent who has the child overnight.” 15 “Although hard to monitor, I think total time spent with the child is relevant, but a parent can spend time with a child and still not incur the main costs of raising that child – clothing, schooling, sport fees, food, transport, medical, etc. The idea of the actual cost of the child being calculated and worked in to the formula is best.” “Should not be based on just number of nights a child spends with a parent as the non-custodial parent often feeds the child before returning the child to the custodial parent’s in time for bed so to classify this as a night in the custodial parent’s care is wrong.” “Shared care should be about that and not nights or days as each situation is different. There are parents that due to night shift cannot have their child during the night therefore care for them during the day and have the same or more expense as the deemed custodial parent. It should be about how much time each parent spends tending to the needs of the child.” “Shared care needs to reflect how much time a paying parent actually spends with the child and based on the number of nights a child spends with that parent is the best measure.” “I have 2 of my children 5 days a week after kindy for dinner and 1 night a week. I class that as shared care, it shouldn’t matter if they stay the night or not.” “Also of great confusion is that Working for Families and child support shared care are calculated differently, as are the liable incomes for the two acts above." Reliance on parenting orders and agreements “Parenting orders and agreements should be seen by the IRD as binding, unless the parties are proven not to be adhering to them. We have lost sight today when parents separate about the child or children. Too often it is now about who can get the most money. I question whether the children in some cases are benefiting. A formula should look at the income of both parents, the age and needs of the child and the number of nights the child spends with the parent.” Presumption of shared care “There should be a rebuttable presumption of shared care.” No child support payments if 50/50 care “Shared care where it exists should have no payments from either party as both parents have their expenses with their children, food, clothing and other support that they choose to provide on their income.” “Shared care is the ideal situation for parents and children allowing them to benefit from growing up under the nurture and care of both parents. It is currently very unfair how responsibility for working and providing for the children is not equally distributed.” “The whole methodology is wrong. When parents separate, 50-50 sharing should be the norm. In this situation no parent should pay child support since they both look after the children for the same time. Only when this arrangement is changed should child support be introduced and then dependent on access – that is, if a parent is preventing the other parent from seeing the child they should receive NO child support as this is abuse.” 16 CHAPTER 4 Taking both parents’ income into account On the basis that both parents should be financially responsible for raising their child, the discussion document outlined options for taking into account the combined income of both parents (as if the parents were living together). Under this approach, the expenditure for raising the child would be divided between parents according to their respective share of that combined income and their respective levels of care of the child. A separate adjustment to a parent’s child support income would be made to take into account other dependant children living in that parent’s household. Results of online consultation Q1: Do you think the income of both parents should always be included in working out the amount of child support payable? No, the income of both parents' income should not be taken into account 32% Yes, the income of both parents' income should be taken into account 68% Note: The view that both parents’ income should always be taken into account was particularly prominent amongst paying parents. Some 88% of paying parents felt that both incomes should be taken into account, compared with 37% of receiving parents. 17 Q1(a): If you think that both incomes should be taken into account, why? Both parents have a financial responsibility to the child 44% It w o uld be fairer 30% These days, both parents are more likely to be working 21% Other 5% Q1(b): If you do not think that both incomes should be taken into account, why not? Other 24% The person who pays most of the bills for the child should not have their income taken into account 60% Low incomes/ part-time work should not be taken into account 16% 18 Summary of comments on taking both parents’ income into account Effect on work incentives Many submitters expressed support for taking both parents’ income into account, reinforcing the view that both parents should have financial responsibility for their children. One of the concerns raised about the “income shares” approach, however, is the impact that it could have on work incentives for parents. It is argued that including receiving parents’ incomes will create a disincentive for them (in particular mothers looking after young children) to return to the workforce. Many submitters – in particular receiving parents – also thought that the person who predominantly pays for the care for the child should not have their income taken into account. Taking the income of the family unit into account Although not recommended in the discussion document, comments were received as to whether the income of the whole family unit, including the income of a parents’ new partner, should be taken into account. Many submitters thought that the income of a new partner should be included. The adequacy of the level of the living allowance suggested in the discussion document was also questioned, in particular for individuals with higher incomes. Definition of income Another recurring concern related to the definition of income – in particular, the perceived ability of paying parents who are self-employed (and others) to manipulate their income for child support purposes in order to minimise payments. To that end, various comments were received suggesting that all income sources including, for example, family trusts, be included. 19 Comments on taking both parents’ income into account General comments on taking both parents’ income into account “I believe this is only fairer if consideration of how much care is provided by either parent is also applied to the formula.” Effect on work incentives “In my situation I have the children for the majority of the working fortnight – I act \[as\] a free childcare (to some degree for my ex-partner) which allows him to work whatever hours are needed at his work – this also allows him to further his career and take additional training opportunities that aren't anywhere nearly as easy for me to pursue. I consider I'm financially disadvantaged enough!” “The custodial parent's income should not affect the non-custodial parent’s responsibilities for their children. The paying parent's liability should be based on THEIR ability to pay, not on the recipient parent's income. Custodial parents would be discouraged by the fact that any increase in their own income, would cause a decrease in child support. This would create a disincentive to work, or to better themselves. It would create an incentive to work ‘under the table’.” “This is the proposal of most concern to me. \[It\] disincentivises custodial parents to return to work and make a better life for themselves. For higher earning custodial parents this approach does not take into account the opportunity cost and other ‘soft costs’ associated with being \[the\] primary caregiver. Also, where do you draw the line with looking at partners of parents and their income? It's a slippery slope.” Taking the income of the family unit into account “I would go further and say that where they have remarried / repartnered the total income of that family situation ought to be taken into account.” “I think a fairer approach would be to look at the “household income” when determining how much either parent should contribute to a child’s welfare. Some cases show that a mother with the main care of her child has a low ‘personal’ income, thereby increasing the amount the other liable parent would be asked to pay, but she may be living in a situation where her income is substantially subsidised by a new partner... which is never obvious when looking at her income alone.” “I believe new partner’s incomes should also be taken into account. Where the custodial parent takes on a new partner, that partner does and should accept the complete package, including the children of a previous relationship. In the case of \[the\] paying parent a new partner likewise, does and should accept the responsibility the partner has for children who reside elsewhere.” “Both parents should be equally responsible for the costs of raising their children. Irrespective of what income a person has, the basic cost of raising a child does not change, therefore what a person earns, any new relationships or children should have no bearing on the base rate that they pay.” 20 Definition of income “Why is the living allowance so low? Surely if you earn $80k you would spend more on yourself per year than $16,054? If you are basing child support payments on income, then shouldn't you base the living allowance on income too? This should be relative to income and not a set amount.” “Income” should also include any Working for Families tax credits etc that either parent may be receiving (or this should offset any liability calculations).” “All income should be looked at even when assets and such are placed in trusts to dodge tax systems.” 21 CHAPTER 5 Options for a revised child support formula The discussion document asked whether the factors discussed above should be taken into account in determining child support payments. If so, a revised child support formula would incorporate: • basing child support payments on estimated average expenditures for raising children in New Zealand; • recognition for lower levels of care; and • taking the income of both parents into account. Respondents were asked whether all these factors should be taken into account. They were also asked, if only one of these ideas could be changed, which would they most like to see. Results of online consultation Q1: Do you think that the factors mentioned so far (expenditure for raising children, shared care and taking both parents’ income into account) should be used to work out child support payments? No, not all these factors should be taken into account 31% Yes, all these factors should be taken into account 69% Note: The view that all the factors should be taken into account was particularly prominent amongst paying parents. Some 83% of paying parents felt they should all be taken into account, compared with 47% of receiving parents. 22 Q2: If only one idea could be changed, which one would you most like to see? None of them 9% Shared care 24% Taking both parents' income into account 33% Expenditure for raising children 34% Summary of comments on options for a revised child support formula The tone of written submissions generally indicates a preference for comprehensive change rather than change in just one issue. 23 CHAPTER 6 Payments, penalties and debt The discussion document sought feedback on whether incentives to pay child support can be improved by changing the rules relating to the payment of child support, the imposition of penalties, and the writing-off of penalties and debt. The document suggests that the best way of dealing with child support debt is to stop the debt being created in the first place. Although penalties can be important in encouraging parents to pay their child support obligations, they can also, if excessive, lead to very high debt levels that discourage paying parents from contacting Inland Revenue and arranging payment. In attempting to strike a balance between these factors, the following options were suggested: • making it compulsory that all child support payments be automatically deducted from a paying parent’s employment income; • reducing penalty rates after the first year of non-compliance (or alternatively capping penalty levels), while at the same time strengthening other non-financial enforcement measures – for example: – by paying parents facing more focused and intensive case management; or – by restricting paying parents’ ability to travel overseas if they fail to pay child support; or – by offsetting the debt against refunds from Inland Revenue in more situations; or – in limited cases, by publicly identifying non-complying paying parents. • having closer alignment with the penalties system currently in place for tax debts; and • relaxing the circumstances in which penalties and child support debt can be written off by Inland Revenue in certain circumstances. 24 Results of online consultation Q1: Do you think that all child support payments should be automatically deducted from employment income? Q2: Do you think that child support penalty rates should be reduced after the first year of default (or penalties capped) and other enforcement measures more widely used? No, penalty rates should not be reduced 35% Yes, penalty rates should be reduced after the first year of default 65% No, child support payments should not be automatically deducted from employment income 34% Yes , child support payments should be automatically deducted from employment income 66% 25 Q2(a): If you think that child support penalty rates should be reduced after the first year of default (or penalties capped), which additional enforcement measures should be introduced at the same time for paying parents that continue not to pay? Q3: Do you think that child support penalties should be better aligned with the penalty and use-of-money interest rules that apply for tax purposes? No, child support penalties should not be more aligned with tax penalties 36% Yes, child support penalties should be better aligned with tax penalties 64% Publicly identifying paying parents who do not pay 15% Further use of the automatic deduction of refunds from Inland Revenue 26% Restrict paying parents from travelling overseas 27% More intensive case management from Inland Revenue 32% 26 Q4: Should the ability to write-off child support penalties be further relaxed? No, the ability to write-off child support penalties should not be further relaxed 45% Yes, the ability to write-off child support penalties should be further relaxed 55% Q4(a): If the ability to write-off child support penalties were to be further relaxed, which options should be considered to achieve this? Inland Revenue being able to automatically w rite-off low le v e ls o f penalty-only debt 27% Allo w ing Inland Revenue a w ider range of options to negotiate the write-off of penalties 31% G reater ability to write-off penalties, such as when a parent agrees and adheres to an instalment arrangement to pay debts 42% 27 Q5: Should the Government be able to write-off child support debt owed to it on serious hardship grounds, for debts owed to it? No, the Government should not be able to write- off child support debt owed to it 45% Yes, the Government should be able to write- off child support debt owed to it 55% Summary of comments on payments, penalties and debt Automatic deduction of child support payments from employment income Automatic deductions from employment income had wide support, although some concerns were raised in respect of privacy and compliance costs for employers. Submitters who did not support the option objected to the prospect of having a specific payment method imposed on them when they were compliant. They felt that they should be trusted to make their own arrangements, with this option only being used for non-compliant parents. Some submitters noted that a similar measure does not extend to the self employed – an area where some believe manipulation of income for child support purposes is occurring. Penalty rates, and other enforcement measures Many submitters considered that, with the Government facing increasing levels of child support debt, it is imperative that the negative impact of the current penalties regime be addressed. This view can be summed up by one submission that contended that late payment penalty rates are far too harsh and overly penal to the extent of discouraging paying parents once they incur a debt, resulting in: • an increase in debt problems; and • discouraging voluntary compliance. 28 In terms of additional enforcement measures that could be imposed in lieu of reducing penalty rates, most of the options canvassed were supported. However, it was noted that these should be balanced against resourcing and privacy issues. The privacy implications of “naming and shaming” certain non-paying parents, especially if any disclosure were subsequently found to be incorrect, were of concern to some. There was some support for better aligning late payment penalties for child support to those applying for tax on the basis that it would make things easier, therefore helping voluntary compliance and also reducing administration costs. There was little support for applying use-of-money interest (UOMI) on unpaid child support. However, there was significant support for passing some or all late payment penalties on to receiving parents (who are not receiving the domestic purposes benefit) to compensate them for the fact that they have not received their child support on time. Writing-off penalties and child support debt in certain circumstances Support for this proposal tended to be conditional on amounts only being written-off if this resulted in payment of core child support debt or, in the case of amounts owed to the Government, in extreme and proven cases of hardship. A common comment was that any changes should not be seen to be diluting the disincentive effect of penalties – therefore they should not be written-off too easily. A greater level of discretion in writing-off penalties in genuine cases when this would result in payment was, however, generally seen to be helpful. Additionally, some felt that paying parents who otherwise comply should not be unduly penalised for making an occasional error or omission. 29 Comments on payments, penalties and debt General comments on payments, penalties and debts “The debt issue is secondary to actually ensuring that parents receive the money they are entitled to.” “The system needs to be fair. Families need to be encouraged to sort things out for themselves and I believe government agencies need to keep out of these situations as much as possible as they are often very complex. I think the first option should always be for a private arrangement to be made (with guidelines available), and the child support system should only be a fall-back if an agreement by the parties can't be reached.” “PLEASE PLEASE AMEND THE PENALTY REGIME! Most of the largest amounts/periods of debt are uncollectible, due to \[an\] individual's circumstances, but no ‘discretion’ is given or provision made to ‘assist’ debtors, and many become embittered with their dealings with IRCS, leaving them LESS compliant, and destroying any possibility of remaining involved with or caring for their children – the children suffer because of the very financial support that ‘punishes’ one or both of their parents.” “It’s grossly unfair. It’s punitive and ultimately money going to the penalties and interest is money not going to the children. It’s not in the best interests of the children and if it was so successful at achieving the aim of getting parents to pay why is there so much owing.” “If CS was fair in the first place, I think a lot more people would pay. For those that do pay, CS is a financial burden designed to support an ex's life style (not the child) and this does not create an environment for good compliance.” “Penalties and debt should be at the discretion of the parent caring for the child/ren as to whether it should be written off.” Automatic deduction of child support payments from employment income “Without a doubt this should be compulsory.” “\[It\] enables a ‘hassle free’ option and is able to be a special tax code. \[It\] doesn't work as well for variable wage earners but is good for salary earners.” “By doing \[it\] this way it saves the ‘he said, she said’ situations that occur with private arrangements. Also, for those that currently go through the IRD system, it will hopefully mean that the payments will come through more regularly and no longer be reliant on the honesty of the “paying” parent. In my situation, the paying parent has done all he could to avoid paying, including stating to a recent employer that he was making payments directly to IRD when he wasn't.” “I think the liable parent should be able to have a choice as to how they pay. Currently if the liable parent does not make their payments then there is the auto option of placing the deduction onto the employer. You need to give the liable parent the benefit of the doubt to be able to deal with their own finances and not assume that payment will not be forthcoming as a number of people would not like their employer to know of their personal circumstances which is private to them.” 30 “Child support payments should only be automatically deducted from employment income if an individual fails to pay two consecutive monthly payments. There are plenty of us ‘paying non- custodial parents’ (sharing care 50% of the time) that actually pay child support on time as we are led to believe it is in the best interest of our children.” “It’s a privacy matter. IRD should not be the watchdog to this. \[The\] paying parent should pay the other parent directly.” “When I had wanted to have child support deducted from my income before I received it, IRD was unable to accept my voluntary request. I found this illogical as I pay tax via PAYE, why not just up PAYE at a special tax rate and apportion the child support out of the PAYE that is received. That way I avoid missing a payment and IRD gets the money in a timely way. Having to manually set up separate payments for child support is stupid and it was a major hassle for me remembering to pay on time.” “Child support is a private and personal affair which employers have no need to know about. It also creates an additional burden on an employer, and if the employer does not subtract the correct amount, the paying parent may end up with an additional bill (and extra penalties?)to manage through no fault of their own. Essentially, child support is a personal responsibility that an employer has no business in.” “What about self-employed people?” “It is not fair to have a person's private life made public at work. Plus the employer would have to meet the cost of administering this additional deduction.” “This only targets PAYE earners – what about all the self-employed parents who minimise their income to avoid CS?” Penalty rates and other enforcement measures “More intensive case management from IRD would be fantastic, instead of it being based on the ‘dripping tap’ scenario which happens currently. By using other enforcement measures rather than solely penalty rates it may act as an incentive for the paying parent to keep up to date with their payments.” “Capped when it becomes apparent they aren't going to pay... no point adding fines on top of fines that then become bigger than the initial debt and don't show a true representation of unpaid child support, but rather unpaid fines with some unpaid child support.” “The 10% penalties are fair but not the 2% penalties. The liable parent is never happy to suddenly see a debt of $100,000 which includes all the penalties when the original child support portion is only a few thousand dollars. This makes it very hard to collect the outstanding child support.” “If the system was fairer there would likely be less defaults.” “I don't see the point in penalising people on a monetary level. It just adds to the problem. Majority of people don't pay because they are unable to, the situation with the receiving parent is difficult or they think the calculation is unfair (shared care etc). I think if a paying parent defaults, then IRD should apply for an attachment to wages/benefit.” “I think penalising people is not going to make them pay any quicker. I think helping paying parents pay on time might help.” 31 “First off penalties should be reduced, ie if payment is missed by one day or so or if there have been regular payments but for some reason a payment is suddenly not made. Take longer to impose penalties but then be more forceful after attempts have failed to get that parent to pay.” “Once penalties get high they are ignored. Increased management via personal contact would be beneficial.” “Parents who choose to ignore their responsibilities should be encouraged to face their responsibility. They know the consequences of avoiding childcare so removing penalties, in my view, won't necessarily make them pay if they've continually avoided their responsibilities in the past.” “Penalty payments fail to benefit children as they are not passed on. Penalties cripple paying parents’ ability to get back to a level score card and to feel good about contributing even if it is in a purely financial way to the lives of their children – paying parents are penalised in many other ways – your terminology reinforces winners and losers – the fact they are not passed on to the children adds insult to injury.” “Failure to pay child support should be like in America, ‘a criminal offence’ and an arrestable offence. There is no excuse for not paying.” “Penalties need to be actually enforced! Any parent with late payments should not be able to leave the country regardless of the amount. This is a principle that should be enforced. If the paying parent has the money to travel overseas they have the money to pay child support. If the paying parent has to travel for work, then it is a stronger incentive to pay on time so as not to affect their employment. Payment should be deducted from their wages and there would not be a problem in this area.” “I don't support publicly identifying non-paying parents – this is pretty ‘out there’.” “I don't see the point in penalties – it just puts people further into debt. I would understand if the money got passed on to the custodial parent as we generally incur costs when the child support doesn't get paid – but the money doesn't get passed on – it goes into the Government coffers.” “Tougher measures need to be brought in for recovering money from self-employed people, including taking money from their personal, company and trust bank accounts.” “You identify non-paying parents and you humiliate a child.” “Penalties should be removed altogether. Why punish the paying parent further? And if compulsory deductions are introduced this will be a minor problem which can be addressed case by case.” “I would suggest that instead of the 10% lump sum penalty, that a say 1% or 2% (min $5) amount be immediately added and that would increase if the amount was still unpaid say 7 days later (depending on how quickly notice was given of the missed payment). This would mean there was incentive for the paying parent to pay up as soon as possible. IRD should also be able to make the payment to the receiving parent between normal payment dates.” “I think the penalties should be high at first and then reduce if it is demonstrated that the person pays on time has an issue/communicates with IRD. If the person defaults/is late and has one chance to redeem themselves it goes back to the initial penalty. If penalties were capped after a certain point then \[there is\] no incentive for someone who has reached that point to clear their debt.” 32 “I want to see interest on the outstanding money be added to the amounts and collected and given to the parent who has been supporting the child, while waiting for the other parent to ‘get around’ or completely avoid paying child support.” Writing-off child support penalties in certain circumstances “If the penalties are contributing to the non-payment (due to stretching \[a\] paying person’s income more) then they should be able to be written off as long as the payer enters into a contract to pay regular CS.” “Greater ability to write-off penalties if agreement made and adhered to...for the full term of the debt repayment...not for 6 months and stop paying again... Anything long-term should incur additional debt... Encourage fast payment, quick resolution, avoiding long-term debt. But severe penalties for long-term non/erratic payment. And penalties written-off for quick repayment of any arrears and those who show a long-term good history of payment.” “Empathy for both parties is paramount – an error once in a blue moon simply doesn't justify your penalties.” “Penalties were supposed to be a way of getting someone to comply. From the CS debt figures released recently it \[is\] clear that it is making some people hide under a rock as the amount has got out of control. And the only person that suffers is the child especially since the child does not see any of the penalties if they are ever paid.” “IRD needs to have options available to the paying parent who has incurred penalties, especially if there is a payment arrangement in place. It would encourage them more to stick to the arrangement and feel better about it as they see the amount reducing further faster.” “Increase IRD's options and discretion to write off penalties, but don't actually make write-offs easy to obtain or assumed. The main point of penalties is to be a disincentive to default on payments, so the penalties need to be believable while not driving people to despair if they are genuine in their intent to pay and their reasons for not.” “Maybe review at some future stage after impact of this review and any changes implemented can be evaluated.” “The aim is to make a paying parent compliant so any incentive to get them to pay can be an advantage. At present waiting 26 weeks to write off penalties is too long. A liable parent’s circumstances can change frequently so one missed payment can result in the earlier repayment arrangement being invalidated. Is it possible to have an ongoing regime where write-off is effected relative to the amount paid?” “Having relaxed policy and legislation provides Inland Revenue with greater negotiation movement. Any penalty should only be written off or wiped once full payment is made though. Not before. Being able to write off smaller debts will also reduce the huge amount of Child Support debt.” “All penalties should stay, otherwise they aren't penalties. The problem is not in the write-off, the problem is in the penalty imposed in the first place.” “Only if the receiving parent agrees to it.” “Some of the penalty should be paid to the custodial parent as quite often they go without if child support is not paid so that the child does not miss out.” 33 Writing-off child support debt owed to the Government (note, not amounts owed to receiving parents) in certain circumstances “It is not going to affect the receiving parent so makes no difference to them, however I wouldn't like to see this happen to every liable parent, it would have to be on serious hardship grounds. I would also like to see terminally ill liable parents considered as a child support debt write-off.” “They should have it deducted at $10 a week, it may take them a long time to pay off but I know heaps of people that have had to do it.” “Child support debt should never be written off, whether it be owed to the custodial parent or Government. The responsibility should always remain, even if it is paid off with a minimal weekly payment.” “Only if wasting time chasing a non-payer is never going to produce results.” “This would see paying parents treated differently depending on the circumstances of the custodial parent.” “Any write-off provisions likely to be abused. We have \[the\] option to suspend collection and should take that step if \[there is\] no income through ill health.” 34 CHAPTER 7 Other issues A number of other issues were considered by the Government as part of its review of the current child support rules. These included: • whether the ability to claim child support should be restricted to either a parent of a child, someone who has legal custody of a child, or someone who is entitled to receive a Government benefit in respect of a child; • whether parents who earn additional income after separation in order to meet set- up costs (such as a new home or furniture) should be able to apply to have this additional income exempted from their overall income for the purposes of the child support formula; • whether paying parents who meet certain costs of the child directly (for example, for school fees, school uniforms, medical/dental services for the child) should, in some circumstances, be able to get a “credit” for this against their child support payments; and • whether child support payments should stop when the child turns 18, unless the child is still in full-time secondary education, in which case the payments would stop when the child left school. Results of online consultation Q1: Do you think that the ability to claim child support should be restricted to either: • a parent; or • someone who has legal custody of a child; or • someone who is entitled to receive a Government benefit in respect of a child. No, there should be no further restrictions on who can claim child support 50% Yes, there should be more restrictions on who can claim child support 50% 35 Q2: Do you think that the child support scheme should, in certain circumstances, ignore certain extra income (for example, from overtime or a second job) for a finite period to allow a parent to set up a new home following a relationship break-up? No, the child support scheme should not igno re e x tra inc o m e 29% Yes, the c hild support scheme sho uld, in certain circumstances, igno re extra inco m e 71% Q3: In certain circumstances, do you think that a parent should be able to obtain a credit against their child support liability by meeting significant costs of the child directly (for example, medical bills)? Yes, a parent should, in certain circumstances, get a credit for s ignific ant c o s ts o f the c hild m e t directly 81% No, a parent should not get a credit for s ignific ant c o s ts of the child met directly 19% 36 Q4: Do you think the age that child support payments cease should generally be when the child turns 18 (unless they are still in secondary education)? Yes, child support payments should generally cease when the child turns 18 76% No, child support payments should not generally cease when the child turns 18 24% Summary of comments on other issues Who should be able to claim child support? Results were divided over whether the ability to claim child support should be restricted. Of those that made submissions on this, a recurring theme was that unduly restricting child support to certain groups could have significant adverse implications for those situations when children were being looked after by extended family members. More generally, some felt that anyone who can prove that they are caring for the child and have the child’s best interests at heart should be able to make a claim for child support. On the other hand, some submitters felt strongly that when children leave home without their parents’ consent, then the person looking after them should not be able to make a claim for child support. Recognising re-establishment costs There was general support for recognising re-establishment costs, with many submitters feeling that, if allowed for a finite period of time, this would allow parents to adequately set up a stable home to allow them to look after their children. Others, however, stressed that all income should be recognised and that allowing re-establishment costs could complicate matters, would require detailed guidance, and could potentially be open to abuse. 37 Prescribed payments Although this idea was very well supported, and was raised in many comments (often in conjunction with the issue of accountability for child support payments), the associated practical issues were also well canvassed – for example, that ideally there should be agreement between parents of what represented acceptable expenditure for such purposes. Age at which child support should cease Although most submitters were supportive, a number of comments were also received that suggest that payments should continue for longer if the child continues in tertiary education. A small number of submitters, on the other hand, thought that child support should cease at an age before 18. Other issues Other issues were submitted as part of the consultation but fell outside the scope of the online questions and the discussion document. They are, however, relevant when considering family relationships and interaction with the child support scheme more generally and include: • That parents’ child support contributions should be paid into a trust account for the children, and that all subsequent expenses could then be withdrawn from that account. • Concerns were raised about the ability of paying parents, in certain circumstances, to have contact with their children. When this issue was raised, it was often noted that this lack of contact could act as a disincentive to make payment. • Ways of better recognising the interests of the child. This was sometimes raised in conjunction with a view that there is a need for a more holistic approach to reform relating to the care of children. • The practical difficulties faced by many victims of domestic violence when interacting with other parents or when dealing with Inland Revenue. 38 Comments on other issues Who should be able to claim child support? “... someone who can prove that they are caring and providing for a child because it is in the child’s best interests regarding health and safety to do so.” “Those who meet the criteria for caring for a child legally and are accountable and meet the terms of caregiving and any guardianship or parenting orders.” “Someone who has entered into a voluntary agreement to care for a child where the agreement indicated that child support would be the way to make payments. Parents who object to their child being cared for by a person chosen by the child, without the parent's consent should not be required to pay child support simply because the child ‘ran away’ from home. This should be considered a care and protection issue and CYFS or \[the\] Family Court should be involved and determine obligations.” “Also grandparents, step families.” “The concept of access to child support is always going to be a contentious issue. Each case will need to be reviewed against a set of guidelines. However once any guidelines are published, there is always a risk that custodial parents will attempt to arrange their affairs to maximise any benefits.” “I feel the Child Support Act needs to recognise ‘Whangai’ situations. Although this is a Māori term for an adoption that has not been processed by the proper legal authorities, it is common amongst most cultures. If the child has been given to another person at birth to raise, I feel that the biological parent should not be made liable, or be able to object and provide supporting evidence that for all intents and purposes, the caregiver is in fact the parent.” “Someone who is actually taking care of the child; it should be the paying parent and custodian's liability to make sure the child is in good care, and to inform police or CYFS as soon as they think the child is being mistreated, and \[take\] action on it.” “I think that if a child has left home without parental consent and that parent has filed a complaint with the police then no claim can be made for that child. So, if the child continues to disobey their parents there is no financial incentive for other adults to support that child against the parent's wishes.” “There are situations where extended families are brought in to take care of the children such as \[a\] grandparent because neither parent is able to take care of the child. In these circumstances they should be allowed to receive child support payments to meet their costs.” Recognising re-establishment costs “When my ex partner did overtime for extra income it seemed that really I got the extra not him. That's why we have moved to a private arrangement, if he has income fluctuations it doesn't matter. In the same token if he was to lose his job or take a massive pay cut we would obviously need to change the arrangement.” “Only in circumstances where \[the\] parent \[is\] accepting their responsibilities already.” “Sometimes the extra income is intended specifically for that purpose – \[to\] help get on their feet following a break-up. Why take more from the paying parent when they are working hard to earn more – leave it at main income.” 39 “Only for a capped period.” “If the assessment is fair to begin with this should not be necessary. But some families and non- custodial parents cannot get ahead because they are either trying to re-start ... or pay for two families as in our case.” “As long as this can be viewed as beneficial to the child, ie if there is shared care and they need to buy furniture for the child to use when visiting. If they have no shared agreement then no.” “Absolutely. Parents who have put their careers on hold to care of their children should not be disadvantaged when a relationship breaks up. A relationship break up for many parents and their children means a huge change in circumstances. If an individual is willing to work to help their children/family re-establish they should be applauded not penalised.” “For a restricted period, eg 3 months, as often the receiving parent has costs also in setting up a home as well as providing for children.” “Must be criteria or guidelines around this.” “It would overcomplicate matters, and would probably disadvantage less-educated parents who would be less likely to make special applications to exempt their ‘extra income’. It would also be likely to result in fraudulent claims.” “Income is income. It should be a percentage of all income.” “Overtime is income and is taxed as such. There is no tax relief for someone needing to set up a new home. Why should the children subsidise it. If the levels of child support are too high, they should be dropped, particularly where the other parent is on a benefit. In those situations it is next to impossible for a liable parent to feel they are contributing to the welfare of the children and, in middle income earning situations, it is difficult to contribute further.” “The overtime option would make it too easy for the employers to help the liable parents to ‘fiddle’ the figures. I do think redundancy pay outs should not be included though.” “Surely both parents are trying to re-establish at this time? The children still need day to day expenses covered, and I'm sure they have re-establishment costs too!” “It depends on circumstances. Again, the child should not be penalised for a parent leaving.” “There is currently admin review if there are circumstances out of the norm. Everyone is entitled to half their matrimonial settlement so this would be allowed for in that.” “This is what the separation agreement is for. Separation agreements and the breakdown of marital property is nothing to do with care of the children.” Prescribed payments “Absolutely. Isn't that what child support is for? To pay toward costs of raising a child – which includes medical and schooling.” “This way paying parents who also contribute directly can have that contribution recognised.” “It would be a way of encouraging more non-custodial parents to be more involved with their child.” 40 “Depends on the expense. These costs should be shared by both parents on top of the child support liability. These should include one-off costs like new school uniforms and medical or dentistry bills. These are necessary expenses for the child’s benefit. I do not think it should include new computers or luxury items, or sports costs that can get out of hand when one parent thinks is important and the other cannot control.” “Only if the costs are warranted.” “It \[is\] all about the child, and if a person is contributing directly to the child's care and living, then that person should have a credit for it.” “These purchases need to be agreed by both parties otherwise the paying parent determines what the money is spent on rather than leaving the care-giving parent with discretion to get what is actually needed.” “I do not think this could be administered properly and fairly. I can see a system like this open to abuse.” “This would be very hard to monitor, if paying parents were allowed to get a credit, there would have to be strict criteria.” Age at which child support should cease “I agree that child support should cease when the child turns 18 unless the child is in secondary education, child support is required to be paid. But after this period, the child either starts to work or is eligible for student loans or government benefits. If the child leaves school before 18 to start employment or tertiary education then child support should also cease.” “Should be capped at 18 or younger if they leave school and support themselves in employment.” “As long as they are at secondary school that’s only fair, once working or on some benefit child support should stop.” “My son no longer receives child support as he is 18 and working fulltime, however next year he is studying fulltime and I believe that both parents’ incomes come into account in regards of him receiving a student allowance. Unless his father is paying child support then his income should not be counted for anything. If it is counted then the child support needs to continue until it no longer is.” “Nowadays society expects parents to support their children past secondary school (aka tertiary education), and as such I feel that if a child is undertaking additional education past high school then child support should continue until 21.” “Up to 25 if still in education. This is when student allowance kicks in without parental income assessment.” “I think that given that tertiary students are not considered independent till they are 25 for allowance purposes, then child support should be paid to tertiary students until they reach this age.” 41 Use of trust accounts “As the system is right now the money is paid in to the CP account and \[there\] is no control over how the money is spent. Also \[it\] is not clear how much the CP contribution to the child support is and what are the real expenses with the child. Instead if both parents’ contribution is paid into a trust account for the children’s benefit all the expenses can be withdrawn from that account. This way the children can benefit more and any money not spent will accumulate for them.” “The Government should look at setting up trust accounts for children “receiving” child support to ensure it is actually used on the child for school fees etc and not by the parent for luxury items such as cigarettes and alcohol. Receipts can be submitted to the trust for reimbursement at month's end (like any tax return). Anything not spent can stay in the account for future use. When the child turns 18 they should be able to get that money directly to help them out in life.”
'Regulatory Impact Statement Makin g KiwiS aver more cost-effective Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue and the Treasury. It provides an analysis of options for changes to KiwiSaver, to boost national savings. These are scheduled to be announced as part ofBudget 201 1. The Government has signalled its desire to focus Budget 2011 on measures which will boost national savings as this will help to address economiclmbalances and reduce New Zealand,s indebtedness, either by enabling current debt to be paid down or by reducing the need for borrowing in the future. As the quickest way for the Govemment to improve national saving and reduce economic imbalances would be to improve its own saving position,l the identifióation and development of options quickly nanowed to those most ü\[ely to reduce Government spending without undermining the primary purpose of KiwiSaver. A key asSumption is that any changes should be directed towards altering the balance of contributions made by each of the contributing parties (the member, their Jmployer and the Çrown) away from public flrnding and towards private saving. Any Crown incãntives to save through KiwiSaver should be directed appropriately. This papei also analyses options for increasing the numbers en¡olled in KiwiSavà, \*d/or increãsing the amo;nt of members, contributions, again with the aim of boosting national savings, and encouraging private savings behaviour that is focused on the long term retum-and specificall| individual retirement. The impacts of each option cannot be easily modelled using historical data, given the relative newness of the KiwiSaver savings model, nor is international comparison ul\*uyr appropriate, given many of KiwiSaver's unique features and New Zealand's TTE model otiaxationi. Our analysis of the options i"s therefore dependent on behavioural assumptions, for which there is minimal empirical evidence, about individuals' and employ"rr' i"rponses to changes in savings incentives and other regulatory requirements, In-módelling the effects on the Net Intemational Investment Position (NIIP), the assumption has been made that additional national savings reduces the cunent account deficit iather than increases overall domestic investment. To the extent that these changes instead boost domestic invsstment, the impact on the NIIP will be smaller. These assumptions are consistent throughout, so \*, huu" greater confidence in the relativity between the varíous results than in their absolute levels. I SavÍng ín New Zeølancl - Icsues øncl Optrbas (The Treasury, September 2 Tu\*". are often classified accordíng to whether income is taxed (T), ta di when income is first earned, secondly when ìnvest ís when income is spent, New Zealand''s TTE appro m come (T), tax is paid on ínvestment income arising from the contributions (T) and withdrawals from te exempt (E). Many other countries have specíal retirement saving vehicles ì¡ât ur" taxed on an EEi basis; so money placed in these vehicles is not taxed when first earned, nor as it compãunds, but it is when it is withdrawn from the fund. We have reconciled, as far as possible, each option for change with the primary pu¡pose for which Kiwisaver was designed, whioh was to provide an easy-access, work-based low-risk produot, which would enable individuals and households who might not be saving enough for their retirement to do so. KiwiSaver was not explicitly designed as an instrument to boost national savings and so, although it can make a positivo contribution, its effectiveness towards this objective is likely to be more limited. We have also recognised that KiwiSaver is less than five years old. Since its launch in July 2007, there have been several significant changes to contribution requirements, which have mostly affected employees and their employers, as well as new providers entering into the KiwiSaver market. The KiwiSaver industry has not experienced any period of stability in which to establish its core products, and this uncertainty and unpredictability is not helpful to either the industry or savers. Any changes made at this point in time should therefore be sustainable and, where possible, use pre-existing features of KiwiSaver rather than introduce new features, Our analysis draws on matters identified by other interestcd agencies, including the Retirement Commissioner and the Govemment Actuary. As the need for Budget secrecy has limited opportunities for formal public consultation in the usual manner under the Generic Tax Policy Process, we have also drawn on the considerations of the Savings Working Group3, which was commissioned by the Minister of Finance in August 2010 to provide a point of referÞnce for the Government in developing its medium-teün savings strategies. The proposals do not impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. The proposal to increase the compulsory employer contribution rate at the same time as increasing the minimum employee contribution rate' will lead to some additional costs on businesses that employ staft by increasing labour costs; ìn the short term thís may reduce firm profitability. The additional cost for employers is likely eventually to be reflected in wage settlements for all employees, although this impact should be limited as the economy and nominal wage growth ate expected to strengthen from the end of 2011.

This RIS summarises off,rcials' analysis of various changes to I(iwisaver that havebeen considered in order to deliver two objectives: o to help return the Crown to surplus sooner by reducing the fiscal costs of l(iwiSaver; and o to continue to encourage increased levels of private household savings, and a long- term savings habit and asset accumulation, in order to increase well-being and fìnancial independence in retirement. 2. Analysis of each of the key options for change is summarised in the table at paragraph 16. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Economic Growth ønd Savìng Levels 3. The Government is concetned that, in recent years, New Zealancl's economic growth perfotmance has been poor by developed country standards, ancl our relative position in the OECD is well below average. In addition, as the Savings Working Group (SWG) noted, New Zealand's low rate of saving has created a dependency on foreign capital to fulfill clomestic investment clemancl. This has created a large and persistent gap between New Zealand's investment attcl saving levels, as reflected in the current account clef,rcit over several decacles. The SWG agreecl with the analysis set out in the Treasury's discussion document4 that this presents two serious economic problems: firstly it makes the New Zealand economy too vulnerable to market shocks; secondly, it has an adverse impact on economic performance, especially growths. 4. In adclition, the Governrnent has signalled its desire to move quickly to recluce Government debt and return to fiscal surplus. Lifting the level of national savings would help to address economic imbalances, recluce New Zealand's indebteclness and thus possibly contribute to improved economic growth. The Govemment has indicated that the focus of Budget 2011 will be on national savings and investment. As noted by the SWG, returning towards fiscal surplus, as well as encouraging private inclividuals to save more, is an important component of irnproving the national savings position. KìwíSuver 5. The objective of I(wiSaver, as set out in the l(iwiSaver Act 2006,is"to encoLtrctge ct long-term savings habit ond qsset accumulation by individuuls who ctre not in a position to enioy stondards o.f litting in retirement similctr to those in pre-retirement". It was not explicitly designed as an instrument to boost national savings per se, but instead to increase individuals' well-being and frnancial independence in retirernent, as a complement to New Zealand Superannuation for those who wish to have more than a basic stanclard of living in retirement. 4 Th" Tr"nrr.y,"Soving in New Zeolanrl", op, cit. s"Saring Ne¡v Zeuktntl: Retlucing I/ulnerabilities ctncl But'riers to Crowllt anrl Prosperiry", Savings Working Croup Final Report to the M inister of Finance, January 20 I I , Section 2. 6, I(iwiSaver was clesigned with features intenclecl to encourage long-term savings, by making it easy and attractive to join, plovicling relatively limitecl opportunities to access savings once enrolled, and providing incliviclual savers with opportunities to exercise as much or as little choice over their savings as they wish to or are able to. Although membership is available to all eligible New Zealand residents, many of the key features of Kiwisaver are those of a work-based superannuation scherne, such as the automatic enrohnent of employees, decluctions at source and (cornpulsory) employer contributions. 7. The numbers enrolling in I(iwiSaver have consistently outstrippecl initial forecasts, and the present membership is double that forecast in 2007. The latest I(iwisaver Evaluation report6 concluded that I(wiSaver's features are working as intended, pafticularly in attracting people into a savings product. It also concluclecl that I(wiSaver has generated some level of uew savings, over and above what would have been saved in the absence of KiwiSaver. 8. KiwiSaver therefore has a potentially significant role to play in increasing national savings, both through the savings contributions made by members, and in promoting awareness about savings and inculcating a savings habit among a large rnajority of the population, However, the cost to the Government is signifìcant and this restricts the benefits to national savings; a recent Cohnar Brunton survey indicates that the percentage of contributions that were "new" savings (as opposecl to cliverted from other forms of saving) at approximately 29Yo7. This is partly because some of the private funcls going into KiwiSaver accounts are being diverted from other savings rather than being aclditional saving, and partly because the Govemment's contribution rneans that inclividuals clo not have to save as much themselves to achieve the same eventual outcornes. OBJECTIVES 9. One of the Governrnent's key goals for 2011 is to build the foundations for a stronger economy. The Government has therefore outlined several objectives, inclucling building savings and investment in New Zealancl. The Prime Minister has signalled the intention to focus Budget 20l l on measures which will boost national saving, by encouraging additional saving from private individuals and through Government efficiency savings. Further information on these objectives was providecl in the Prirne Minister's Statement to Parliament on 8 February 201 t8: Building Scntings and \[nvestment: \[n order to reduce our clependence on .foreign lenders, Nevv Zealctnd neecls to build up the pool o.f Kiwi-owned savings and int¡estment, held by both the Government ctnd everyday New Zeulctnders.

The objectives for any changes to l(wiSaver are: o to help retum the Crown to surplus sooner by reducing the fiscal costs of I(iwiSavere, and o to continue to encourage increased levels of private household savings, and a long- term savings habit and asset accumulation, in order to increase well-being and financial independence in retirement. I 1' Each of the options for change that could meet one or more of these objectives was assessed against a matrix of criteria: o impact on national savings, which was measured as the effect on the Net International Investment Position (NIIP) over ten years o fiscal costs/fiscal savings . economic impacts, such as the likely effect on labour costs ancl hence employer costs and profitability o social welfare and clistributional impacts on those on the lowest income . alignment with the broader l(iwiSaver framework and objective. 12' In making this assessment, the strongest weight was given to measures which reduced fiscal costs, in light of earlier advice from the Treasury that reducing the defrcit sooner is the most impoftant contributor to national saving. Actditional weight was also given to options that did not threaten other aspects of the economic well-being, such as employment, or the social welfare of those on the lowest income. Further analysis of each option, including variations and dependencies between the options, is cliscussed below. 13. On a practical level, attention was also quickly directed towarcls options for change that could be developed in the immediate and short term, given the tight time-frames for delivery in Budget 2011, Certain options were therefore not taken forward, or further consideration within a longer time-frame was recommended, as the necessary consultation and irnplementation work coulcl not be clelivered within the timescale of this Budget.

Treasury and Inlancl Revenuue officiials providecl support to the SWG. Other policy reports were received by Ministers regarding KiwiSaver's role in the overall savings package. 16. A large number of potential changes to l(wiSaver have been discussed iin the public arena over the last five months because of the SWG review, such as thre KiwiSiaver clefault provider arrangements, managernent of funds, consulner financial literæcy, and provicler fee sttuctures. Some potential options for change were considered by the S\\l/G and are discussed in their interim and final report. Some of their recommenclations are witlhin the remit of other Govemment clepartments; for example, the Ministry of Economic Dexøelopmentt3 recently issuecl a discussion document regarding periodic reporting. l7' This RIS does not replicate all of the discussions about potential oprtions forr changes to I(iwiSaver that have been considered. Insteacl, it summarises officjials' aclvice on the developmeut of a preferred package of feasible changes, assessecl againsü the criteria outlined in paragraph 11, to cleliver the Governrnent's objectives for Budget z0ll. t 8. The options considered in more cletail in cleveloping this preferrecl parckage !v,,€re: Key objective: Recluce the fiscal costs of KiwiSaver . Changing KiwiSaver incentives and entitlement rules: memben'tax creclits (MTCs), initial Crown contribution ("kick-stafi"), ancl employer supemlÌnuationr contribution tax (ESCT) exemption. Seconclary objective: Encourage increasecl levels of private hou¡sehold saving . Increasing membership of l(wiSaver, including some form of curmpulsiton . Increasing contributions frorn existing members . Increasing contributions from employers. 19' In exploring the options uncler each objective, the clirectional'effect on the other objective hacl to be considered. For example, an increase in l(iwiSaver r.rrembership woulcl, in the short term, increase the atnount of "kick-start" payments macle ancl, in the longel term, increase the numbers clairning MTC, An increase in members' contribtution levels coulcl also lead to increased MTC payments; so although both changes might inclrease pri,vate savings, they would move against the objective of reducing the fiscal costs of I(iw¿iSaver. 20. For most optious, there were a number of potential variations. S'onle options were inter- clepenclent, while others were consiclered as cornplementary but indepøndent. Mar-ry of the options consiclered had several sub-variations; for example, varying cnntributlion rates per contributor, or re-sttucturing incentives such as the kick-start ancl memli,,er tax creclit amounts and entitlernent/payment mechanisrns. The rnain variations that were explored are cliscussed uncler each option below. t3ivtEODiscussion Paper,PeriotlicReportingRegulutions.forRetuil KiwisuverScherrzes,re\[easrr:d 0Il\]2l2tl0. KiwiSaver options explorecl Reducing Jìscul costs by chungìng KíwíSuver subsidìes: Generctl 21. One of the biggest impacts the Govemment can have on national savings is by returning to a budget surplus as quickly as is reasonably possible. An effective way to achieve this is by cutting low-value frscal spencling. Under the curent I(iwiSaver settings, there are opportunities to achieve lower fiscal costs while having minimum impact on encouraging household saving. In order to recluce the fiscal costs of I(iwiSaver, the various subsidies must either be reduced or removecl, whether for all members or through more direct targeting of subsidies to particular member groups. 22. Government contributious to KiwiSaver through direct subsidies (kick-start and MTCs) and forgone tax (ESCT exemption) total over $1 billion per annum; this is estimatecl at about 40o/o of total contributions in 2009/10. The current settings mean that Govemment contributions will make up a significant ptoportion of individual I(iwiSaver balances at retirement. Empirical evidence suggests that this expenditure is clelivering poor value in tenns of leveraging additional savings. Some of the savings going into l(iwiSaver accounts are being divertecl from other forms of saving rather than additional saving. Also those individuals saving towarcls a target level of income in retirement may reduce their own level of saving in response to Government contdbutions, since they can achieve the sarne f,rnal accumulations at less expense to themselves. Genuine additional private saving may therefore be as little as $29 for each $100 contributed by Government. 23. Although two thirds of members in the Cohnar Brunton survey citecl Govetnment subsiclies as one of the reasons why they joined l(iwiSaver, other features such as auto- enrolment, ease of contribution (cleductions from pay) ancl employer contributions were also importantta. The ESCT exemption, being relatively hidden, clid not feature in the survey responses. Clrangíng KiwíSaver subsìdíes: ùIember tøx credits 24. The Government cumently pays a member tax credit (MTC), up to a maximum of $1,042.86 ayear) into the account of members agecl over 18, which matches contributions rnade by the individual during the year. MTC payments for the year to 30 June 2010 totalled about $665 million. 25. Reducing the maximum annual MTC payment alone (i.e. without changing the matching rate) would provide imrnediate frscal savings. It woulcl also recluce the total accumulation in inclividual I(iwiSaver accounts, compared to leaving the MTC maxirnum atnount unchanged. However, other changes, such as increasing the matching rate or, notably, incteasecl ernployer contributions, will work in the opposite clirection to raise total accumulations. 26, The MTC is clesigned to encourage and rewarcl the clevelopment of a regulal pattern of savings once members have joined I(iwiSaver. However, the cument $ t to $ t matching rate is particularly generous by comparison with other savings options; it cloubtes the amount of contributions made (up to $1,042), effectively provicling a minimum 100% return on these contributions, l4 Col,nur Blunton Ki¡visrtver Evaltrcttiorr,op. cit, page 57. 27. MTCs are sirnple ancl relatively easy to aclminister because they are linkecl to the level of a metnber's contributions paid in a year rather than to the member's income. The cap ensutes that lower contributors, who tend to be lower income eamers, get a larger benefit proportionate to their contribution. The possibility of making a link between maximum entitlement, or matching rates, and a rnember's income (whether just active or active and passive income) was considered. However, the administrative reality is that any such link is not possible without prohibitively costly system changes, and even then woulcl take several years to implement. 28. The SWG suggested increasing MTC payrnents for those on lower incomes by increasing the matching rate to 52 MTC for each $1 member contribution, in order to increase the amounts received by those on lower incomes making lower contributions. However, as well as increasing the fiscal cost of the MTC this coulcl also have the effect of encouraging/enabling those on higher incomes to reduce their contributions, either by reducing their contribution rate or making fewer voluntary contributions (if self-employed) in order to maximise their MTC, 29. The converse matching position, f-or example 50c per $1 member contribution, should not lead to a reduction in contributions from those cumently contributing to the maximum MTC level, since they would still need to contribute the same to maximise the Government contribution. A reduction in the matching rate spreads the irnpact more broadly tl'ran reducing the cap alone, which would cleliver fiscal savings only in the case of KiwiSaver members contributir-rg above the level of the cap. The cap would fllean that the subsicly woulcl remain broaclly progressive, and still reflect a greater proportion of total I(iwiSaver inputs for low income earners than for highu income earners. Chunging IfiwíSaver íncentíves: Kìck-start 30. The $1,000 kick-start payment from the Crown is a highly successful o'recognition" feature for l(wiSaver; 92% of all responclents to the Colmar Brunton surveyts (both I(iwiSaver and non-l(iwiSaver rnembers) were aware of the kick-start. Fayments for the last 12 months to February 201 I totalled $354.6m. 31. With a projected increase in KiwiSaver membership of approximately 300,000 members over the next four years, there would be f,rscal savings to be rnade in removing or reducing the kick-start incentive. However, this could damage l(iwiSaver's attractiveness to uew members. There is a strong psychotogical boost attachecl with such an early initial increase in a tnember's tìnds ancl, on balance, the potential clamage to public perception and to the initial attractiveness of Kiwisaver outweighs the diminishing value of fiscal savings made by reducing or rernoving the iconic kick-star.t payment. 32' The Savings Working Group recommended a gradual 'clrip-feecl' of kick-start paytnents, to be matcl-red to members" contributions. However this would have minimal effect on costs, reduce the immecliate psychological boost of a $\[,000 incentive and woulcl effectively rnake this payment a duplication of MTCs, which are intencled to encourage regular contributions. t5 ibi,l, png" 3. ü0) 33. Removing or detaying payment of the kick-start to those uncler eighteen was also considered. The 2010 tîwisaver Evctlucttion, conducted by Inland Revenue's Evaluation Servicel6, identifiecl that among those parents who had enrolled their children, the Government kick-start contribution \\,vas the most colnmon reason providecl; 83 percent said this was a factor in enrolling their children, while 34 percent said this was the most impoftant factor in their decision. However, the value of accounts for most under eighteens is relatively low; a large numbers of children's accounts appear to holcl nothing more than the $1,000 kick-start, indicating that this practice is cloing little or nothing to raise private savings ancl encourage a savings habit via I(iwiSaver. 34. There are therefore potentially some fiscal savings from clelaying the payment of the kick-start for under-eighteens, for example, until their eighteenth birlhday. However, such a change would add to the complexity of l(iwiSaver, ancl yet the overall fiscal savings are likely to be minimal. Any I(wiSaver changes targeted at only this age group should form part of any wider consideration of how to boost savings levels for young people, and install good savings habits from a young age. Chunging IfiwiSaver íncentíves: Employer superøn,xuøtìon contríbution tax exemptíon 35. Ernployer contributions (cumently up to 2o/o of employee remuneration) to employee KiwiSaver accounts and complyir-rg superannuation funds are presently exernpt from ESCT. The exemption is estimated to cost the Government about $l75million a year in revenue forgone.36. The Savings Working Group recommencled that the existing exemption from ECST be removed; by its nature it is ahnost invisible to I(iwiSaver members, and so is the least-value of the incentives in terms of raising levels of private saving. It is also the rnost regressive of the I(iwiSaver subsidies, since those in higher tax bands get a proportionately greater benefit; 50 percent of the benefit goes to the top 15 percent of earners. Officials also recommend removing this exemption on similar grounds. 37, As part of removing the exemption, however, consideration should be given to how ESCT is computed on employers' contributions. The legislation currently gives two main methods to calculate ESCT. The default rnethocl allows ernployers to decluct ESCT at a flat rate of 33% from eligible superannuation contributions, while the "progressive scale" method allows lower ESCT rates to be appliecl to employers' superannuation contributions in relation to each inclividual's previous year's salary, wage ancl sLlperannuation contribution levels. 38. lnland Revenue's administrative clata is insufficient to iclentify which methods are usecl by ernployers. However, although it is recognisecl that the default rnethod is sirnpler for employers to apply ancl so reduces compliance costs, it does mean that lower-income employees who are affectecl will be more heavily taxecl than they woulcl be the case comparecl to the "progressive scale" methocl and compared to the rate at which their salary or wages are taxed. This results in less money going into their superalìnuation accounts. 39. It is tlierefore proposed to require alI ernployers to use the progressive scale systern at the same time as removing the ESCT exemption. This shoulcl not be a particularly difficult change for ernployers using commercial payroll systems that already have this functionality. l6 K¡tvisctvcr Evuluution Repon2010,\[nlanrl Rcveuue Evaluation Selviccs, t'or lnlanct Revenue, lvf inistryolEconornic Developrncnt ancl \[-\[ousirrg Ner.v Zealancl Cor¡ror.ation, Septernber 20 10, page 12. For ease, the timing of the change should be matchecl to the annual payroll cycle ( I April 2012). Employers prepaling rnanual payrolls will need to inclucle an additional calculation for ESCT when calculating KiwiSaver contribution amounts. Inland Revenue guidance, calculators and calculation tables will be available to assist with this. Encourage increased levels of private household saving Increasing membersltip: Compulsory versus voluntary 40. SWG and Government officials considered the impacts of KiwiSaver becorning a compulsory scheme. Variations included compulsion for employees only, with compulsory contributions deducted from pay; compulsion for all eligible adults; or compulsion for aclults over a ceftain age or fi'om a particular incorne level. This would also require changes to the cument settings for "contribution holiclays". The point of compulsion woulcl otherwise be negated by the ability of members to choose not to contribute. Issues regarding market fees and investment strategy would need to be fully resolved in advance of any element of compulsion being introducecl, 41. The present lGwiSaver model, although available to non-employees, is primarily rnarketed ancl designecl as a rvork-based voluntary superannuation savings scheme. For a universal enrolment, as well as new enrolment mechanisms for those outsicle the employed workforce, new contribution rnodels would neecl to be introducecl to require ancl collect savings contributions fi'om non-employecl persons. Sirnilar issues arose if compulsion was linked solely to age or income levels. 42. Cornpulsion for all employees, building on the existing I(wiSaver design, woulcl therefore be more ptactical than a univelsal enrolment. It is estimated that KiwiSaver membership would increase b1'an estirnated 730,000; the impact on national savings depends in part on other KiwiSaver serttings, such as the contribution rate and Crown incentives, but would be expected to be positive. 43. However Inland Revenua and officials frorn the Treasury consicler that these benefits I(iwiSaver need to be weighed against the welfare costs for people at the lower end of the income clistribution scale, who may be forced to recluce their spending on essential items in the present time in order to increase their income in retirement. The SWG considered the same point, and referrecl to thi,c in their report as "timing costs".t7 44. The SWG also noted that compulsion to save into l(iwiSaver has a "portfolio cost'\] in that it f'orces some people to invest in superannuation when they would rather invest in sornething else, such as housitrg, an enterprise business, or in a savings scheme that provides earlier access to funcls, such as for eclucation purposes. The Retirement Commission also recommended against compulsion. | 8 45. Treasury modelling also indicates that, following compulsion, 30 percent oî any new savings would be expectecl to come flrorn 60 percent of new mernbers, each earning less than $40,000. This suggests that the increase in national saving is unlikely to be justified by the negative irnpact ou present welfare for such low eamers, who are themselves unlikely to value the benefits in terms of increasecl consurnption later over decreasecl consumption now. l7 SWC' Suvitrg New Zertkutrl,op. cit. ¡rar.a 7.33. l8 http://ruw\*.retiretnent.org.nzlr'etilernent-incorne-resealoh/policy-review/20 l0-review. t2 46. Linking compulsion f'ot employees to wage levels or age were possible variations uncler this option that might have helpecl to alleviate some of the concerns over both "timing costs" and "portfolio costs" for savers. However, these variations would acld to the complexity of ICr,viSaver, and create additional compliance requirements for employers. 47. On balance, the modest increase in national savings that could be expected from introducing compulsion was outweighecl by the harmful welfare impacts on some groups of people, ancl the increase in fiscal costs if the l(iwiSaver subsidies were retained, even in a reduced form, Further, a move towards compulsion now was unlikely to be able to be readily reversed in future if it no longer aligned with the Government's longer term savings and investment plans. Increusing membershíp: enrolment exercìse (with optìon to opt out) 48. Some increase in I(iwiSaver membership could neveftheless still be delivered through existing mechanisms, if the increase is targeted to attract the people most likely to continue to contribute. Employees are the prime rnarket; behavioural analysis inclicates that there is a strong "inertia" factor for contributions by this group, which is assistecl by the automatic cleduction of contributions frorn source. 49. lnland Revenue comrnissioned Colmar Brunton to unclertake a survey to assess the outcomes of l(iwisaver for individuals. Colmar Brunton reported in July 2010'0. Inter alia, the survey asked respondents why they hacl not become members of l(wiSaver:28Yo had not got round to joining, while a fbrther 130lo wanted more information about I(iwisaver. This could indicate that, of the employecl population who are not alreacly members of l(iwisaver, over a third would not be averse to joining ancl so would be likely to remain a member if automatically enrollecl by their employer. 50. Officials therefore considered a one-off enrolment for all employees who are not already members of l(iwiSaver or a complying superannuation scheme. The exercise would provide employees the option to opt out before being enrollecl in l(wiSaver by their employer. Such an exercise was estimated to deliver up to 330,000 new members. This differs from the SWG recommendation of a one-off exercise using the current auto-enrolment process, by avoiding the significant compliance ancl administration costs for employers to rnake deductions from wages, which are later refunded by Inland Revenue where ernployees subsequently opt out. Even so, there would be costs to employers, both in running the exercise ancl in increased employer contributions for new mernbers. 51. Such an increase in I(iwisaver population would also significantly increase the fiscal costs, both in the short tetm through higher kick-start payrnents ($330 million in the f,rrst year) and ongoing through the MTC (arouncl $100 miltion per year), Given the key objective to recluce f,tscal costs, this was not regarcled as the appropriate time to consider running such an exercise. 52, The SWG suggested that the immediate irnpact of tl-re increased kick-start payments could by managed down by spreading payrnent over five years. However, this would have a limitecl effect on the overall ftscal cost and woulcl have negative incentive irnpacts, The $1,000 kick-start is highly successtul 'recognition' feature for l(iwiSaver; 92o/o of all respondents to the Cohnar Brunton survey20 (both I(wiSaver ancl non-KiwiSaver members) lt) Col,no, Brurrton Kiwisrtver Evctluutictn, op. ci: 20 ibi,l. png" 3 l3 were aware of kick-start, cornpared to only 58% who knew about member tax credits (MTCs). The spreacling method would have to be applied to all new rnernbers, not just those enrollecl as part of the exercise; it would therefore reduce the attractiveness of the kick-start payrnent in encouraging members to join in future, Increasìng contríbutíons: íncreusing deføult contributíon røte for uuto-enrolled employees 53. The "default contribution ratd' is the rate at which employees who are automatically enrollecl into I(iwiSaver by their employers will start contributing, unless they actively choose a rate. The default rate now stancls atZYo of wages. However, of those joining before 1 April 2009, when the default employee contribution rate was 4o/o,75 percent of members are still contributing at least 4o/o; that is, they did not take advantage of the introduction of the 2o/o miuimum rate from 1 April 2009. Only 20 percent of members joining on or after 1 April 2009, when the default rate',vas se| aIT%o, have actively chosen a higher rate. 54. Thus, for many rnembers, the default rate at which they start making I(iwisaver contributions governs the level of on-going contributions ("set and forget"). However, those employees who have chosen to move to a lower contribution late have tended to be lower- income. This suggests that affordability does have some influence, since the cap on Government contributions means that incentives are already stronger for low income members to contribute at above-minimum levels; and that 4Yo may be too high for some members. Increøsing contributíons: ìncreasìng compulsory employer contríbtttíon rute 55. Cornpulsory ernployer contributions both increase individual final accumulations ancl, especially if rnatched to employee contributions, are a strong way to encourage individuals to save towards retirernent, Witli the exception of higher-paicl executives where retirement contributions are a key part of a total remuneration package, rnany employees clo not traditionally regard their ernployerso contributions as deductions tiom "their" wages, even though the additional cost to employers fi'om making contributions is likely eventually to find its way through to lower wages (ir-rcluding for those not members of KiwiSaver). 56. At present, the minimum employer contribution is ZYo of employee wages. The rate was originally set at lo/o with the intention that this should increase by I percentage point each yeal until it reached 4o/o, bur. it lvas capped at 2o/o in 2008. Internationally, employers traclitionally contribute at much higher levels; for example, the Australian scheme involves an employer oontribution rate of 9%, 57. \[u contrast to ernployee contributions, where many employees are contributing above the 2o/o minimum rate, 90 percent of ernployer contributions are macle at 2o/o. A requirement for ernployers to raise their minimurn contribution woulcl therefore make a fairly signif,rcant impact on total Kir,viSaver accumulations. 58. Higl-rer employer contributions would increase labour costs in the short term. A delayed or staged introcluction of an iucreasecl minimurn rate for employer aontributions (either with or without an etnployee matchiLrg requirernent) would better enable employers to prepare for and manage these changes alongsicle other business costs. In the longer term higher contributions are likely to be reflected in lower wage settlements, hut this impact should be limited as the labour market ancl nominal wage growth are expected to strengther-r fi'om the encl of 201 I . l4 59. tf the requirement were that ernployets should raise their own contributions only where ernployees contribute above the minimum rate, it would reinforce the incentive for ernployees to raise, or maintain, their own contribution rates. However, the well-clocumented power of inertia raises the risk that many employees woulcl still take no action and leave contribution rates unchanged even though they could afford and woulcl derive greater benefits from a higher rate. Where subsidies are reduced as set out above, such employees, who are most likely to be in the lower income bracket, would see reductions in both their ernployer contributions (because of removal of the ESCT exemption) and in the Govemrnent's MTC contribution. Making the increased employer contributions dependent on voluntary action by individual members may therefore mean that rnany lower-income members see no inclividual benefit. \[ncreusìng co ntributío ns : íncreasìng mìnim ttm employee co ntrìb utío n rüte 60. Increasing the curent minimum employee contribution rate would increase the amounts of employee savings. It would also move some way to address the risk that the current 2o/o minimum and clefault rate setting sencls the wrong message regarcling the appropriate level of savings that individuals shoulcl be making in order to provicle an adequate retirement income. 61. Tl-ris must be weighed against the "timing costs" for people at the lower end of the income distribution scale. A higher minimum contribution effectively increases the price of contributing to l(wiSaver. People who cannot afford to contribute a revisecl minimum would be forcecl onto contributions holidays or never join in the first place, thus missing out on Government and employer contributions. So a very sharp inclease in the minirnum contribution rate may not deliver very much by way of additional householcl savings. 62. Allowing an adclitional 3Yo employee contribution rate, between the existing 2% minimum and the next optional contribution rate of 4Yo could be a helpful option for some members. Matching employer conttibutions at higher rates would reinforce the incentive for employees to contribute more where they can, and help to ensure that there is little rnovernent frorn employees the other way (that is, downwards to 3%). However, the risk of down- shifting may not actually be very high, given that employees on 4o/o akeady have the option to reduce their contribution rates, and the adclitional cost to employers may not tl'rerefore be justifiable. The additional costs to both Inland Revenue and ernployers of introducing this fuither option would be very moclest, as woulcl be the introcluction of furthel contribution rates, f'or example 5Yo,6Yo etc. 63. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the individual l(iwiSaver member there is a strong ir-rterest in keeping the scheme as sirnple and clear as possible; and in serving the interests of those who take no action. The adclition of further options which require active clecision making on the part of members and which many are likely to ignore anyway, even though they could benefrt from them, woulcl work against that objective. Members who are keen to engage rnore fully can always make voluntary contributions to increase their final accumulations ancl (for those on lower incomes) Member Tax Credit receipts. l5 \[ncreusirtg contributiotts: ntinor chutge optiorts 64, Other more minor change options tl-rat were consiclered but not recommendecl f'or the Buclget 201 I package are summarised below: Option Lowering rninimurncontribution rate to lo/, Comment Consideled alongside cornpulsion.

The SWG tnade several recommenclations in tliis regard, which have been discussed above. 67. The SWG received consiclerable public feedback during the process; the submissions it receivecl ancl its interim anci final reports are available on the Treasury website. Officials have been able to view these subrnissions and listen to specifìc concerns r?ìised by interested groups cluring the SWG process, albeit that there has been no aotive consultation by oFficials. 68.

Officials have recommended that the proposed changes to the ESCT and the Member. Tax Credit should be included in Budget night legislation which will go through all the stages in the House in a single Parliamentary day. This is to allow suffìcient time for implernentation, both for employers ancl Inland Revenue. 75. The removal of both the ESCT exemption and the 33%:o flaI-rate calculation method would come into effect on 1 April 2012. This is to tie in with the starl of the tax year and so take advantage of the various updates to payroll systems and employer information leaflets that are alreacly schecluled to be macle at that date. 76. The proposed changes to reducing the MTC matching rate to 50c per $l mernber contribution, and reclucing the maximum annual MTC payment to $52 L43 (half of the present level), would take place with effect from I July 2011, being the 20l1lI2MTC claim year. Most MTC claims are macle after the year-end, which gives providers and Inland Revenue ovet 12 mouths to prepare for the changes before the bulk of the 20l|ll2 payments are macle. As the proposed changes clo not directly affect the claims process, the cornpliance costs would be expected to be relatively minirnal. 77 . The proposed increase to 3Yo for the compulsory ernployer contribution rate and for the default and minimum employee contribution rates would come into effect on 1 April 2013. Tl-re delayed start of this change means that it can be inclucled within a normal taxation bill, enabling interested parties to be consulted on design aspects, 78. The proposals fot a one-off enrolment exercise would be cliscussed with employers, payroll providers and other interestecl pafties. This would explore both the expected costs and benefits to each party, ancl possible design rnoclels for such an exercise. TVIONITORING, EVALUATTON AND REVIEW 79.

Regulatory Impact Statement Simplifying filing requirements for individuals and record-keeping requirements for businesses Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The problem that this statement addresses is the increasing number of contacts with taxpayers that Inland Revenue is required to process. Along with an increase in volume, there has been an increase in the complexity of these contacts. This statement provides an analysis of options to transform the way in which Inland Revenue delivers its services and with a view to reducing contacts. A major focus of the policy project has been to examine ways in which Inland Revenue can administer its responsibilities in a more efficient manner. The proposed approach adopts electronic services as the main method of service delivery and seeks to reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals. The increase in contacts has been driven by a number of policy settings, such as the requirement for social policy recipients to file a tax return. Also driving this increase is the current ability for certain taxpayers to access refunds of over-deducted PA YE without having the reciprocal requirement to pay under-deducted PA YE. Although the proposals are intended to reduce these contacts, the extent to which they do this can be established only once they are made operational. The most significant dependency of the analysis is the ability of Inland Revenue to deliver significant operational change, particularly given its commitment to other major changes such as student loan redesign and the child support review. The design and information technology commitments to these two projects mean that there is limited ability for Inland Revenue to deliver other initiatives in the short to medium term. As a consequence, design and implementation of the proposals would be staggered from July 2011, with full implementation occurring 1 April 2015. The analysis summarised in this document has been the subject of public consultation via a Government discussion document and associated online forum, Making tax easier, released in June 2010. The proposals have been developed in light of the feedback received, and they strike a balance between the concerns raised in the submissions and the efficiency of tax administration. As the proposals were developed, more focused consultation was carried out with key selected stakeholders and interest groups. This feedback was also reflected in the policy design. The recommended policy proposals are intended to reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals. They do not impair private property rights, although one of the proposals may reduce the net amount of refunds. They may also affect the business of the personal tax intermediary market, as one of the proposals will impact on the current business model used by these firms by reducing the net amount of refunds by requiring returns to be squared across four years. The recommended do not override fundamental common law principles. Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 25 July 2011 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The problem that this Statement addresses is that Inland Revenue's increasing number of contacts with taxpayers and the resulting processing is creating pressure on the administration of the tax system. The increase in contacts is due in part to the expansion of Inland Revenue's responsibilities into social policy administration through initiatives such as KiwiSaver, student loans. Working for Families tax credits and child support. Businesses and individuals find tax processes time-consuming and uncertain. 2. At a high level, the underlying causes of the problem can be categorised as the following: • Lack of certainty, due in large part to frequent changes to the tax rules: Although this is generally due to changes in Government policy, and is typically accompanied by public consultation, the frequency of tax changes has led to substantial increases in the number of taxpayers who require assistance from Inland Revenue. • Meeting the expectations of taxpayers: As the volume of tax returns and queries increases with changes to policy and the expansion of Inland Revenue's responsibilities, service delivery standards necessarily come under pressure. This expansion has also increased the expectations that taxpayers have of Inland Revenue. Because of the heavy reliance on paper (with around 26 million letters per year being sent to taxpayers), Inland Revenue's response times have come under pressure. • System integrity: Inland Revenue's FIRST computer system has been substantially added to and modified as a result of policy change, which has added to the pressure on the core strengths of New Zealand's tax system. It is integral to taxpayer trust that tax administration systems do not fail. 3. These problems are exacerbated by: • Inland Revenue's systems are designed to be as accurate as possible with minor variations generally netting out over time. For PA YE, deductions are based on current rates, and the annualising of the pay amount for individual pay periods may be out of line with individuals' annual income tax liabilities on their employment income (ignoring social assistance) in various situations. However, for PAYE, refunds can occur in a number of circumstances such as: o when individuals enter employment part way through the year, o have PAYE deducted at the non-declaration rate because they have not yet obtained an IRD number and tax code, o have deductions made at the incorrect code for whatever reason (including employer error), o change jobs during a year at different rates of pay, o have lumpy income (those in part time or casual employment based on hourly pay rates, where the amount may vary considerably from pay period to pay period), o hold more than one job at a time, o receive extra pays, and o do not earn uniform amounts of employment income in each pay period throughout a full tax year, for whatever reason, when personal tax rates change during the year. • Large numbers of individuals self-select to file an income tax return or receive a personal tax summary (also known as an income statement) in years in which they are due a credit. This has resulted in a significantly increased workload for Inland Revenue as people re-enter the annual filing system. This is in large part due to the ability of taxpayers to choose to file only when they are due a refund and not in years when they have tax to pay. • The graph below shows the increase in customer-requested personal tax summaries. In 2004, it took 60 months (from the close of return period) for the volume of self-selected personal tax summaries to reach 200,000. In 2008, it took only 14 months to reach this level. Cumulative volumes of customer-requested PTS refunds - as at end Aug 2010 400,000 350,000 300.000 100,000 50,000 250,000 200,000 150,000 '—•—2D04 relp\] -•-2005 relp . 2006 relp . i-K- 2007 relp I—X—2008 relp i 2009 relp • —I— 2010 relp i month\* from close of return period • The ability for some taxpayers to access refunds of over-deducted PAYE, but not pay their under-deducted PAYE, has resulted in a situation where large amounts of revenue are being paid out, without a reciprocal obligation on taxpayers to pay potential shortfalls as evidenced in the graph below. 2 Cumulative value $M (excluding WFF) of customer-requested PTS refunds months from close of ratum period -160 —•—2004 relp -•-2005 relp; -w- 2007 relp -•-2008 relp —•—2009 relp —f—2010 relp 2006 relp 1 0 • The requirement of people who interact with social policy programmes to file a tax return has also contributed to the increase in the volume of contacts. For example, large numbers of Working for Families tax credits recipients are required to file an income tax return because they receive these tax credits. However, all that is needed to assess their entitlement is their income and family details, rather than the amount of tax they have paid. • Electronic filing needs to be streamlined to remove the barriers that are currently discouraging businesses and individuals from using it. Specifically, some of the barriers that we can address immediately are: o A person who carries on business or derives income in New Zealand must also keep sufficient records in New Zealand. This is a problem for the increasing number of taxpayers who are choosing to use payroll or accounting software that uses offshore data storage. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue's discretion to exempt this requirement only extends to a "person", and this means that each individual needs to seek the exercise of discretion. Requiring individual applications for exemption is increasingly impractical given the rise in use of offshore data storage. o When information in a taxpayer's return has been provided to Inland Revenue electronically, the taxpayer is required to retain a paper copy of the information for seven years. Similarly, other information that is submitted electronically also needs a hard-copy transcript. To ensure consistency with policy objectives in the Electronic Transactions Act 2002, which in essence provides that the existence of readable and reliable electronic copies would satisfy a requirement to retain paper copies, this requirement needs to change. 3 4. The proposals have also been developed in light of submissions received on a Government discussion document and online forum, Making tax easier, which was released in June 2010. OBJECTIVES 5. The desired Government outcome is to have a tax administration that delivers value-for- money services and is sufficiently flexible to change and grow. This is in line with the Government's six economic policy drivers, one of which is a world-class tax system. 6. The options have been assessed against the following objectives: (1) they reduce tax compliance obligations for individuals and/or businesses, (2) they facilitate a move to using electronic services as the main form of service delivery by Inland Revenue, and (3) they are fair and equitable. 7. The move to electronic services is important because it is Inland Revenue's preferred method of delivery to deal with the increasing number of contacts with taxpayers. These services are in line with the expectations of taxpayers and would increase Inland Revenue's agility and flexibility. They would also potentially decrease the number of contacts, and make those contacts quicker and easier to deal with and lead to efficiency savings in the future. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 8. Two streams of policy initiatives have been developed to address the policy problems outlined above. These two streams can be broadly broken down into those that relate to individuals and those that relate to businesses. 9. Our preferred options are: Individuals • Require taxpayers who self-select to file an annual return (either an IR 3 or PTS) to be squared up across the previous four income tax years (Option 3). • Remove the requirement for Working for Families tax credit recipients to file an income tax return (Option 5). • Amalgamate the two major income tax return forms (that is the IR 3 and the PTS) and replace them with one consolidated web-based income tax return form (Option 7). • Move to the use of electronic services as the primary mode of service delivery, using a phase-in approach (Option 11). Businesses • Allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to authorise, and also revoke permission for, certain "classes of persons" to keep their records outside of New Zealand (Option 13). • Remove the requirement for taxpayers who submit electronic returns or information to Inland Revenue to retain paper copies (Option 14). 4 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to fde an income tax return 1. Make PA YE full and final at the point of deduction for employees in stable employment for 11 or more months in the year. • Taxpayers in stable employment for 11 or more months per year and who have PA YE over-deducted, would not be able to get the over-deducted PA YE refunded to Ihem. • Many taxpayers may disagree with this (as seen in consultation) mainly due to the potential for error in the PA YE system. • If there was an exemption from this rule for major over-deductions, this could be difficult to define and to administer. • Major administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue (528,000 people would be taken out of the annual filing system). See the Making lax easier discussion document, paragraph 7.10. • Gives certainty to taxpayers, as large numbers would not be required to file. • Taxpayers who have been sent tax bills for small amounts of under-deducted PA YE would no longer be required to pay these amounts. • Addresses the problem of cherry picking (filing only in the years in which one is due a refund) to an extent. • Will increase Crown revenue to a moderate extent, but moreso than Option 3. • Public consultation took place via the Making tax easier discussion document and online forum. • Feedback was generally against this proposal. Submitters felt that it was too arbitrary, and that taxpayers have a right to file a return and get any over- deductions refunded to them. • Feedback also argued that there is too much potential for over-deduction in the PAYE system, and as long as this is the case, this option should not be progressed. • 528,000 taxpayers would no longer be able to file a tax return at the end of the income year. • Moderate increase in Crown revenue. • Efficiency gains to Inland Revenue (due to lowered contacts). • Potential pressure from taxpayers for refunds could make this difficult to administer in a consistent way. • Difficulty in assessing what makes a major over- deduction. • Potential for employers to consistently under-deduct PAYE, leading to large-scale under-payment of PAYE and income tax. • May push some taxpayers out of the PAYE system and into receiving cash payments which are not subject to withholding tax payments. • System updates required. 2. Set a de minimis amount for refunds, below which refunds would not be paid out (e.g. $50). • Very difficult to set an acceptable level, as any amount of refunded PA YE may be valuable to taxpayers, especially those on low incomes. • Fairness and equity - any amount of over-deducted PA YE should be refunded to its rightful owner. • Simple to administer. • Recognises the cost and difficulty of processing large volumes of small-value refunds. • Counteracts the cost of processing these small refunds. • This option was suggested by several submitters in response to the consultation on Option 1 (above) in Making tax easier. • 327,000 taxpayers would no longer be able to file (see the Making tax easier discussion document, paragraph 7.6). • Results in some Crown savings. • Some potential for employers to under-deduct PAYE to the extent of the de minimis. • Increased contacts, as individuals try to confirm the amount of their return. • System updates required. 3. Require taxpayers who self-select to file to be squared up across the previous four years. • Removes the ability for taxpayers to file only in the years that they are due a refund (i.e. cherry pick), but arguably this is a fairer outcome. • Does not have the same degree of administrative • This option is the best at addressing the problem of cherry picking refunds. • Would result in presently unpaid terminal tax being paid or offset against refunds. • Requires taxpayers to • This option was developed in light of the responses received in the Making tax easier consultation. • Retains the ability for taxpayers to file a return if they wish to, something that came across in submissions • No taxpayers would be prevented from filing, but those that are not required by law to file, would need to file for the previous four years. • Results in some Crown savings (approx. $27 million • Communicating the change to taxpayers, particularly that the rule would be phased in over several years. • Minimising administrative pressure would depend on the uptake of electronic services being successful. 5 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to file an income tax return savings as Option 1 may have. • Initially, the amount of refunds being released may increase, as taxpayers would be required to square up in years that they may not have otherwise. choose either accuracy of tax paid, or administrative efficiency. • Results in Crown revenue savings of S66 million over ten years. as being important to taxpayers. per year). • Potential operational pressure of ensuring that all taxpayers who self-select also do so for the previous four years. • Potential for taxpayers to tTy to "game" the system by attempting to bring themselves within the requirements to file. • System updates required. • There may be confusion from a customer perspective about what their final tax position actually is. 4. Retain the status quo, regarding the filing requirements of individuals. • Allows taxpayers flexibility to file only in the years where they are due a refund (cherry pick). • Large numbers of taxpayers who do not have to file are doing so anyway, which has resulted in large numbers of taxpayers being brought back into the system unnecessarily. • This increase in taxpayers filing causes pressure on the system. • Taxpayers understand the current system. • Public consultation via the Making tax easier discussion document and online forum. • The feedback received was mostly concerned with the ability for taxpayers to file and get back any potential over-deductions, which is something this option provides. • No taxpayers would be precluded from filing. • Taxpayers would still be able to cherry pick refunds. • No revenue savings for the Crown and no efficiency gains to Inland Revenue. • Large pressures on the system and resources, which have been caused by significant increases in recent years of taxpayers self-selecting to file (taxpayers who are not required to file but choose to anyway). This has largely been facilitated by personal tax summary intermediaries (PTSIs). See graphs on pages 2 and 3. 5. Remove the requirement for Working for Families tax credits recipients to file an income tax return. • This group would not have to pay terminal tax in the years that they are under- deducted; however, they also would not be automatically refunded over-deductions. • If the customer wants an overpayment of PA YE refunded, they would now fall into the four-year square up criteria and have to elect into the system. • Reduces the tax compliance obligations for this group by giving them a choice of whether to file or not. • This group would not have to pay terminal tax in the years that they are under- deducted; however, they also would not be automatically refunded any over- deductions. • Potential for some revenue savings to the Crown of approximately $10 million • This option has not been the subject of public consultation. • This option takes into account the concerns raised about the other proposals relating to individual filing, such as the importance of being able to file a tax return and be refunded any potential over-deductions. • Officials have consulted with NZICA, which supports this proposal, as it • Approximately 260,000 taxpayers would no longer be required to file a tax return. • Results in efficiency gains to Inland Revenue, and a reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers. • Results in some revenue savings for the Crown (approx. $10 million per year). • Significant system changes required. • Minimising administrative pressure would depend on the uptake of electronic services being successful. • There is potential that people within this group of taxpayers may be over- deducted, and if they do not file, they would not be refunded. • However, since they are currently required to file, 6 Option Negatives Positives Consultation Net impact Implementation issues INDIVIDUALS Options for reducing the number of taxpayers required to file an income tax return per year • The exact amount of revenue savings will differ according to whether large numbers in this group continue to file. • Gives this group equality with other taxpayers, as they now have the choice to file. reduces tax compliance for this particular group. they would be familiar with the process, and many of them may choose to continue to file. • Managing people through the change in process. 6. Retain the status quo whereby all Working for Families tax credit recipients are required to file a tax return. • All Working for Families tax credit recipients would be sent tax returns, which would mean that they would be required to pay terminal tax in the years when they have PA YE under-deducted. • Filing a tax return is arguably unnecessary for the bulk of these people, as all that is needed to assess their entitlement is their income, not how much PAYE they have paid. • All Working for Families tax credit recipients would be sent tax returns, which would mean that they would automatically get their refunds in years when they are due them. • This option has not been the subject of public consultation. • All Working for Families tax credit recipients would still be required to file. • No efficiency gains, compliance cost savings or Crown revenue savings. • There are approximately 400,000 recipients of Working for Families tax credits. Sending these taxpayers assessments and tax returns adds to the administrative burden on Inland Revenue. 7. Amalgamate the two major income tax return forms (the Personal Tax Summary and the 1R3). • Having a short form personal tax summary is useful for people with uncomplicated tax affairs. • Results in less confusion about which form taxpayers are required to file. • Results in less duplication of processes, as both forms require a degree of maintenance. • This option has not been the subject of public consultation. • Officials have consulted with NZICA and some representatives from the PTSI industry. Both support this option as it would reduce confusion about which tax return form to use and reduce the amount of paper they deal with on behalf of their clients. • This should result in significant efficiency savings for Inland Revenue (approx. $6 million per year once fully implemented) and tax agents, and also potentially taxpayers. • Less confusion for taxpayers regarding which form to file. • As the form will be primarily web-based, it may not suit all taxpayers. However, a paper version will be available in limited circumstances. • Would only work in a predominantly electronic environment. • Any paper version of an amalgamated tax return would be long and unsuitable for sending out in large volumes. • There would need to be a paper version for taxpayers who cannot use the online version, but this would function as a back-up channel only. • Significant system changes required. 8.

The options have been developed in accordance with the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The initial consultation for these changes took the form of a June 2010 Government discussion document called Making tax easier. The discussion document outlined the potential new direction for Inland Revenue's delivery of services. It called for submissions from the public and was also accompanied by an online forum. 11. As the range of options were developed, officials engaged in more consultation as appropriate. As the consultation differed according to the particular proposal, a summary of the approach taken and the outcomes of consultation are outlined in the section on regulatory analysis. This format was also chosen in order to clearly show the impact that consultation had on the policy development, and the large extent to which the preferred options have been developed with the feedback in mind, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 12. For the options relating to individuals, the recommendations are those that best address the concerns detailed in the submissions received. For the options relating to employers, the recommendations are based on those that make the most administrative sense, and there has been consultation on these recommendations with the Software Developers Working Group. 13. Below is a table outlining the preferred options, and the key reasons why they are preferred: Option Key reasons 3 To require taxpayers who self- select to file to be squared up across the previous four income tax years • Best takes into account the argument, raised in submissions, that taxpayers should be able to claim amounts of over-deducted PAYE. • Reduces the number of contacts that Inland Revenue needs to process by consolidating the income tax return process. • Results in revenue savings. 5 Remove the requirement for Working for Families tax credit recipients to file an income tax return. • Reduces the compliance burden. • No sound policy reason to continue to require this group to file tax returns, given that the WFF tax credit process is now different to the income tax process. • Results in revenue savings. 7 Amalgamate the two major income tax return forms and replace them with one, consolidated, web-based form. • Results in less confusion for taxpayers regarding which form they should file. • Supported by NZICA and some representatives from the personal tax intermediary industry. • Significant step towards using electronic services as the main form of service delivery. 11 Move to the use of electronic services as the primary mode of service delivery, using a phase-in approach, • Takes into account the views raised in consultation, which were generally against mandating the use of electronic services. • Allows for taxpayers to be gradually moved across to electronic service with a minimum of disturbance. 13 Allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to authorise, and also revoke permission for, certain "classes of persons" to keep their records outside of New Zealand. • Extends existing policy (i.e. taxpayers can currently apply for an exemption to the current requirement to store records in New Zealand). • Simpler in an administrative sense, compared with requiring individual persons/businesses to make applications for an exemption. 14 Remove the requirement for taxpayers who submit electronic returns or information to Inland Revenue to retain paper copies. • Reduces compliance costs for businesses. • Consistent with the policy intent of the Electronic Transactions Act 2003, which treats electronic copies in a similar manner to that of paper. 12 IMPLEMENTATION 14. Implementation issues have been considered in the table under the regulatory impact analysis section of this statement. This is because the issues are many and varied, and are specific to each option. 15. For the implementation of these proposals, Inland Revenue has four major pressures: • addressing increasing demands for services • managing tight baseline funding • working with a computer system that has been substantially added to and modified • managing any move to a new platform. 16. The key goal is to manage these tensions while meeting Inland Revenue's current and future obligations. In particular, as a consequence of student loan and child support redesign project pressures, Inland Revenue is reassessing the impact of its capital position and capability requirements. 17. From the 2011/12 financial year, it is proposed Inland Revenue would take a strategic approach over a multi-year period to migrate taxpayers into the updated electronic environment. The initial work would include research to determine the mix of education, customer change management and awareness approaches that Inland Revenue would adopt. We would also work with third parties and customers to identify enhancements to our online services and products. 18. To mitigate the risk to the student loans and child support deliverables, we would propose that the application date for options 3, 5 and 7 be 1 April 2015 (the 2014/2015 income year). However, work would commence immediately on initial design work. As officials gain more understanding of the impacts of the other commitments, we would report back to Ministers on whether this application date can be brought forward. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 19. In general, the monitoring, evaluation and review of these proposals would take place under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves a post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, this would mean that these proposals would be reviewed at a time after the policy has had some time to work. Any changes that are needed to give the legislation its intended effect would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 13
Regulatory Impact Statement Tax treatment of profit distribution plans Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The problem addressed in the Statement is that the current tax treatment of profit distribution plans (PDPs) is inconsistent with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. The objective is to align the tax treatment of PDPs with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. This means there would be no opportunity to stream imputation credits, and shareholders would pay tax at their correct marginal tax rate on the distribution of bonus shares. The analysis assumes that the existing tax treatment applied to similar arrangements should also apply to PDPs, and that PDPs are being used only by listed companies. There are no other key gaps, assumptions, dependencies, significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the analysis. In June 2009, consultation on the tax treatment of PDPs was undertaken through a public issues paper. In May 2011, follow-up targeted consultation was undertaken on the draft legislative provisions for tax treatment of PDPs. As a result, alternative solutions for the tax treatment of PDPs were considered and are covered in this Regulatory Impact Statement. We have also consulted with the Treasury, who agree with our analysis. None of the policy options considered impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or override fundamental common law principles. Submitters have responded that the proposed solution may reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest since the status quo provides an effective way for a company to retain capital rather than pay out dividends. Submitters also responded that the proposed new tax treatment of PDPs would impose additional compliance costs on businesses and shareholders. However, the proposed new tax treatment of PDPs does not impose higher compliance costs than already incurred when a regular dividend is paid. Inland Revenue 1 August 2011 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The problem addressed by this Regulatory Impact Statement is that the current tax treatment of profit distribution plans (PDPs) is inconsistent with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. The current tax treatment of PDPs provides opportunities to stream imputation credits away from shareholders who cannot use them, towards shareholders who can use them. Secondly, shareholders may not be taxed on dividends at their personal tax rates. 2. A PDP is a scheme offered by companies whereby the company advises all its shareholders that they will be issued with bonus shares on a particular date. The shareholders are asked if they would like to have the company repurchase those bonus shares immediately after the shareholder receives them. If the shareholder does not elect to have some or all of their bonus shares repurchased, the default option is for the shareholder to retain the bonus shares. 3. The current tax treatment is that the bonus issue of shares under a PDP are treated as a non-taxable bonus issue and are therefore not subject to tax. Furthermore, the subsequent sale of the bonus shares on the market will not be subject to tax if the shareholder holds the shares on capital account. However, if a shareholder elects for the company to repurchase their bonus shares, the cash that they receive is treated as a dividend and is therefore subject to tax. Imputation credits may be attached to the cash dividend by the company and used to credit the tax payable by the shareholder. 4. In other similar arrangements where shareholders are given the choice of receiving cash or bonus shares, such as a dividend reinvestment plan 1 and a bonus issue in lieu 2 , the shareholder receives a taxable dividend whether they choose to receive the cash or shares. 5. Officials are aware of seven companies that have carried out PDPs in the past. In general these plans have been popular with publicly listed companies who have a large numbers of shareholders. However, we are aware of only one company that is currently carrying out PDPs. 6. PDPs are also popular because they are highly effective capital management tools. PDPs are successful at retaining capital because they benefit from lack of shareholder action. If the shareholder does not positively respond to the company and elect to have their bonus shares repurchased, the default position is for the shareholder to retain the bonus shares, thereby retaining capital in the company. If shareholders do not choose the cash option and as a result get bonus shares, they do not need to return these shares in their tax return. 7. The current tax treatment of PDPs provides an opportunity for imputation credits to be streamed, New Zealand resident companies can attach imputation credits to dividends paid to its shareholders, and shareholders can generally use the credits to reduce their tax payable in New Zealand. However, for some shareholders (such as foreign or tax exempt shareholders), imputation credits have little or no value as they can only be offset against taxable New ' A dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) is where a company provides all shareholders with a cash dividend, and then gives them the option of reinvesting their cash dividends in shares of the company. This can be advantageous for the company, allowing it to maintain a dividend payment policy, while providing an opportunity to increase cash retentions. DRPs are also convenient for shareholders as they are a method for shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends in a company at a lower cost and effort than purchasing shares on the market. If the shareholder does not make an election, the default option is to receive a cash dividend. 2 A "bonus issue in lieu" is a tax concept. It is a bonus issue of shares made under an arrangement where a company gives its shareholders a choice whether to receive a bonus issue or money or money's worth. Under a bonus issue in lieu arrangement, regardless of whether the shareholder chooses to receive bonus shares or money, they are subject to tax. 2 Zealand income. This creates an incentive to direct the credits to those shareholders who are best able to use them (a practice known as imputation credit "streaming"). Tax rules generally prevent imputation credit streaming. 8. Imputation credit streaming can take place under a PDP when shareholders self-select whether to redeem their bonus shares for a cash dividend, depending on whether or not they can utilise imputation credits that would be attached to a cash dividend. Those shareholders who are unable to utilise imputation credits, for example foreign or tax exempt shareholders, may elect to receive bonus shares that are non-taxable. As the bonus shares are non-taxable, imputation credits will not be attached, preserving the credits for shareholders who can best use them. This defeats the current policy settings for the imputation system. 9. The current tax treatment also raises issues related to equity. Under a PDP: • shareholders on personal tax rates higher than the company rate may not pay tax at their marginal tax rate on the distribution of the shares from the company; and • shareholders who are receiving social assistance may receive entitlements that they would not receive if the bonus shares were taxable. 10. The current tax treatment of PDPs was the subject of a specific Inland Revenue product ruling in 2005. This ruling was made subject to certain conditions, including that the company making the bonus issue has sufficient credits in its imputation credit account to have fully imputed a cash dividend equal to the bonus issue not redeemed. On 31 March 2009, that product ruling expired. 11. On 16 April 2010, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue announced that the Government would clarify the law to ensure that bonus issues of shares distributed under PDPs are taxed in the same way as shares issued under other dividend reinvestment plans. 12. If the current tax treatment is retained, the tax treatment of PDPs will remain inconsistent with other similar arrangements. In addition, no action in this area may encourage imputation credit streaming. 13. We estimate that retaining the status quo rather than adopting the recommended option would result in a fiscal loss of approximately $0.76m per annum. OBJECTIVE 14. The objective is to align the tax treatment of bonus shares provided under a PDP with the tax treatment of other similar arrangements. This is satisfied if the following two conditions are met: 1. PDPs are not able to be used to stream imputation credits There are tax rules that prevent imputation credits from being directed to shareholders who can best use them (streaming). 2. Equity Under current policy settings, a taxpayer's total annual income should be taxed at their personal tax rates under the progressive tax rate structure. In addition, all the income of taxpayers should be taken into account for social assistance purposes. 3 15. Alongside this objective, we have also taken into account compliance and administration costs. As far as possible, the compliance costs faced by taxpayers should be minimised. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 16. A number of options have been considered for the tax treatment of PDPs: • Option 1 (our recommended option): treat the bonus shares issued under a PDP as a taxable dividend. Shareholders would be taxed when they receive their bonus shares. If shareholders are required to file a tax return, they must include the dividend income in their return. • Option 2: treat the bonus shares issued under a PDP like a taxable dividend, and also give shareholders who are already required to file a tax return the option to include the bonus shares as a dividend in their return. • Option 3: require the company to debit its imputation credit account (ICA) when issuing bonus shares, and also pay a levy as compensation for shareholders that may be on the top marginal tax rate and who, as a result of this proposal, do not return the income and pay tax at their personal tax rate. The ICA would be debited at the maximum imputation ratio (ordinarily 28%) on the value of the bonus shares that are retained by recipient shareholders. The additional levy could be up to 5%. • Option 4: require the company to debit its ICA at the maximum imputation ratio (ordinarily 28%) with respect to the bonus shares that are retained by recipient shareholders, without requiring payment of an additional levy. • Option 5: retain the status quo. Shareholders who retain their bonus shares issued under a PDP are not taxed, while shareholders who redeem their bonus shares are treated as receiving a taxable dividend. 17. Option one was the option originally proposed by officials in the 2009 issues paper. In May 2011 legislation was drafted based on this option and sent out for targeted consultation. Options two, three and four arose from consultation with interested parties. 18. Officials' analysis of the options is summarised in the following table: Options Costs Benefits Conclusion One: treat bonus shares issued under a PDP as a taxable dividend. - Higher compliance costs than the status quo, borne by shareholders and the company. - May discourage capital raising when compared to the status quo, but not when compared to substitutable arrangements. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Equitable as it ensures shareholders are taxed at their personal tax rates. - Ensures substitutable arrangements are treated the same. - Fiscally positive. Recommended option Net impact: positive. Improvement on the status quo (equitable outcome, equivalent treatment with substitutes, and prevents streaming opportunities). However, does increase compliance costs. 4 Options Costs Benefits Conclusion Two: treat bonus shares as a taxable dividend and give shareholders an option to include bonus shares in their tax return. - Does not treat substitutable arrangements the same. - Income may not be counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. Not recommended Net impact: marginally positive. Improvement on the status quo (prevents streaming). However, results in inequitable outcome, and does not result in equivalent treatment with substitutes. Three: require company to debit ICA and pay an additional levy. - Does not treat substitutable arrangements the same. - Low rate shareholders are effectively taxed at higher rates. - Income is not counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Administratively complex because it is likely to require the creation of a new revenue item for Inland Revenue systems, and new forms/guides for the company. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Low compliance costs for shareholders. - Addresses fiscal concerns with shareholders not paying their personal tax rates on income. Not recommended Net impact: negative. High administrative costs, inequitable outcome, and does not result in equivalent treatment with substitutes. However, does reduce compliance costs for shareholders, and prevents streaming. Four: require company to debit ICA. - Does not treat substitutable arrangements the same. - Low rate shareholders are effectively taxed at a higher rate, and higher rate shareholders are taxed at a lower rate. - Income is not counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Fiscally negative: estimated at $7m revenue loss per annum. Costs borne by the Government. - Limits imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Low compliance costs for shareholders. - A cheap and effective way of raising capital, and because tax treatment is concessionary, companies may be encouraged to use PDPs in order to raise capital. Not recommended Net impact: negative. Inequitable outcome, fiscally negative, and does not result in equivalent treatment with substitutes. However, does reduce compliance costs for shareholders, and prevents streaming. Five: retain status quo. - There are imputation credit streaming opportunities. - Shareholders in similar arrangements are subject to more tax. - Bonus issues are not counted for social assistance purposes which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. - Estimated revenue loss of $0.76m per annum when compared to the recommended option - Low compliance costs for the company and its shareholders - A cheap and effective way of raising capital. Not recommended Net impact: negative. Maintains status quo (streaming opportunities, and inequitable outcome) 5 19. Option one is the recommended option. This option treats substitutable arrangements the same for tax purposes, and as such, it meets the key objective. As such, it prevents opportunities for imputation credit streaming, and it ensures that shareholders are taxed at their personal tax rates on distributions from the company. It addresses the concerns regarding social assistance because a shareholder must include the bonus shares issued under a PDP in their tax return. Option one (the recommended option) results in more revenue being raised when compared to the status quo. 20. Officials note that option one imposes higher compliance costs on shareholders and the company when compared to the status quo. However, these costs are no higher than if a cash dividend was paid. Therefore, we do not anticipate that this option would impose significant costs beyond those already being incurred in the normal course of business. This is because publicly listed companies generally already have mechanisms in place for withholding resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends 3 . If RWT is correctly deducted, a resident shareholder will not be required to file a tax return, simply because they receive a dividend under a PDP. A resident shareholder will only have to put the dividend in their tax return if they are already filing a tax return because, for example, they have income that has not had tax deducted at source (such as rents). For these shareholders, due to the rate of RWT on dividends, it is unlikely that the shareholders would face a tax liability as a result of the dividend. As such, we do not expect this to result in cash- flow problems for shareholders. 21. Although options two, three and four prevent opportunities for imputation credit streaming, they do not result in consistent treatment with substitutes and therefore do not tax shareholders at their personal tax rates. Therefore, these options are not recommended. They also raise concerns with social assistance entitlement, administrative simplicity and fiscal constraints. 22. Option five does not meet any of the objectives, and it also raises equity concerns. Therefore, this option is not recommended. 23. The economic, fiscal, compliance and social implications of the options are outlined in the table above. None of the options have environmental or cultural impacts. CONSULTATION 24. Officials have consulted interested parties in two formal rounds of consultation. 25. The first round of consultation was open to the public where officials released an issues paper in June 2009. The issues paper proposed to amend the definition of "bonus issue in lieu" to include shares issued under a PDP, so that they would be subject to tax. Six submissions were received in response to this issues paper. 26. The feedback received from the first round of consultation was generally negative. All six submitters opposed the change that was proposed. The key reasons were: • The form and substance of dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) and PDPs differ and the tax treatment should be determined by the form rather than the substance of the transaction. 3 NRWT is a final tax for non-resident shareholders. 6 • PDPs result in a high rate of retention of reserves. This outcome is good for New Zealand companies and the economy. Taxing the bonus issue of shares under PDPs would result in PDPs no longer being a viable mechanism to retain cash reserves. • The tax consequences of PDPs would become too complicated to explain to shareholders, particularly as a result of the inconsistency in the resident withholding tax (RWT) rate on dividends (33%) compared with the company tax rate and the maximum imputation ratio (generally 28%). • Relatively little weight should be placed on the concern that investors with marginal tax rates above the company rate benefit from a tax advantage. These taxpayers are equally able to reduce their tax liability by investing in a trust, portfolio investment entity or company and the medium-term Government policy is to move towards alignment. • The proposal to tax PDPs like a bonus issue in lieu could lead to double taxation. • Any potential fiscal cost would only be minimal, and the fiscally positive aspects of PDPs (such as additional tax revenue generated from the business operations) were not factored in. • It would be more appropriate to include PDPs in a wider review of imputation. 27. After the first round of consultation, the Capital Markets Development Taskforce (the Taskforce) reported, stating that it: ...considers it important that the tax system treats substitutable transactions neutrally. If PDPs are substitutable for ordinary dividend payments with optional reinvestment, the tax treatment should ideally be identical in both cases. The same goes for other close substitutes. Otherwise, there is a danger that investment decisions will be biased towards companies that offer PDPs, and that there could be significant loss of tax revenue from normal dividend taxation. At the same time, the Taskforce considers it desirable that the tax system does not impede the supply of capital. A decision on the tax treatment of PDPs should, therefore, take into account the fact that PDPs are an effective way for companies to raise capital. Recommendation: We recommend that changes to the tax treatment of PDPs should be made as part of a broader review of tax settings and take into account any adverse impacts on capital-raising costs. 28. Officials considered the Taskforce's report and agreed with their concerns around substitutability. Following this report, officials consulted on a solution that provided for a more consistent tax treatment across close substitutes. 29. Consequently we proposed treating bonus shares issued under PDPs like a taxable dividend. In May 2011, we began our second round of consultation by seeking comments on draft legislation, which would have treated bonus shares issued under a PDP in the same way as a taxable dividend. The draft legislation was sent to the six parties that had responded to the earlier round of consultation, as well as one other party who officials considered would be interested in the issue. 7 30. Several submitters provided feedback about the wording of the draft legislative provisions. This feedback would be taken into account in any drafting. 31. Some submitters also commented on policy matters. One submitter expressly supported the proposed change, and considered that shares issued under a PDP were the same as a taxable dividend for all practical purposes. Other submitters expressed concerns with the proposed tax treatment. The concerns that differed from the first round of consultation were: • A PDP is not a dividend because it does not involve a transfer of value. • There are other related inconsistencies in the tax acts that should be addressed, such as the RWT rules. • Additional consultation was needed. 32. In addition to these two formal consultation rounds, the Minister of Revenue has on a number of occasions announced the progression of work on PDPs, and officials have been involved in a number of discussions with interested parties. Options two, three and four arose out of those discussions. These three options, along with option five, would allow PDPs to continue to be viable and cost-effective capital raising tools. 33. The key argument made by submitters has been that the proposed change would increase compliance costs for companies and shareholders to the extent that PDPs would no longer be a viable mechanism to achieve retention of cash reserves. 34. We acknowledge that after the change in the tax treatment there may be higher compliance costs for shareholders and for the company. However, as already noted, we do not anticipate that these costs would be significant. 35. It should be noted that the compliance costs of the recommended option are no greater than those currently faced by companies that pay dividends. Companies paying dividends are already required to report this in their tax returns. Under current law, many shareholders can already choose to not file a tax return even when they receive taxable dividends. This will be the case, for example, where the only other income they are receiving is employment income, or interest or dividends that have had tax correctly deducted at source. Shareholders will generally be required to recognise dividend income in their tax return only if they are required to file for some other reason (for example, if they have income which has not had tax deducted at source, such as rents). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 36. Option one is the recommended option and involves treating the bonus shares issued under a PDP in the same way as a taxable dividend. This would ensure that substitutable transactions are treated the same way for tax purposes, opportunities for imputation credit streaming are minimised, and dividends are effectively taxed at the shareholders' personal tax rates. 37. Although many of the other options prevent opportunities for imputation credit streaming, they do not treat substitutable arrangements the same. They also raise other concerns, such as equity and fiscal concerns. 8 IMPLEMENTATION 38. It is proposed that the necessary legislative changes be included in the tax bill that is due to be introduced in September 2011, with application from a prospective application date after date of enactment. There would be no need to implement transitional rules. 39. If option one (the recommended option) is adopted, the new rules would be administered by Inland Revenue through existing channels. Companies would be required to recognise bonus shares issued under a PDP in their tax returns as a dividend paid out. Shareholders who currently file tax returns would be required to include the bonus shares issued under a PDP as dividend income in their tax returns. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 40. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves a post-implementation review of the legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. 9
Regulatory Impact Statement Tax minimum equity rules for foreign-owned banks Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options for updating the tax minimum equity rules for foreign- owned banks, to reflect changes in the commercial and regulatory banking environment, and ensure that the appropriate amount of tax is paid in New Zealand. The existing rules envisage regular review, taking into account changes in regulatory and market practice to ensure an appropriate allocation of equity and debt to New Zealand. Therefore, our analysis has been confined to a review of whether (because of changes in the regulatory and commercial environment) the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks should be raised from its current percentage, rather than an overarching review of the use of a tax minimum equity ratio. The analysis and consultation undertaken as part of our review has been subject to time constraints in order to meet Budget 2011 deadlines. In keeping with the established process in this area, consultation has been undertaken with the New Zealand Bankers' Association, and with some other individual banks. A key concern raised during consultation was that any increase in the minimum equity percentage should be made on a principled basis, and not merely to raise revenue. If this is not the case, it would imply that the percentage could be increased any time that the Government needed money. This perception would have ramifications for the financing structures that banks would use over the longer term and, therefore, on the cost of capital. The consultation undertaken has informed both the setting of the appropriate ratio and the transitional approach. We carried out our review in conjunction with the Treasury, and the Treasury supports our conclusions and recommendations. We also consulted the Reserve Bank of New Zealand throughout our review process. Their independent analysis of our modelling supports the conclusions we reach. Any increase in the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks would be likely to impose additional tax costs on foreign-owned banks. However, we believe that the increased tax costs are justified, as our analysis shows that the amount of tax currently being paid in New Zealand by foreign-owned banks does not fairly reflect the economic reality of their banking business in New Zealand. Moreover, these increased tax costs in New Zealand would be substantially offset by reduced tax costs overseas. There are also likely to be transitional costs for banks in restructuring their balance sheets (for example, by converting existing tax debt into tax equity) to meet the proposed requirements. However, ongoing compliance costs are minimised, as banks already have systems in place for monitoring their tax equity position under the current rules. 1 Any increase in the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks may reducc the incentives for those banks to invest in New Zealand. However, our analysis shows that our recommended option would not materially influence these incentives. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or override fundamental common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 28 March 2011 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The problem addressed in this Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is the setting of the appropriate tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks. The setting of this ratio is important for ensuring that foreign-owned banks pay an appropriate amount of tax in New Zealand. 2. Currently, foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand are subject to a special form of thin capitalisation rule. This rule was introduced in 2005 and requires the New Zealand banking group to hold equity equal to at least 4% of its New Zealand risk-weighted exposures (RWEs). The rule prevents banks from using structures that allow excessive interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base. 3. New Zealand incorporated banks are also subject to prudential regulatory requirements, which prescribe the minimum levels of capital they must hold, to protect against insolvency in the event of bad loans or other unexpected losses. This capital is split into "tiers", with Tier 1 capital consisting of the capital that is closest in nature to ordinary share capital. The minimum Tier 1 capital ratio is currently also 4% of RWEs. Tax equity and Tier 1 capital are generally defined in the same way, with similar instruments (such as common equity) being included in both. However, there are a number of important technical differences, which must be borne in mind when comparing the tax and regulatory amounts of equity. 4. The prudential requirements are based on the "Basel" frameworks, which are applied in many countries. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently recommended an increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio to 6%, as part of a number of changes proposed under the Basel III framework. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will be consulting with the banks regarding the implementation of Basel III in New Zealand. The New Zealand Bankers' Association (NZBA) expects an increase from 4% to 6% to occur, and that this will happen sometime between January 2013 and January 2015. 5. As illustrated in the following graph, in recent times (post-financial crisis of 2008), the banks operating in New Zealand have been maintaining higher Tier 1 capital levels than they were pre-financial crisis. Selected Industry Averages 12% 4% •• 2% - — - —— 0% ! 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Awrage Her 1 capital ratio for banks which operate in New Zealand forlhier worldwide business Average Tier 1 capital ratio of Australian Banks (ANZ, CBA, NAB & Weslpac) for their worldwide business Awrage Her 1 capital ratio of NZ incorporated registered banks with an Australian parent (ANZ National, ASB, BNZ, Westpac) - - - Average Her 1 capital ratio of NZ incorporated registered banks with an Australian parent (calculated under Basel II) Aierage Tax capital ratio of 5 banks - Representative of where we have observed the banking industry 3 6. This increase is partly explained by the anticipation of higher prudential regulatory ratios, but officials understand that there has also been a fundamental reassessment by markets of the amount of capital that financial institutions must hold. 7. However, as also illustrated on the above graph, the average tax equity ratio has remained close to the prescribed minimum of 4% of RWEs. The primary reason why the average tax equity ratio has remained relatively stable, while average Tier 1 capital ratios have been increasing, is the use of holding company structures in New Zealand. Holding company structures are ignored for New Zealand regulatory purposes but are included for tax purposes. This allows the operating bank (the prudentially regulated entity) to be equity funded by the holding company, while the holding company is partially funded by debt. This enables the holding company to take interest deductions on a portion of the "capital" and thereby pay less tax in New Zealand. OBJECTIVES 8. The desired Government outcomes are to ensure that: • the amount of tax paid in New Zealand by foreign-owned banks reflects the economic reality of their banking business in New Zealand, and • there is continued stability in the banking sector in New Zealand. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 9. The existing rules envisaged regular review, taking into account changes in regulatory and market practice to ensure an appropriate allocation of equity and debt to New Zealand. Therefore, the options considered do not involve an overarching review of the use of a tax minimum equity ratio to prevent excessive interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base. Instead, the review focuses on whether, because of changes in the regulatory and commercial environment, the tax minimum equity ratio for banks should be raised from its current level of 4% and, if so, to what level. Consequently, the options considered in this RIS are different tax minimum equity percentages and transitional approaches. New threshold options 10. The following table outlines a range of tax minimum equity percentages that could be chosen. For each of these thresholds, the table shows the additional capital that would be required in aggregate by foreign-owned banks, the aggregate reduction in interest deduction, and the estimated increased tax revenue per annum resulting from the increased equity. All of these figures assume that the banks would hold a 0.5 percentage point buffer over the threshold. 4 New Threshold Actual % Equity Held Additional Capital Required ($ million) Reduction in Interest Deduction ($ million) Increased Tax per annum ($ million 4.5% 5.0% 34 2 0 5.0% 5.5% 556 28 8 5.5% 6.0% 1,391 70 19 6.0% 6.5% 2,225 111 31 6.5% 7.0% 3,060 153 43 7.0% 7.5% 3,894 195 55 8.0% 8.5% 5,781 289 81 11. In setting the percentage in 2005, worldwide Tier 1 capital ratios were taken as a starting point. At the time, worldwide Tier 1 ratios were, on average, 7% to 8% for the main banks. This was then discounted to take account of surplus capital held by the parent banks, non-bank business equity, and the use of hybrid instruments (equity-like debt instruments). This took the rate to less than 6%. 12. However, other factors were also taken into account, which further lowered the appropriate percentage. These factors included the potential for disruption to the banking industry if further capital was required to support the New Zealand business, robustness over the business cycle and across different banks in different commercial situations, and the fit with the broader trans-Tasman relationship and the economic and revenue impacts. 13. It was also felt that the use of an external statutory benchmark would avoid the perception of arbitrariness that could attach to a percentage that had no such linkage. As such, it reduced the potential uncertainty for the banks as to the future tax consequences of their long-term financing decisions. 14. In the end, it was decided that on balance a ratio of 4% was appropriate, the same as the regulatory minimum. 15. The considerations taken into account in setting the percentage in 2005 remain relevant today. For comparisons with the tax minimum equity ratio, the relevant regulatory equity concept is Tier 1 capital held by the consolidated Australian banks. Tier 1 capital levels currently average over 8.5%, and have been growing over the last 24 months. Tier 1 capital levels for the New Zealand incorporated banks average over 9%. However, some instruments that would not be included in equity for tax purposes are included in the regulatory capital, so these figures are not directly comparable to the tax minimum equity percentage. To the extent to which such instruments give rise to tax deductions, they are already excluded from equity for purposes of the minimum equity calculation in New Zealand. Accordingly, the above 5 figures would need to be adjusted downward for comparative purposes. Overall, the increase in capital has raised capital ratios by 1 to 1V\* percentage points from 2005 levels. 16. The regulatory requirements are likely to change in the near future, following a process of consultation between the RBNZ and the banking industry. As noted above, the NZBA expects that the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio will be increased from its current level of 4% to 6%, an increase of 2 percentage points. This increase has been anticipated and banks are already preparing for it, holding more than the current regulatory minimum even though the financial crisis has eased. 17. Based on these increases, applying the policy parameters underlying the 2005 decisions would imply an increase in the minimum equity percentage of between 1 and 2 percentage points. Given the advantages of basing the tax percentage on the regulatory percentage, our preferred option is an increase in the tax minimum equity percentage to 6%. 18. Setting the tax minimum equity percentage for foreign-owned banks above the regulatory minimum has been considered, but is not recommended by officials, particularly because of the increased likelihood that banks' regulatory capital would be insufficient to meet the tax requirement at these higher levels. As well as potentially creating practical problems for banks in obtaining additional tax capital, a higher tax minimum equity percentage may have an appearance of arbitrariness. This could suggest to foreign-owned banks that the percentage may again be increased at any time in the future as a revenue raising measure, which could be destabilising to the banking industry in New Zealand. 19. The wider economic impact of increasing the tax minimum equity percentage must also be considered. We have carried out modelling of the effect of increasing the tax minimum equity ratio on banks' cost of capital or the cost of borrowing in New Zealand. Our modelling shows that a rise in the threshold to 6% would have only a minimal impact, requiring a rise in lending interest rates of less than 2 basis points in order to maintain shareholder returns. The primary reason that the impact on lending costs in New Zealand would not be significant is because the increased tax in New Zealand would be substantially offset by reduced tax in Australia. Transitional options 20. As Ministers wished to announce any increase in the tax minimum equity percentage as part of their Budget 2011 package, options considered included application from either: • 1 July 2011 • 1 April 2012, or • at the same time as the anticipated changes under Basel III. 21. Regarding transitional approaches, officials considered both a one-off rise and a staggered rise to the chosen new threshold. A staggered approach would involve increasing the tax minimum equity percentage incrementally over a specified timeframe until it reached the desired level. A myriad of permutations would be possible due to the number of variables involved (including the desired eventual new threshold, and the length of time over which the staggering would occur). Staggering would mean that the aggregate additional capital required by foreign-owned banks would increase incrementally. 22. The following table provides an example of the use of a staggered rise to a new threshold. It illustrates the effects of a staggered rise of the tax minimum equity threshold 6 from 4% to 6% from 1 July 2011 to 31 March 2013. The threshold is increased in six- monthly increments of 0.5 percentage points over the period. For each quarter, the table shows the aggregate additional capital required, the reduction in interest deduction, and the estimated increase in tax. The increased tax is then aggregated for fiscal years. Quarter Ended New Threshold Actual % Equity Held Additional Capital Required ($ million) Reduction in Interest Deduction ($ million) Increased Tax ($ million) Annual Tax Increase Year ended 30 June($ million) 30-Sep-2011 4.5% 5.0% 34 0 0 30-Jun-2012 4 31-Dec-2011 4.5% 5.0% 34 0 0 30-Jun-2012 4 31-Mar-2012 5.0% 5.5% 556 7 2 30-Jun-2012 4 30-Jun-2012 5.0% 5.5% 556 7 2 30-Jun-2012 4 30-Sep-2012 5.5% 6.0% 1,391 17 5 30-Jun-2013 25 31-Dec-2012 5.5% 6.0% 1,391 17 5 30-Jun-2013 25 31-Mar-2013 6.0% 6.5% 2,225 28 8 30-Jun-2013 25 All subsequent quarters 6.0% 6.5% 2,225 28 8 30-Jun-2013 25 All subsequent years 31 23. As mentioned above, there are myriad permutations of using a staggered approach to raising the tax minimum equity percentage. The above table is but one example. However, it allows for some general observations to be made. Use of the staggered approach means that the annual increase in tax paid rises gradually over the transitional period. Therefore, the longer the transitional period, the longer before the annual estimated increase in Crown revenue reaches its maximum. 24. The use of a staggered approach makes more sense the nearer in time the application date of the new tax minimum equity requirements is. The further away in time the application date is, the more sense it makes to just have a one-off increase in the tax minimum equity percentage, as banks would have more time to convert debt into equity. 25. When considering what the application date should be, officials were mindful that the banks would need sufficient time to make the necessary adjustments to their balance sheets. This may involve the conversion of existing tax debt into tax capital. For some banks, this debt is long-term third party debt. 26. When officials decided on a threshold of 6% as their preferred option, the decision as to the implementation approach became easier. The higher the new threshold, the more time banks would need to make the necessary adjustments, which would influence our choice of preferred implementation approach. A later application date and/or use of a staggered 7 approach would be more appropriate the greater the rise in the threshold. At the relatively small rise to 6%, particularly with a later application date, we considered that staggering was unnecessary. 27. For a new threshold of 6%, our preferred option would be an application date of 1 April 2012 without staggering. This approach (which would give banks until 30 June 2012 to bring in any additional capital required) would allow banks a reasonable amount of time to make the required adjustments, and would also allow for the legislation to go through the full Parliamentary process, including the Select Committee stage. 28. This approach would be expected to raise approximately $8 million of additional tax revenue in the 2011/12 fiscal year and $31 million in each subsequent fiscal year, as per the following table: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 8.000 31.000 31.000 31.000 29. For a new threshold of 6%, we also considered an application date of 1 July 2011 without staggering. This approach would be expected to raise approximately $31 million of additional tax revenue in the 2011/12 fiscal year, and the same in each subsequent fiscal year, as per the following table: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 31.000 31.000 31.000 31.000 30. Although this approach would raise more revenue in the 2011/12 fiscal year, officials do not recommend this approach, because of the short notice it would give the banks, and the potential problems some banks may face in quickly making the necessary adjustments to their balance sheets. Also counting against this approach is the fact that it would not allow for the legislation to go through the full Parliamentary process. 31. We also considered an application date coinciding with the expected implementation of Basel III in New Zealand. Such an approach would mean that it would take longer before tax revenue increased. We do not recommend this approach, as we consider that the tax minimum equity rules have a different purpose to the regulatory rules and, therefore, an explicit linkage in application date is not appropriate. Officials' view is that the tax minimum equity ratio is already too low at present, given the level of Tier 1 capital currently being held by banks. 8 CONSULTATION Banking industry consultation 32. In late October 2010, officials wrote to the affected banks, advising them that the Government intended to explore some issues with the minimum equity rules for banks—in particular, whether the current 4% threshold for minimum equity was still the appropriate percentage. We indicated in our letter that we wanted to get their input into any possible changes, and that we would be in contact with them to see if they wanted to meet to discuss the issues. 33. In November 2010, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials released an issues paper on banking minimum equity, for the purposes of consultation between the banking industry and tax policy officials. 34. In early December 2010, officials again wrote to affected banks. Officials set out, in more detail, the issues with the existing bank minimum equity rules, and asked the banks for their feedback on the following questions: • Do you agree that the gap between actual capital and tax capital was widened? • Do you consider a 20% discount to take account of surplus capital, hybrids and other non-banking business to be a useful rule of thumb? • What would you consider the impact of increasing the minimum equity ratio to the range of 7% to 8% would be in terms of capital and tax paid at the New Zealand entity and banking group level? Would there be any other impacts? • If the rules were to be changed, what would your expectations be regarding transitional arrangements? • Are there any other issues which you believe should be taken into account? 35. Further correspondence was exchanged and meetings were held between officials and the NZBA, and some other individual banks, between late November 2010 and late February 2011. 36. As a result of this consultation, the NZBA raised a number of issues, including the impact on the cost of capital and the perceived stability of the New Zealand taxing environment as banks make long-term financial commitments to New Zealand. 37. The NZBA's key concern was that any increase in the minimum equity percentage should be made on a principled basis, and not merely to raise revenue. If this is not the case, it would imply that the percentage could be increased any time that the Government needed money. This perception would have ramifications for the financing structures that banks would use over the longer term and, therefore, on the cost of capital. Accordingly, the NZBA suggested that the tax minimum equity requirement be linked explicitly with the minimum regulatory requirement. 38. The banks have also expressed concerns about the level at which the tax minimum equity percentage is set. The strong message is that any increase above 6% would be problematic for banks. 39. Another key concern expressed by banks was about the timing of the changes to the tax minimum equity requirements. They emphasised that it will take time for banks to put extra tax capital into their New Zealand balance sheets. This is because it may involve converting 9 some of their existing tax debt (which for some banks is long-term third party debt) into tax capital. Banks have also suggested that the tax changes should coincide with the changes under Basel III. 40. Feedback received through consultation has helped officials in arriving at their preferred option. Officials' preferred option is for the change not to apply until the quarter beginning 1 April 2012, which would give banks until 30 June 2012 to bring in any additional capital required. Intra-governmental consultation 41. Inland Revenue officials have carried out their review of the tax minimum equity ratio for foreign-owned banks in New Zealand in conjunction with Treasury officials. The Treasury concurs with our conclusions and recommendations. 42. Officials have maintained close consultation with the RBNZ throughout the review process. 43. RBNZ officials have emphasised their position that the regulatory regime in New Zealand is not designed to provide protection for the New Zealand tax base. 44. RBNZ officials were also consulted about the potential impact on the banking sector of raising the tax minimum equity percentage. RBNZ officials concur with Inland Revenue modelling, which shows that an increase in the percentage to 6% is likely to have only a minimal impact on banks' cost of capital or the cost of borrowing in New Zealand. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 45. Officials recommend increasing the tax minimum equity percentage for foreign-owned banks from 4% to 6% from 1 April 2012. 46. Officials do not recommend raising the tax minimum equity percentage any more than the increase in the regulatory minimum, particularly because of the increased likelihood that banks' regulatory capital would be insufficient to meet the tax requirement at these higher levels. 47. This option allows banks sufficient time to organise the extra capital required, which was a major concern raised by banks during consultation. IMPLEMENTATION 48. The proposed option, which requires legislative change, would be included in the August 2011 Bill. This would allow the legislation to go through the whole Parliamentary process, including the Select Committee stage. The change would apply for the quarter beginning 1 April 2012, which would give banks until 30 June 2012 to bring in any additional capital required. 49. We expect any additional administrative costs to be minimal, as the proposal involves only a change to the existing tax minimum equity percentage for a small group of taxpayers. Monitoring of the level of tax paid and banks' compliance with the rules already occurs. 10 50. Banks are expected to incur initial compliance costs in restructuring their balance sheets (for example, by converting existing tax debt into tax equity) to meet the proposed requirements. 51. Ongoing compliance costs are minimised, as banks already have systems in place for monitoring their tax equity position under the current rules. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 52. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 53. We would continue to monitor the tax equity ratio maintained by banks and the amount of tax paid in New Zealand. If it became apparent that the amount of tax being paid in New Zealand by foreign-owned banks no longer fairly reflected the economic reality of their banking business in New Zealand, we may revisit the tax minimum equity rules for foreign- owned banks, and any proposals for change would again go through the GTPP. 11
Regulatory Impact Statement Non-resident film renters' tax Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this Statement is whether the non-resident film renters' tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are necessary and, if not, whether the rules should be replaced by non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The non-resident film renters' tax was introduced in 1928 because of the difficulties in accurately determining the net profit derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand. However, there is no longer a sound policy rationale for retaining the non-resident film renters' tax rules. Public consultation was undertaken as part of the Government discussion document, New Zealand's International Tax Review: a direction for change, released in December 2006 and three submissions were received on the proposal. Recently, officials have been in contact with the submitters about the proposed change and they raised no additional points to their submissions. Other than set out in this Disclosure Statement and the broader Regulatory Impact Statement, no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified. In preparing this Statement, we have consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. The proposed change may impose some compliance costs for New Zealand customers who make payments to non-resident film renters for renting and exhibiting film purposes in New Zealand. New Zealand customers would need to withhold tax for the non-resident film renters and some may potentially need to re-negotiate existing contracts and re-configure systems for the deduction of NRWT. But, overall and also in the long tenn, the change would simplify the New Zealand income tax rules applying to non-residents and reduce compliance costs on non-resident companies by removing their filing responsibility in New Zealand. The change does not affect the local film production industry. The proposed change does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles, Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 2 June 2011 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. At present, 10 percent of the gross receipts derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand are deemed to be assessable income under section CV 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under section DW 3, a non-resident film renter is not allowed a deduction in relation to this income. The rate of tax that is applied is the rate of tax applicable to the non- resident. Because the non-resident is invariably a company, this means that non-resident film renters are generally subject to an effective tax rate of 2.8 percent on their gross receipts (i.e. 28 percent of 10 percent). 2. Income subject to this rule is not included in the income of the non-resident film renter under any other provision in the Act. Importantly, this income is excluded from the definition of non-resident passive income and is therefore not subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). 1 3. The rule for taxing non-resident film renters has existed in various forms since 1928. The rule was originally enacted because of the difficulties in accurately determining the net profit derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand. Given NRWT is now well-established and could apply to such income, there is no longer a sound policy rationale for having separate tax rules for non-resident film renters. 4. This Statement considers whether the Income Tax Act should be amended to remove the separate tax rules for non-resident film renters. OBJECTIVES 5. The main objective is to review whether the existing non-resident film renters' tax rules are necessary and, if not, whether the rules should be replaced by NRWT. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 6. The options that we have identified are to retain the status quo or to repeal the provisions relating to non-resident film renters' tax so that NRWT applies to amounts derived by non-resident film renters. 7. The non-resident film renters' tax is an historical anachronism. It appears that the non- resident film renters' tax was not replaced in 1964 when NRWT was introduced because of the 1948 double tax agreement (DTA) between United States and New Zealand. That DTA prevented New Zealand taxing the income of United States film renters except to the extent allowed under the existing non-resident film renters' tax. The 1982 DTA between New Zealand and the United States (replacing the 1948 DTA) and the current DTA (in force from November 2010) contains no similar restriction on New Zealand's ability to tax income derived from New Zealand by the United States-resident film renters. 8. The preferred option is to repeal the existing provisions relating to non-resident film renters' tax so that NRWT could apply. This would rationalise and simplify the New Zealand income tax rules applying to non-residents and provide consistency with other tax treatments. 1 NRWT is a broad set of withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties derived from New Zealand by non-residents. 2 Also, this approach is in line with how other countries, such as Australia, tax amounts derived by non-resident film renters. 9. Practically all amounts subject to the non-resident film renters' tax would come within the royalty definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and in New Zealand's DTAs. Hence, such amounts would be subject to NRWT if non-resident film renters' tax is repealed.2 10. Under this option, NRWT at variable rates would apply in accordance with DTAs between New Zealand and other countries, which limit the amount of NRWT that New Zealand can charge on royalties. The DTA royalty rate is generally 10 percent. However, the rate under the United States and Australia DTAs is five percent, which would apply to many non-resident film renters. The NRWT rate of 15 percent applies if there is no applicable DTA. 11. This option will result in the following estimated increase in tax revenues, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 &outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 5.000 5.000 5.000 12. No social, environmental or cultural costs are expected to arise under this option. Also, no significant behavioural changes by non-resident film renters are expected to arise. NRWT on film rental payments derived from New Zealand by non-residents would generally be creditable in the home country of the non-resident film renter. 13. There will be some compliance costs for New Zealand customers who make payments to non-resident film renters for renting or exhibiting film purposes in New Zealand. New Zealand customers will have to withhold tax for the non-resident film renters from the 2012-13 income year and may potentially re-negotiate existing contracts and re-configure systems for the deduction of NRWT. Because it involves making deductions from gross payments at a flat rate, NRWT is a relatively simple tax to comply with. Some non-resident film renters may also face increased compliance costs to re-negotiate existing contracts but this will be partially offset by the removal of filing responsibility in New Zealand. 14. The proposed change will not affect the local film production industry. CONSULTATION 15. Inland Revenue has consulted on the proposal as part of the government discussion document, New Zealand's International Tax Review: a direction for change, released in December 2006 and three submissions were received. The submitters raised a general 2 Note that certain types of receipts, which are currently subject to non-resident film renters' tax, would not be subject to NRWT (being outside the royalty definition). These are receipts from the sale or hire of film containers or other film accessories. However, the value of film containers or other accessories relative to the copyright in the film itself would be immaterial. The transfer pricing rules would prevent non-arm's length values being attributed to such accessories if film rental payments were subject to NRWT. 3 concern about an increased cost of film rental to New Zealand customers. These costs may include the increased tax burden on New Zealanders because of the existing contract conditions (for example, gross-up clauses) and the increased compliance costs on New Zealand customers to withhold tax for the non-resident film renters. Recently, officials have been in contact with the submitters about the proposed change and they raised no additional points to their submissions. 16. Officials have reviewed the submitters' concerns but consider the policy arguments for replacing the non-resident film renters' tax with NRWT are stronger. The change would simplify the New Zealand income tax rules applying to non-residents and, in particular, the burden of the increased tax will not necessarily be borne by New Zealanders because NRWT would generally be creditable in the home country of the non-resident film renter. 17. Inland Revenue has also consulted with the Treasury. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 18. The recommended option is to replace the non-resident film renters' tax with NRWT so that NRWT applies to amounts derived by non-residents from renting out films in New Zealand. IMPLEMENTATION 19. The necessary legislative change will be included in the scheduled September 2011 tax bill, with application to payments made on or after the date of enactment. 20. A small number of non-resident film renters would have a reduced compliance burden as a result of the removal of filing responsibility in New Zealand. Some New Zealand customers, who make payments to non-resident film renters for renting and exhibiting film purposes in New Zealand, would have to deduct and return NRWT from payments made to non-resident film renters. Some may need to register with Inland Revenue for NRWT. Because it involves making deductions from gross payments at a flat rate, NRWT is a relatively simple tax to comply with. 21. Inland Revenue intends to identify these New Zealand customers and target them with communications advising them of their new obligations, and what they need to do. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 22. The new tax treatment of the non-resident film renters would be part of any monitoring, evaluation and review of NRWT. If any specific concerns are raised, officials would determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. The Income Tax Act 2007 is also subject to regular review by officials. 4
Regulatory Impact Statement Extending eligibility for the in-work tax credit to unpaid shareholder-employees in certain circumstances Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this Statement is whether unpaid shareholder-employees can be eligible for the in-work tax credit where they work the required number of hours per week. Currently, the in-work tax credit is only available to a shareholder-employee who works full-time and where they derive wages, salary or a shareholder salary. It is not available if they only derive dividends or other distributions from the company. The Statement provides an analysis of the options for extending eligibility to unpaid shareholder-employees. As the change concerns people who are currently ineligible, there is little information to indicate the number of people affected. Estimates have been made based on current administrative data and information gathered through consultation. The number affected is expected to be very low and also likely to vary between years due to economic conditions affecting business profitability. Other than set out in this Disclosure Statement and the broader Regulatory Impact Statement, no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified. In preparing this Statement, we have consulted with the Treasury and the Ministry of Social Development, which agreed with our analysis. We have also discussed the issue and potential options with representatives of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. The consultation informed the problem definition, development of options and analysis summarised in this Statement. The proposed change will not impose any significant new compliance costs on shareholder- employees seeking to apply for the in-work tax credit. The proposed change also does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. Inland Revenue 19 July 2011 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Where a person meets certain criteria they will be eligible for the in-work tax credit. The criteria include being a New Zealand resident, caring for a dependent child, not receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance, working the minimum required number of hours a week and deriving income from that work activity. 2. Section MD 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires the full time worker to be receiving specified income from the work activity. This specified income is defined to include wages and salary, shareholder salary and income from a business carried on for profit, as well as weekly ACC and parental leave payments in certain circumstances. 3. This requirement is not clearly stated on the application form leading to some applicants being unaware of the requirement for income to be derived from the work activity. Additional costs can be incurred by the department and applications in correcting applications. 4. Where all the criteria are met the person can apply for the in-work tax credit, which provides up to $60 a week where the family has up to three children, and an extra $15 a week for each additional child. The total amount, along with any family tax credit or parental tax credit, is abated against family scheme income. Family scheme income is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 to include wages and salary, shareholder salary and business income. It also includes income attributed to people from trusts or companies in specific circumstances. 5. These criteria are intended to encourage people to move off income-tested benefits into work. It also encourages people to remain in work. 6. When a business makes a loss in a tax year, it may decide not to make a payment to the business owner relating to the owner's work activity. If the business owner is a sole trader, partner, shareholder of a look-through company, or beneficiary of a trading trust, they may still be eligible for the in-work tax credit as the gross income of the business can be treated as the person's income from a business. However, this treatment does not apply where the business is conducted via a company. A shareholder-employee will only qualify as receiving income from a work activity if they are paid wages or salary, or a shareholder salary. The gross income of the company is not treated as the person's income from a business for the purposes of the test in section MD 9. 7. In a number of situations, companies have elected to make no payment to the shareholder-employee due to the overall net loss of the company in that year. As a result, an unpaid shareholder-employee is not eligible for the in-work tax credit, even though they normally work the required number of hours per week. The number affected is estimated to be very low. 8. The current situation creates an inequity between working business owners based on the type of structure their business operates in. 9. An alternative could be for a shareholder-employee to receive a nominal payment, meaning they would meet the criterion of receiving income from a work activity. However, as this is an artificial construct it is likely to receive additional scrutiny from Inland Revenue with associated costs for the department and applicant. It would be preferable to address the problem directly. 40 10. The key cause of this situation is the inability for an unpaid shareholder-employee to meet the current legislative definition of income from a work activity. While the definition is sufficient for business owners in other entities, it does not cover shareholder-employees in standard companies. A non-legislative solution of the payment of a nominal salary is artificial and could result in greater scrutiny being applied to it with increased uncertainty and compliance costs for applicants. OBJECTIVES 11. The main objective is to ensure that the in-work tax credit operates as intended by encouraging people to move into and remain in work. It aims to support people with dependent children based on their level of work activity and their level of income. The question is whether the legislation setting out the eligibility criteria achieves the policy objectives. 12. In making changes to the eligibility rules, consideration should be given to government priorities to improve the integrity of the tax credits. Fiscal costs are also a consideration. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. The options that we have identified are to: Option A: provide further guidance to applicants and Inland Revenue staff about the requirements for income to be derived from work and the approach taken on nominal salary payments in light of the recent broadening of the definition of income. This would only clear some confusion on the current rules and would not extend eligibility to unpaid shareholder-employees. Option B: change the definition of "full-time earner deriving income from a work activity" to include major shareholder-employees of close companies that produce gross income, provided the person meets all other requirements. This would extend eligibility to unpaid shareholder-employees who meet all other requirements. 14. As noted, Option A does not address the inequity that has been identified, although it may reduce the uncertainty and compliance costs for some applicants. 15. The preferred option is Option B to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to extend eligibility to major shareholder-employees of a close company, where the close company produces gross income and all other requirements are met. This addresses the inequity. 16. The preferred Option B will result in an estimated increase in expenditure on the in- work tax credit of approximately $0,650 million per year. The 2011-12 appropriation for the in-work tax credit is approximately $567 million. The estimated cost of the preferred option can be met within the existing appropriation. 17. Shareholder-employees affected by the proposed change will be required to confirm that they meet all the eligibility requirements when applying for the in-work tax credit. No social, environmental or cultural costs are expected to arise. CONSULTATION 18. Officials discussed the status quo and problem definition with representatives from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, who provided information to inform the analysis. Indicative options were also discussed and the representatives did not support the 2 option to issue further guidance only. Feedback from the consultation was factored into the analysis and informed the development of the preferred option. 19. Inland Revenue has also consulted with the Treasury and the Ministry of Social Development, which agreed with our analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 20. The recommended option is to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to change the definition of "full-time earner deriving income from a work activity" to include major shareholder- employees of close companies that produce gross income, provided the person meets all other requirements. This would ensure comparable treatment between major shareholder- employees and other working business owners. IMPLEMENTATION 21. The definition of family scheme income has been broadened from 1 April 2011 to improve its integrity. The broadened definition of family scheme income will reduce the risks associated with potential behavioural changes. In particular, section MB 4 attributes the net undistributed income of a close company to the major shareholders in proportion to their shareholding. Furthermore, section MB 7 attributes the income earned by a trust that is not paid out as beneficiary income to the settlors of the trust. This broadened definition of family scheme income ensures that Working for Family tax credits, including the in-work tax credit, are well targeted. 22. The necessary legislative change will be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in September 2011, with effect from the 2012-13 tax year. 23. As the proposed option refers to existing definitions of major shareholders and close companies, it can be implemented within existing processes for changes to Working for Families. Administrative costs will be met within the Inland Revenue's existing baselines. No significant risks have been identified. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 24. The proposed change to eligibility will be monitored as part of business as usual processes on the take-up and expenditure of the in-work tax credit. 3
Regulatory Impact Statement Liquidators and receivers changing GST accounting basis Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this Statement is whether liquidators and receivers should be able to change from the payments to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. The main objective is to ensure that liquidators and receivers are not able to engage in tax driven behaviour to generate GST refunds to the detriment of the Government's tax base. Other than set out in this Disclosure Statement and the broader Regulatory Impact Statement, no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified. Officials have consulted with the relevant industry body, INSOL, and the Treasury. Given the technical nature of the issue and its small stakeholder group, wider public consultation has not been undertaken. In preparing this Statement, we have consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. The proposed change will not impose any compliance costs on liquidators or receivers. The proposed change does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 20 July 2011 I STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The question in this Statement is whether liquidators and receivers should be able to change from the payments to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. 2. If a registered person meets certain conditions, for example, the total value of taxable supplies for a 12 month period has not, or is not likely to exceed $2,000,000, the registered person may account for GST on a payments basis. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows registered persons who are accounting for GST on a payments basis to change to the invoice basis by applying to the Commissioner. There are currently no restrictions on registered persons making this accounting basis change. 3. The large majority of registered persons choose to account for GST on a payments basis because it suits their business needs. 4. It is normal practice for liquidators and receivers to switch the GST accounting basis of registered persons they are acting for from the payments basis to the invoice basis. Changing from the payments to the invoice basis often results in refunds being made to the liquidator or receiver despite in many cases there being no realistic prospect that the debt, to which the input credit relates, will ever be paid. Even though output tax is also recognised on an invoice basis when the accounting basis is switched, Inland Revenue's statistics show that liquidators and receivers consistently receive net refunds when they make the switch. 5. For example, in the period 1 January 2009 to 30 July 2010 there were 627 companies where the liquidators requested a change from the payments basis to the invoice basis - the amount of GST claimed by these liquidators on switching accounting basis was approximately $4.5 million, whereas the output tax returned was approximately $550,000. 6. Although companies not in liquidation or receivership can similarly change their GST accounting basis, this is not considered an equivalent problem because such persons who stay in business eventually come into a net paying position. 7. Officials also note that it is not the policy intent of the GST legislation that refunds obtained by changing GST accounting bases be used to fund the liquidation or receivership of private companies. 8. The problem, therefore, is liquidators or receivers engaging in tax driven behaviour in order to generate GST refunds, which is at the detriment of the Government's tax base. 9. This Statement considers whether the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be amended to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. OBJECTIVES 10. The main objective is to ensure that liquidators and receivers are not able to engage in tax driven behaviour to generate GST refunds to the detriment of the Government's tax base. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 11. The options that we have identified include retaining the status quo or amending the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. 2 12. The preferred option is to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST in order to generate GST refunds. The amendment should also apply to voluntary administrators. 13. Officials considered other options including making the change of accounting basis subject to Commissioner discretion and amending the incapacitated persons provisions in section 58 of the GST Act 1985. These options were disregarded because a discretion would be arbitrary in nature and the incapacitated persons provisions have a might wider ambit than liquidators and receivers. 14. The impacts of the preferred option are: Impacts Comment Net Impact Costs Benefits Comment Net Impact Liquidators/ Receivers $2.5 million less tax refunded. Marginally reduced compliance costs as no longer making a change in accounting basis. Approximately 400 companies going into liquidation each year could be affected by this proposal. Negative Government None. $2.5 million per annum. GST no longer inappropriately used to fund liquidation or receivership of private companies. Positive CONSULTATION 15. Officials have discussed the amendment with representatives from INSOL (a group representing insolvency practitioners). The group considered the GST refunds were used to investigate companies, which could result in higher returns to creditors and therefore supported the status quo. It is not the policy intent of the legislation that GST refunds obtained by changing GST accounting bases be used to fund the liquidation or receivership of private companies. 16. Inland Revenue has also consulted with the Treasury who agree with our recommendation. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 17. The recommended option is to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to preclude liquidators and receivers switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. IMPLEMENTATION 18. The necessary legislative change will be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in September 2011, with application to payments made on or after the date of 3 enactment. There is no need for transitional provisions. No implementation risks have been identified. Implementation can be managed within existing systems. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 19. There are no plans to monitor evaluate and review the GST treatment of liquidators and receivers following this amendment. If any specific concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Also, the Goods and Service Tax Act 1985 is subject to regular review by officials. 4
Regulatory Impact Statement GST and late payment fees Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It addresses an issue with the GST treatment of late payment fees by taxpayers and a potential significant fiscal risk if GST is not payable on the fees. Late payment fees are fixed fees charged by businesses to their customers on late payment of accounts. The fees are different from penalty and default interest payments which are specifically GST-exempt in the same way as other financial transactions. Inconsistency between interpretation and practice has created a lack of clarity around the application of the GST rules to late payment fees. The current interpretation of the law raises boundary issues that would result in different GST treatments for comparable fees, such as prompt payment discounts, depending on how the fees are structured. There should not be a difference in GST treatments between two similar types of charges when GST is intended to be imposed on the consideration for any transaction. The current interpretation creates a significant fiscal risk to the GST base. It means that taxpayers, most of whom have charged GST on late fees to their customers, may be entitled to a refund of the output tax that they have returned to Inland Revenue. We recommend that a legislative amendment be made to clarify that late payment fees are subject to GST and this be made retrospective. However, we recommend a savings provision that would preserve the position that a small minority of taxpayers may have taken in relation to this matter before the effective date of the proposed legislative amendment. A general limitation of our analysis was the time constraint in developing the options. A prompt change was considered necessary as maintaining the status quo raises a potentially significant fiscal risk. We consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. Full consultation has not been undertaken with the public so as not to signal a potential base maintenance change that could result in a behavioural change by taxpayers. We do, however, intend to inform a small number of taxpayers, who may be affected by the amendment, of the proposed legislative change closer to the date of bill introduction. The proposed amendment does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. As noted, a retrospective amendment in this area would remove the ability of taxpayers to seek GST refunds. However, the savings provision would maintain the existing treatment for all affected taxpayers. Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 20 July 2011 I STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. This statement considers options to address a recent issue relating to GST and late payment fees. Late payment fees are fixed fees charged by businesses to their customers in respect of the late payment of accounts - for example, a telephone company may charge their customers a set fee for the cost of administration if they do not pay their monthly telephone bill on time. These fees are common across a range of sectors and charging GST on these fees is a common practice among many businesses. The fees are different from penalty or default interest payments which are specifically GST-exempt under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act") in the same way as financial transactions. 2. Under the GST Act, GST is only charged on a taxable supply. The term "supply" being very broadly defined in keeping with the policy of GST having the broadest base that is practically possible. However, under the current interpretation of the law, no GST should be imposed late payment types of fees as there is a lack of connection between the fee charged and the underlying supply of goods and services, even though they may represent the cost of administering the late payment. This is inconsistent with both the policy of a broad-based tax and with Inland Revenue's public statement to date which has been that while penalty interest is clearly not subject to GST, late payment fees are subject to GST. 1 3. The current interpretation of the law raises boundary issues that would result in different GST treatments for comparable fees depending on how the fees are structured. There should not be a difference in GST treatments between two types of charges when GST is intended to be imposed on the consideration for any transaction. In this respect, late payment fees should be treated in the same manner as prompt payment discounts. 4. Inconsistency between interpretation and practice has created a lack of clarity around the application of the GST rules to late payment fees. If this is maintained, there will be an ongoing fiscal cost of around $3.3 million per year. This would be the result of taxpayers who currently charge GST on late fees no longer charging it. Moreover, the same group of taxpayers may be entitled to a refund of the output tax that they have already returned to Inland Revenue. This is estimated to amount to a one-off revenue loss of approximately $13.8 million. OBJECTIVES 5. The main objective is to clarify the current law around GST and late payment fees. A clarification to the law would also ensure that there is no potential ongoing fiscal risk resulting from the inconsistency between interpretation and practice. A further objective is to ensure that this need to remove the fiscal risk is balanced with the need to treat fairly those who have taken an interpretation that is justifiable under the current law. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 6. The options we have identified are to maintain the status quo or to make a legislative amendment which would clarify that late payment fees are subject to GST. For base 1 See GST Treatment of Interest Charged on Overdue Accounts — TIB Volume Two No. 5 December (1990). 2 maintenance reasons and to remove the fiscal risk resulting from the current interpretation of the rules, our preferred option is a legislative amendment. Legislative amendment 7. Our preferred option is that the application date of an amendment is aligned with the last year in which taxpayers can possibly argue for a refund of overpaid GST. Under the GST rules, the Commissioner must refund overpaid GST if he is satisfied that the amount of the refund represents an excess over the amount properly payable and the four-year time-bar in the Tax Administration Act 1994 has not expired. However, this time-bar is extended to eight years if the GST overpaid is the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight. Under this option, the effective date would be the date that is 8 years before the date of bill introduction, say from September 2003, with application for taxable periods ending on or after that date. 8. This option would also include a savings provision that would effectively preserve the positions that taxpayers may have taken in relation to this matter, say prior to the introduction of legislative amendment. 9. We recognise that a savings provision may give rise to concerns about the potential disparity between taxpayers who have applied the current law and have not charged GST on late fees, and those who, based on their understanding of the rules have charged GST. However, on balance, we believe that this concern is outweighed by both the need to treat fairly those who have taken an interpretation that is justifiable under the current law, and the need to remove the fiscal risks outlined. Other legislative options considered 10. Another option considered was a prospective legislative amendment - that is, an application date that would make GST chargeable on all late payment fees from the date of bill introduction. This option would prevent taxpayers from either adopting or continuing to rely on the recent interpretation of the current law from this date. Practically speaking, it means that taxpayers who had previously relied on the interpretation would not have to account for the GST that they did not charge during the periods before the introduction of the legislative change. Equally however, it would mean that taxpayers who had charged GST on late fees before the introduction of the amendment may be entitled to a refund of the output tax that they have returned to Inland Revenue. As noted above, the fiscal cost of this would be about $13.8 million. 11. We also considered a retrospective amendment without a savings provision. This option would make it clear that GST has always been chargeable on these types of fees. In practice, it would prevent taxpayers who have already charged GST on their late payment fees from claiming refunds. A retrospective application date, however, would mean that taxpayers, who had relied on an interpretation that is justifiable under current law and not charged GST on their late payment fees, would now be accountable for the outstanding output tax from the effective date of the retrospective amendment. 12. The preferred option, therefore, represents a compromise between these alternative options. The inclusion of a savings provision allays concerns about enacting retrospective 3 legislation while, at the same time, ensuring that the interpretation of the current law and any proposed amendments to the rules around GST and late payment fees do not pose an ongoing risk to the GST base. Status quo 13. Maintaining the status quo is unsustainable. It results in uncertainty, creates boundary issues, and poses a significant fiscal risk to the GST base. 14. No social, environmental or cultural costs are expected to arise under any of these options. CONSULTATION 15. We consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. Full consultation has not been undertaken with the public so as not to signal a potential base maintenance change that could result in a behavioural change by taxpayers. We do, however, intend to inform a small number of taxpayers, who may be affected by the amendment, of the proposed legislative change closer to the date of bill introduction. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 16. The recommended option is a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 that would clarify that late payment fees imposed by business on their customers are subject to GST. IMPLEMENTATION 17. The necessary legislative change would be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in September 2011, with an application date that is 8 years before the date of bill introduction, and application for taxable periods ending on or after that date. A savings provision would also apply to preserve the positions that taxpayers took before the date of bill introduction. 18. No implementation risks have been identified. The proposed changes can be done within existing administrative functions. Any legislative change in this area will be communicated. Specifically, Inland Revenue will prepare a Tax Information Bulletin item to communicate the effect of the proposed changes to taxpayers. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 19. In general, the monitoring, evaluation and review of these proposals would take place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, this would mean that these proposals would be reviewed at a time after it has had some time to work. Any changes that are needed to give the legislation its intended effect would be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 4
