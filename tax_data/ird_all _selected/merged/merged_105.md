This report brings to your attention the outcome of the regular review of the use of money interest (UOMI) rates. It seeks your agreement to increasing the rates in line with the latest increases in market interest rates. Context and background 2. The UOMI rates, along with other rates used in the tax system, 1 are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates. 3. The UOMI rates are an important component of the tax compliance rules. By changing in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. UOMI rates 4. There are two UOMI rates: 4.1 the taxpayer’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI underpayment rate), which is charged on underpayments of tax to Inland Revenue; 4.2 the Commissioner’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI overpayment rate), which is paid by the Commissioner on money paid to Inland Revenue above a taxpayer’s tax liability. 5. The underpayment rate is currently 7.96%, while the overpayment rate is currently 1.22%, based on RBNZ figures from May 2022. Principles for updating the rates 6. Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 6.1 the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 100 basis points or more from the figures used to calculate the last rate change; or 6.2 one of these indexes moves by 20 basis points or more and the UOMI rates ha ve n’t been adjusted in the last 12 months. 1 The other rates are the FBT interest rate on employment-related loans and the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. In Confidence IR2022/459: Use of money interest rates review Page 2 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. When regulations are made altering the UOMI rates, the adjustment is applied from the day after the next standard provisional tax payment date – which is 15 January 2023. However, 15 January falls on a Sunday which makes 16 January 2023 the date that tax payable is due. Therefore, the increased UOMI rates start applying from the next day which is 17 January 2023. 8. The formula for setting the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 as follows: 8.1 Section 2 of the Regulations provides that the taxpayer’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points (or 2.5%); 8.2 Section 3 of the Regulations provides that the Commissioner’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point). However, if this calculation would produce a figure lower than 0%, the rate is instead set at 0%, to ensure overpayments do not accrue negative interest. 9. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate is a proxy for a debt that a taxpayer might prioritise over their tax obligations. In the absence of a UOMI charge, a taxpayer wanting to borrow money could simply underpay their tax and use Inland Revenue like a bank rather than borrow from a bank at a commercial interest rate. A conservative margin of 250 basis points is added to the mortgage rate in calculating the underpayment UOMI rate because the Commissioner does not have information about the likelihood of any individual taxpayer paying the UOMI charged to them (i.e., the taxpayer’s creditworthiness). 10. The Regulations provide that the methodology for setting the interest rate for overpaid tax is the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates, and approximates the return a taxpayer might expect on a low-risk investment in the New Zealand Government. Ensuring that the Commissioner pays less interest to the taxpayer on overpaid tax than the taxpayer would receive as a return from a low- risk bond aims to prevent a payment of tax to Inland Revenue being used as an investment. Results of latest RBNZ figure review 11. According to RBNZ figures from August 2022, both the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate and the 90-day bank bill rate have risen more than 100 basis points from their positions at May 2022, which triggers the UOMI rates to be reset. 12. The UOMI underpayment rate should be increased to 9. 21%, while the UOMI overpayment rate should be increased to 2.31%. 13. The RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer rate has risen by 125 basis points since May 2022 (the last time the UOMI rates were set). Accordingly, the underpayment rate should be increased by 125 basis points, from 7.96% to 9.21%. 14. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill r ate has risen by 109 basis points since May 2022. Accordingly, the overpayment rate should be increased from 1.22% to 2.3 1%. Fiscal Impact 15. The change to the underpayment rate will increase revenue over the forecast period. At the same time, the increased overpayment rate will reduce revenue over the forecast period. In Confidence IR2022/459: Use of money interest rates review Page 3 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 16. Overall, it is estimated that the net tax revenue impact will be negative, as the cost of increasing the overpayment rate is expected to exceed the revenue from increasing the underpayment rate. 17. The net tax revenue impact of the change, before impairments, is shown in the table below. $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Tax Revenue impact of change to Underpayment rate 25.000 56.000 56.000 56.000 56.000 Tax Revenue impact of change to Overpayment rate (17.000) (37.000) (37.000) (37.000) (37.000) Net Tax Revenue Impact 8.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 18. However, a large part of underpayment debt is typically written off, meaning the cost to revenue is larger than the net revenue impact reported above. To represent this, underpayments are impaired in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid and must be written off. Increasing the underpayment rate thus also increases impairment expenditure. 19. In previous UOMI rate changes, UOMI underpayment debt was impaired at a standard rate of 78.7%. This rate was intended to reflect the average repayment rate of all debt. However, since the approval of the last UOMI rates change (IR2022/347 refers), the methodology for calculating the impairment rate has been adjusted to reflect only the average repayment rate of recent debt. Taking this into account, the impairment rate used for this report has reduced to 67.63%, based on debt repayment for the year ending 30 June 2022. For future UOMI reviews this impairment rate will be updated in October each year. 20. The total fiscal impact and operating expenditure for the forecast period taking the new rate of impairment into account are presented below.

Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO), and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) on this report. They agree with the recommendations. 22. Customs advise that a change in the underpayment UOMI rate will have some small operational and financial impacts. Customs’ compensatory interest rate is aligned with the UOMI underpayment rate, and an increase in the underpayment rate will correspondingly result in an increase to the compensatory interest rate. 23. Since the previous rate change to 7.96% in 30 August 2022, Customs have collected $14,964.73 in compensatory interest. If the compensatory interest rate had been 9.21%, they estimate they would have collected $17,314.71 instead over that period, an increase of $2,349.98. Customs also estimate that, over the next 12 months, they would collect $170,807.27 in compensatory interest if the rate were to remain at 9.21%. 3 Next steps 24. Officials have advised PCO that a draft Order in Council changing the rates may need to be prepared depending on your decision. 25. Attached is a paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee, recommending that it approve the Order in Council and authorise their submission to Cabinet and the Executive Council. If you decide to increase the UOMI rates, the paper should be referred to Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 17 November 2022. This would enable the Cabinet Legislation Committee to consider the paper on 24 November 2022. 2 Note this figure differs from the table above due to rounding differences to ensure the table sums correctly. 3 Note that this projected figure excludes compensatory interest that may be collected as a result of Customs’ investigation and trade audit activities.

1 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS (NO 3) 2022 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2.It is proposed to amend the regulation so the underpayment use of money interest (UOMI) rate is set at 9.21%, while the overpayment UOMI rate is set at 2.31%. Policy 3.The UOMI rates play an important role in the tax compliance rules. By moving in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rates apply to all revenue and duties. 4.The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and overpayment interest rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by Order in Council. 5.The methodology for calculating the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations). The Regulations provide that the interest rate for underpaid tax should be set at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6.The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points, or, if this would produce a negative figure, at 0%. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 7.The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 7.96% and 1.22% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 30 August 2022 and were based on the interest rates for May 2022. 8.The RBNZ interest rates for August 2022 indicate that the 90-day bank bill rate has changed by 109 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:19:32 Doc 2 2 adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long-term misalignment. I therefore recommend the overpayment rate be increased to 2.31%. 9. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has also changed by 125 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. Therefore, I also recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 9.21%. Timing 10. I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the change in the UOMI underpayment rate to Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 28 November 2022. In order to minimise compliance costs, it is proposed that the new rate comes into force on 17 January 2023, the day after the due date for the second standard instalment of provisional tax. Compliance 11. The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi 11.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 11.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 11.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 11.5 relevant international standards and obligations 11.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Regulations Review Committee 12. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 14. A regulatory impact assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Financial Implications 15. The proposal to increase the UOMI rates, with the effective date of 17 January 2023, is estimated to result in net negative revenue of approximately $84 million over the forecast period. While the change to the underpayment rate will increase revenue over 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:19:32 3 the forecast period, the increased overpayment rate will reduce revenue over the forecast period at a greater rate. 16. The net tax revenue impact of the change is shown in the table below. $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Tax Revenue impact of change to Underpayment rate 25.000 56.000 56.000 56.000 56.000 Tax Revenue impact of change to Overpayment rate (17.000) (37.000) (37.000) (37.000) (37.000) Net Tax Revenue Impact 8.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 17.

To represent this, underpayments are impaired in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid and must be written off. Increasing the underpayment rate thus also increases impairment expenditure. 18. Based on debt repayment for the year ending 30 June 2022, the impairment rate used for this paper is 67.63%. The total fiscal impact and operating expenditure for the forecast period taking this impairment into account are presented in the table below: 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:19:32 4 $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: 9.000 1 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 Tax Revenue Non-Departmental Other Expense: 17.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 Impairment of debt and debt write-offs Total operating 8.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 Publicity 19. Inland Revenue will publish an item about these changes in the next available issue of its Tax Information Bulletin, the February 2023 issue. However, since the proposed changes will apply from 17 January 2023, a timelier notification method is required. Therefore, Inland Revenue will also publish a special report on the changes once the Order in Council has been made. Proactive Release 20. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 21. The Treasury, the New Zealand Customs Service, and the Parliamentary Counsel Office have been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agree with its recommendations. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. agree that the UOMI underpayment rate increase from 7.96% to 9.21%. 2. agree that the UOMI overpayment rate increase from 1.22% to 2.31%. 1 Note this figure differs from the table above due to rounding differences to ensure the table sums correctly. 2qddsziq5 2022-12-01 10:19:32 5 3. agree that the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations (No 3) 2022 give effect to the rates referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above. 4. agree that the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations (No 3) 2022 come into force on 17 January 2023. 5. note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendations 1 and 2 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: 9.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 Tax Revenue Non-Departmental Other Expense: 17.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 38.000 Impairment of debt and debt write-offs Total operating 8.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 19.000 6. approve the forecast change in appropriations for Non-Departmental Other Expenses set out in recommendation 5, as a result of the decision in recommendations 1 and 2, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance. 7. agree that the proposed change to the Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs appropriation for 2022/23 above be included in the 2022/23 Supplementary Estimates and that, in the interim, the increase(s) be met from Imprest Supply: 8. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations (No 3) 2022.

As part of this, we are seeking Cabinet’s endorsement of the . Relation to Government Priorities 2.Reducing child poverty is critical to the Government’s priority of improving child wellbeing and laying the foundations for the future. 3.Addressing debt owed to government is an important part of addressing child poverty. Reducing household debt for low-income families increases the funds available to families, reduces the stress they experience, and increases opportunities. Reducing debt for people in hardship will help some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable children and help the Government make progress towards achieving its child poverty targets. Executive Summary 4.Cabinet invited the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction, the Minister for Social Development and Employment, the Minister of Revenue, and the Minister of Justice to report back on the Debt to Government work programme by July 2022 to outline the outcome of Phase One work and the plan for Phase Two \[SWC- 21-MIN-0171\]. 5.Phase One primarily involved progressing the work that can be done within agencies and laying the foundations for future cross-agency work.

The following work has been completed: 6.1 Budget 2022 introduced two initiatives as part of the Hardship Assistance Review: 6.1.1 The first permanently increased the income limits for Special Needs Grants, Recoverable Assistance payments, and Advance Payments of benefit. It also indexed the limits to average wage growth from 1 April 2023. 6.1.2 The second will increase the maximum Special Needs Grant for immediate and essential dental treatment from $300 to $1000 and continue to allow the limit to be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. 6.2 6.3 Budget 2022 approved funding to update key legal aid policy settings around eligibility, repayment, and legal aid lawyers’ remuneration. 6.4 Initial data analysis was completed by the Social Wellbeing Agency (SWA) on persistent debt to government. 6.5 The final changes resulting from the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 were implemented in November 2021. IR has developed its plan for evaluating the recent child support changes, and preliminary findings will be available by December 2022. 7. 8.

We propose that officials would report to joint ministers in November 2022 on the progress of the work. In particular, officials would: 10.1 10.2 10.3 10.4 Background 11. Following advice from the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) and the Tax Working Group (TWG) to address individuals’ debt owed to government, a cross-agency group of officials was convened in 2019 to consider a cross- government approach to prevent and manage debt as part of the welfare overhaul. Since then, work has progressed to highlight the importance of addressing this issue, and particularly for the wellbeing of low-income individuals and families. 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 4 \[SENSITIVE\] 12. Evidence shows that many people on lower incomes with debt have children. Approximately 566,600 low-income individuals owe $3.5 billion of debt to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), Inland Revenue (IR), and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and of these, over $2.5 billion is owed to people in households with children. Individual debt can form and accrue for multiple reasons, and these can interact, creating a highly complex situation for both individuals and agencies to manage. 13. Income inadequacy is often the source of entrenched debt for individuals and their families. However, the management of these debts through a variety of differing policies and processes across government agencies can exacerbate the issue, making it difficult for people to understand why they are required to pay amounts or repay overpaid entitlements, or whether or not they are eligible to have a debt considered for write off. 14. While some types of debt can be an important mechanism for the enforcement of social obligations, such as child support or fines, the negative impacts of debt can include: 14.1 A reduction in income adequacy for the debtors and their families as people with lower incomes may not have the ability to repay debt without being put into hardship. 14.2 Psychological stress, especially when debt is persistent. High levels of debt can make people feel that improving their situation is impossible, which leads them to ignore the issue or disengage with agencies. 14.3 Disincentives to work when repayments are based on income earned. 15. The Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee (SWC) has agreed the Debt to Government work programme should have the dual focuses of: 15.1 ensuring debt recovery is fair, effective, and avoids exacerbating hardship; and 15.2 preventing debt from occurring so that it does not create future problems for those in hardship. 16. The work would also follow principles of improving coherence by improving consistency across the system where appropriate and focusing on fairness. 17. Alongside the Debt to Government work, the welfare overhaul also includes a focus on addressing income adequacy which may contribute to a reduced reliance on debt for low-income families. 18. In November 2021, the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction, Minister for Social Development and Employment, Minister of Revenue, and Minister of Justice (together, the joint Ministers) reported to SWC on the Debt to Government work programme on the planned phases of the work programme. 19. Phase One was primarily a foundational phase, consisting of work to understand and define the issues across agencies’ approaches to debt 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 5 \[SENSITIVE\] generation and recovery \[SWC-21-SUB-0171\]. Phase One focussed on changes agencies could implement independently. \]. 20. This paper details the initiatives which have been completed, those which are still in progress, and plans for next steps of this work programme. Progress to date Work completed since 2021 21. A number of initiatives have been completed as part of the Phase One work programme: Budget 2022 changes to hardship assistance 22. We have permanently increased income limits for Special Needs Grants, Recoverable Assistance Payments, and Advance Payments of Benefit from 1 July 2022 and these income limits will be indexed to average wage growth from 1 April 2023. 23. In December this year, we will increase the maximum dental treatment Special Needs Grant rate from $300 to $1000 in a 52-week period, which will reduce debt for future recipients (approximately 40,000 people per year). 24. Budget 2022 changes to legal aid 25. In Budget 2022, the Government invested $148.7 million to implement changes to the legal aid scheme to improve access to justice for people on low incomes. The package of changes is expected to increase access to government-funded legal aid and to reduce debt experienced by low-income New Zealanders. Social Wellbeing Agency analysis of persistent debt 26. The Social Wellbeing Agency has completed a data analysis on persistent debt to government. This analysis indicates that more than half of the people who owe debt to government have owed debt for two or more years. A third have owed debt for five or more years. This means that a person who does not become debt-free within two years has a greater than 65 percent chance of remaining in debt for at least the next three years. 27. The Social Wellbeing Agency proposes to publish its full report when the SWC paper is published. Next steps for this work are covered in paragraph 36.

The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 included several changes which are intended to help parents meet their child support obligations and prevent new debt by ensuring liable parents get their payments right from the start of their liability. The removal of incremental penalties is also expected to help parents engage with their core obligations. Final changes were implemented in November 2021, and IR has developed a plan to evaluate the impacts. Work in progress 29. A number of initiatives have continued to progress. Progress on an overarching debt framework 30. Cabinet directed officials to explore the development of a framework for how to approach clients with debt to repay and/or clients about to take on new debt, as part of work to improve the fairness and coherence of operational processes and policy \[SWC-21-MIN-0171\]. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Revenue has worked with officials to develop this framework. 31. 31.1 31.2 32.

Court attachment orders 36. Attachment orders are the most common method of enforcing debts that have been ordered by the Courts. These debts arise through civil litigation, and the debt can only be enforced once there is a court order in favour of the creditor. If the debtor is receiving a benefit, MSD must comply with the attachment and deduct the debt owing according to the rate set by the order. The only exception is when existing deductions from a client’s benefit mean that the attachment rate would breach the protected earnings rate, leading to the attachment being set at any residual amount. Currently about 80% of attachment orders are collected through deductions from benefits rather than creditors seeking to make deductions from wages 1 . 37. Court Registry Officers cannot see existing deductions from an MSD client’s benefit, so they have low visibility over what may be affordable and sustainable for the client. 38. 1 Figures on application for civil enforcement provided by the Ministry in June 2021, under the OIA 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 8 \[SENSITIVE\] Options to address persistent debt 39. SWC requested a report back on options to address (e.g., prevent or write-off) persistent debt based on the findings of the SWA’s analysis of the drivers of persistent debt. Overpaid benefit debt 40. There are a range of circumstances that can lead to an overpayment of a benefit with one of the most common being a change in a person’s income.

Improvements in the information sharing process between MSD and IR in May 2022 increased the ability for MSD to process income changes earlier in the month. 42.

The common debtors pilot was a joint initiative between MSD and IR to assist people with debt to both agencies (child support and benefit debt). It ran from April 2021 to March 2022 and an evaluation of the pilot was completed on 30 June 2022. The purpose of the pilot was to make it simpler and easier for these common debtors to repay their debt obligations in a sustainable manner, and ensure they were receiving the income supports they were entitled to or eligible for. 54. The pilot operated using a three-way call service with the debtor and staff from both agencies. Results from the pilot were mixed. There was difficulty in getting debtors to engage with the pilot; of the 2,128 individuals contacted to take part in the pilot, only 235 completed the service. Furthermore, of those who completed the service, 153 entered into repayment arrangements, and fewer than 40% of these had sustained their repayments three months after the pilot was finished. The evaluation showed that the individuals who participated and completed the pilot found the experience to be positive, as staff were able to consider the participants’ circumstances and built an ongoing relationship during the pilot. However, the pilot was resource-intensive given the outcome. 55. A key insight from this experience is that repayment of debt can be fundamentally difficult for some individuals, despite attempts to provide personalised support. 56. Results from the pilot indicate the value of increased inter-agency information sharing on debt and debtors, and of training staff about entitlements from other agencies. Our plan going forward 57. As evidenced by the number of initiatives and work currently underway, the Debt to Government work programme is substantial, and with good reason. The issues are complex to understand, and solutions will take time to fully consider. Some of the solutions could involve policy, operational, and legislative change as well as fiscal costs. For that reason, we are seeking SWC to agree 58. Because the underlying policy and operational settings relating both to debt creation and management are complex, the development of cross-agency options is anticipated to now occur over a longer timeframe. Creating meaningful and long-term change for individuals and families who are in debt will require further understanding of complex issues such as hardship, sustainability of repayment, and collaboration and info-sharing between departments. 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 12 \[SENSITIVE\] Finalising a framework for debt to government 59.

Population Implications Population group How the Debt to Government work may affect this group Māori The debt to government work will have positive impacts on Māori individuals and whānau. Among those with debt to government, Māori are disproportionately likely to be on a low income or in receipt of a benefit (22 percent of all Māori working- age adults are on a main benefit). Māori individuals are overrepresented in almost all categories of debt to MSD, MoJ, and IR, and are overrepresented in people with debt to multiple agencies (Māori comprise 44 percent of those with debt to all three agencies). 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 16 \[SENSITIVE\] Children The debt to government work underway includes assessing the generation of several types of debt that may be held by a family unit that has children (WFF overpayments, MSD overpayments and recoverable assistance, legal aid). Reducing the creation of debt to government and the role that this debt may have in exacerbating hardship will therefore have a positive effect on children. Seniors The debt to government work will have a positive impact on seniors. Where debt is persistent, seniors who are on a fixed income (i.e., pensioners) may find old debts are reinstated or able to be collected at a stage of their life where they may not have the income to meet their costs. 11 percent of people with debt to government are aged over 65. Disabled people The debt to government work is likely to benefit disabled people. While government data for disabled people is poor, we know they are more likely to be in hardship than non-disabled people. Incomes for disabled people are on average lower than those for non-disabled people, and disabled people, including people with health conditions, and carers of disabled people make up approximately 53 percent of all people in receipt of a main benefit. 65 percent of people receiving a supported living payment benefit (one of the benefit types most likely to capture disability) have debt to government. Disaggregated child poverty statistics also identify that disabled children and children living in households where someone is disabled comprise more than half of all children in material hardship. Pacific peoples The debt to government work will have positive impacts on Pacific people. Pacific people are overrepresented in all categories of debt to MSD, MoJ, and IR, and are overrepresented in people with debt to multiple agencies (Pacific people comprise 13 percent of those with debt to all three agencies). Among those with debt to government, Pacific people are disproportionately likely to be on a low income or in receipt of a benefit. Women Women are overrepresented in several categories of debt to MSD (including recoverable assistance and overpayments), MoJ (legal aid), and IR (WFF overpayments), and in some areas of debt across multiple agencies. Women make up 68 percent of those receiving a main benefit. Rural populations The debt to government work will have slightly more of an impact to people who live in urban populations than rural populations. This is because the distribution of people with debt to government across urban and rural areas is broadly similar to the distribution of the New Zealand population and people with debt to MSD or MoJ are slightly more likely to live in an urban area than the general population. Ethnic communities The results from the debt to government analysis show that about 18% of the NZ population is in this group, but less than 13% of any debt category are in this group. Hence debt to government does not appear to affect ethnic communities to the same extent as other ethnic groups. Consultation 80.

Relation to Government Priorities 2.Reducing child poverty is critical to the Government’s priority of improving child wellbeing and laying the foundations for the future. 3.Addressing debt owed to government is an important part of addressing child poverty. Reducing household debt for low-income families increases the funds available to families, reduces the stress they experience, and increases opportunities. Reducing debt for people in hardship will help some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable children and help the Government make progress towards achieving its child poverty targets. Executive Summary 4.Cabinet invited the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction, the Minister for Social Development and Employment, the Minister of Revenue, and the Minister of Justice to report back on the Debt to Government work programme by July 2022 to outline the outcome of Phase One work and the plan for Phase Two \[SWC- 21-MIN-0171\]. 5.Phase One primarily involved progressing the work that can be done within agencies and laying the foundations for future cross-agency work.

It also indexed the limits to average wage growth from 1 April 2023. 6.1.2 The second will increase the maximum Special Needs Grant for immediate and essential dental treatment from $300 to $1000 and continue to allow the limit to be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. 6.2 6.3 Budget 2022 approved funding to update key legal aid policy settings around eligibility, repayment, and legal aid lawyers’ remuneration. 6.4 Initial data analysis was completed by the Social Wellbeing Agency (SWA) on persistent debt to government. 6.5 The final changes resulting from the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 were implemented in November 2021.

Following advice from the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) and the Tax Working Group (TWG) to address individuals’ debt owed to government, a cross-agency group of officials was convened in 2019 to consider a cross- government approach to prevent and manage debt as part of the welfare overhaul. Since then, work has progressed to highlight the importance of addressing this issue, and particularly for the wellbeing of low-income individuals and families. 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 4 \[SENSITIVE\] 12. Evidence shows that many people on lower incomes with debt have children. Approximately 566,600 low-income individuals owe $3.5 billion of debt to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), Inland Revenue (IR), and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and of these, over $2.5 billion is owed to people in households with children. Individual debt can form and accrue for multiple reasons, and these can interact, creating a highly complex situation for both individuals and agencies to manage. 13. Income inadequacy is often the source of entrenched debt for individuals and their families. However, the management of these debts through a variety of differing policies and processes across government agencies can exacerbate the issue, making it difficult for people to understand why they are required to pay amounts or repay overpaid entitlements, or whether or not they are eligible to have a debt considered for write off. 14. While some types of debt can be an important mechanism for the enforcement of social obligations, such as child support or fines, the negative impacts of debt can include: 14.1 A reduction in income adequacy for the debtors and their families as people with lower incomes may not have the ability to repay debt without being put into hardship. 14.2 Psychological stress, especially when debt is persistent. High levels of debt can make people feel that improving their situation is impossible, which leads them to ignore the issue or disengage with agencies. 14.3 Disincentives to work when repayments are based on income earned. 15. The Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee (SWC) has agreed the Debt to Government work programme should have the dual focuses of: 15.1 ensuring debt recovery is fair, effective, and avoids exacerbating hardship; and 15.2 preventing debt from occurring so that it does not create future problems for those in hardship. 16. The work would also follow principles of improving coherence by improving consistency across the system where appropriate and focusing on fairness. 17. Alongside the Debt to Government work, the welfare overhaul also includes a focus on addressing income adequacy which may contribute to a reduced reliance on debt for low-income families. 18. In November 2021, the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction, Minister for Social Development and Employment, Minister of Revenue, and Minister of Justice (together, the joint Ministers) reported to SWC on the Debt to Government work programme on the planned phases of the work programme. 19. Phase One was primarily a foundational phase, consisting of work to understand and define the issues across agencies’ approaches to debt 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 5 \[SENSITIVE\] generation and recovery \[SWC-21-SUB-0171\]. Phase One focussed on changes agencies could implement independently. \]. 20. This paper details the initiatives which have been completed, those which are still in progress, and plans for next steps of this work programme. Progress to date Work completed since 2021 21. A number of initiatives have been completed as part of the Phase One work programme: Budget 2022 changes to hardship assistance 22. We have permanently increased income limits for Special Needs Grants, Recoverable Assistance Payments, and Advance Payments of Benefit from 1 July 2022 and these income limits will be indexed to average wage growth from 1 April 2023. 23. In December this year, we will increase the maximum dental treatment Special Needs Grant rate from $300 to $1000 in a 52-week period, which will reduce debt for future recipients (approximately 40,000 people per year). 24. Budget 2022 changes to legal aid 25. In Budget 2022, the Government invested $148.7 million to implement changes to the legal aid scheme to improve access to justice for people on low incomes. The package of changes is expected to increase access to government-funded legal aid and to reduce debt experienced by low-income New Zealanders. Social Wellbeing Agency analysis of persistent debt 26. The Social Wellbeing Agency has completed a data analysis on persistent debt to government. This analysis indicates that more than half of the people who owe debt to government have owed debt for two or more years. A third have owed debt for five or more years. This means that a person who does not become debt-free within two years has a greater than 65 percent chance of remaining in debt for at least the next three years. 27. The Social Wellbeing Agency proposes to publish its full report when the SWC paper is published. Next steps for this work are covered in paragraph 36.

The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 included several changes which are intended to help parents meet their child support obligations and prevent new debt by ensuring liable parents get their payments right from the start of their liability. The removal of incremental penalties is also expected to help parents engage with their core obligations. Final changes were implemented in November 2021, and IR has developed a plan to evaluate the impacts. Work in progress 29. A number of initiatives have continued to progress. Progress on an overarching debt framework 30. Cabinet directed officials to explore the development of a framework for how to approach clients with debt to repay and/or clients about to take on new debt, as part of work to improve the fairness and coherence of operational processes and policy \[SWC-21-MIN-0171\]. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Revenue has worked with officials to develop this framework. 31. 31.1 31.2 32.

These debts arise through civil litigation, and the debt can only be enforced once there is a court order in favour of the creditor. If the debtor is receiving a benefit, MSD must comply with the attachment and deduct the debt owing according to the rate set by the order. The only exception is when existing deductions from a client’s benefit mean that the attachment rate would breach the protected earnings rate, leading to the attachment being set at any residual amount. Currently about 80% of attachment orders are collected through deductions from benefits rather than creditors seeking to make deductions from wages 1 . 37. Court Registry Officers cannot see existing deductions from an MSD client’s benefit, so they have low visibility over what may be affordable and sustainable for the client. 38. 1 Figures on application for civil enforcement provided by the Ministry in June 2021, under the OIA 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 8 \[SENSITIVE\] Options to address persistent debt 39.

The purpose of the pilot was to make it simpler and easier for these common debtors to repay their debt obligations in a sustainable manner, and ensure they were receiving the income supports they were entitled to or eligible for. 54. The pilot operated using a three-way call service with the debtor and staff from both agencies. Results from the pilot were mixed. There was difficulty in getting debtors to engage with the pilot; of the 2,128 individuals contacted to take part in the pilot, only 235 completed the service. Furthermore, of those who completed the service, 153 entered into repayment arrangements, and fewer than 40% of these had sustained their repayments three months after the pilot was finished. The evaluation showed that the individuals who participated and completed the pilot found the experience to be positive, as staff were able to consider the participants’ circumstances and built an ongoing relationship during the pilot. However, the pilot was resource-intensive given the outcome. 55. A key insight from this experience is that repayment of debt can be fundamentally difficult for some individuals, despite attempts to provide personalised support. 56. Results from the pilot indicate the value of increased inter-agency information sharing on debt and debtors, and of training staff about entitlements from other agencies. Our plan going forward 57. As evidenced by the number of initiatives and work currently underway, the Debt to Government work programme is substantial, and with good reason. The issues are complex to understand, and solutions will take time to fully consider. Some of the solutions could involve policy, operational, and legislative change as well as fiscal costs. For that reason, we are seeking SWC to agree 58. Because the underlying policy and operational settings relating both to debt creation and management are complex, the development of cross-agency options is anticipated to now occur over a longer timeframe. Creating meaningful and long-term change for individuals and families who are in debt will require further understanding of complex issues such as hardship, sustainability of repayment, and collaboration and info-sharing between departments. 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 12 \[SENSITIVE\] Finalising a framework for debt to government 59.

Population Implications Population group How the Debt to Government work may affect this group Māori The debt to government work will have positive impacts on Māori individuals and whānau. Among those with debt to government, Māori are disproportionately likely to be on a low income or in receipt of a benefit (22 percent of all Māori working- age adults are on a main benefit). Māori individuals are overrepresented in almost all categories of debt to MSD, MoJ, and IR, and are overrepresented in people with debt to multiple agencies (Māori comprise 44 percent of those with debt to all three agencies). 2qddsziq5 2022-10-10 12:59:29 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 16 \[SENSITIVE\] Children The debt to government work underway includes assessing the generation of several types of debt that may be held by a family unit that has children (WFF overpayments, MSD overpayments and recoverable assistance, legal aid). Reducing the creation of debt to government and the role that this debt may have in exacerbating hardship will therefore have a positive effect on children. Seniors The debt to government work will have a positive impact on seniors. Where debt is persistent, seniors who are on a fixed income (i.e., pensioners) may find old debts are reinstated or able to be collected at a stage of their life where they may not have the income to meet their costs. 11 percent of people with debt to government are aged over 65. Disabled people The debt to government work is likely to benefit disabled people. While government data for disabled people is poor, we know they are more likely to be in hardship than non-disabled people. Incomes for disabled people are on average lower than those for non-disabled people, and disabled people, including people with health conditions, and carers of disabled people make up approximately 53 percent of all people in receipt of a main benefit. 65 percent of people receiving a supported living payment benefit (one of the benefit types most likely to capture disability) have debt to government. Disaggregated child poverty statistics also identify that disabled children and children living in households where someone is disabled comprise more than half of all children in material hardship. Pacific peoples The debt to government work will have positive impacts on Pacific people. Pacific people are overrepresented in all categories of debt to MSD, MoJ, and IR, and are overrepresented in people with debt to multiple agencies (Pacific people comprise 13 percent of those with debt to all three agencies). Among those with debt to government, Pacific people are disproportionately likely to be on a low income or in receipt of a benefit. Women Women are overrepresented in several categories of debt to MSD (including recoverable assistance and overpayments), MoJ (legal aid), and IR (WFF overpayments), and in some areas of debt across multiple agencies. Women make up 68 percent of those receiving a main benefit. Rural populations The debt to government work will have slightly more of an impact to people who live in urban populations than rural populations. This is because the distribution of people with debt to government across urban and rural areas is broadly similar to the distribution of the New Zealand population and people with debt to MSD or MoJ are slightly more likely to live in an urban area than the general population. Ethnic communities The results from the debt to government analysis show that about 18% of the NZ population is in this group, but less than 13% of any debt category are in this group. Hence debt to government does not appear to affect ethnic communities to the same extent as other ethnic groups. Consultation 80.

You will recall that under the Income Tax Act 2007, the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) must be adjusted for inflation once the cumulative value of quarterly increases in the CPI reaches 5% since the payment rates were last adjusted. 2. These adjustments ensure the FTC and BSTC retain their real value over time and are achieved through Orders in Council (OIC) under a process set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. 3. The FTC and BSTC were last adjusted with effect from 1 April 2022. Our cross- agency report late last month (IR2022-440 refers) drew Ministers’ attention to the likelihood that the September CPI figures would indicate the 5% threshold would be reached. Ministers agreed that the FTC and BSTC rates should be increased to reflect CPI when this occurs. 4. On 18 October 2022, the CPI figures for the September 2022 quarter were released. As expected, these recent figures indicate that inflation has exceeded 5% since payment rates were last adjusted and that the current FTC and BSTC rates therefore need to be increased. This will mean that the: 4.1 The FTC rate will increase from: 4.1.1 For the eldest child, from $6,642 to $7,121 (i.e. from $127 to $136 per week) after tax; 4.1.2 For a subsequent child, from $5,412 to $5,802 (i.e. from $104 to $111 per week) after tax; and 4.2 BSTC rate will increase from $3,388 to $3,632 (i.e. from $65 to $69 per week) after tax. 5. Although the FTC has been increased by OIC before, this will be the first time the BSTC will have been increased using OIC. Minimum Family Tax Credit 6. The adjustment of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) threshold is required under Cabinet policy rather than by legislation. The intention of the MFTC is to ensure low income working families remain better off financially in full time work than they would be on a main benefit. 7. Because benefit rates are expected to increase from 1 April 2023, the MFTC will similarly need to be increased to ensure that the policy intention is achieved. Based on the projected Half Yearly Economic Fiscal Update (HYEFU) figures, the MFTC will increase from $32,864 to $34,164 (after tax) per annum. IR2022/479: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Minimum Family Tax Credit: Cabinet documents Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8. However, because the HYEFU figures will not be available until 9 November 2022, our current projected change to the MFTC is based on preliminary HYEFU figures. We recommend the enclosed Cabinet Legislation Committee paper delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to revise the MFTC as may be required once the confirmed HYEFU figures are available. 9. We will provide you with further policy advice on MFTC settings if the Sole Parent Benefit differs materially from its expected position once it is confirmed in February 2023. Summary of changes 10. The confirmed changes to the credits discussed above can be summarised below. No change is required to the In Work tax Credit as it is linked to work incentives and is not increased with price inflation.

Funding implications 11. The higher than expected CPI of 7.2% released on 18 October 2022 will increase the costs of CPI indexation which had been estimated at Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2022 (BEFU 2022) by $5.7m in the 2022/23 Financial Year and $20.0m in the 2023/24 Financial Year. 12. However, the preliminary results from the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2022 (HYEFU 2022) indicate that the increased costs from the CPI indexation will be more than offset by other factors (e.g. wage growth) which will reduce the total cost of Working for Families in the 2022/23 and 2023/24 Financial Years. Any difference will be adjusted in the final HYEFU forecasts. Compliance and administrative implications 13. There are no compliance cost implications or changes in administration costs associated with increasing the value of the FTC, BSTC and MFTC. Publications and systems will be updated with the new level as part of the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue’s existing annual processes IR2022/479: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Minimum Family Tax Credit: Cabinet documents Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Communication 14.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Social Wellbeing Committee Order in Council: Increase in Working for Families Tax Credit rates Proposal 1 I seek Cabinet agreement to the increase in Working for Families tax credit rates. I also seek authority to make a submission to the Executive Council of 14 November of the Income Tax Increase in Working for Families Tax Credit Rates Order 2022 (WFF Order) once it is finalised. 2 A series of adjustments to the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) have been proposed to reflect annual price inflation of 7.2% since rates were last adjusted with effect from 1 April 2022. 3 Additionally, the after-tax value of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) will also need to increase to reflect the anticipated wage-growth adjustment of main benefit rates from 1 April 2023. 4 In summary, I propose that, from 1 April 2023, the: 4.1 FTC rates increase from: 4.1.1 For the eldest child, from $6,642 p.a. to $7,121 (i.e. from $127 to $136 per week) after tax; and 4.1.2 For a subsequent child, from $5,412 p.a. to $5,802 (i.e. from $104 to $111 per week) after tax. 4.2 BSTC rate increase from $3,388 p.a. to $3,632 (i.e. from $65 to $69 per week) after tax; and 4.3 MFTC rate increase from $32,864 p.a. to $34,164 p.a. after tax. Policy Best Start Tax Credit and Family Tax Credit 5 The Income Tax Act 2007 requires that the FTC and BSTC payment rates must be adjusted for inflation once the total value of quarterly increases in the CPI reaches 5% since the payment rates were last adjusted. 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 Doc 3 6 The payment rates for the FTC and BSTC were last set by legislative amendment incorporating inflation up to the end of September 2021. Due to the current high rates of inflation, the 5% threshold was exceeded at the end of the September 2022 quarter. The annual inflation rate to the September 2022 quarter was 7.2%. 7 In line with current policy, I recommend that the MFTC threshold should be increased from $32,864 p.a. to $34,164 for the 2023/24 tax year. This increase reflects the average wage growth, and wage indexed main benefit rates that are expected to apply from 1 April 2023. 8 Because the new sole parent rates have not yet been determined and will not be available until February 2023, officials have adjusted the MFTC based on average wage change given by the preliminary Half Yearly Economic Fiscal Update (HYEFU) figures. 9 The confirmed HYEFU figures will be available after 9 November 2022. I recommend that the MFTC be revised, if required, once the confirmed HYEFU numbers are available. Financial implications 10 There are no financial implications associated with adjusting the rates of Working for Families Tax Credits by inflation. The higher than expected CPI of 7.2% will increase the forecast costs of CPI indexation, which had been estimated at Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2022, by $5.7m in the 2022/23 Fiscal Year and $20.0m in the 2023/24 Fiscal Year. 11 However, the preliminary results from the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2022 (HYEFU 2022) indicate that the increased costs from the CPI indexation will be more than offset by other factors (e.g. wage growth) which will reduce the total cost of Working for Families in the 2022/23 Fiscal Year. Timing and 28-day rule 12 The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the Order to be made no later than 1 December and to come into effect and apply from 1 April following that date. The Order therefore is in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 Compliance 13 The Order complies with: a. the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; b. the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993; c. the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; and d. relevant international standards and obligations. Regulations Review Committee 14 Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the WFF Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15 The WFF Order will be certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 16 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposals to adjust the FTC and the BSTC for inflation are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that the government is required to make the adjustment by the Income Tax Act 2007. 17 The proposal to adjust the MFTC in line with increases to main benefit rates is also exempted by the Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team. The exemption is on the grounds that it has no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities, as the adjustment maintains relativities and is required by established Cabinet policy. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 18 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) teams has been consulted and confirms the CIPA requirements to not apply to these proposals as the threshold for significance is not met. 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 Publicity 19 I intend to make an announcement regarding the increase in the amount of the Working for Families tax credits after Cabinet has agreed to the recommendations. This may be before the Executive Council has authorised the Order on 14 November. 20 Inland Revenue will publish an item in its Tax Information Bulletin series, and relevant publications and material will be updated to incorporate the new amount. The Ministry for Social Development may also update its publicly available information. 21 Existing recipients will be contacted in early 2023 with an updated estimate of their Working for Families tax credits entitlement for the tax year beginning 1 April 2023. 22 The Order will be published in the New Zealand Gazette. Proactive release 23 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 24 The Treasury and Ministry of Social Development have been consulted on this paper. Recommendations I recommend that the Social Wellbeing Committee: 1 Note that Cabinet agreed: a. in April 2004, to increase the Minimum Family Tax Credit from 1 April 2006 onwards by an amount sufficient to ensure that families do not suffer a reduction in income when moving off a welfare benefit and into full-time paid work \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]; b. in December 2020, to calculate the threshold based on sole parents moving off benefit at 20 hours being better off, rather than couples at 30 hours \[CAB-2-MIN-0512 refers\]; and c. in April 2021, to change the approach to calculating the Minimum Family Tax Credit so that the Winter Energy Payment of the formula equates to five months of payments rather than 12 months of payments \[CAB-21- MIN-0116.33 refers\]; 2 Agree that (subject to the finalised HYEFU figures) the annual amount of the Minimum Family Tax Credit increase from $32,864 to $34,164 (i.e. from $38,647 to $40,223 gross) for the tax year beginning 1 April 2023, as allowed under section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 3 Agree that the amount of the Family Tax Credit increase from: a.

You will recall that under the Income Tax Act 2007, the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) must be adjusted for inflation once the cumulative value of quarterly increases in the CPI reaches 5% since the payment rates were last adjusted. 2. These adjustments ensure the FTC and BSTC retain their real value over time and are achieved through Orders in Council (OIC) under a process set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. 3. The FTC and BSTC were last adjusted with effect from 1 April 2022. Our cross- agency report late last month (IR2022-440 refers) drew Ministers’ attention to the likelihood that the September CPI figures would indicate the 5% threshold would be reached. Ministers agreed that the FTC and BSTC rates should be increased to reflect CPI when this occurs. 4. On 18 October 2022, the CPI figures for the September 2022 quarter were released. As expected, these recent figures indicate that inflation has exceeded 5% since payment rates were last adjusted and that the current FTC and BSTC rates therefore need to be increased. This will mean that the: 4.1 The FTC rate will increase from: 4.1.1 For the eldest child, from $6,642 to $7,121 (i.e. from $127 to $136 per week) after tax; 4.1.2 For a subsequent child, from $5,412 to $5,802 (i.e. from $104 to $111 per week) after tax; and 4.2 BSTC rate will increase from $3,388 to $3,632 (i.e. from $65 to $69 per week) after tax. 5. Although the FTC has been increased by OIC before, this will be the first time the BSTC will have been increased using OIC. Minimum Family Tax Credit 6. The adjustment of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) threshold is required under Cabinet policy rather than by legislation. The intention of the MFTC is to ensure low income working families remain better off financially in full time work than they would be on a main benefit. 7. Because benefit rates are expected to increase from 1 April 2023, the MFTC will similarly need to be increased to ensure that the policy intention is achieved. Based on the projected Half Yearly Economic Fiscal Update (HYEFU) figures, the MFTC will increase from $32,864 to $34,164 (after tax) per annum. IR2022/479: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Minimum Family Tax Credit: Cabinet documents Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8. However, because the HYEFU figures will not be available until 9 November 2022, our current projected change to the MFTC is based on preliminary HYEFU figures. We recommend the enclosed Cabinet Legislation Committee paper delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to revise the MFTC as may be required once the confirmed HYEFU figures are available. 9. We will provide you with further policy advice on MFTC settings if the Sole Parent Benefit differs materially from its expected position once it is confirmed in February 2023. Summary of changes 10. The confirmed changes to the credits discussed above can be summarised below. No change is required to the In Work tax Credit as it is linked to work incentives and is not increased with price inflation. Tax credit payment: (annualised) From ($) To ($) Change ($) Fiscal cost ($m) Family Tax Credit Eldest child rate 6,642 7, 121 479 249 Subsequent child rate 5,412 5,802 390 Best Start Tax Credit 3,388 3,632 244 23 Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold 32,864 34,164 1,300 5 In-work Tax Credit\* 3,770 3,770 n/a 19 \*T he in-work tax credit cost increase is due to higher FTC payments. Funding implications 11. The higher than expected CPI of 7.2% released on 18 October 2022 will increase the costs of CPI indexation which had been estimated at Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2022 (BEFU 2022) by $5.7m in the 2022/23 Financial Year and $20.0m in the 2023/24 Financial Year. 12. However, the preliminary results from the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2022 (HYEFU 2022) indicate that the increased costs from the CPI indexation will be more than offset by other factors (e.g. wage growth) which will reduce the total cost of Working for Families in the 2022/23 and 2023/24 Financial Years. Any difference will be adjusted in the final HYEFU forecasts. Compliance and administrative implications 13. There are no compliance cost implications or changes in administration costs associated with increasing the value of the FTC, BSTC and MFTC. Publications and systems will be updated with the new level as part of the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue’s existing annual processes IR2022/479: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Minimum Family Tax Credit: Cabinet documents Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Communication 14. We understand the Government would like to announce these changes following their consideration at Cabinet Legislation Committee on 27 October 2022. We are able to liaise with your office as required and provide you with supporting materials for an announcement. Consultation 15. The Ministry of Social Development and the Treasury have been consulted during the preparation of this report and agree with its recommendations. Proactive release considerations 16. Officials recommend that this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers should be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Personal information will be redacted. Next steps 17. Giving effect to your decisions will require the following administrative steps: 17.1 Subject to your approval, lodging the Cabinet paper in time for Cabinet Legislation Committee on 27 October 2022; and 17.2 Providing drafting instructions to Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) so that the Order in Council can be prepared and provided to Executive Council for 14 November 2022; 18. A draft Cabinet paper has been attached for you to take for consideration to the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 27 October 2022. 19. We will provide your Office with a set of speaking notes to assist you at that meeting. Recommended action We recommend that you: Changes to Working for Families Tax Credits 1. Note that the recent decision to make CPI-indexation increases to FTC and BSTC rates will result in the: a. FTC rate increasing: i. For the eldest child, from $6,642 to $7,121 (i.e. from $127 to $136 per week) after tax; ii. For a subsequent child, from $5,412 to $5,802 (i.e. from $104 to $111 per week) after tax; and b. BSTC rate will increase from $3,388 to $3,632 (i.e. from $65 to $69 per week) after tax.

On 20 October 2022, we provided you with a report (IR2022/470 refers) which advised you on the indexation of the Family Tax Credit (FTC), Best Start Credit (BSTC), and the adjustment of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). The MFTC amount was based on provisional Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update (HYEFU) forecasts. 2. A Cabinet paper was considered by the Social Wellbeing Committee on 26 October 2022 (SWC-22-MIN-0190) and confirmed by Cabinet on 31 October 2022 (CAB-22- MIN-0469). The Cabinet paper sought authority to allow you to finalise the amount of the MFTC and submit the Order in Council to the Executive Council once the confirmed HYEFU figures were available after 9 November 2022. 3. On Sunday 6 November the Prime Minister announced these increases to the Family Tax Credit and Best Start Tax Credit as part of the Government’s Cost of Living Package. The adjustment of the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold has yet to be announced. Final amounts 4. The confirmed HYEFU figures are now available. These do affect the previously indicated adjustment to the MFTC, increasing the amount from the provisional 34,164 to the finalised 34,216. 5. Accordingly, the final adjustments to the Working for Families Tax Credits are as follows: Tax credit payment (annualised) From ($) To ($) Change ($) Fiscal cost ($m) Family Tax Credit Eldest child rate 6,642 7,121 479 249 Subsequent child rate 5,412 5,802 390 Best Start Tax Credit 3,388 3,632 244 23 Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold 32,864 34,216 1,352 5 In-work Tax Credit\* 3,770 3,770 n/a 19 \* The in-work tax credit cost increase is due to higher FTC payments.

These adjustments are reflected in the drafting of the Order in Council (OIC) which Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) will provide to Cabinet Office. The title of this OIC is the Income Tax (Tax Credit) Order 2022. 7. A copy of the “goatskin” which accompanies the OIC will need to be provided to the Cabinet Office by 11 November 2022. 8. This, along with the OIC, will be present at Executive Council at its meeting at 4:00 p.m. on 14 November 2022. Consultation 9. The Ministry of Social Development and the Treasury w ere informed of the content of this report. Next steps 10. Finalising the above adjustments will require you to attend the Executive Council meeting of 14 November 2022, at 4:00 p.m. Recommended action We recommend that you: 11. Note that Cabinet agreed that you would finalise the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) amount and submit the Order in Council once the confirmed Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update forecasts were ready. Noted 12. Note the updated MFTC amount from the finalised Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update forecasts is now $34,216. Noted 13. Note that the Order in Council will be at the Executive Council meeting at 4:00 p.m. on 14 November 2022. Maraina Hak Policy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / /2022 s 9(2)(a) In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Social Wellbeing Committee Order in Council: Increase in Working for Families Tax Credit rates Proposal 1 I seek Cabinet agreement to the increase in Working for Families tax credit rates. I also seek authority to make a submission to the Executive Council of 14 November of the Income Tax Increase in Working for Families Tax Credit Rates Order 2022 (WFF Order) once it is finalised. 2 A series of adjustments to the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) have been proposed to reflect annual price inflation of 7.2% since rates were last adjusted with effect from 1 April 2022. 3 Additionally, the after-tax value of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) will also need to increase to reflect the anticipated wage-growth adjustment of main benefit rates from 1 April 2023. 4 In summary, I propose that, from 1 April 2023, the: 4.1 FTC rates increase from: 4.1.1 For the eldest child, from $6,642 p.a. to $7,121 (i.e. from $127 to $136 per week) after tax; and 4.1.2 For a subsequent child, from $5,412 p.a. to $5,802 (i.e. from $104 to $111 per week) after tax. 4.2 BSTC rate increase from $3,388 p.a. to $3,632 (i.e. from $65 to $69 per week) after tax; and 4.3 MFTC rate increase from $32,864 p.a. to $34,164 p.a. after tax. Policy Best Start Tax Credit and Family Tax Credit 5 The Income Tax Act 2007 requires that the FTC and BSTC payment rates must be adjusted for inflation once the total value of quarterly increases in the CPI reaches 5% since the payment rates were last adjusted. 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 Doc 3 6 The payment rates for the FTC and BSTC were last set by legislative amendment incorporating inflation up to the end of September 2021. Due to the current high rates of inflation, the 5% threshold was exceeded at the end of the September 2022 quarter. The annual inflation rate to the September 2022 quarter was 7.2%. 7 In line with current policy, I recommend that the MFTC threshold should be increased from $32,864 p.a. to $34,164 for the 2023/24 tax year. This increase reflects the average wage growth, and wage indexed main benefit rates that are expected to apply from 1 April 2023. 8 Because the new sole parent rates have not yet been determined and will not be available until February 2023, officials have adjusted the MFTC based on average wage change given by the preliminary Half Yearly Economic Fiscal Update (HYEFU) figures. 9 The confirmed HYEFU figures will be available after 9 November 2022. I recommend that the MFTC be revised, if required, once the confirmed HYEFU numbers are available. Financial implications 10 There are no financial implications associated with adjusting the rates of Working for Families Tax Credits by inflation. The higher than expected CPI of 7.2% will increase the forecast costs of CPI indexation, which had been estimated at Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2022, by $5.7m in the 2022/23 Fiscal Year and $20.0m in the 2023/24 Fiscal Year. 11 However, the preliminary results from the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2022 (HYEFU 2022) indicate that the increased costs from the CPI indexation will be more than offset by other factors (e.g. wage growth) which will reduce the total cost of Working for Families in the 2022/23 Fiscal Year. Timing and 28-day rule 12 The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the Order to be made no later than 1 December and to come into effect and apply from 1 April following that date. The Order therefore is in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 Compliance 13 The Order complies with: a. the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; b. the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993; c. the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; and d. relevant international standards and obligations. Regulations Review Committee 14 Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the WFF Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15 The WFF Order will be certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 16 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposals to adjust the FTC and the BSTC for inflation are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that the government is required to make the adjustment by the Income Tax Act 2007. 17 The proposal to adjust the MFTC in line with increases to main benefit rates is also exempted by the Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team. The exemption is on the grounds that it has no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities, as the adjustment maintains relativities and is required by established Cabinet policy. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 18 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) teams has been consulted and confirms the CIPA requirements to not apply to these proposals as the threshold for significance is not met. 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 Publicity 19 I intend to make an announcement regarding the increase in the amount of the Working for Families tax credits after Cabinet has agreed to the recommendations. This may be before the Executive Council has authorised the Order on 14 November. 20 Inland Revenue will publish an item in its Tax Information Bulletin series, and relevant publications and material will be updated to incorporate the new amount. The Ministry for Social Development may also update its publicly available information. 21 Existing recipients will be contacted in early 2023 with an updated estimate of their Working for Families tax credits entitlement for the tax year beginning 1 April 2023. 22 The Order will be published in the New Zealand Gazette. Proactive release 23 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 24 The Treasury and Ministry of Social Development have been consulted on this paper. Recommendations I recommend that the Social Wellbeing Committee: 1 Note that Cabinet agreed: a. in April 2004, to increase the Minimum Family Tax Credit from 1 April 2006 onwards by an amount sufficient to ensure that families do not suffer a reduction in income when moving off a welfare benefit and into full-time paid work \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]; b. in December 2020, to calculate the threshold based on sole parents moving off benefit at 20 hours being better off, rather than couples at 30 hours \[CAB-2-MIN-0512 refers\]; and c. in April 2021, to change the approach to calculating the Minimum Family Tax Credit so that the Winter Energy Payment of the formula equates to five months of payments rather than 12 months of payments \[CAB-21- MIN-0116.33 refers\]; 2 Agree that (subject to the finalised HYEFU figures) the annual amount of the Minimum Family Tax Credit increase from $32,864 to $34,164 (i.e. from $38,647 to $40,223 gross) for the tax year beginning 1 April 2023, as allowed under section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 77a3n3k20l 2022-11-03 14:19:43 3 Agree that the amount of the Family Tax Credit increase from: a.

This report outlines the process for increasing the student loan repayment threshold for New Zealand-based borrowers from 1 April 2021 and recommends you take a paper to Cabinet on this matter. 2. The current policy is to adjust the loan repayment threshold for movement in the Consumer Price Index - all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products (CPI-ex tobacco) every year. 3. The current repayment threshold is $20,020 per year. Under the current policy the new threshold would be $20,280 and would apply from 1 April 2021. This would allow New Zealand-based student loan borrowers to earn an additional $260 of income per year (or $5 per week) before they must begin to make loan repayments. 4. The impacts of adjusting the repayment threshold are already accounted for in the forecast. However, the Parliamentary Counsel Office will need to be instructed to draft the necessary regulations to increase the threshold and Cabinet authorisation is needed for the regulations to go to the Executive Council. 5. It is preferable for the regulations to be passed by 9 December to allow payroll providers time to make the necessary changes to payroll software in time for the 2021/22 income year. Recommended action We recommend that you: a) Note officials support the continuation of the current policy to adjust the student loan repayment threshold for inflation annually. Noted b) Agree that the Parliamentary Counsel Office be instructed to draft the necessary regulations to increase the student loan repayment threshold to $20,280 and that the threshold apply from 1 April 2021.

Referred Maraina Hak Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / / 2020 In Confidence IR2020/459: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 6. The student loan repayment threshold sets the amount of annual income at which a New Zealand-based borrower is required to begin making loan repayments. The threshold is a mechanism to reduce the likelihood that a low-income borrower would be placed into f inancial hardship as a consequence of their student loan repayment obligations. 7. The student loan repayment threshold is prescribed by regulation through an Order in Council. 8. The Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2019 set the annual repayment threshold for the 2020/21 tax year at $20,020. This was an increase from $19,760 for the 2019/20 tax year. Process for calculating the threshold adjustment 9. Since 2016, Government policy has been that the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted annually in line with the CPI-ex tobacco ( September quarter) \[CAB-16- MIN-0655 refers\]. Adjusting the repayment threshold for inflation maintains the real value of the amount of income someone can earn before they are required to begin repaying their student loan. 10. Officials consider that the policy of annual adjustments to the repayment threshold should continue. This is consistent with inflation adjustments made to other forms of social assistance. The threshold for 2021/22 tax year 11. The CPI-ex tobacco for the quarter ending 30 September 2020 was up 1. 2% on the September 2019 quarter. Applying the CPI-ex tobacco value to the formula set out in the Appendix to this report produces a new annual threshold of $20,280. This would mean that New Zealand-based student loan borrowers could earn an additional $2 60 per year (or $5 per week) before being required to make loan repayments. Regulations to be made by Order in Council 12. To increase the student loan repayment threshold to $20,280 per year from 1 April 2021, we recommend that the Parliamentary Counsel Office be instructed to draft regulations under s 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 13. Ideally, the Order in Council should be made before 9 December 2020 to provide sufficient time for payroll providers to build the new threshold amount into payroll specifications in time for the 1 April 2021 application date. Financial implications 14. The impacts of adjusting the threshold from 1 April 2021 using the current methodology are already accounted for in forecasts \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative and system implications 15. Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year. Inland Revenue issues a number of draft specifications to allow payroll users to gauge the impacts of payroll changes well in advance of their application. In Confidence IR2020/459: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] These specifications are normally published in December to apply for the following tax year. Proactive release considerations 16. If the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted, officials recommend that the Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Next steps 17. We recommend the attached Cabinet paper be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 26 November for the Cabinet Business Committee meeting on 2 December 2020. In Confidence IR2020/459: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 Page 5 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix Method Application from 1 April 2021 The formula to calculate the student loan repayment threshold for the 2021/22 tax year is: Tnew = Ru (19084 x CPIexcl2 / 986.6778) Where: Tnew is t he new threshold to be effective from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 Ru() is a function which rounds its argument up to the next multiple of 52. CPIexcl2 is the value of the Consumer Price Index excluding cigarettes and tobacco products for 30 September Y-1. 19084 is the unrounded repayment threshold for the year ended 31 March 2017. And 986.6778 1 is the All groups less cigarettes and tobacco subgroup (series SE9NS14800) for September 2015. CPIexcl2 = 1047 (index for September 2020) Tnew = Ru (19084 x CPIexcl2 / 986.6778) Ru (19084 x 1047 / 986.6778) Ru (19084 x 1.06114) Ru ($20,250.80) The next multiple of 52 above 20250.80 is 20280 (52 x 390). 20250.80 is therefore rounded up to 20280. Tnew = $20,280 Proposed threshold from 1 April 2021 is $20,280. 1 In 2017, Statistics New Zealand rebased their inflation index series. Prior to this rebasing, the September 2015 index value used for the purposes of this formula was 1185.
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Business Committee STUDENT LOAN SCHEME (REPAYMENT THRESHOLD) REGULATIONS 2020 Proposal 1. I propose that the Cabinet Business Committee authorise the submission to the Exe cutive Council of the attached Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 (the Regulations). The Regulations increase the income threshold at which New Zealand-based student loan borrowers must begin to repay their student loan, from $20,020 to $20,280, for the tax year beginning 1 April 2021. Policy 2. The policy is to adjust the student loan repayment threshold for inflation yearly. The i nflation adjustment is based upon the September quarter Consumer Price Index – all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products (CPI-ex tobacco). This approach was agreed to in 2016 \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. 3. In line with the policy the student loan repayment threshold increases from $20,020 a year to $20,280 for the tax year beginning 1 April 2021. 4. The repayment threshold limits the likelihood that a low-income borrower would be p laced in financial hardship as a consequence of having to meet student loan repayment obligations. This year’s adjustment would mean New Zealand-based borrowers could earn an additional $5 per week ($260 per year) before being required to make repayments on their outstanding student loan balance. Financial implications 5. The impacts of adjusting the student loan repayment threshold, using the current me thodology, are already accounted for in the forecast \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative implications 6. Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax ye ar. Inland Revenue issues specifications to allow payroll users to gauge the impacts of payroll changes on their software well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally published in December to apply for the next tax year. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2020-12-14 10:24:11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact analysis 7. The Regulatory Quality Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the basis that they have no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not for profit entities. Consultation 8. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Education on the proposal to i ncrease the repayment threshold for the 2021/22 tax year. Timing and 28-day rule 9. A waiver of the 28-day rule is not required as the Regulations are not proposed to co me into force until 1 April 2021 and will apply for the 2021/22 tax year. Publicity 10. Inland Revenue will publish information about the new threshold and its impact in the st udent loan section of its website. 11. Inland Revenue will publish an article about this change in its T ax Information Bulletin. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 12. The Regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Regulations Review Committee 13. Officials consider that as the adjustment is of a minor and routine nature, it is u nnecessary to refer the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 to the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Compliance 14. The regulations comply with: 14.1 The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 14.2 The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 o r the Human Rights Act 1993; 14.3 The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; and 14.4 Relevant international standards and obligations. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2020-12-14 10:24:11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive release 15. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in line with the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note t hat the policy is for the student loan repayment threshold to be adjusted for inflation every year. 2. note t hat an Order in Council is required under section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to adjust the repayment threshold. 3. note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 increase the student loan repayment threshold to $20,280 for the 2021/22 tax year and come into force on 1 April 2021. 4. authorise t he submission to the Executive Council of the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee GST ON FEES CHARGED TO MANAGED FUNDS Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to proposed changes to the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) treatment of fund manager and investment manager fees charged to managed funds and retirement scheme funds, including KiwiSaver schemes. Relation to Government Priorities 2.The Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme allocates policy resource to maintaining the tax system to ensure that the Taxation Acts are updated to reflect changes in technology, business practices, jurisprudence or other factors. This supports the health and integrity of the tax system by ensuring that laws work as intended. This proposal is required for these reasons. Executive Summary 3.Goods and Services Tax is a 15% consumption tax on the supply of goods and services supplied to consumers in New Zealand. However, there are certain types of goods and services that are ‘exempt’ from GST. That is, GST is not imposed on these supplies. One form of exempt supply is financial services (such as the services managed funds supply to their investors). 4.The current GST treatment of management services supplied to KiwiSaver funds and other managed funds is complex and inconsistent. The GST treatment (that impacts the total price paid) of the services supplied by a fund manager or investment manager to managed funds can range from being 100% GST exempt to 100% subject to 15% GST. 5.These issues have resulted in an uneven playing field which may be distorting competition, leading to higher compliance costs and less GST revenue collected. As well, due to the complexity of the existing law, the various GST practices are not consistent with current GST laws. 6.Submissions received on the February 2020 GST Policy Issues paper were mixed, with most favouring their particular existing GST treatment for the whole industry. Some submitters suggested their current industry practice of applying a mix of 90% exempt / 10% taxable (effectively imposing a 1.5% tax on managers’ fees) should be retained and legislated for across the industry. Other submitters preferred their current 4. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] approach of 100% of the fees being subject to 15% GST being retained and legislated for across the industry. 7. In recent months, my officials have met with key stakeholders such as managed funds (broadly split between larger funds and boutique funds) that will be impacted by any change and private sector GST advisors to discuss potential reform options, including retaining the current industry practices. 8. I am recommending all fund managers and investment managers fees charged to managed funds, including KiwiSaver funds, should be subject to 15% GST. This will provide simplicity and consistency across the industry and ensure there is a fair marketplace that is not distorted by the GST rules. 9. Because the recommended rules will impose GST on fund manager and investment manager fees, and the funds cannot claim back this GST cost as a GST input deduction, it is anticipated that much of this GST cost will ‘flow-through’ to fund investors in the form of higher fund fees. 10. The recommended rules will adversely impact investors, including KiwiSaver members. For many investors that are investing in managed funds for their retirement, including KiwiSaver members, the result of the recommended rules is they will earn smaller after-fee returns on their investments and, therefore, reduced amounts that are reinvested back into the managed fund to generate future returns and ultimately, diminished future retirement savings. However, the extent to which GST will lead to higher fees for retail investors is uncertain, as the market for manager services is viewed as relatively uncompetitive and managers may decide to absorb some of the cost of GST. 11. The proposed rules will result in approximately $37 million in additional tax revenue in the 2025/26 fiscal year, increasing to $247 million in the 2026/27 fiscal year. Projected to over ten years, the additional GST collected in the 2031/32 fiscal year is approximately $400 million, with the revenue impact of the change growing steadily over the forecast outyears 12. I agree with stakeholders that for most fund managers and investment managers, the proposed rules will impose significant transition costs. I am also mindful that these financial institutions have been asked to implement other regulatory changes in the short-to -medium term. In light of this, I am recommending a 36-month transition period before the new GST rules will apply. Background 13. Goods and Services Tax is a 15% consumption tax on most goods and services supplied to New Zealand consumers by registered person (such as businesses). To ensure GST is not a cost on business production, businesses can claim GST input tax deductions on purchases of goods and services they use in their business. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14. However, there are certain types of goods and services that are deemed to be exempt from GST 1 . One form of exempt supply is financial services, such as those services KiwiSaver schemes and other managed funds supply to their investors. 15. The current GST treatment of management services supplied to KiwiSaver schemes and other managed funds is complex and inconsistent. The pricing of the management services supplied to managed funds can distort competition, lead to higher compliance costs, and less Crown revenue. Complexity and inconsistency of the existing rules 16. KiwiSaver and other types of managed funds purchase three main types of services from third parties: 16.1 Fund manager services. A fund manager has overall responsibility for managing the fund. This can include offering and issuing units in the fund to investors, managing the fund’s investments, reporting to investors, and procuring services from an investment manager and various administration service providers. 16.2 Investment manager services. An investment manager recommends which assets (such as shares, bonds, cash) or other funds the fund invests into. When reporting to investors, manager services and investment manager services are both reported as “management fees’ which are set as a small percentage (typically between 0.2% and 2%) of the funds under management. 16.3 Various administrative services. These include legal, accounting, ICT (information and communications technology) or reporting services. 17. Managed fund fees charged to investors can have a large impact on the financial wellbeing of investors as they directly contribute to the level of accumulated savings, including retirement savings from retirement schemes (such as KiwiSaver). Generally, fees should decrease over time through economies of scale as the amount of funds under management grow and the benefits are passed onto consumers. For this reason, the Government (through the KiwiSaver default provider appointment process) and the Financial Markets Authority have focused in recent years on ensuring fund investors (including KiwiSaver members) receive value for money. 18. Providers of these fund manager and investment manager services apply GST inconsistently, resulting in an uneven marketplace across the industry. 2 1 Meaning GST is not charged on the good or service, but also the business cannot claim back GST charged on the costs incurred to supply that exempt good or service. These supplies are known as being ‘input-taxed’ because the GST charged on these purchases is collected and not claimed back. 2 Unlike many other industries, any GST applied to these services represent a real cost for managed funds. This is because under New Zealand’s GST rules managed funds are ‘exempt’ from GST. They cannot claim back GST charged to them, and do not apply GST to the fees they charge to investors. 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 19. The industry applies the following GST practices: 19.1 For retirement schemes, an existing GST exemption applies for management services provided directly to a retirement scheme. However, this exemption is limited. 3 20. For other types of manged funds, the GST treatment is usually by either: 20.1 The largest fund managers and investment managers typically treat 10 percent of their services as being subject to 15% GST and the remaining 90 percent as GST exempt. This is because they consider their services are mostly “arranging” the buying and selling of investment products and so most of their service should qualify for the GST exemption for financial services. Because their fee is effectively only subject to 1.5% GST, this approach may allow them to charge lower fees to the wholesale managed funds. 20.2 A group of boutique fund managers and investment managers apply 15% GST to all of their services. This is because they consider their services are providing investment advice and other types of services that are typically subject to 15% GST. This approach means the managers can claim GST deductions on their purchases. This may be because they have fewer ‘in-house’ resources, compared to the larger fund managers and investment managers. 21. Many of the industry’s current GST practices, such as 90% exempt, are not consistent with existing GST law. However, up until 2014 these positions were accepted by Inland Revenue as part of an industry agreement. However, in 2017, Inland Revenue formally considered how the GST should apply to these fees under existing law, with the draft conclusions further complicating the issue. This means that even retaining the status quo industry practices would require amendments to the GST Act. 22. The problem and several potential policy solutions have been subject to ongoing consultation with the industry, including the issue being subject to public consultation in GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper released in February 2020. Overall, submitters’ views were mixed on what the preferred solution should be, largely depending on their current approach to GST. 23. Following public consultation, my officials continued to engage with industry representatives. The Financial Services Council (which represents most of the large managed funds managers) raised a new preference to effectively legislate the status quo. This approach would involve a fund manager or investment manager choosing their preferred GST treatment, based on one of three available options. It would allow the current, inconsistent GST practices of all three GST treatments to continue. However, the option would avoid any transition costs or other costs which could otherwise require managed funds to charge higher fees to investors, such as KiwiSaver members. 3 This exemption does not apply where a retirement scheme invests into an underlying wholesale managed funds, as the managers and investment managers will be providing their services to the wholesale fund, rather than the retirement scheme. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 24. A law change is required to resolve the legislative uncertainty that is impacting the managed funds industry. Services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST 25. I recommend that all fund manager and investment manager fees charged to managed funds should be subject to 15% GST. This includes fund manager and investment manager fees charged to retirement schemes. 26. This proposal is consistent with associated GST frameworks and principles, in particular the financial services exemption, which should generally be limited to cases where there are valuation issues. 27. This proposal will result in competitive neutrality across the managed funds industry with all fund manager and investment manager suppliers competing fairly in the marketplace. All their manager fees would be subject to 15% rather than some being treated as exempt or 90% exempt (effectively 1.5% GST). As well, general managed funds and retirement schemes that invest into underlying wholesale funds would no longer be disadvantaged when compared to retirement schemes that procure management services directly. The fund managers and investment managers that are currently charging 15% GST on their fees would not be impacted by the proposed changes. 28. By requiring the same GST treatment across the industry, fund managers and investment managers will have simplified GST compliance as they would be able to claim GST deductions for all the GST charged on their external costs. There will be less risk of errors or tax disputes on the GST treatment of services provided to managed funds. 29. Compared to the other options, this proposal is more sustainable in the long term, as there is likely to be less pressure for further exemptions or pressure on the legislative boundary and novel interpretations of the rules in an attempt to obtain a GST advantage over competitors. Impact on retail fees charged to investors 30. The proposed rules seek to impose 15% GST on fund manager and investment manager fees charged to managed funds, however the managed funds remain subject to the financial services exemption and so cannot claim back this GST cost. Therefore, it is expected that the additional GST collected will flow through as an additional cost to a managed fund and therefore higher fees for its retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members. Officials from the Financial Market Authority are also of the view that the increased costs of GST will be passed onto KiwiSaver members in the form of increased fees. This increase is counter to recent years where KiwiSaver fees have fallen by 0.15% or 15 basis points over the past two years. 31. The extent to which GST will lead to higher fees for retail investors is uncertain. The economic literature 4 for other types of GST increases and decreases has found they 4 IHS (2011), “The Effect of VAT on Price-Setting Behaviour” in IFS et al., A retrospective evaluation of elements of the EU VAT system, Report prepared for the European Commission, TAXUD/2010/DE/328. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] are more likely to affect the prices paid by consumers (in this case, retail investors) in more competitive markets, or if the GST reform is broader. 32. New Zealand’s managed fund fees are regarded as being less competitive (that is, we have higher fees) than other countries. This could suggest that some funds may be able to offset or absorb some of the additional GST cost pressures by changing their commercial practices, or reducing their profit margins, rather than raising their fees by the full amount of added GST. This is because in more competitive markets, businesses have lower profit margins so are less able to absorb cost increases as an alternative to increasing their retail prices. 33. Because management fees are set as a percentage of the member’s total balance, retail investors (such as KiwiSaver members) with higher balances and those invested into higher fee funds would likely face larger increases in fees and therefore reductions in their future fund balances. We expect this change to have a greater direct impact as a share of retirement income on wealthier New Zealanders, who are more likely to have larger savings, including savings in managed funds. However, for some retail investors (such as KiwiSaver members) with low total savings, while the impact as a share of their total retirement income will be lower, the importance of these savings to meet future living costs during retirement means the impact of increased fees may have a disproportionate impact on their living standards in retirement. This is illustrated in the appendix. 34. Stakeholders have mixed views on the level of fee increase as a result of the GST change. The large managed fund providers (that are currently 90% exempt / 10% taxable) represented by the Financial Services Council believe the full GST cost will be passed through to retail investors, whereas the boutique funds believe the additional GST cost may have little impact fees charged to retail investors due to increasing pressure to compete on investor fees. Stakeholder views on the proposal 35. While stakeholder views have been mixed, they can be broadly be regarded as: 35.1 The large managed funds, represented by the Financial Services Council, consider the proposal to be their least preferred option, as it would require them to shift from a fully exempt or 90% exempt treatment to 15% GST applying to all fees. Their most preferred option is legislating the status quo. They believe this option imposes the least transition costs and on-going costs on managed funds and consequently, their fund investors. 35.2 The boutique managed funds (which are much smaller in comparison), consider the proposal to be their most preferred option, as it provides a level marketplace with their competitors, while imposing no transition costs or on-going costs on themselves. 36. Alongside this, stakeholders have suggested the proposed changes may encourage a behavioural change in some managed funds, in that they may relocate their funds offshore to avoid incurring GST on the fund manager and investment manager fees charged. This is because GST is not collected on services supplied to offshore domiciled funds, which a New Zealand based fund can then invest into. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 37. While it is difficult to measure the behavioural impact, the effect of this would be less GST collected over time. Given the likely transition costs of establishing and domiciling an existing New Zealand managed fund in another country, or reinvest a managed fund into an overseas fund, it is not anticipated that a significant number of funds will relocate in the short to medium term. Transitional costs 38. The proposal to charge 15% GST on all fund manager and investment manager fees would consequently impose significant transition costs for fund manager and investment managers that are not already applying 15% GST. 39. The Financial Services Council advise that the proposed rules will impose significant transition costs and have submitted that they would require a three-to-five-year transition period. There are currently over 1,000 funds 5 offered to retail investors. Nearly all of these funds will need to amend their IT systems, appoint new service providers, or renegotiate commercial contracts, update investor disclosure statements, prepare investor communications, and staff training to respond to increased investor contacts. 40. In particular, the changes to the IT systems are likely to require the most time to prepare and implement (especially for funds managed by banks). This is because these financial institutions have much of their IT resources pre-committed to other projects. This includes implementing other required regulatory changes, such as climate reporting disclosures, changes to the anti-money laundering rules and the introduction of the new regulatory regime covering the conduct of financial institutions (CoFI). 41. To ensure funds and their service providers have sufficient time to implement the proposed new rules, I recommend providing a transition period between enactment of the law change and the application of the new rules. I recommend 36 months is provided for this. Revenue collection 42. The proposed rules will result in approximately $37 million in additional tax revenue in the 2025/26 fiscal year, increasing to $247 million in the 2026/27 fiscal year. Projected to over ten years, the additional GST collected in the 2031/32 fiscal year is approximately $400 million, with the revenue impact of the change growing steadily over the forecast outyears. 43. The forecast is based on December 2021 data published by the Financial Markets Authority about the manager’s basic fee for each KiwiSaver and non-KiwiSaver fund. There are several key assumptions underlying the revenue forecast. These include: 43.1 That all, or nearly all of the additional GST will ultimately be passed on to fund investors, including KiwiSaver members. 43.2 Management fees charged to fund investors will continue to grow at 5% for 2022 and 10% per annum thereafter. This assumption is based on the dollar value of 5 331 KiwiSaver funds (operated by 39 KiwiSaver schemes) and 758 non-KiwiSaver managed funds. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] basic manager's fees on KiwiSaver and Non-KiwiSaver managed funds growing by an annualised average of 20.6% for the three years between 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2021. A more conservative assumption of 5% for 2022 and 10% per annum for later years was used to account for recent investment returns which have been historically high, while the first four months of 2022 had negative investment returns, and that future contributions to KiwiSaver and other retirement schemes may be less as more investors reach retirement age. 43.3 That a manager currently incurs taxable inputs of 20% of the value of the management services they provide. In the future, a manager could claim the additional GST input deductions on their expenses and offset these deductions against the GST charged on their fees, resulting in less GST paid to the Crown. 43.4 The forecast does not consider any other second-order effects. Implementation 44. The proposed rules do not create any material implementation costs to Inland Revenue. 45. The proposed rules will impose transition costs on affected fund managers and investment managers. These are outlined above. Financial Implications 46. The proposed rules will result in approximately $37 million of additional tax revenue in the 2025/26 fiscal year, increasing to $247 million in the 2026/27 fiscal year. Projected to over ten years, the additional GST collected in the 2031/32 fiscal year is approximately $400 million, with the revenue impact of the change growing steadily over the forecast outyears. 47. The additional GST revenue collected will not be directly recognised on allowances and instead will ‘flow-through’ to future tax revenue forecasts. The Treasury will advise Ministers on the impact of this additional tax revenue alongside other economic and fiscal considerations when setting future allowances. Legislative Implications 48. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 49. If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in the upcoming omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in August 2022. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 50. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material, and: 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 50.1 The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the GST on management services supplied to managed funds Impact Summary and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. 50.2 This issue has been subjected to wide consultation, including through a public issues paper. As identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section, a difficulty with assessing the revenue implications of the various options has been establishing the managed funds’ likely responses/behavioural changes to GST changes, and the extent to which deductions are currently being claimed on the various input costs associated with providing management services to the managed funds. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 51. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 52. There are no population implications arising from these proposals. Human Rights 53. The proposal does not give rise to any human rights implications. Consultation 54. The initial problem definition and proposed rules were consulted on as part of the release of the GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper in February 2020. Officials received 11 written submissions on the proposals. Stakeholder views were mixed 55. The large managed funds (represented by the Financial Services Council) view the proposal as their least preferred option, as it would apply 15% GST to the fund manager and investment manager fees charged to their managed funds. Their preferred option is legislating the status quo, as this will impose no material transition costs and no additional cost on their fund investors. 56. However, the boutique managed funds (which are much smaller in comparison) prefer the proposed rules, as they believe these rules will provides a level marketplace with their competitors. 57. The Treasury, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and the Financial Markets Authority were consulted throughout the policy development process and in preparation of this paper. 58. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment considers the proposal will have a significant impact on the fees paid by retail investors in managed funds and therefore investment savings outcomes over time, notably in KiwiSaver. Investment fund fees in KiwiSaver are highly relevant when research shows there are issues around retirement savings adequacy for many New Zealanders. While MBIE acknowledges some 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] inconsistency and complexity with the status quo, the impacts of these are not clear and should be weighed carefully against the likely significant costs of the proposal. 59. The Financial Markets Authority notes that value for money in the fund management sector has been a significant area of its focus in recent years. Overall, fees for KiwiSaver schemes have fallen by 0.15% or 15 basis points over the past two years. The Financial Market Authority’s view is that the increased costs of GST will be passed onto members in the form of increased fees. 60. Modelling by the Financial Markets Authority shows that the proposed approach will lead to KiwiSaver fund balances being reduced by $103 billion by 2070 (KiwiSaver balances of $2,196.9 billion), while fund balances for non-KiwiSaver managed funds would be lower by $83 billion (fund balances of $1,757.05 billion). Communications 61. I will make an announcement on the contents of the Bill, including this proposal, when the bill is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. 62. Some managed funds, as well as their fund managers and investment managers will oppose the proposed rules as the additional GST cost charged to them will be an increased cost to their business (because this GST cost cannot be claimed back). This will likely result in a mix of the fund manager and investment manager absorbing a portion of the GST cost due to commercial pressure, and a portion of the additional GST cost flowing through for retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members, in the form of higher fees. Proactive Release 63. I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions until the introduction of the bill. The expected introduction date for this Bill is August 2022. 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1. note that the current rules are creating complexity and inconsistency across the managed funds industry. 2. agree to provide consistency by requiring fund manager and investment manager fees to be subject to 15% GST. 3. agree that the recommendation apply from 1 April 2026 (approximately 36 months after enactment). 4. note the recommended changes will adversely impact KiwiSaver members by reducing their retirement savings in both KiwiSaver schemes and non-KiwiSaver funds, which investors may have invested in to save for their retirement. 5. note the recommended changes has the following estimated fiscal impact within the forecast period, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Tax Revenue - - - 37.000 247.000 Total Operating - - - (37.000) (247.000) 6. agree not to directly recognise any impact on allowances at this time as a result of this change. 7. note that officials will report back when developing the Budget Policy Statement with further advice on managing the aggregate effect of recent tax policy changes. 8. agree the legislative amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 required to give effect to the recommended changes in this paper be included in the next omnibus tax bill currently scheduled for introduction in August 2022. 9. authorise the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, to make final policy decisions, in line with these recommendations. Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix 1 - Illustrative examples of potential upper-limit impacts on fees and future balances Assume the fund is purchasing management services which are currently treated as being 90% exempt, 10% subject to GST (GST is effectively 1.5% on management services) and that management fees comprise 90% of the fund’s total fees (the other 10% are administration fees). Also assume the retail investor’s balance grows by 5% in 2022 and 10% each year thereafter (before fees) as they continue to regularly contribute funds and reinvest returns. Investor with $37,500 in a fund with a 0.8% annual fee A retail investor with $37,500 invested in a fund that charged a 0.8% fee under the status quo (option 1) would currently pay a $300 annual fee. Under the proposed reform (option 2), and assuming the GST costs were fully passed through to the retail investor, their fee could increase by up to $29, to become $359 for the first year after the reform. After 25 years of regular contributions and reinvesting, the investor would have had a $338,530 balance under the status quo and a $332,040 balance under the proposed reform, a reduction of $6,490. Investor with $100,000 in a fund with a 1% annual fee A retail investor with $100,000 invested in a fund that charges a 1% fee would pay a $1,000 annual fee under the status quo. Under the proposed reform, their annual fee could increase by up to $96, to become $1,194 for the first year after the reform. After 25 years of regular contributions and reinvesting, the investor would have had a $862,308 balance under the status quo and a $841,128 balance under the proposed reform, a reduction of $21,179.

While submissions are not due until 29 April, this report alerts you to the feedback on the share sales proposal. Context and background 2.The discussion document, released last month, is the first tranche of the Government’s work on measures to support the integrity of the top personal income tax rate of 39%. Among other things, the discussion document proposes that any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder, to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has undistributed earnings other than from capital gains. This wou ld t rigger a residual tax liability for the shareholder. The discussion document included three options as to how broadly the proposal would apply : ( A) where the shareholder retains economic ownership (related-party transactions); (B ) where the shareholder sells to an unrelated company; and (C) where the shareholder sells to an unrelated individual. 3.Rather than being a primarily anti-avoidance measure, the share sales proposal would address a more fundamental matter about ensuring that company tax is no t a final tax on income. T he proposal would do this using share sales. The proposal would mean that whenever shares are sold in a controlled company, the component of the sale price that relates to the retained earnings is taxed as a dividend in the hands of the exiting controlling shareholder. Accordingly, genuine commercial sales to third party buyers would be taxed (to the extent of the company’s retained earnings) if the sale is by a controlling shareholder (that is, someone holding more than 50 percent of the company’s shares). Doc 1 Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4. As a result, the options in the proposal are wide-reaching and would over time affect a large number of small and medium businesses, as well as some very large privately held businesses. These wide-reaching impacts raise the biggest concerns for stakeholders, in particular the application of the proposal to third party sales (options B and C). 5. As you may recall, the discussion document also contained proposals around available subscribed capital and the personal services income attribution rule. Stakeholder reaction to the available subscribed capital and net capital gains tracking accounts proposal has generally been positive. While there have been some concerns raised with the income attribution proposals, we are confident that we can resolve the issues in the time available to include finalised proposals in relation to these issues in the August tax bill. Consultation 6. We have been meeting with stakeholders to work through the discussion document proposals and want to alert you to the feedback received so far in relation to the share sales proposal. These discussions have made it evident that stakeholders do not agree with the fundamental premise of the proposal as it relates to unrelated party sales, and have also revealed considerable complexity and risk of overreach in the proposal, beyond the level of concern that officials had anticipated. Concerns raised by stakeholders include: • The breadth of the proposal: Stakeholders say that recharacterising some of the proceeds from share sales as dividends where there is no intention of tax avoidance would be an overreach, and that the focus of the proposals should be on the most egregious cases, being sales between related parties (option A). In particular, they are concerned that the proposals would potentially affect a large number of small and medium businesses who under current law are clearly not subject to tax when they sell their shares. • The effect the proposal would have on business growth and succession planning: For example, a small business owner may want to introduce a new owner to the business to benefit from their skills or experience. Alternatively, a small business owner such as a builder or plumber may want to retain a key staff member (such as an apprentice that they have trained) with a view to having the staff member eventually succeed them and keep the business going after the current business owner has retired. A way that the business owner can do this is by selling some of their shares to the other person. Stakeholders are concerned that the proposals would penalise, or act as a barrier to, this form of business expansion or succession planning. • Their view that the proposal is a capital gains tax: Because the proceeds from a sale of shares are generally capital proceeds, in stakeholders’ view, recharacterising some or all of the sale proceeds as a taxable dividend is a capital gains tax. 7. Stakeholders have also raised a number of practical issues with some details of the proposal, for example: • How the deemed dividend is quantified (two approaches are in the document, using imputation credits and retained earnings, and how these would interact has raised a number of technical issues). • The extent to which application of the rule only to sales by controlling shareholders could be broadened by also including sales where shareholders “act together” – questions include how broad this would be and how it would be defined. 8. In general, stakeholders have expressed concerns with the amount of material they are required to submit on, and in relation to the 39% integrity consultation, they Page 3 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] are concerned about the length of time (six weeks) to provide feedback on such a fundamental change to the tax system. They are also concerned about the short timeframe between submissions closing and introduction of the proposals in an omnibus taxation bill later this year (currently planned for August). 9. Given the complexity and the various issues that need to be worked through, stakeholders are concerned that the resulting legislation (which officials have indicated is intended to be effective for sales occurring on or after 1 April 2023) will not be workable for taxpayers and that the amount of time between legislative enactment and the application date might only be a few days. Officials’ views and next steps 10. While we do not agree with all the points raised by stakeholders, they do raise a number of valid points that we would like to consider further. We will continue to work through the proposals with stakeholders and will report to you in May on the submissions and our recommendations. 11. Following that report, the key milestones for including the proposals in the August bill are: • 22 June – Consideration by DEV • 27 June – Cabinet approval of final policy • July/August – Cabinet approval for including proposals in omnibus tax bill.

Cabinet had previously invited you to report back in June 2022 on the outcome of the consultation and to provide final policy proposals (DEV-22-MIN-0028 refers). This report provides you with a summary of the feedback provided by submitters and our advice on the next steps. Proposal 1 – Share sales The Discussion Document proposed that any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend in the hands of that shareholder to the extent that the company and its subsidiaries have retained earnings. Submitters strongly opposed this proposal . Submitters’ key concern was that the proposal is a fundamental change to the tax system and many considered it to be a form of capital gains tax. Submitters argued that any change should be limited to share sales between related parties and the most egregious behaviour. Other key concerns relating to the details of the proposal were that the rules would: • discourage business investment and innovation, • create problems for succession planning, mergers and acquisitions and employee share schemes; and • mostly i mpact small and medium businesses as well as family-owned companies, adding significant compliance costs for this group and resulting in arbitrary and unfair outcomes. While we do not agree with all the submissions, we do agree the proposal as set out in the Discussion Document would be a significant change and that submitters have raised valid concerns about the details of the proposal that cannot be resolved quickly. Both agencies recommend, as a first step, developing a targeted rule applying to related party transactions to deal with the transactions that are the most likely to be specifically tax motivated. This targeted rule could also cover transactions that shelter the company’s future earnings. The details of this work could be consulted on and legislation introduced in the first quarter of 2023, to apply from a date such as the date of enactment or a fixed date soon after. However, Inland Revenue and the Treasury have different views on how changes for third- party sales should proceed. Inland Revenue officials recommend that a wider rule to cover third-party transactions be considered over a longer timeframe. Specifically, we could consider what priority to give a IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 2 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] wider rule when we report on the measures under tranche two. This would allow Ministers to better assess wider integrity issues across the tax system and what the highest value measures are given the finite policy resources available. The tranche two advice is dependent on information from the additional trust disclosures, due to be received in full at the end of March 2023. The resulting advice will therefore be provided later in 2023. Treasury officials recommend agreeing in principle to a third-party rule to be developed following the introduction of a related party rule. While the Treasury accepts stakeholder feedback that it is a more fundamental change and therefore further work on implementation and a longer transition period would be sensible, it does not believe that further policy work or consultation would materially change the outcome of any policy analysis. In Treasury’s view, the positive impacts on social capital, the fiscal position, and horizontal and vertical equity outweigh what are likely to be relatively low economic costs. Announcing that a third-party rule is being progressed would also provide greater certainty to stakeholders. Under this approach a third-party rule would be progressed in a subsequent omnibus tax bill. Proposal 2 – ASC and capital gains reporting The second proposal was that companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their available subscribed capital (ASC) 1 an d net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. Submissions were invited on whether there should be a requirement to report these accounts to Inland Revenue annually, or if taxpayers should instead merely be required to maintain and keep these records. Submissions on this proposal were more supportive, although some considered legislative changes in this area to be unnecessary. Submissions included: • That these records will be useful when a transaction requiring this information occurs. • There will be compliance costs associated with collating and maintaining the accounts and associated records, particularly for small businesses. To address this issue, some submitters suggested a de minimis below which taxpayers are not required to maintain records (and report them). • Requiring annual reporting of these records to Inland Revenue will increase compliance costs. If reporting is required, the time bar should apply. We note the submissions in support of the proposal but also recognise the additional compliance cost. While we recommend progressing this proposal, we consider that the best way to reduce compliance costs is to work with accounting platform software providers to develop the reporting requirements. We recommend that we do this over the second half of this year with a plan to introduce the relevant legislative amendments early in 2023 to apply from 1 April 2024. Proposal 3 – Personal services attribution rule The third proposal was to remove the “80 percent one buyer” test 2 for the personal services attribution rule where income from personal services is taxed at the person’s marginal tax rate (as opposed to the company and trustee tax rates). In addition, the Discussion 1 “Available subscribed capital” refers to a company’s paid-up share capital and can be distributed tax free to shareholders on liquidation. 2 That is, at least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to one buyer and/or an associate of the buyer. IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 3 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Document suggested changes to the other threshold tests for the rule, such as increasing the substantial business assets threshold. 3 Submissions on the proposed changes included: • That the current rule is deliberately targeted to quasi-employment situations and the proposals significantly and inappropriately widen its scope. Specifically, the changes would go beyond people trying to avoid the 39% tax rate by using a corporate or trust structure and instead capture legitimate businesses. • Th at the changes would introduce a competitive disadvantage for small personal services businesses compared to other businesses who are not subject to the proposals (such as larger personal services businesses and businesses that are providers of goods rather than personal services). • The proposals would increase compliance costs, as well as reduce these businesses’ ability to reinvest retained earnings. This will have a negative impact on their ability to grow. • That there is no evidence justifying the changes proposed, and the effect of these changes will go well beyond the stated problem that they are trying to address. Depending on their design, the changes could significantly widen the scope of the personal services attribution rule to include service providers with multiple clients, such as real estate agents, plumbers, IT contractor s and hairdressers. If widely drafted, these rules could capture up to 8,000 one-person service companies. By their nature, the personal services attribution rules are somewhat arbitrary and can create competitive distortions. Given the proposals would widen the scope of these rules, these competitive distortions could be exacerbated. While we recommend proceeding with these changes, we would like additional time to work through the detailed design options to address some of the negative impacts. We propose to further develop the design of the rules and then consult on the detail to allow stakeholders to identify any issues with the updated proposals. Legislation could then be introduced in early 2023, with the changes applying from 1 April 2024. Next steps We are scheduled to discuss the recommendations in this report at the joint Ministers’ meeting on 2 June. You previously agreed to progress these integrity proposals in the next omnibus tax bill scheduled for introduction in August 2022. Given the delays in releasing the discussion document and the short time between now and the introduction of the bill, further time to consider the feedback from submissions and refine the proposals would be beneficial. We recommend progressing any changes in a tax bill to be introduced in early 2023. This would also allow further time to consult on more detailed proposals to address practical issues. If you agree to this timeframe, we will report to you in August or September with a draft issues paper on more detailed and refined proposals for further consultation. If you wish to proceed with any of the proposals on a faster track, we can discuss how that might be achieved in the time available. Officials note there are substantial risks in 3 The personal services attribution rule does not apply if the business has “substantial business assets” used to derive the income from personal services. “Substantial business assets” means depreciable property that has a total cost of more than either $75,000 or 25 percent of the company’s total (gross) income from services for the income year. IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 4 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] proceeding on a faster track, although it could enable implementation to occur a year earlier. We seek permission to update stakeholders once decisions have been made on the progression of this work.

Stephen Bond Paul Young Manager Principal Policy Advisor Tax Strategy Policy and Regulatory Stewardship The Treasury Inland Revenue Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2022 / /2022 s 9(2)(a) IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 6 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Purpose 1. This report provides you with a summary of the feedback provided by submitters on the Government discussion document Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution, as well as our advice on the next steps and timeframe for progressing these measures. Context and background 2. The Government introduced the 39% tax rate for income above $180,000 from 1 April 2021. When this rate was introduced, Ministers indicated that integrity measures would be considered if behaviours aimed at avoiding the application of the 39% rate were observed. 3. Cabinet recently approved the release of the Government discussion document Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution for public consultation (“the Discussion Document”). The Discussion Document stated that the Government’s objective is to ensure the continuity of revenue streams by ensuring that the tax system is fair and progressive, and that everyone pays their fair share of tax. It noted that the bunching of self-employed people at the relevant tax thresholds indicates that there is an existing issue, especially for relatively high- income taxpayers. The period for submissions closed on 29 April 2022. The Discussion Document outlined three main proposals: 3.1 That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has undistributed earnings other than capital gains. (Proposal 1) 3.2 That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their available subscribed capital (ASC) and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. (Proposal 2) 3.3 That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule be removed and the significant asset threshold be increased. (Proposal 3) 4. These integrity measures – and those in future tranches – aim to buttress higher personal income tax rates on labour income than other rates in the tax system. They are not a complete solution to the challenges of misalignment. Specific rules are inherently complicated and carry unintended consequences. Therefore, the decision to proceed with such measures is a trade-off between complexity and unintended consequences and the positive benefits that buttressing higher personal tax rates has for social capital, revenue, and the fairness of the tax system. 5. Officials from both agencies are working on strategic options for managing misalignment in the future, but that work would be fundamental and would necessarily take longer and require more careful consultation. Therefore, specific integrity measures remain appropriate as a near term solution. 6. In total, 40 submissions were received on the Discussion Document from private sector tax advisors, tax and business advocacy groups, and from small businesses and private individuals. Submissions on the share sales and personal services attribution proposals were strongly opposed to the measures, while submissions on the proposal about tracking ASC and net capital gains were mixed but generally more supportive. 7. Rather than being viewed as integrity measures, both the share sales and personal services attribution proposals were considered by submitters to be fundamental IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 7 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] changes to the income tax system involving substantial overreach. Many viewed the proposals as a departure from New Zealand tax principles, which allow the use of companies for income tax purposes, by requiring the integration of corporate and personal income. Submitters considered the proposals would discourage small business owners from retaining earnings in their companies to invest in new assets which they said would have implications for productivity and economic growth. Rather than making such fundamental tax changes, several submitters considered the issues would be better addressed by increasing enforcement of the existing tax rules. However, some thought there might be some justification for a share sales rule for transactions between related parties but only if the existing tax rules are not sufficient. Share sales (proposal 1) 8. Under current law, the sale of shares is usually treated as being on capital account and is not taxed. This is not the case where the sale is considered to involve tax avoidance such as where there is “dividend stripping.” In broad terms, “dividend stripping” refers to a situation where a shareholder of a company avoids receiving a taxable dividend by selling their shares for a non-taxable capital amount, often without a change in the economic ownership of the acquired company. 9. The Discussion Document proposed that any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder would be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company and its subsidiaries have retained earnings (the “share sales proposal”). This is intended to ensure that there is consistent tax treatment across the range of transactions where the value of earnings retained in a company can be realised by a shareholder. 10. The Discussion Document outlined different scenarios where the share sales proposal could apply, from a narrow focus on related party sales ( potential avoidance situations) to broad application to third-party sales ( situations where avoidance is less of a concern). Submitters’ views 11. In general, submitters considered the proposals to be an overreach as they felt that the proposals should be targeting avoidance transactions and would instead have a wide impact. Submitters argued that in third-party sale situations, most transactions do not give rise to avoidance concerns and are carried out for genuine commercial reasons. 12. Several submitters argued that the share sales proposal is effectively a capital gains tax, as the proceeds from a sale of shares are generally capital proceeds under current law and, as such, are non-taxable. Some also stated that since no value is transferred from the company itself to the shareholder, the proceeds from the sale are not a distribution from the company in form nor in substance, and therefore recharacterisation of these amounts as dividends is conceptually incorrect. Scope of proposal 13. Submitters were generally opposed to the breadth of the proposal, in that it would apply to all share sales by a controlling shareholder, and not just those sales with a purpose of tax avoidance. Several stated that if the proposal proceeds, it should be limited to transactions between related parties only, or to transactions that have the hallmarks of a tax avoidance arrangement. One submitter suggested narrowing the scope of the proposal to sales by natural persons who are on the top personal tax rate of 39% so that it would not apply to sales by holding companies, nor to sales by natural persons on a lower marginal rate. Two submitters suggested that IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 8 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] a de minimis based on the value of the transaction should apply, with one of those submitters suggesting a threshold of $1 million. 14. While some submitters suggested that the changes were targeting small businesses and family-owned companies, one submitter (whose clients are largely small businesses) thought that small business owners would almost never sell a business by selling the shares in the company. This is because, by buying the assets of the company rather than the company’s shares, the purchaser can protect themselves from any liabilities that might have been incurred by the company prior to the acquisition. This means that the proposal would not typically capture sales of small businesses, as it does not apply to asset sales. 15. Two submitters considered the limitation of the proposal to sales by controlling stakeholders to be appropriate, but most considered it to be unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory to small and medium companies and family-owned companies. They noted that this meant the proposal would not apply to a 49 percent shareholder but it would apply to a 51 percent shareholder in the same company. Submitters considered it unfair that the proposal would not apply to a sale of shares in a large, publicly listed company (except in the unlikely scenario where a majority stake in the company is sold). 16. Some submitters were concerned that the proposal could affect employee share schemes and create barriers to succession planning and to company mergers and acquisitions. For example, an employee share scheme may be established with shares contributed by the controlling shareholder (which is common in the succession planning context). Under the proposal, a tax liability would arise for the selling shareholder, assuming the company has undistributed earnings. Definition of “controlling shareholder” 17. There were also concerns about how a “controlling shareholder” might be defined. The Discussion Document proposed that the proceeds from a share sale would be recharacterised as a dividend if the selling shareholder, together with associates and other shareholders “acting together”, controlled the company immediately be fore the sale. One submitter considered the definition of “controlling shareholder” should be narrowed to just those shareholders that individually have more than 50 percent of the voting interests in the company. 18. Others noted specific concerns with the “acting together” part of the proposed rule. In particular, they noted shareholder agreements with “drag along” or “tag along” 4 clauses are common and stated that minority shareholders party to these agreements should not be regarded as “acting together” solely by virtue of the existence of such clauses. 19. One submitter said there should be no associates test for the purposes of the proposed share sale rule, while another requested more guidance as to who could be associated for the purposes of the rule. Specifically, they requested clarity as to whether genuine sales between family members (where no holding companies are created or involved in the transaction) would be caught. Calculation of deemed dividend amount 20. A number of technical points were raised in submissions about the method proposed for calculating the amount of the deemed dividend. Submitters were generally concerned that the proposed methodology would in some cases lead to over- taxation or even double taxation. Submitters were also concerned about the 4 A “drag along” clause allows majority shareholders to force minority shareholders to participate in a sale, usually on the same terms as the majority shareholders. A “tag along” clause is a clause that allows minority shareholders to join in on a majority shareholders’ sale (also usually on the same terms as the majority shareholders). IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 9 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] complexity involved in the calculations, which they considered would give rise to compliance costs and, in some cases, over-taxation when taxpayers did not have satisfactory evidence of retained earnings. Officials’ view 21. While we do not agree with all the submissions, we do agree that the proposal as set out in the Discussion Document would be a significant change and that submitters have raised a number of valid concerns that cannot be resolved quickly. 22. The question of how broadly these rules should apply depends on the objectives: 22.1 Applying the proposed rules to related party transactions is consistent with the objective of addressing avoidance concerns associated with the misalignment of corporate and personal tax rates; 22.2 Applying the proposed rule more broadly to include third-party transactions is consistent with the objective of enhancing integrity by expanding the tax base so that personal tax rates are applied to income earned by closely held companies that is not distributed but nevertheless realised by the shareholder when it sells its shares. As a result, a broader rule would target the Government’s integrity objectives of ensuring the tax system is progressive and that everyone pays their fair share of tax. 23. Both agencies recommend that initially a narrower proposal targeting related party transactions be developed to deal with the area in which transactions are most likely to be specifically tax motivated and therefore raise the greatest avoidance concerns. This proposal could also be designed to cover transactions that shelter the future profits of the company, such as selling the shares in the company to a related holding company that has been structured to have available subscribed capital or debt. This would then allow them to pay future profits out through the holding company without any further taxation. 24. The Discussion Document suggested that these proposals could be progressed in the omnibus tax bill scheduled for introduction in August this year with application from April 2023. However, given the level of complexity and the issues raised by submitters, there is value in taking more time to consider this feedback and consult further on the detail of such a rul e. More detailed consultation would cover: 24.1 the scope of the rule (that is, the definition of a related party transaction); 24.2 the impact of such a targeted rule (how many transactions the rule may apply to and the fiscal impact); 24.3 options to address the concerns raised around the definition of “controlling shareholder” and the proposed acting together rule; 24.4 the interaction with existing anti-avoidance rules concerning dividend stripping; and 24.5 the method of calculating the deemed dividend. 25. If Ministers agree, we will prepare an officials’ issues paper with more detailed proposals later this year to be progressed in legislation to be introduced in the first quarter of 2023. To mitigate the risk of taxpayers structuring around the rule before it applies, such a rule should apply to transactions from the date of enactment of the legislation or a fixed date soon after. This means such a rule would apply to transactions entered into on or after a date in 2023 agreed by Ministers rather than applying from the beginning of the next income year. IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 10 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 26. If Ministers wish to fast track the proposal, there is a greater risk of unintended consequences. This includes affecting people who are not intended to be caught by the reforms. Providing additional time would also allow us to gather data to better determine who would be affected by the changes, including the fiscal implications. Therefore, we do not recommend fast tracking the proposal. 27. While both agencies agree on the approach to related party sales, Inland Revenue and the Treasury have different views on how changes in respect of third-party sales should proceed. 28. Inland Revenue officials recommend that work on a wider rule to cover third-party transactions be considered over a longer timeframe. This would allow officials to consider which integrity issues have the highest priority and how to best allocate policy resources in light of these priorities, as well as plan the timing of the work on these issues. We could report to Ministers on these matters when we report on the proposed measures for tranche two. This would allow Ministers to better assess wider integrity issues across the tax system and what the highest va lue measures are given the finite policy resources available. 29. The Treasury recommends that Ministers should agree in principle to proceed with a third-party share sales rule after the introduction of the related party rule. The third-party rule could proceed in a subsequent omnibus tax bill. 30. The Treasury takes this view because a third-party rule would: 30.1 address longstanding integrity issues with the current system, including those noted by the Tax Working Group, that pre-date the current 39% rate by better capturing the full range of transactions where the value of earnings retained in a company is realised by an exiting controlling shareholder by way of a share sale; 30.2 support both horizontal and vertical equity, as well as favourable perceptions of the fairness of the tax system which contribute to overall social capital; 30.3 raise revenue for the Crown in a way that is likely to be progressive and come at a lower economic cost. While a higher effective tax rate on investors in close companies, all else being equal, could discourage investment at the margin, it is also making the tax treatment of income earned in different ways more neutral. 31. The Treasury does not recommend delaying commencement of work on a third- party rule until tranche two. Consultation has already been carried out on the proposal, and submitters are unlikely to change their views. If Ministers still want to achieve the objectives of a third-party rule, then we consider that giving stakeholders more certainty that such a rule will be put in place would allow for more productive consultation on implementation. It would also allow further work to focus on the concerns already raised and lessons learned from the related party rule. Recording ASC and capital gains (proposal 2) 32. When a distribution is made to shareholders on a company liquidation or share repurchase, determining the dividend amount requires subtracting the available subscribed capital (ASC) and capital gain amount. Because a company may have been in existence for a long time before liquidation and the amounts may not be relevant before then, it is sometimes difficult for the company to determine them by going through historical records and for Inland Revenue to verify them. 33. To improve the reliability of this information, t he Discussion Document proposed that companies would be required to maintain a record of their ASC and net capital IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 11 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] gains. It proposed that this requirement would only apply to transactions that occur after the law is enacted. To the extent a company’s ASC and net capital gain figures rely on transactions occurring before that date, the current law would continue to appl y. This means an existing company would have the onus of proof (as is the usual case for tax matters) in establishing the amount of its pre-application date ASC and net capital gains, but this burden can be satisfied at the time these amounts become relevant (that is, when shares are repurchased, or liquidating distributions are made to shareholders). 34. The Discussion Document invited submissions on whether annual reporting of ASC and net capital gains should be required, or whether taxpayers should merely be required to maintain and keep records of these amounts. In either case, the Discussion Document proposed that taxpayers would have deemed ASC and net capital gains of zero if the accounts were not maintained on a timely basis. Submitters’ views 35. Submissions on the proposal were generally more supportive than on the share sales and income attribution proposals , although some considered the proposed changes to be unnecessary and did not think the compliance costs associated with the proposal were justified. One submitter agreed that companies should be maintaining tracking accounts for ASC and net capital gains, but they thought that existing operational guidance on the matter should be sufficient to alert companies to the onus of proof requirements. 5 As an alternative to the proposed approach, one submitter suggested that company directors could instead be required to retain a copy of each year’s financial statements for the life of the company. Maintaining tracking accounts 36. Two submitters stated there should be a de minimis below which taxpayers are not required to maintain and report tracking accounts for ASC and capital gains. Two others suggested that taxpayers should have the option of not holding contemporaneous records at their discretion, and that Inland Revenue should not request the records unless the taxpayer has undertaken a transaction that utilises a claimed amount of ASC or net capital gains. 37. One submitter noted that maintaining tracking accounts for ASC and capital gains can be burdensome in the context of an employee share scheme. In this context, they suggested allowing businesses to opt out of contemporaneously recording relatively small ASC amounts, and to instead allow these records to be reconstructed and included at a later date if the ASC is to be utilised. Periodic reporting and application of statutory time bar 38. Submitters’ views on whether annual reporting of ASC and net capital gains should be required were mixed. Six were broadly supportive of annual reporting, although most stated that the statutory four-year time bar should apply to the returns of these amounts, some going as far as saying they only supported annual reporting on the condition that the time bar would apply. Three others were also supportive of a reporting requirement, just not annual reporting. Two of these submitters recommended requiring reporting on a three-yearly basis, while one submitter stated that these amounts should only be required to be reported to Inland Revenue whenever a dividend is paid. 5 Under the current rules, even though there is no formalised requirement for taxpayers to maintain tracking accounts for ASC and net capital gains, the onus is on taxpayers to substantiate a claimed amount of ASC or net capital gain when a transaction utilising either of these amounts occurs. IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 12 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 39. Four submitters were opposed to periodic reporting. They considered the case for mandatory reporting to be unclear, as there is an incentive for taxpayers to maintain accurate records due to the high cost of failing to do so. They considered that it should be generally sufficient for taxpayers to maintain and keep these records so that they can be provided when requested by Inland Revenue. 40. One submitter commented on the suggestion in the Discussion Document that taxpayers that have not maintained tracking accounts would be deemed to have zero ASC or net capital gains. They considered the proposed treatment to be overly harsh, stating that there are many valid reasons why the records might not be prepared on a timely basis and that taxpayers should be allowed to reconstruct the necessary records if and when they are required. Transitional issues 41. Submitters who commented on the proposed transitional rule (that is, applying the existing law to pre-application date ASC and capital gains of existing companies) were mostly supportive of the proposed approach. 42. One submitter requested more lead-in time to allow Inland Revenue to prepare guidance and education sessions, as well as for businesses and their advisors to prepare. The submitter noted that digital service providers such as accounting software packages will be critical to the implementation of the proposed changes. Officials’ view 43. We note the submissions in support of the proposal but also recognise that there will be some additional compliance costs. We consider these compliance costs are justified on the basis that taxpayers should ideally be recording ASC and net capital gains anyway and maintaining adequate supporting documentation, given the onus is on taxpayers to substantiate a claimed amount of ASC or net capital gain under the existing rules. 44. While the existing onus of proof requirements mean that companies already have an incentive to maintain a record of their ASC and net capital gains, timely and accurate record keeping is still an issue in practice, particularly for smaller companies. For ASC in particular, this is at least in part because the figure will never be relevant in many cases. In instances where a company does have to determine its ASC or net capital gains, it requires a careful record of both the law and transactions going back to the formation of the company. 45. On balance, officials recommend proceeding with the proposal to require annual reporting of ASC and net capital gains. As some submitters noted, there is the risk that some taxpayers, particularly smaller ones, will not comply with the requirement to maintain and keep records of ASC and net capital gains unless there is an annual reporting requirement. We consider that the process for reporting these amounts could be kept relatively simple, similar to the existing process for reporting imputation credit accounts. 46. We consider the best way to reduce compliance costs will be to work with providers of accounting software packages to develop the reporting requirements. However, this would require more time, meaning that including these proposals in the omnibus tax bill scheduled for introduction in August this year is not feasible. Subject to your agreement, we propose to undertake consultation with software providers over the second half of 2022, with a view to including the necessary legislative amendments in a tax bill to be introduced in early 2023. 47. We do not recommend applying the four-year time bar to returns of ASC and net capital gains. If these returns were time barred, it would mean that when the IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 13 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] claimed amount of ASC or net capital gains became relevant (that is, a transaction occurred utilising these amounts, such as a liquidation or share repurchase) it could not be challenged by Inland Revenue in most cases (as more than four years would likely have passed by that time). We note that not applying the time bar to these returns would be consistent with the existing approach for imputation credit account returns which are also not subject to the time bar. Personal services income attribution (proposal 3) 48. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains an attribution rule for income from personal services. The attribution rule prevents an individual avoiding the top personal tax rate by diverting income to an associated entity. Under the attribution rule, an amount of income of an associated entity is attributed to the working person. 49. The attribution rule currently applies when an individual (the working person), who performs personal services, is associated with an entity (the associated entity) that provides those personal services to a third person (the buyer). The rule only applies when the following threshold tests are met: 49.1 At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer or an associate of the buyer (or some combination thereof). This is referred to in the Discussion Document as the “80 percent one buyer” test. 49.2 At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from services that are performed by the working person or a relative of theirs (or some combination thereof). This is referred to as the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test. 49.3 The business does not have “s ubstantial business assets” used to derive the associated entity’s income from personal services. “Substantial business assets” means depreciable property that has a total cost of more than either $75,000 or 25 percent of the associated entity’s total (gross) income from services for the income year. 49.4 The working person’s net income (including the net income of the associated entity) for the income year is more than $70,000. 50. The combination of these tests targets the attribution rule at individuals who, using an interposed entity, sell their labour to a buyer in the specific situation where these individuals would likely have normally supplied their labour as employees, rather than as independent contractors. Proposals 51. The discussion document proposed to remove the “80 percent one buyer” test that applies for the attribution rule. As possible further options, it also suggested: 51.1 reducing the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent; 51.2 increasing the $75,000 threshold in the substantial business assets test – the Discussion Document suggested $150,000 and $200,000 as two possible options; and 51.3 excluding the value of passenger and luxury vehicles from the calculation of business assets except where the business is a transportation business. IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 14 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Submitters’ views 52. Almost all those who commented on the proposed changes to the personal services attribution rule opposed the measures, especially the proposed removal of the 80 percent one buyer test and the suggested reduction in the threshold for the 80 percent one natural person supplier test. The combined effect of the suggested changes was seen by submitters as a significant expansion of the scope of the rule. 53. A common criticism was that the proposed solution does not entirely align with the stated problem or rationale behind the proposal. Several submitters considered that something more targeted at the problem of inadequate shareholder salaries or dividend would be more appropriate, rather than “repurposing” the attribution rule. Note that shareholder loans will be considered as part of tranche two of the work on integrity measures. Rationale for proposed change 54. Submitters noted that the original purpose of the attribution rule was to ensure that “quasi-employees” could not avoid having their income over $70,000 taxed at the then-top personal tax rate 6 by earning the income in a company or trust, and that the rule in its current form is appropriately targeted at this type of scenario. Submitters were concerned that repurposing of the attribution rule would affect many small businesses which have chosen a corporate vehicle for legitimate commercial reasons. They pointed out that the 28% company rate is a deliberate policy setting intended to encourage business activity and investment, and people who are taking on the risk of being in business and who have chosen a corporate form should not be taxed on the income of the company at their personal level. 55. Several stated that there are good commercial reasons for companies to retain earnings, including funding business expansion and investment in new assets. They felt small business owners should be entitled to reinvest retained earnings in their companies without being subject to tax at their marginal rate. 56. At least one submitter also pointed out that effectively imposing a higher tax rate on small companies is at odds with other recent policy measures in New Zealand aimed at supporting small businesses , such as the business continuity test that enables losses to be carried forward in some instances when a company is sold. Another submitter considered the proposal to be contrary to the approach taken by Australia, which has introduced a lower corporate rate for small and medium businesses. 57. Most also felt that the proposed changes are unnecessary and stated that there is no evidence to justify the proposed approach. They were of the view that the courts have been effective in countering tax avoidance, and that existing case law precedents and Inland Revenue guidance on the matter should be sufficient. A couple of submitters suggested that alternative interventions could instead be taken, such as codifying in law minimum market-based levels of remuneration for working persons or, alternatively, providing guidance on this, although one was careful to state that they did not favour that approach either. 58. As an alternative to the proposals, one submitter suggested exploring an excess retention tax. Note that consideration of excess retention tax is currently planned for tranche two. 6 At the time of the attribution rule’s introduction in 2000, the top marginal tax rate of 39% applied to income earned over $70,000. IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 15 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impacts of proposal 59. Submitters said that the proposed changes would: 59.1 introduce competitive distortions between small personal services businesses and other businesses who are not subject to the proposals; 59.2 increase compliance costs; 59.3 reduce the ability of small personal services companies to reinvest retained earnings in new assets, and thus will undermine business resilience and growth and stifle businesses’ recovery from the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantial business assets test 60. Submitters felt that the monetary thresholds suggested in the Discussion Document for the substantial business assets test ($150,000 and $200,000) were too high and not based on sound reasoning. One submitter said that, if anything, the thresholds should be reduced, as many personal services businesses are heavily reliant on IT and the cost of IT has not increased to the level to make the suggested thresholds realistic. One submitter said the maximum increase in the $75,000 threshold should be to $125,000. Another said the suggested $200,000 threshold in particular was much too high, especially for businesses run by tradespeople or specialists. 61. Some submitters took issue with the proposed exclusion of motor vehicles from the asset calculation. Others requested clarity on which assets would be captured by the test, including the definitions of “luxury vehicle” and “passenger vehicle”. 62. One submitter suggested that the substantial business assets test should not be limited to assets owned by the business and that an appropriate test would instead be based around whether substantial infrastructure (including staffing and leased assets) is required to operate the business. Net income of working person test 63. The Discussion Document did not propose to increase the threshold for the “net income of working person” test (currently $70,000) but invited submissions on whether the threshold should be increased. Submitters were generally in favour of increasing the threshold from $70,000 to $180,000. Officials’ view 64. The current personal services rule is essentially a quasi-employment test capturing only situations where a company’s income is largely derived by selling a single person’s personal services to a single buyer. The proposal would remove the 80 percent one buyer test and so would mean that companies selling a person’s services to multiple buyers could be subject to the rule if they do not meet one of the exemptions. This would mean that a wide range of small personal services companies, from plumbers and builders to accountants, lawyers and IT contractors, could be subject to the rules. 65. Based on the information that we currently hold and applying a number of assumptions (including the doubling of the fixed asset threshold to $150,000), we estimate that the widening of the rule could apply to approximately 7,500 businesses earning between $70,000 and $180,000 per annum and could apply to approximately a further 500 businesses earning over $180,000 per annum. IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 16 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 66. Submitters have argued that the proposed widening of the rules is overreach and creates additional compliance costs for small businesses. The changes could capture around 8,000 businesses and could require the attribution of up to $450 million of income retained in companies. This income would then be subject to a top-up tax of 5% (28% to 33%) or 11% (28% to 39%). We note that these numbers are indicative only and that the actual resulting attribution is likely to be lower. 67. While the changes would significantly widen the rules, we consider that this is appropriate given all the impacted businesses earn at least 80 percent of their income from the sale of the services of one person. The income of the company is therefore strongly linked to the efforts of that one person and their remuneration should reflect that. 68. Widening the rule would also reduce the horizontal equity issue that exists between unincorporated sole traders and sole traders using a company structure by treating them similarly. However, it would also create a horizontal equity issue between personal services companies based on whether they have one or more people providing the services. The distinction between companies selling services largely provided by one person and companies with more than one person acting as a service provider can be justified having regard to the amount of control the single service provider is likely to have on the decisions made by the company. Where there is more than one provider there is likely to be a natural tension that reduces the risk of the retention of too much income as the different providers are incentivised to seek their share of the earnings. 69. Submitters also argue that it would be unfair to require these businesses to pay tax at the person’s marginal tax rate on income that they want to reinvest in the business while businesses not caught by the rule can reinvest income having only been subject to tax at the 28% company tax rate. We consider this to be a legitimate concern and therefore would like to work with stakeholders on ways to address this issue. One option could be to allow a percentage of the income to be retained in the company. For example, the rule could be designed not to apply if at least 80 percent of the income had been distributed to the person who is the service provider. 70. Submitters have also argued that the proposed changes do not appropriately target people avoiding the 39% tax rate. This argument reflects a view held by some submitters that any changes made as part of this project should only relate to the 39% tax rate. The current attribution rule applies when the net income of the working person is at least $70,000, so the rule applies for taxpayers on the 33% personal rate as well as those on the 39% rates, with both of these rates being much higher than the 28% company tax rate. 71. To narrow the scope of the rule and reduce compliance costs, the rule could be made to apply only where the net income of the working person exceeds $180,000. This would reduce the estimated number of people that the rule would apply to from about 8,000 to about 500. On the other hand, it would also allow some people who earn over $70,000 but less than $180,000 to defer tax of up to $5,500 by retaining the income in the company. Changing the threshold to $180,000 raises fairness concerns and reduces potential attribution of corporate income by $250 million. 72. Options to address the concerns about the ability to retain income for reinvestment in the company may also reduce compliance costs and consequently will influence the analysis of whether it would be better to limit the rules to those with income exceeding $180,000. Therefore, we would like to explore these options before determining whether there is a case for narrowing the rules in this way. 73. Lastly, the Discussion Document proposed increasing the $75,000 threshold for the substantial business assets test, which has remained the same since the introduction of the rules in 2000. There is a case for increasing the assets threshold although the proposed exclusion of luxury vehicles is less easily defined. Our ability to define luxury vehicles in a way that can be practically administered may influence IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 17 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] decisions on whether to increase the substantial business assets threshold. Further work is required on the design of the changes and it would be beneficial to test the proposed design with submitters. 74. We propose to develop the design of the rules, taking into account the feedback received in submissions and Ministers’ feedback so that we can then consult again on a more detailed proposal. This would allow submitters an opportunity to identify any specific issues with the updated proposals. Proposed legislation could be introduced early in 2023. Financial implications 75. We previously advised that the share sales proposal in the Discussion Document might collect approximately $50 million in revenue per annum (T2021/277; IR2021/063 refers). However, the amount of revenue it would collect depends on the nature of the transactions undertaken in a year and could vary significantly from the estimated $50 million. At the time of the estimating the revenue impact, t he proposal was expected to apply from 1 April 2023 but the revenue estimate was not included in g overnment forecasts. 76. While narrowing the initial proposal to apply only to related party transactions would on the face of it reduce the expected additional revenue, the potential extension of the related party proposal to cover transactions that also shelter future income would at least partially offset this reduction. The overall impact is not able to be estimated until the design of the proposal is more developed. Officials will report back with the financial implications when seeking agreement on the final detailed design later this year. This would occur prior to the Budget Policy Statement so any additional revenue could be considered as part of that process. 77. As this related party measure would be a measure targeting specific transactions, it could be made to apply from the date of enactment or an earlier date such as the date of the introduction of the relevant b ill. If it were included in a bill early next year, the introduction date could be around March 2023, while enactment would be likely to be around September 2023. 78. We are proposing to do further work to consider a wider rule for third-party share sales but note there are a number of outstanding issues with this to resolve. If progressed, such a rule would be unlikely to apply until 1 April 2024 or 2025 (depending on the timing of legislative changes). We would advise you on the fiscal implications of such a rule at a later date. 79. The personal services attribution rule changes would potentially capture around 8,000 companies and could cause attribution of up to $450 million. Tax on this could be up to approximately $36 million. We note that some of this income will be paid out as dividends so this, to an extent, will just be a timing difference. However, there will also be some permanent differences if income is distributed through trusts or retained in the company and the shares of the company are sold. Changes to reduce the impact of the rules would reduce the figures from these initial estimates. 80. The recording ASC and capital gains proposal is intended to assist with compliance and does not have any direct financial implications. Next steps 81. We are scheduled to discuss the recommendations in this report at the joint Ministers’ meeting on 2 June. 82. You previously agreed to progress these integrity proposals in the next omnibus tax bill scheduled for introduction in August 2022 (T2022/106; IR2022/013 refers). As IR2022/283; T2022/1166: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution – Summary of submissions and next steps Page 18 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] discussed in this report, further time to consider the feedback from submissions and refine the proposals would be beneficial. There is the risk that proceeding with legislation in the August tax bill would result in unintended consequences, including affecting people that are not intended to be impacted. Providing additional time would also allow us to gather data to better determine the impact of the changes, including the fiscal implications. 83. We instead recommend taking more time to refine the proposals with stakeholders and include the necessary changes in a tax bill scheduled for introduction in early 2023. If you agree to this timeframe, we will report to you in August or September with more detailed proposals and an attached draft issues paper for further consultation on more detailed proposals. 84. If you wish to proceed with any of the proposals at a faster pace, we can discuss how that might be achieved in the time available. To proceed with legislation in the August tax bill at introduction would require Cabinet approval for the final policy recommendations by 4 July. 85. We also seek permission to update stakeholders once decisions have been made on the progression of this work. 86. This would then be followed by advice on tranche two of this work which considers shareholder loans, excess retention tax, trust taxation and, depending on your decisions, a wider rule covering share sales to third parties. This advice is reliant on information from the additional trust disclosures, due to be received by the end of March 2023. The resulting analysis and advice will therefore not be available until later in 2023.

This report gives you an update on the integrity workstream and makes recommendations for next steps. Importantly, the recommendations should be considered alongside the report on 2. We previously recommended that work on specific integrity measures to address some of the problems with misalignment be progressed in stages (T2021/277, IR2021/063 refers). However, following a public consultation process and further consideration, we have identified several risks with proceeding with this work We therefore recommend stopping this work on legislative changes for the next tax Bill in favour of a wider discussion to clarify direction on how to address misalignment. Background 3. In 2020, a new top personal income tax rate of 39% for income earned over $180,000 was introduced. The motivation for this reform was to raise extra revenue in a way that is progressive and does as little as possible to increase taxes on low to middle income earners. 4. We have provided you with a number of reports on the general issue of a lack of coherence in the tax system, focussing on the different tax rates that can apply to income, depending on whether the income is earned from personal services, dividends or investment, through companies, trusts or portfolio investment entities (PIEs) (see in particular Tax policy report: Integrity of the 39% top personal income tax rate T2021/277, IR 2021/063). 5. In March 2022, a Discussion Document proposing company integrity measures aimed at addressing some of the problems with misalignment was released. Following consultation on the proposals, we reported to you in May with a recommendation that these measures be progressed in a tax bill to be introduced in early 2023 to allow more time to consult further on the changes (T2022/1166, IR2022/283 refers). 6. The current focus for integrity measures has been on company issues (including share sales and personal services provided through companies). We had previously suggested further steps to enhance company tax integrity and rate differential issues across the tax system (including the PIE and trust rates) could be progressed in two subsequent tranches of work. However, feedback has made it clear that it is difficult to make these changes regarding company issues when the overall direction of changes has not been determined. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/352; T2022/1837: Update on integrity workstream Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Discussion Document released in March 7. The Discussion Document Dividend integrity and personal services attribution released in March this year dealt with two issues with income earned through a company. These issues were: 7.1 that in a sale of a company with retained earnings, the selling shareholders can effectively receive those retained earnings without paying tax at the shareholder level – the retained earnings will thus be taxed at no more than the 28% corporate tax rate (and possibly less, for example if they are from non-resident subsidiaries). 7.2 that a person earning income from personal services can ensure that the income is taxed initially at only the corporate rate, and at only the trustee rate when distributed, by using a personal services company, and that this issue is only partially addressed by the current personal services income attribution rule. 8. The paper also proposed that companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their available subscribed capital and net capital gains so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. Stakeholder feedback on proposals 9. The two proposals outlined in \[7.1\] and \[7.2\] were strongly opposed in consultation. Some stakeholders expressed concern about the breadth of the changes that were envisaged because important decisions have yet to be made on the broad direction of tax changes that were envisaged in later tranches. 10. Stakeholders were also concerned that the rationale for the proposed changes was unclear. Specifically, that the ability of people to pay tax at the corporate rate is the result of the structural tax settings rather than any deliberate attempt to avoid the top personal tax rate. 11. Some stakeholders considered the share sales proposal as akin to a capital gains tax. Share sales proposal 12. In response to submissions, we recommended developing a targeted rule applying to related party share sales for inclusion in a tax bill in early 2023, to deal with the transactions that are the most likely to be specifically tax motivated. 13. In the process of developing this proposal and discussions with a number of stakeholders we have become aware that there is a lack of understanding about longer term directions which make it difficult to legislate rules ahead of a wider consideration of the tax framework underpinning the taxation of companies and shareholders. 14. While a targeted related party share sales rule is intended to ensure shareholders pay the appropriate amount of tax, it will also introduce complexity and boundaries within the tax system that could distort people’s behaviour. The possible distortionary effects were a key concern raised by stakeholders, in particular the impacts on transactions that are done for commercial or practical reasons rather than being motivated by tax (for example, the way some family businesses are passed down to the next generation). 15. Distortions may be acceptable if the rules prevent people structuring share sale transactions in a way that results in no top-up tax being payable when value is IR2022/352; T2022/1837: Update on integrity workstream Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] extracted from a company. However, any rule would need to be progressed carefully to ensure it has a clear purpose, integrates with the current anti-avoidance dividend stripping rule, and that unintended consequences are minimised. This is particularly important as any work in this area will be met with intense opposition from those impacted and could draw considerable media attention and public comment. 16. Personal services proposals 17. In the May report, we also recommended removing the “80 percent one buyer” test in the personal services attribution rule, and for officials to report back on proposals to address stakeholder concerns about compliance costs and competitiveness distortions. 18. The proposal would expand the current rule which is targeted at service providers in quasi-employment situations (supplying services to one client). The proposed change would mean that individuals providing personal services to multiple clients via a corporate structure will be required to pay tax at their marginal tax rate (assuming there are no significant assets). 19. A wide range of small personal services companies could be caught by the personal services attribution rule, from plumbers and builders to accountants, lawyers and IT contractors. It is difficult to estimate how many service providers could be impacted by these changes, however, we previously estimated this could be around 8,000 service providers. 1 20. Submitters were concerned that, unlike the current rule, the proposed expansion of the personal services attribution rule does not have a clear purpose and would put businesses caught by the rule at a competitive disadvantage. Specifically, these businesses would not be able to retain earnings taxed at 28% in the company as a way of investing in and growing the business. 21. We have been considering ways of allowing some level of earnings retention within the business, such as excluding businesses if they distribute at least 80 percent of earnings. This goes some way to address concerns raised by submitters. However, introducing a threshold like this is somewhat arbitrary and will likely distort behaviour. 22. 23. 24. 1 Including doubling the threshold for the substantial business assets test to $150,000. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/352; T2022/1837: Update on integrity workstream Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 25. 26. Financial implications 27. Suspending work on a related party share sales rule and changes to the personal services attribution rule will defer the additional revenue which would have resulted from these changes. The amount raised by these proposals would depend on their final design. Initial estimates suggested up to $50 million per annum for a wider share shales rule (not the more targeted rule) and $36 million per annum for changes to the personal services attribution rule, but these estimates are highly uncertain. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/352; T2022/1837: Update on integrity workstream Page 5 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommended action We recommend that you: 1. agree to defer work on the proposed targeted rule applying to related party share sales Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 2. agree to defer work on the proposed changes to the personal services attribution Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 3. discuss with officials the process and timing for further advice on the direction of the tax system’s structure, including dealing with the challenges of misalignment.

Summary: •The controls in relation to share sales may be heavy handed and also unnecessary. •The rules regarding shareholder continuity in relation to imputation credit accounts does, to a large extent, achieve the desired effect without needing to create new laws. •As an alternative to the proposed rules regarding ASC, it might be worth requiring the company directors to retain a copy of each year’s financial statements for the life of the company, thus ensuring the necessary information is to hand if needed. •The income of high-income individuals does not often come from personal services. Consequently, changing the income attribution rules is unlikely to impact the taxpayers you want to target. •The proposals seem to be premature, and based on incomplete evidence, since the new top marginal tax rate only affects 2022 income tax returns and very few of those have been filed to date. •A de minimis threshold the deemed dividend rules would be good (for example, the rules could apply only to share sales with value of $1M or more) •It might be worth finding an older accountant or economist who can remember how the excess retention tax from the 1980’s worked. Detailed comments: In general, the NZ tax system’s reliance on voluntary compliance seems to be fairly reasonable. Although there will always be a few individuals that will do their best to avoid paying their fair share of tax, the majority are compliant. Using heavy handed legislation to force obedience, when taxpayers are already obeying the spirit of the law, may increase compliance costs without actually increasing compliance to any measurable degree. Has any research been done into the frequency of share sales in close companies? It may be that a law is being proposed to resolve a problem that is very small. In general, we have found that the shareholder(s) proposing to sell shares in a close company will encourage that company to declare a dividend prior to the sale. The objective of such dividend would be to pass the retained earnings to the shareholders who have been involved in the company PUB-01 s 9(2)(a) while those profits were earned. The effect is actually to achieve the goal of this proposed law – it passes the earnings of the company through to the company shareholders so that they are forced to pay tax on it at the appropriate marginal tax rate. Continuing to have the continuity rules in relation to retaining Imputation Credits should be sufficient to achieve the desired effect, making additional legislation unnecessary. Do you really need a law to force the maintenance of records of Available Subscribed Capital (ASC) and net capital gains? This seems as though you are simply forcing additional compliance costs on small businesses in advance of an event that might never happen. The rules about ASC are robust enough as they stand. It seems more sensible to expect that the exercise be done at the time of share cancellation or liquidation. It is already acknowledged that some extra effort is needed at this time. The required information won’t be impossible to compile, if and when it is needed. Paragraph 1.4 seems to show little faith in taxpayers in general. It seems more likely to me that taxpayers who have been compliant all along will continue to be compliant, regardless of what they think other taxpayers are doing. If you genuinely think that the perception of avoidance is an issue, then perhaps a media campaign (or even some sneaky little updates on the IRD website) showing how IRD is catching and punishing the miscreants might be more effective. Perhaps you could find some older professionals to consult, who can remember how the anti - avoidance measures of the 1980’s worked. In particular the excess retention tax was a good one, and the National Super Surcharge was a very effective (although much reviled) tool for means- testing government support. The advantage of arbitrage is generally only temporary. In general, if taxpayers wish to spend the money earned by their company, the company must pass that income through to the shareholder so that it is taxed at the individual marginal tax rate. Income that is left in the company may be taxed at 28% this year, but it is normally only a short number of years before the shareholder wants to spend the money and therefore concedes that it must be passed through as either a dividend or a salary. While it is tempting to leave some income in the company, the disadvantages associated with an overdrawn current account do tend to encourage the company to distribute the income. In particular, the FBT rules regarding low interest loans encourage compliance. Those who trade as a company in order to have the security of Limited Liability will also try to avoid having overdrawn current accounts. Any company that needs to borrow money will tend to find that lending institutions prefer companies whose shareholders are invested in the company (as opposed to companies that are lending money to their shareholders by allowing them to overdraw their current accounts). It is hardly surprising that Figure 1 doesn’t show any bunching at the $180,000 level. That top marginal tax rate was not in place for the year ended 31 March 2020. It only takes effect from 1 April 2021. Paragraph 1.12 says there was increased avoidance of the top personal tax rate in 2020 in response to the increase in the top personal tax rate. That is odd, since the tax rate didn’t increase in 2020. The first paragraph under heading 1.13 doesn’t read very clearly. Also, the courts have been effective in finding tax avoidance (see Penny & Hooper for example) You mention the use of PIEs as an area where there is potential for integrity issues to arise. Could that be addressed by adding a further (higher) approved PIR? Paragraph 1.24 suggests the sale of shares as a way of realising cash from a company. This is a fairly short-sighted way of realising cash, as it ends or severely limits the shareholder’s right to any further income from the company. In response to paragraph 1.25, I would like to ask what research has gone into the pervasiveness of this issue. I would argue that a sale of shares is not a very common transaction and may be unworthy of legislative control. In general, a person interested in buying a business is more likely to buy the business activity (as a going concern) from the company. The purchase of close company shares is normally discouraged by most advisors. In buying shares, the purchaser is also buying the history of the company. There can be a number of issues in the history of a company that will not necessarily come to light during due diligence but can cause costly problems to a subsequent owner. A couple that spring to mind are retained earnings that include related party capital gains, and historic share buy backs that have used up all of the available subscribed capital. A company may have been a Loss Attributing Qualifying Company (LAQC) or Qualifying Company (QC) at some time in its past. There may be inadvertent errors in recording Imputation Credit account transactions, or a history of having had tax debt forgiven. None of these possibilities are implausible, and therefore many advisors would discourage their clients from buying company shares in order to obtain a new business. Please, if you really think there is a need for the records described in paragraph 1.26, do make it easy for the small business person. Perhaps you could insist that the company’s annual financial statements be retained for the life of the company. This would simply be an extension of the current requirement to hold accounting and tax records for seven years. A company already has to have annual financial statements prepared in order meet income tax and Companies Act requirements. To actually retain a permanent copy of those accounts shouldn’t require too much extra cost or effort for the directors. By doing this, the information needed to determine the ASC and other necessary information will be available should it be needed, without putting too much extra burden on business operators. At 1.28 it is proposed that taxpayers providing personal services are an area of risk. This could do with a bit of research. I think you will find that the high-income people are not generating their high levels of income from personal services. In general, higher incomes are obtained by leveraging other people’s labour, or by investing in income generating assets. The amount a taxpayer can earn from personal services is effectively restricted because there is a physical limit to the number of hours a person can work in a day. In my opinion, tinkering with the legislation will add complexity and frustration without noticeably improving the tax take. 1.30: you ask whether the 80% threshold should be dropped to 50%. I think dropping it to 67% would be sufficient. 1.30: you ask about the substantial business assets test. In my experience (I have worked in Chartered Accountancy practices for around 30 years), I have not encountered any companies that have been able to take advantage of the substantial business assets test. I don’t think a change in the threshold would make any difference. 2.13 Is there any need for the inter-corporate dividend exemption? Perhaps that should disappear? That might help towards the issues you want to resolve. I’m revealing my prejudices here – I am much more in favour of reducing complexity rather than adding extra new laws. 2.23 This sems counter-intuitive, and contrary to current experience. I have found that more dividends have been declared in the two years leading up to the onset of the higher top marginal tax rate. The 2021/22 tax year is the first full year where the higher marginal tax rate has applied. Very few of the 2021/22 company tax returns will have been filed yet, since the standard 2021/22 year is not finished. You have very little evidence to support this proposal. 2.26 It seems that you are most concerned about share sale activities where the effective ownership of the company doesn’t change. It might be better if your proposal was targeted to these types of transactions rather than a scatter-gun approach targeting all share sales. 3.1 The general scope of the rule appears to recharacterize a sale of a capital asset as a taxable sale, thereby imposing a tax on capital gains without calling it a capital gains tax. There’s not much wrong with a capital gains tax, but this is stealthy. Example 1: No, the Imputation Credits (IC’s) are not still available. A 100% sale of shares breaches the continuity rule for retention of IC’s. In example 2 you say that the purchaser has the potential to distribute the $72. It doesn’t look like a distribution to me. It looks as though Purchaser Ltd is repaying (to the shareholder of Purchaser Ltd) the cash that the shareholder had loaned to the company so that it became able to achieve the purchase. Repaying a loan should not be counted as a distribution. There is no need to determine whether this is labelled as a taxable or non-taxable distribution. You ask: To which scenarios should a generic recharacterisation rule apply? In my opinion, only the sale of shares where the original shareholder retains effective control of the new owner should be captured. All of the others are not the result of attempted evasion but simply normal commercial decisions made when selling a business. I think the proposal is unnecessary. Most of the intended result is actually achieved by the rules associated with Imputation Credit accounts and continuity rules. This encourages companies to declare dividends before undertaking any shareholding changes that would otherwise result in the IC’s being lost. 3.31 Using the accounting concept of retained earnings is fine. Don’t forget that companies are held to a fairly high standard of accounting reporting by the Companies Act. In addition, IRD regulations specify what information must be recorded when using Special Purpose reporting concessions. 3.32 Woohoo! I think that referral to the company’s ICA balance is a great idea. Very simple, which is what you want to achieve with any new law. It should be clear and easy to understand and not easy to misinterpret. 3.34 No thanks. I think it would be better to make the undistributed earnings portion be the lesser of the two figures. 3.38 (to treat the deemed dividend as an increase to ASC) seems unnecessarily complicated. It is quite difficult to follow what you expect the effect to be for the remaining shareholders. It seems (and I’m happy to be corrected here, because I would rather be wrong on this count) that the deemed dividend effectively gives the benefit of accumulated ICs to the seller. The remaining shareholders will lose the advantage of the IC’s that had accumulated in the company’s ICA. Questions for Submitters: • Is deeming a dividend to arise when shares are sold (while the company has retained earnings) an appropriate policy outcome? I can understand the desire to do so, but I think it is unlikely to capture very many transactions. I think the return you will achieve will not be worthy of the effort • Should the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule cover all of scenarios A, B, or C, or only one or two of these scenarios? I think only scenario A (sale to related parties) should be captured. Scenarios B and C have more commercial reality because there is a third party involved and the purpose is not tax avoidance. • Is limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule to sales of shares by a controlling shareholder appropriate, or do you think this is too broad or too limited? It’s about right. • Is the conceptual basis for quantifying the deemed dividend (that is, undistributed income, not including untaxed capital gains) appropriate? Yes • What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested dividend quantification approaches (grossed-up ICA, retained earnings, or a combination of the two), and which of these approaches do you prefer? Is there an alternative approach you would suggest? I prefer accounting retained earnings, principally for simplicity. The more complicated a tax law is, the more likely it is to be misunderstood, misinterpreted or ignored. Questions for submitters in relation to ASC and ACDA • Whether the proposed transitional rule is appropriate. It doesn’t seem unreasonable. However, it might be better to allow taxpayers to calculate the opening balance based on available information. To distinguish between ASC from before the tracking rules started and ASC from after seems complex and unnecessary. Just continue to rely on voluntary compliance, and assume that the “before” ASC is correct. • Whether the Commissioner should be able to reopen a return and on what basis. I think a return should only be subject to being re-opened a) when ASC is used (for example when a share buy back is actioned) AND b) when it is material. Share buy backs or other use of ASC that are less than $100,000 are ridiculously small and would not generate enough benefit for the time IRD has to commit to such investigations. A threshold of $1,000,000 might even be appropriate. • Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity. No it does not. It imposes additional compliance costs on all companies. This might be appropriate if this was a big pr oblem, but it is not a big problem. Perhaps this rule should apply only to listed companies? • Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns. No, I don’t think it should be disclosed in income tax returns. But maybe, if you really think it is important, perhaps the Special Purpose Reporting rules for Tax Purposes could be modified in order to require that that the ASC is disclosed in a note to the financial statements. 5.3 If these accounts are not prepared on a timely basis ... This seems unnecessarily punitive. Most taxpayers do try to be compliant but there are many reasons (including death or serious illness, or pandemic lockdowns) that might prevent the records being prepared on a timely basis. The TAA already has enough powers to encourage filing returns on a timely basis. There is no need to add to this. The second is to require taxpayers to keep and maintain these accounts ...but without requiring taxpayers to submit these accounts to Inland Revenue. Yes, this is the better option. ... maintain sufficient records to evidence the amounts entered in the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts... do you have any thoughts on what kind of evidence you want here? The phrase sounds nice, but it is rather vague. Perhaps a copy of the financial statements for the relevant year (showing that there genuinely was some kind of activity that increased the ASC) would be sufficient. 5.7 ... compliance with a requirement to maintain tracking accounts could be optional, on the basis that companies that do not choose to maintain accounts would then have no ASC or ACDA It seems to me that the need to prove ASC or ACDA would arise only on very rare occasions. Perhaps the companies that choose not to maintain such accounts could be permitted to reconstruct the records to prove the ASD balance, if and when the need ever arises. I can see that you want to provide for a greater level of proof. However, it really seems that you are asking a lot of extra record keeping for all companies, when the majority of them may never need to use the ASC balance at all. It seems quite an onerous addition to the responsibilities of small business people. 5.11 ... would be onerous. I totally agree! Personal services income attribution I suspect that an excess retention tax (like there was in the 1980’s) would be more effective in attaining your stated goal. Example 8: did you check before you wrote the example whether there is actually accompany called A Plus Accounting Ltd? It might be a bit rascally to be appropriating the name of a real business for your example. Your questions: • Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? The proposal is probably fair, but I don’t like it. Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? I can see your reasoning. You are trying to expand the scope of the personal service income rule to cover more than just a structure that is close in nature to employment. The goal is clearly to ensure that more income is passed through to shareholders, to be taxed at 39% rather than being retained by companies to be taxed at 28%. This seems to target one small corner of the self-employed market, while leaving others (for example where there are employees as well as a principal, or where personal services are mixed with sale of goods, such as tradesmen) untouched. I prefer a level playing field which is why I would recommend something more general and wide-ranging like excess retention tax. • Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? I don’t see any need to change the thresholds. This rule doesn’t have much impact, and changing it won’t make much difference. • Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000? Yes My question for you: has the 21 June 2020 Revenue Alert on Diverting Personal income been superseded? This alert encourages close companies to pay a market salary to shareholder(s) for personal services rendered.

Hi Team I have a suggestion that imputation credits in the Imputation Credit Account be limited to 3 years. The company must be forced to distribute dividends to use up imputation credits for closely held companies. Hope this suggestion will be helpful. Regards, Sandeep PUB-03 From:Zim Sherman To:Policy Webmaster Subject:Dividend integrity and person services income attribution Date:Sunday, 24 April 2022 4:24:12 PM External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments. Dear respected Ministers and staff, Please accept this submission. I have omitted comments on sections where I have no strong opinion. Regarding ASC and ACDA tracking accounts: Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity. In paragraph 5.2, you say: "Many companies have for their entire existence no more than nominal ASC." As a small business owner, I would say "most companies". At least here in the South Island, most businesses are small family-owned affairs. However, I do recognise this is a problem for some companies, especially the larger ones. For small business owners like myself, we struggle to keep our overhead low. The expense of a professional bookkeeper or accountant is significant, and, with our relatively simple tax system, largely unnecessary. However, with more and more recordkeeping, the drudgery of business administration expands to fill all available hours, substantially reducing our productivity. As a compromise, perhaps the recordkeeping should be structured with a threshold, below which no action is required. This would catch the big fish, while not adding to the struggles of the little fish. Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns. Yes, but only if required. Again, a grace-threshold based on income and/or value of assets transferred would prevent small business owners from drowning in a sea of recordkeeping. Regarding personal services income attribution: I have strong feeling about this. In paragraph 6.14, you say, "...the economic reality is that the taxpayer is performing work and being paid for it – the entity is effectively just a conduit for the taxpayer’s income-earning activity." PUB-05 I argue that this is a generalisation, and not true for many small business owners. I will use myself as an example: My company designs and sells electronics to scientists. It is quite a tiny niche, but every so often, it pays quite well. This pattern leads to some extreme income cycles: in some years we earn $260,000, in other years $7,000. The purpose of the business is to provide some stability. In a good year, I pay myself a standard salary that covers my living expenses; the remainder stays in the company as retained earnings. If I were to instead treat this money as "mine mine mine all mine", then the company would fail instantly when the bad year comes. • Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? I disagree with the proposed removal. I understand the need to create a barrier for people who abuse the tax system to avoid paying their fair share. The "80% one buyer rule" guards against people starting a business just so they can avoid being paid as an employee. It is a good rule. If you remove this rule, I would be exposed to quite a large tax burden during the good years. This would severely undermine my financial stability during the bad years. • Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? I don't think this test is fit for purpose. Some family businesses are legitimate, and others are tax shelters. Whether it's one person or two doesn't change this. It seems the original legal structure was created to catch a specific type of person -- a sole proprietor with a large income derived from (mostly) a single customer, for work that does not require a lot of investment. Essentially, this describes consultants who cater to one customer. What about the electrician who has an apprentice riding with her? 80% seems in the spirit of the original law, but at 50% you start to catch people you hadn't intended to catch. • Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? A business can still be legitimate if it does not require expensive equipment. I get paid for abilities that I have acquired over decades, but the tasks that I perform require very little equipment. What are my assets? Who can measure them? • Which of options one and two do you consider to be preferable? Is there another option that you think would be better than either of the thresholds suggested in this chapter? I think there are better ways to test whether the owner is truly invested in the business, besides summing the dollar value of the tangible assets. It is sometimes hard to say whether the earnings should be taxed as personal income, but if earnings are retained in the company -- and doesn't distribute the earnings through a trust, etc. -- those earnings are invested in the health of the company. That indicates that the owner treats the business as more than the conduit you describe in paragraph 6.14. • Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000? I think it could be increased, but a 157% bump seems like a lot. $110,000 ($60 per hour) is a reasonable figure for most professionals. To be honest, I think the value is irrelevant. The question is whether those earnings are personal or business in nature. I understand your dilemma. It is important to test whether a business is legitimate, or just a way to hide personal income from the taxman. However, this proposal burdens legitimate small businesses. Two take-home points: Because every business is different, you can't paint them all with the same brush. Business owners know their circumstances better than you do. Allow business owners to regulate their own personal income, and allow their businesses to retain earnings for a rainy day. Put pressure on the business owners who are transferring wealth out of their company inappropriately, but please find a better way to do it. (Target the inappropriate wealth transfer, not the legitimate earnings of the business entity.) Sincerely yours, Zim Sherman Scienterra Limited Oamaru, New Zealand www.scienterra.com Phone s 9(2)(a) 2 (other than those proposals which relate to recording ASC and ACDA, which do seem inherently sensible). Submissions on personal services income attribution The personal services income attribution rules have always been primarily aimed at “pseudo-employees”. The underlying logic was effectively to ensure that if a person entered a long term contractual arrangement with another entity for the supply of personal services, which would generally be an employment arrangement, and if the person and the entity structured the arrangement as that of independent contractor with an inter-posed company, the tax legislation would effectively recharacterise the related income stream as employment income. In addition a few additional factors were added to the applicable definitions to ensure that a relevant person/company, in a quasi-employee situation, who were not truly in business, could not easily structure their affairs in these sorts of situations to fall outside the proposed ambit of the personal services income attribution rules. It was never intended that the personal services income attribution rules should apply to a situation where the person/company were truly in business, and as such subject to the risks and rewards of business. In particular there was no logic, and there remains no logic, for treating one business differently from another business, from an income tax perspective, simply because one business is small and the other business is not. With this background in view I comment upon and submit on the proposed changes as follows: • The key issue to determine for application of the personal services income attribution rules should always be whether the person/company is a quasi-employee? • In determining this issue, one can safely and logically rely on the premise that a person/company is not a quasi-employee if the person/company carries on a business, with the attendant risks and rewards of business, as practically and legally it is well accepted that the status of carrying on a business is well different from the status of being in employment. • The current approach (and tests/thresholds) applied in the personal services income attribution rules focus on factors which are mostly relevant to determining whether the person/company carries on a business, having regard to the above premise that a person/company will not be a quasi-employee if it carries on a business. • Noting the above approach in the current personal services income attribution rules, logically the proposed changes should only be pursued if they assist to better resolve, in today’s economic environment, the issue as to whether a person/company is truly in business, and with it subject to the risks and rewards of business. • It is long established best practice in New Zealand, and all other comparable jurisdictions, to operate a business through a company format. Reasons include: limited liability, risk, separate legal personality, commercial perception etc. • A business, no matter its size, should be able to, and indeed should be encouraged to, follow best practice. Why should a large business be able to operate, in accordance with best practice, as a company and with company tax consequences, yet a smaller business would not be able to both operate as a company and have company tax consequences? 3 • The proposed changes with respect to thresholds for buyers and natural person suppliers seem completely arbitrary and do not assist with the issue as to whether the person/company is in business. • In particular, the logic behind examples 8 & 9 seems entirely flawed. Surely if a company is conducting a business with a number of customers, the company, is not a quasi-employee, is in business, and should be taxed as such. • Given the company in the example has a number of customers, t here would be no doubt that the company would be a business if it had many service suppliers. Why should this result alter if it does not have many suppliers? There are any number of reasons why that company is in business and has a single supplier (choice, business size, flexibility, constrained by investment funds available, constrained by customers available etc). The fact that the company is in business would remain, large or small. • New Zealand has many small businesses following best practice and operating as companies, and providing a range of services. • The size of the business, and the number of buyers and natural person suppliers, (beyond certain obvious business-related thresholds, (such as those currently applicable)), are completely irrelevant as to the inquiry of whether the company is carrying on a business and should be taxed accordingly. • If the proposals in this area are pursued, small businesses in a number of situations, many completely arbitrary, would be taxed in a quite different way from larger businesses. Such an outcome arbitrarily penalises smaller businesses and clearly lacks integrity. • With the above comments in view I submit the current thresholds for buyers and natural person suppliers should not be changed. • The suggested changes to the substantial business asset tests do not seem to be based on useful logic, and do not seem to assist to answer the relevant questions. Most businesses in the personal services areas in today’s world are heavily reliant on information technology, (with or without the need for other specific business related assets), and the cost of computers and software etc has not risen to such a level as to make the suggested optional levels of $150,000 or $200,000 realistic. Hence I submit the substantial business assets threshold should not be increased as proposed. If anything, the substantial business assets threshold should be reduced. (For example, how many quasi-employees do you know who currently have $75,000 or more of business assets?). • Given the reasons the Document advances for looking at this area, and given the breadth of the deemed dividend rules, I see little logic in keeping the income threshold at $70,000. o There should be no impediment to retaining income (by way of retained earnings) in a company for ongoing business funding purposes. This approach is common to all companies, and small companies should not be restrained or penalised in this regard. o Alternatively if the income is not required for business funding purposes, and is somehow to be advanced or made available to the working person, one would very reasonably expect that the broad deemed dividend rules would apply to the amount advanced or made available, and would tax the associated benefit as a dividend at appropriate tax rates. • Therefore retaining the $70,000 income threshold is entirely unnecessary in the context of the broad deemed dividend rules, and would seem only to add 2 Questions Is deeming a dividend to arise when shares are sold (while the company has retained earnings) an appropriate policy outcome? 7. The Law Society does not agree that this is an appropriate policy outcome, and considers the proposal should not proceed, because: a. There are genuine commercial reasons for companies not distributing amounts to shareholders. These can include the need to reinvest retained earnings, to drive capital growth (i.e., payments expended on expanding the taxpayer’s business, or the growth of a capital asset). b. Paragraph 2.23 of the Discussion Document implies that the increased balances of non- listed companies’ imputation accounts are attributable to businesses deciding not to incur the tax which would arise from distributions, and instead looking to sell a company and access a tax-free capital gain. i. We consider this is incorrect. Whether a company pays a dividend and whether shareholders decide to sell their shares in a company is determined by a range of commercial factors, often outside of the control of the company or the shareholders. For example, changes in the investment market away from income generating assets towards capital growth stock. ii. A clear example of this is New Zealand’s tech sector, which will generally not pay dividends to its shareholders, instead making the business decision to reinvest profits, to develop world leading technologies. If instead such companies are concerned with the tax bills that may arise when, say, a venture capitalist or angel investor makes an investment, they may be more inclined to distribute dividends regularly to avoid a lump sum tax charge. c. The experience of practitioners is that the purchaser in a transaction will often require the target to declare a taxable dividend immediately prior to the transaction, equivalent to the total amount of cash held by the company. This is commonly achieved by an agreed working capital statement in the sale and purchase agreement. Contrary to the Discussion Document’s underlying premise, a vendor does not sell a cashed-up target to a third-party purchaser. This is because the purchaser of the shares does not want to pay ‘cash for cash’. d. The proposed rule would in effect create a ‘shadow’ capital gains tax on shares otherwise genuinely held on a capital account that would not ordinarily be taxable. Imposing a tax on the sale of shares to third parties would create a financial penalty for entering a transaction and could prevent commercially beneficial transactions from taking place. This would be an example of tax policy unduly impacting commercial outcomes. e. The proposed rule is unnecessarily complex, and seeks to target a perceived risk that is not borne out in practice: i. It is not the experience of practitioners that taxpayers dispose of their share interests in order to access untaxed gains. Ordinarily, taxpayers dispose of their interests when they consider they can realise value on a capital asset that aligns with their investment horizon, or with a need to introduce new shareholders to the company, and not because there is a large sum of retained earnings on the balance sheet. There are existing avoidance rules in force to counter this issue, 3 and the Commissioner is known to be actively considering transactions of interest, as an operational matter. ii. Moreover, the current proposal does not consider the many complexities associated with introducing what is, in effect, a form of capital gains tax – including: • Whether any rollover relief would be available (i.e., upon the death of shareholder) and, in the event that no relief is allowed, whether the proposal would act as a form of inheritance tax on shares owned by relatives. • The application of the proposal in the event of an internal reorganisation. • The application of the proposal to employee share schemes. • The conflict between the current proposal and existing regimes in the Income Tax Act. For example, the ability of New Zealand companies to receive as exempt income dividends from CFCs engaged in active business. • How pre-enactment retained earning would be treated. Specifically, whether there would be a valuation date or whether the retained earnings of a business would be ‘grandparented.’ 8. In addition, the proposal will apply inconsistently to only New Zealand tax resident persons, as it is not currently proposed to apply to businesses owned by non-resident shareholders. This proposal may disincentivise local investments in New Zealand businesses by increasing the cost of investment, which has the potential to reduce productivity generally (particularly when coupled with the current tax rate for inbound investment). 9. Should the proposal proceed, the Law Society is of the view that this proposal should only apply to future acquisitions, for which taxpayers are aware that the capital gain of their shares would be taxed (and so the relevant return on investment can be accurately calculated). The proposal is retrospective as it taxes retained earnings arising prior to enactment and will impact the return on investments already made. Taxpayers have acquired shares on a capital basis expecting that the capital nature of the asset would be respected, especially so considering the Government’s policy not to tax capital gains. Should the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule cover all of scenarios A, B, and C? 10. For the reasons outlined above, the Law Society does not consider that the rule should be introduced for any of the scenarios outlined in the Discussion Document. 11. Scenario A is covered by existing law. The Law Society considers that the tax legal landscape is already saturated. Adding a new rule that will overlap considerably with existing law is not desirable. 12. Scenarios B and C relate to arms’ length transactions between parties that are not associated. These rules would add a level of complexity that would make business transactions unnecessarily more difficult to complete, could lead to a loss of business activity, the adoption of new business structures or tax-driven changes in business investment strategies. 4 Is limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule to sales of shares by a controlling shareholder appropriate, or do you think this is too broad or too limited? 13. The Law Society considers the proposed rules are too broad. Imposing a tax only on controlling shareholders seems to be somewhat arbitrary, and could create inequitable outcomes, as illustrated in the below examples: a. A business set up by two unrelated individuals, owning 51% and 49% respectively. The shareholding is based on the amount that was genuinely available by both parties to be invested into the business. Clearly in this case, there is an advantage gained by the 49% shareholder, because when they have reached their investment horizon and seek to realise a return on their capital asset, they will not be subject to the proposed rule. However, the 51% shareholder would be, and would likely receive lower capital return compared to the other shareholder despite owning a larger percentage of the company. b. A New Zealand investor which acquires more than 50% of the shares in a company, which had not previously had any one person (or group of related persons) with an interest of more than 50% (i.e., these proposed rules would not apply to the vendors, and there would be no step up in ASC etc). The company has been operating for the best part of 15 years, and has not paid a single dividend as all profits have been reinvested into the company’s business. The investor holds the shares for 5 years, and no dividends are paid in this time. When the investor seeks to dispose of the asset, they will be taxed on 20 years of retained earnings, of which they were not a shareholder for 75% of the time. The Discussion Document does not contemplate whether the retained earnings created prior to the enactment of the proposal would be taxed in a scenario such as the above. Further, it does not contemplate whether retained earnings arising prior to the controlling shareholder obtaining a shareholding would be subject to this proposal. 14. In addition, the proposed application of the associate and ‘act together’ rules are too broad. If an ‘act together’ test like the definition in the hybrid rules is adopted, then the breadth of the proposal will be very wide, and likely beyond the scope of the intended objective of counteracting tax avoidance. 15. If the rules are to proceed, the Law Society considers a more appropriate threshold would be for application of the rules to those with more than 80 percent of the voting interests in the company. Is the conceptual basis for quantifying the deemed dividend (that is, undistributed income, not including untaxed capital gains) appropriate? 16. As outlined, the Law Society does not agree with the proposed rules in principle. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested dividend quantification approaches (grossed-up ICA, retained earnings, or a combination of the two) and which of these approaches do you prefer? Is there an alternative approach you would suggest? 17. If the proposal is adopted, the Law Society suggests that the most appropriate quantification approach would be to calculate the deemed dividend on the lower of the grossed-up ICA balance and the sales price, for the following reasons. 18. We do not consider that retained earnings should be used to quantify the deemed dividend. Retained earnings is an accounting concept, and its computation is clearly governed by a set of accounting standards (i.e., GAAP or IFRS) and not taxable profits. There are a range of items that go into the computation of retained earnings that may not otherwise give rise to income 5 tax. For example, profit could include significant unrealised gains (e.g., property) that would not be taxed, which is clearly the case as there are adjustments made in tax calculations. 19. Another example is a profit in one accounting year which will be reversed in subsequent years (for example, a mark to market gain on a long-term supply contract). To then tax these amounts via the proposed rules could result in over taxation, and again encourage regular distribution of dividends which otherwise would have been reinvested into the business. Further, the flexibility of accounting rules and their inconsistent application could cause a range of issues. Recourse to tax concepts is desirable to ensure that the scope of this rule is not broadened due to changes in accounting standards. 20. ICA accounts will not always be reflective of undistributed earnings in a company. For example, deposits / withdrawals can be made from tax pools that would increase or decrease the ICA of a company. In addition, an ICA is predominantly impacted through provisional tax. Provisional tax, by its very nature a ‘guesstimate.’ 1 Ordinarily, provisional tax is overestimated to avoid UOMI and penalties. This could result in a shareholder paying more tax than would otherwise have been paid if regular dividends had been paid – again, this could encourage regular distributions of dividends and is not conducive to good business practice. Despite these drawbacks, if the proposal is to be adopted, we consider the grossed-up ICA balance to be the better of two difficult options. 21. To the extent these rules are implemented, it will be important any deemed dividend that would arise is capped at the cash proceeds, not the total sale proceeds, as this could result in a “dry” tax charge for the vendor. 2 Do you agree with the proposed approach (outlined in Example 3) for calculating dividends and ASC adjustments for corporate groups? 22. Example 6 3 demonstrates the complexity of this proposal. Further, it only calculates the retained earnings based on the grossed-up ICA balance and does not demonstrate how the accounting retained earnings would be calculated. Therefore, we consider that the proposed approach outlined in Example 6 does not adequately explain the full impact of this proposal. 23. As noted above, and as noted in the Discussion Document, the ICA balance is not a perfect measure, and could result in over-taxation. Is the approach outlines in Example 4 for a sale of one controlled company to another (existing) controlled company (potentially generating a deemed dividend from both companies) correct conceptually? 24. The Law Society notes that applying such a rule to activities within a corporate group will likely impact normal corporate activities, such as corporate restructures, outside of the policy intent of this initiative. Part II: ASC and ACDA tracking accounts Whether the proposed transitional rule is appropriate 25. Given Inland Revenue’s views on current law applying to ASC (and by extension, ACDA), the Law Society does not consider there is a compelling case for further administrative reporting. 26. However, should Option 1 be adopted, the transitional rule appears to be appropriate. We consider that ASC should be debited on a FIFO basis, such that is should be debited against FSC 1 This is somewhat accepted at paragraph 3.33 of the Discussion Document. 2 As noted at paragraph 3.41 of the Discussion Document. 3 This appears to be the intended reference. 6 prior to the formation of a tracking account, with any residual ASC not used then only being added to a tracking account. This method means taxpayers would have to calculate historical ASC amounts only when they seek to return an amount of ASC, and not immediately. Whether the Commissioner should be able to reopen a return and on what basis 27. Consistent with other provisions across tax legislation, it would seem inappropriate for the Commissioner to reopen a return. The time bar should apply. Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity 28. The Law Society is of the view that this proposal creates unnecessary compliance costs. 29. As noted in the Discussion Document and in OS 22/01, 4 taxpayers already bear the onus to evidentially substantiate the ASC and ACDA amounts of a business. Imposing an administrative barrier that would bar a proper claim of an ASC amount under Option 1, even where there is the evidence to prove such ASC amount, is undesirable. Further, the Law Society does not see any difference in substance between Option 2 and the current law. Option 2 is voluntary, just as the current law (as reflected in OS 22/01) is, in that a company can decide whether or not to keep records in relation to ASC (and ACDA) which would allow it to substantiate a claim in the future. Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns 30. We do not consider this should be required. The law currently imposes an evidential burden on taxpayers to prove they have the claimed ASC or ACDA. This would impose a further compliance burden. Part III: Personal services income attribution Do you agree with the proposed removal of the ’80 percent one buyer’ test? Why/Why not? 31. This appears to be appropriate. Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the ’80 percent one natural person supplier’ test, from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/Why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? 32. The Law Society does not agree with this proposal, as it may have unintended consequences. 33. For example, consider a business with one principal and two others (a junior and a manager). To the extent the principal’s charge out rate is higher than the others, they may derive 50% of the revenue for the firm. However, in this instance, there would be genuine reasons for a corporation to be used, namely, to be an employer for the other two staff members. To say the principal in this case is using a corporation to avoid tax in such a situation is incorrect. Further, this would add considerable complexity to the taxation of small businesses (or non- compliance for those who are not aware of such a rule). Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/Why not? 34. They appear to be appropriate, particularly considering rising costs due to inflation. 35. The Law Society does not agree there is a need to remove the cost of vehicles. In particular, the reference to luxury vehicles – it is not clear what the definition of this is. A luxury vehicle is 4 Available Subscribed Capital record keeping requirements.

Questions for submitters • Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? Yes. An employee at a large firm usually does work for more then one main client, yet gets taxed at the highest applicable rate. Self employed should be treated in a similar fashion. • Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? I support this - but wonder what proportion of consultants are 1 person only so do 100% of the work and this wouldn’t affect them. Also would it discourage employing others to grow a business? • Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? Not sure, no business experience • Which of options one and two do you consider to be preferable? Is there another option that you think would be better than either of the thresholds suggested in this chapter? Not sure, no business experience • Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000? No. I would like equitable treatment of all taxpayers so the threshold should be the same at $70k Dear IRD, Overall I support the suggested changes to tax rules proposed in the discussion paper because: 1. As a salaried employee myself, I know that employees are sitting ducks for PAYE and have no recourse to reduce tax by any of the mechanisms in the discussion paper. Private citizens contribute a large proportion of tax revenue through being employees, aka “wage slaves”. 2. There is an increasing trend towards what is known as the “gig economy”, which for many individuals means forming their own small company with only themselves or perhaps one other and essentially becoming consultants instead of employees, often providing services to only 1 - 3 main clients, and minimising their tax bill by the mechanisms in the discussion paper. 3. These two trends lead to an unbalanced situation where salaried employees are unfairly contributing a larger share of the tax revenue, and the number of employees is reducing as some create their own companies to become consultants in order to minimise their tax obligations. For the sake of equity I support the changes in this discussion paper.

New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited was established with the purpose of accelerating and facilitating low emissions investment and is a company listed in Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act. We have a broad investment mandate and have the flexibility to use several different structures (including owning equity in businesses) to make investments that can further our objectives. 1 We currently have four equity investments and regularly consider others. We were incorporated for the purpose of investing to reduce emissions, and to help others to do the same. As an entity owned and funded by the Crown, we certainly support a tax system that has integrity, and has rules that are not easily circumvented. As is already the case, the Crown will need to invest heavily in climate change mitigation and adaptation over the coming years; having a tax system under which people contribute their fair share will be important to that investment. However, anything that makes it harder to provide finance to reduce Aotearoa New Zealand’s emissions will make the job of mitigating climate change significantly harder. Climate change presents a fundamental threat to our way of life and the solution to it will involve innovative businesses developing new processes, products, technologies, and services. Many of the businesses that will be at the forefront of the required change are in their infancy now. Businesses we see that are developing these new processes, products, technologies, and services are often small, closely-held companies, run by founders with a passion for their business. Those businesses need to be able to grow, and their founders need to see a path to reward for the effort the put in and the risks they take. While we support the general principle in the dividend integrity proposal that shareholders should pay tax at their marginal rate on income from a company they control (where that income is subject to a dividend stripping arrangement), we submit that thought needs to be given to the circumstances in which a shareholder should be considered to be dividend stripping. 1 Our objectives are: to invest to reduce emissions; to crowd-in private capital; to invest on a commercial basis; and to show market leadership. PUB-010 2. Founded by David Farrar and Jordan Williams in 2013, the Taxpayers’ Union’s mission is Lower Taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency. We enjoy the support of some 170,000 registered members and supporters, making us the most popular campaign group championing fiscal conservatism and transparency. We are funded by our thousands of donors and approximately five percent of our income is from membership dues and donations from private industry supporters. 3. We are a lobby group not a think tank. Our grassroots advocacy model is based on international taxpayer- group counterparts, particularly in the United Kingdom and Canada, and similar to campaign organisations on the left, such as Australia’s Get Up, New Zealand’s ActionStation, and Greenpeace. 4. The Union is a member of the World Taxpayers Associations - a coalition of taxpayer advocacy groups representing millions of taxpayers across more than 60 countries. 5. We give permission for Inland Revenue to publish this submission. Introduction 6. The government discussion document (“the Document”) proposes three changes. This submission is on two of the proposals: a. Shareholders being taxed on the sale of shares in a company to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings b. The changes to the personal services company rules that effectively remove when small business can use the lower corporate tax rate. 7. We strongly oppose both these proposals as in effect, they amount to additional taxes on small businesses. The case for such ad hoc measures being necessary to buttress the 39% income tax rate is not made in the Document. 8. Instead, these measures would prevent small businesses from using retained earnings taxed at the corporate tax to invest in the firm’s plant and machinery and other necessary business assets. 9. Taxing share sales on the gross value of the underlying retained earnings, in effect, deems all such earnings to be distributed to the vendor shareholder at the time of the share sale. However, the earnings are still invested in the firm funding business assets. There is no justification for deeming this to be income of the vendor shareholder when it is still invested in the business. 10. Applying this rule to all controlling shareholders including shareholders who “act together” would mean the rule would apply to most family businesses. In effect they are then denied the 28% company tax rate for reinvested profits that other larger businesses have. 11. The current personal services attribution rule deems the income of a company that is in effect merely the single shareholder’s employment income to be income of that shareholder and so is taxed at individual rates not the company rate. For the rule to apply currently: a. 80% of the firm income must come from one client; and b. The owner must generate 80% or more of the firm profits; and c. The firm must have less than $75,000 in business assets. 12. The proposal is in effect to apply this rule to many family businesses that have fewer than two or three employees and business assets less than $150,000 to $250,000. This would cover many tradies and small contactors. They would be denied the ability to finance assets out of profits taxed at the 28% company tax rate. We say that is unfair and wrong. Taxation of the sale of shares 13. The Government proposes that when a shareholder sells their shares, they will be taxed as a dividend on a portion of the shares if: a. they are a controlling shareholder owning more than 50% of the shares; or b. if they are “acting together” with other shareholders where they and the other shareholder control the company. 14. The taxable dividend will be the greater of: a. the shareholder interest in the retained earnings of the company (grossed up for imputation credits); or b. the quantum of imputation credits in the company (grossed up by the tax rate). 15. Our opposition with taxing the sale of shares is as follows: a. The stated problem is avoidance of the 39% tax rate. The proposals are not limited to such avoidance. (See: Problem definition) b. The proposal is, in many cases, a tax on the gross return from the sale of shares and therefore in some cases it will be on an amount that exceeds the economic income of the shareholder. (See: Taxation on gross proceeds) c. The proposals are not practical and therefore not workable. (See: Proposals are not practical) d. The practical effect of the proposals will materially impact on commercial transactions and in some cases result in commercial transactions now not occurring. (See: Economic distortion caused by the proposals) Problem definition 16. The Document outlines how the Government is concerned about the integrity of the 39% tax rate for individuals. a. “The Government’s work on integrity measures to support the 39% personal income tax rate is being progressed in tranches. Tranche one, which is the focus of this discussion document, concerns dividend integrity and income attribution measures” (page 5) b. “The biggest area of concern relates to closely-held companies and trusts that are used to earn income on behalf of relatively high income individuals, particularly those who earn income that is taxed at the top personal tax rate of 39% (or who would have income taxed at the top personal rate if they earned the income directly rather than through an entity)”. (Para 1.7) c. While the Government’s main concern is the integrity of the 39% tax rate, the proposals in this document can affect taxpayers at any personal tax rate in situations where some of or all their income is being earned through entities. (para 1.9) 17. The proposed solution is considerably wider than the problem as outlined above. While reference is also made to avoidance at the 33% tax rate, again the proposal is not limited to avoidance of these rates. As outlined below, the proposal is a tax on gross income and is unrelated to taxpayers who are on the 33% or 39% tax rates. For example, a widely held corporate which has no controlling shareholder is subject to these rules while its tax rate is 28%. Further all its shareholders might be portfolio investment entities, again this is of no relevance to the stated problem definition. 18. As detailed further below, the proposal is a tax on the gross proceeds and not on the net gain of the shareholder. Taxing a shareholder on their gross sales proceeds has no relationship to their actual gain. For example, it is possible under the proposal that a shareholder sells shares at a loss however, under the proposal, they have taxable income. Again, this is not related to the avoidance of the 39% tax rate. 19. It is proposed that the measure not apply to the sale of shares in a listed company and the sale by non- controlling shareholders (unless they are acting together with other shareholders who control the company). If this is the right policy outcome for major shareholders, then it would seem logical it should apply to all shareholders. The document says it is not practical for non-controlling shareholders to undertake the detailed calculations, however as discussed below, we do not believe it is practical for controlling shareholders. Taxation on gross proceeds 20. The proposal is to tax the shareholders interest on the greater of: a. The retained earnings of the company b. The grossing up of the imputation credits of the company 21. This is a tax on the gross proceeds and not on the net gain of the shareholder. It is clear from the Document that this the intended outcome. (Para 3.41) 22. This would result in absurd outcomes. For example, where the controlling shareholder acquired a company that already had retained earnings and subsequently sells those shares, the shareholder will be taxed both on retained earnings accumulated during the ownership of the shareholder and the retained earnings in the company when it was acquired by the shareholder (pre acquisition retained earnings). That amounts to double taxation. 23. Not only would this mean that a person is taxed on retained earnings derived before they had an interest in the company, but they are also taxed if the shareholder sells the shares at a loss. 24. The above examples are where a company is acquired and then sold. Unwarranted tax liabilities can arise when a company was incorporated by the shareholder and then disposed of. As noted para 3.41 of the Document states this is the intended outcome. An example of this is as follows: Profits 138,889 Less tax at 28% 38,889 Profits after tax 100,000 Capital loss - 50,000 Shareholder’s funds/net assets 50,000 Sale value 50,000 Gain on sale of shares 50,000 Taxable income 100,000 25. Paragraph 3.41 states that if the loss was allowed this would effectively allow a deduction for capital losses. The problem with the above, is that it is taxing gains that never eventuated. Further, if the company was first liquidated and the shareholder then sold the net assets of the company for $50,000 then the tax that arises under the proposals would not arise. This is an absurd result. No tax liability would arise if instead of selling the company it is liquidated and then the distributed assets sold. The alternative of liquidating the company will obviously incur substantial compliance costs in undertaking the liquidation, the need to transfer of commercial contracts and the overall added complexity. 26. A similar result arises under the alternative of grossing up the imputation credits. Using the above example, as opposed to a capital loss if there were simply non-deductible losses, such as revenue expenditure that was not tax deductible, a similar result occurs. That is: Profits 138,889 Tax at 28% 38,889 Profits after tax 100,000 Non-deductible expenditure - 50,000 Shareholder’s funds/net assets 50,000 Sale value 50,000 Gain on sale of shares 50,000 Retained earnings 50,000 Imputation credits 38,889 Gross up of imputation credits 138,889 27. Under the proposals, the taxable income is the greater of the retained earnings ($50,000) and the gross up of the imputation credits. Given the non-deductible expenditure the grossing up of the imputation credits gives rise to taxable income of $138,889 whereas the company was only sold for $50,000. 28. The above examples also highlight the effect of the shareholder deriving all the income in the year of sale. Consider an example where a company earns $150,000 each year. Each year the company pays a salary of $100,000 therefore leaving in the company $50,000 (before tax) to invest in stock, plant and machinery. After five years of retained $50,000 (before tax), the company will have retained earnings of $250,000 less tax of $70,000 (at 28%), that is retained earnings of $180,000. If the company is sold, at the end of year 5, the taxpayer will have total taxable income of $100,000 salary and $180,000 dividend. That is $280,000 of which $100,000 is taxed at 39% (the excess over $180,000). In all the years the taxable and the company never had combined income over $180,000. In this case there is no issue of anyone avoiding the 39% tax rate but income is taxed at the 39% rate. Proposals are not practical 29. These rules come with substantial complexity and are not practical to implement or only implementable by incurring substantial compliance costs. 30. The proposal requires the calculation of the retained earning at the time of sale. This will require detailed financial accounts at the sale date during the income year when shareholding changes take place. In the situation where the controlling shareholder is progressively selling down to employees through the income year, this will require detailed accounts to be prepared throughout the income year. This comes at a substantial compliance cost or transactions will be aligned with income tax balance date or transactions will not occur at all. 31. The cost of detailed financial accounts also will require of level of precision that for many companies is only undertaken at year end. This includes: a. Depreciation calculations to shareholding change date. b. Physical stock takes. c. Accrual and provisions including calculation of tax liabilities, holiday provisions, shareholder salaries etc to the date of sale. 32. There will likely be a range of avoidance rules to prevent taxpayers artificially reducing retained earnings to reduce the tax payable by the sale of shares by major shareholders (such as the over-provision for expenses). The scope and breath of these rules is not yet known so it is not possible to provide detailed comments other than this will raise compliance costs. 33. The calculation of the imputation credits at the point of sale has also not been fully canvassed in the Document. This will likely need to be adjusted for tax liabilities post the sale or outstanding tax refunds. There is no comment on how tax liabilities from the last income year to the point of sale are to be treated. For example, if there are material profits from the last balance date but no tax has yet been paid with respect of that period, is some adjustment required? Economic distortion caused by the proposals 34. Many companies initially start with insufficient capital. They accumulate capital through the retention of taxable income, that is retained earnings. The proposals in the Document will create a tax cost for many commercial transactions and as such it could create a barrier to undertaking ordinary commercial transactions. It is proposed that the tax will be paid when any controlling shareholder sells shares in the following situations: a. Introducing employees b. Introducing another partner c. Succession planning 35. When introducing the above shareholders, the major shareholder will be taxed on the retained earnings portion of the shares being sold. Most small and medium size companies build capital by retaining profits so that the level of retained profits will be significant, especially if retained earnings are accumulated over a number of years. The retained earnings are likely to be invested in plant and machinery etc. necessary to operate the business. 36. When a controlling shareholder sells even a small portion of their shares there could be a significant cash liability even though the funds are still in the company. This could be a significant barrier for controlling shareholders selling shares to employees, new partners or combining businesses. Conclusion to taxing the sale of shares 37. Conclusion: a. This is a significant tax imposition on the sale of many companies. While portrayed as taxing those avoiding the 39% tax rate, these proposals go much further and will impact shareholders that have never been on the 39% tax rate. b. For many small and medium size companies these proposals will create a barrier to introducing new investors, rewarding employees with shares and succession planning. This is a material economic distortion that is not discussed in the document. c. These rules will come with extreme complexity and therefore compliance costs. Personal services attribution rule 38. It is also proposed to change the personal services attribution income. Where a company earns taxable income it is taxed at 28%. Generally, where the income from the company is derived from the services of one person and 80% or more of that gross income comes from one customer and there are no substantial assets (costing greater than $75,000), then the income of the company is taxed at the person’s individual marginal tax rate as opposed to the corporate tax rate. This is referred to as the personal services attribution income. Removal of the 80% individual supplier rule 46. The personal services attribution rule requires 80% of the “effort” to provide the services to come from one person (in the above example it is Bill). “Effort” is in proportion of the income of the business the one person derives. 47. It is proposed to reduce this “80% effort test” down to 50%. That is, the person providing the services currently has to provide at least 80% of the effort. It is proposed to reduce this down to 50%. 48. With the requirement that 80% of the income comes from one client (as above), the “80% effort test” makes sense. With the removal of the requirement that 80% of the income comes from one client, the reduction of the “80% effort test” to a 50% test means that small service businesses with one or potentially two or three employees cannot access the 28% corporate tax rate. 49. If there is only one shareholder employee providing the services, then the personal services attribution rule would naturally apply (whether an 80% or 50% effort test). Reducing the 80% effort test down to 50% means where the company has one, two or three employees (including the shareholder employee) then the rules will only apply if the shareholder employee is providing at least 50% of the “effort”. This is obviously extremely subjective. It requires detailed analysis of whether the shareholder employee contributed at least 50% of the “effort” to generate the income of the company and in many cases this will not be measured. 50. If there is an accounting business with say one accountant and say two other employees, this business will be prohibited from retaining profits with the tax rate of 28% if the accountant generated 50% of more of the “effort” to derive the income. Why such a business cannot access the 28% corporate tax rate when similar business with more employees can is not explained. 51. For the reasons outlined above, we submit there should be no changes to the existing rules. Substantial asset test 52. The personal income attribution rules do not currently apply if the business has substantial assets used to generate the services income. In most situations there is a $75,000 threshold when an asset becomes substantial and the personal income attribution rules do not apply if that threshold is exceeded. For example, a farming contractor that provides services such as cutting grass is not caught by the personal attribution rules if they have a substantial assets such as the tractor. Currently, they can access the corporate tax rate retaining profits at the 28% tax rate to repay the loan to buy the tractor. 53. There are two proposals with respect of this exemption from the personal services attribution rules. The first is to increase the $75,000 test to either $150,000 or $200,000 due to “the cost of business assets today.” (para 7.7). The second proposal is to remove passenger vehicles or luxury vehicles (para 7.8). 54. There is no explanation for the increase in the threshold from $75,000 to either $150,000 or $200,000. There is no explanation what forms “the cost of business assets” noted above. 55. Removing “passenger vehicles” is also without policy rationale. If the substantial asset is a bus, it is unclear why the taxpayer cannot access the corporate tax rate to finance the cost of the bus. Likewise, if PUB-012 s 9(2)(a) Dividend integrity and personal services income attributiion – a Government discussion document 27 April 2022 Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. The Minister of Revenue recently stated that he has no idea what the effective tax rate (on economic income) of taxpayers is. Despite that, the discussion document draws conclusions from limited information. This is used to support the discussion documents proposals. The results that are observed are because of structural features and choices for the tax system. If a person uses a company to operate a business or a trust or portfolio investment entity (PIE) to make investments, the tax system operates in a particular and chosen by parliament way. To be able to achieve these results: • there must in reality be a company, a trust or a PIE. These all have a combination of tax and other rules which govern how they can and must operate; • the number of companies, trusts, and PIEs is irrelevant to the tax outcomes and is neutral as to the tax outcomes. (From a purely tax perspective, only one company or trust is required to produce the company or trust tax rate. The number of them must be driven by other requirements.) Apart from the personal services attribution rule, personal and “entity” integration is not a consistent principle of the New Zealand tax system. In fact, the reverse can often be the case. For example, the Look Through Company (LTC) regime prevents integration through the LTC qualification rules. Further, the dividend rules mean that a capital gain made by a company cannot be distributed to shareholders. Significantly, the PIE rules also have a tax rate difference of 11% for those with taxable income of greater than $180,000. (I note this is excluded from consideration as “savings policy”. This does not mean it is not contrary evidence to the integration principle implied by the discussion document.) Despite this the discussion document proceeds from the assertion that results which do not align with integration “avoid” the application of personal marginal tax rates. That should not be the conclusion or the starting point. The better question is whether integration should be the principle. If it is, the questions that arise include: • when should the personal tax rate apply? Should the company and personal tax rate differential should be preserved? Reinvestment of company profits at a lower tax rate may be desirable so that integration does not apply as a company makes taxable income. If there is a desirable difference, do the current dividend rules support the reasons for a differential rate? (Use of company profits by shareholders without a dividend being taxed is contrary to the reason for a differential tax rate. If the shareholder has use of the company profit, it is not reinvested in the business. Ostensibly, this is a driver for the discussion document’s proposals. However, the s 9(2)(a) Dividend integrity and personal services income attributiion – a Government discussion document 27 April 2022 Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. assumptions made and conclusions drawn do not make a convincing case for the proposed deemed dividend rules. • should the LTC regime be relaxed to allow greater use of the regime? • should a company distribute capital gains without it being a dividend? If integration is the objective, there is no reason why company capital gains should be treated as dividends. • Should shareholders be able to use company tax losses? If integration is the principle, then company tax losses are losses of the individual shareholders. These questions should be considered rather than proceeding with further ad hoc changes. (Note that some of these questions arise from the proposal in any case. For example, if taxable income is deemed distributed why are tax losses not deemed attributed on sale of shares?) If the proposals proceed, there will be a partial integration principle - integration would not apply to investments in widely held companies or PIEs and integration would only arise on disposal of shares. The discussion document does not provide a convincing argument for why this should be the case. Other observations The discussion document, consistent with Government policy, rules out a comprehensive capital gains tax. I note that this constrains the policy choices and means potentially better policy cannot be pursued. (“Better” in the sense of coherence.) As an aside, I note that US dividend treatment may not be the best example for New Zealand tax treatment. The context is different. The US has a classical company tax system, capital gains tax and has specific treatments (for example, for share buybacks) which both seek to tax and exempt distributions from companies. This is different to the New Zealand system and approach. General comment In short, comprehensive integration of personal and “entity” taxation should be considered for whether it should be (it currently is not) a principle of New Zealand’s tax system. If it is, there are further changes to tax policy which should be pursued. However, I expect these concerns will be dismissed. That is, in my view, unfortunate as it reduces the prospects of having a good tax system. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Inland Revenue Department KPMG submission - Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution discussion documen t 28 April 2022 20532320\_1Document classification: KPMG Confidential 2 reinvested in the business (such as in plant or other business assets), rather than being paid out as a dividend. The discussion document does not make any distinction, for example, between retained earnings that are reinvested versus held in cash and available for distribution. The proposal to treat a sale of shares as giving rise to a deemed dividend, to the extent of retained earnings, can also be seen as a form of capital gains tax. This is because it will recharacterise some of the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset as a taxable amount. We note the Government has made clear that it has no intention of introducing a capital gains tax. This is, therefore, a clear overreach. We believe that further work is needed to significantly modify the proposals. The scope should be appropriately narrowed to address the identified integrity issues and no more. We discuss this in more detail below. Part I: Sale of shares Principal submission – the proposed deemed dividend rule should not proceed The scope of any dividend recharacterisation rule should be limited to transactions where it is clear that the primary driver is converting what would otherwise be a dividend to a capital gain (that is, there is a clear tax avoidance purpose or intention). It is not an appropriate policy outcome to deem a dividend to arise more generally when shares are sold, merely on the basis that the company has retained earnings at the time the shares are sold. This has no regard, for example, to how retained profits have been utilised. We note that the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) already contains targeted rules to deal with “dividend stripping” (in section GB 1), together with the general anti-avoidance provision (in section BG 1). In our view, the current rules are already sufficiently wide to deal with the stated tax rate integrity problems, provided they are appropriately enforced by Inland Revenue. The most likely scenario where there could be a dividend stripping risk is scenario A, where the shareholder sells shares of a controlled company to a related company for a loan back. Here, the shareholder retains economic ownership of the company and can use the loan to access the retained earnings of the controlled company without paying any additional tax. We believe the existing dividend stripping rules will be effective in targeting such arrangements. In contrast, scenarios B and C, which involve the sale of shares to third parties, appear to us to be standard commercial transactions and not undertaken for tax-related reasons. But no such distinction is drawn in the discussion document – the inference is that there is a clear tax motive. Where there are undistributed retained earnings, this will generally be because the profits have been reinvested and there is no cash available to pay a dividend. On the sale of a business resulting in a greater than 34% shareholding change, any imputation credits will be forfeited. In our experience, if cash balances were held, these will generally be distributed pre-sale. This is because the value of any undistributed retained earnings that will not be sheltered by imputation credits would generally be discounted by the purchaser, who will be inheriting a future tax cost when these earnings are distributed. Therefore, it is not correct to say that a controlling shareholder will receive full value for the value of retained earnings in the business, on sale. We do not believe legislative changes are required to deem a dividend to arise in scenarios A to C. To the extent that there is clearly dividend stripping in these scenarios, the current rules (sections BG 1 and GB 1) can be applied by Inland Revenue. If a legislative rule is needed, we strongly recommend it be targeted at scenario A only, as that appears to us the most likely dividend stripping scenario. Inland Revenue Department KPMG submission - Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution discussion documen t 28 April 2022 20532320\_1Document classification: KPMG Confidential 3 Supplementary submissions In the event the deemed dividend proposal outlined in the discussion document proceeds, we make the following supplementary submissions: The grossed up undistributed earnings of the company should not be calculated as “the higher of” the accounting retained earnings or the ICA balance dividend by the company tax rate. We understand that the proposal to use the higher of these measures is because this avoids the potential risk of under-taxation. This is not a valid justification. Using the higher of these two measures is more likely to result in over-taxation, in our view, including for some of the reasons outlined below. Accounting retained earnings (less non-taxable capital gains) is not an appropriate proxy for the grossed up un-distributed taxed earnings of the company. The accounting retained earnings (less non-taxable capital gains) is not an appropriate proxy for the following reasons: — Generally, transactions involving the sale of shares will not happen on the last day of the financial year. Therefore, the accounting retained earnings balance will not be calculated as at the date of the sale of the shares. A requirement to prepare accounts and calculate retained earnings to the time of sale would impose additional compliance costs on taxpayers. —There is often an element of subjectivity in the calculation of accounting retained earnings (for instance, when provisioning for doubtful debts or making inventory valuations). Therefore, there may be an ability to manipulate the accounting retained earnings figure as at the date of the transaction. — There will be a clear “disconnect” between accounting retained earnings and accumulated profits that have been subject to tax in some circumstances. For instance, if tax depreciation has been calculated at a higher rate than accounting depreciation in respect of an asset, the accounting retained earnings will exceed after-tax profits. There will be over (double) taxation —If there is future depreciation recovery income, the proposed rule will result in a deemed dividend without the corresponding imputation credits being available to shelter this. This would result in a double tax impost. — Companies may have retained earnings that arose when owned by a previous shareholder(s). The imputation credits relating to those past profits will have been forfeited when the shareholding changed to the current owner. Including prior period retained earnings in the deemed dividend rule would result in over-taxation to the current shareholder. The ICA balance, without adjustments, divided by the company tax rate is not an appropriate proxy for the undistributed earnings of the company In our view, using the ICA balance divided by the company tax rate is a more workable solution than basing the deemed dividend amount on accounting retained earnings. However, this is only a workable solution if adjustments to the ICA balance as at the date of the share sale are allowed. In particular: —The ICA balance as at the date of the sale of shares would not reflect the tax paid on undistributed earnings up to that point of time. Adjustments would be required for tax Inland Revenue Department KPMG submission - Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution discussion documen t 28 April 2022 20532320\_1Document classification: KPMG Confidential 4 payments and refunds of tax made after the transaction date that relate to the period up to the transaction date. — The impact of the tax pooling rules on the ICA balance (and in particular the timing of debits and credits to the ICA) needs to be considered. As noted earlier, there is a risk that shareholders will be taxed at a higher rate than if the earnings had been distributed at the time they arose. The definition of “controlling shareholders” needs to be narrowed It is proposed that the changes would apply to “controlling shareholders”, including associates and other (non-associated) shareholders that are “acting together”. Often share sale agreements will have tag-along or drag-along rights, however the existence of these clauses does not necessarily imply that shareholders are “acting together” (in a control of the company sense). Any test which requires a determination of whether the exiting shareholder is a controlling shareholder, or not, will be extremely difficult to apply in practice, unless suitably narrowed to those shareholders who have genuine control of the company (e.g. as reflected by their voting interests). Part II: ASC and ACDA tracking accounts We support the proposal to require companies to maintain a record of their ASC and net capital gains so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. Our preference is for ASC and net capital gain amounts to be determined and reported to Inland Revenue annually (similar to the current annual ICA disclosure requirement). On the basis that taxpayers would be required to take a tax position when treating a distribution as a return of capital, the statute bar should apply to the information provided. The Commissioner should only be able to dispute the calculation of ASC or net capital gains within the relevant statute bar period (unless no such disclosure has been made). We also submit that ASC should be applied on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. Part III: Personal services income attribution We do not support broadening the personal services attribution rules by removing the single buyer requirement. The proposed changes to the attribution rules criteria would significantly expand their coverage and potentially capture business activities carried on by a company where the income has not arisen primarily due to the personal services of the shareholder. It is also not clear to us why this change is needed given case law precedent (Penny and Hooper v CIR (2011)).

We represent the diverse interests of more than 170,000 members in over 100 countries and regions, including over 2,700 members in New Zealand. We make this submission on behalf of our members and in the broader public interest. The Government’s Dividend integrity and person services income attribution discussion paper (the Discussion Paper) proposes the introduction of dividend integrity and income attribution measures to limit the ability of individuals to avoid the top 39 per cent rate (or the second-highest personal income tax rate of 33 per cent) by diverting their income through entities taxed at a lower rate. We appreciate the opportunity to have spoken with Inland Revenue and Treasury on 8 April to better understand the Government’s intention behind the proposed reforms and the practical challenges for Inland Revenue in applying the existing general anti-avoidance rules (GAAR). However, we maintain our view that the proposed changes go well beyond merely targeting individuals with income (or potential income) levels at the higher tax brackets. The proposed measures impose high compliance costs with significant tax consequences for non- adherence and introduce tax distortions into the economic decision-making of corporate business entities. We do not support the proposed tax rules due to their complexity and widespread impact, in particular: •The high likelihood that capital gains will be inadvertently subject to tax where taxpayers do not have satisfactory evidence of retained earnings leading to over-taxation •The imposition of significant advisory and compliance costs on all small business owners while ostensibly seeking to target only a small group of higher wealth individuals with associated entities. •The proposed calculations to determine the amount of the deemed dividend are extremely complex and we anticipate there will be a number of issues identified when the rules are put into practice •The potential challenges for businesses and their tax agents, particularly those who are not qualified accountants, to apply the new rules correctly with significant tax costs if not set up, maintained and enforced properly •The broad proposed scope with a lack of de minimis thresholds or simplified rules •The limited digital capability of many New Zealand small businesses, thereby creating barriers to accessing the potential benefits of accounting software-driven efficiencies and improved record keeping upon which the proposals depend for effective implementation PUB-014 • The repurposing of the personal services income (PSI) rules to apply across the gamut of small commercial services businesses, depriving the businesses of profit and the opportunity to retain earnings for business growth • The continuous limited efforts by Inland Revenue to utilise the GAAR, alternative intervention actions and administrative guidance to influence taxpayer behaviour before seeking significant, complex and disruptive changes to the tax system. More generally, the Discussion Paper refers to the tensions created in New Zealand due to the absence of a general tax on capital gains. As the Government’s proposals increasingly seek to address tax arbitrage by introducing complex and piecemeal measures that distort economic decision making and reduce productivity, we believe that a capital gains tax may be preferable to the current approach. We also observe that the much-lauded Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) is being truncated and condensed to the detriment of New Zealanders. The GTPP epitomises the strength of the tax policy due diligence process in New Zealand and its value lies in the consultative and deliberative manner in which policy is developed to maximise effectiveness and minimise unintended consequences. For such significant proposals, we are concerned that the limited opportunity to consider and test the changes will result in overly complex, very costly and distortionary changes being introduced with limited long-term benefit to the revenue. Our responses to the questions for submitters in the Discussion Paper are contained in the Attachment.

While framed in the context of addressing tax avoidance by higher-income individuals, the deemed dividend proposal generally seeks to more clearly separate capital gains from retained earnings, to ensure that income tax is paid on the latter while maintaining the tax-free status of the former. Currently, the GAAR are available to address dividend stripping cases. From the perspective of tax system design and ease of tax administration for Inland Revenue, we recognise the rationale behind the proposal to ensure that the full tax base is properly captured. However, we believe that the proposed approach will be costly and unfair in practice. The proposed mechanics of the deemed dividend rules are exceptionally complicated in their current form. Feedback from our members suggests that the quality, or even existence, of the documentation required to properly establish and maintain records of retained earnings using accounting concepts, imputation credit account (ICA), available subscribed capital (ASC) and/or available capital distribution amounts (ACDA) will be highly variable, particularly for smaller businesses. The Discussion Paper acknowledges these issues in Chapter 4 and the Government should be mindful of the reality of current business practices and the likely prospect of incorrect taxation due to complexity and the lack of historical records. The scope of the proposed rule is also very broad, capturing small businesses in existence for decades and requiring detailed accounting records to ensure capital gains are properly quarantined. It is likely that capital gains will be inadvertently subject to tax where taxpayers do not have satisfactory evidence of retained earnings, leading to over-taxation. Should the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule cover all of scenarios A, B, or C, or only one or two of these scenarios? We support the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule being limited to scenario A. The Discussion Paper is focused on the risks arising from transactions between associated entities, so the tax measures should target this particular issue rather than seek to capture all sales of New Zealand businesses. Scenarios B and C will capture the sale of shares to unrelated companies and individuals. This will impose significant advisory and compliance costs on all small business owners while ostensibly seeking to target only a small group of higher wealth individuals with associated entities. Is limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule to sales of shares by a controlling shareholder appropriate, or do you think this is too broad or too limited? As per our response to the previous question, the limitation of the recharacterisation rule to controlling shareholders is appropriate given the nature of the issue the Government seeks to address. Is the conceptual basis for quantifying the deemed dividend (that is, undistributed income, not including untaxed capital gains) appropriate? While the conceptual basis of the proposal may appear simple, the proposed calculations to determine the amount of the deemed dividend are extremely complex. The intention to couple these rules with further complexity by requiring adjustment and monitoring of the ICA and ASC is impractical and inefficient. There will inevitably be increased compliance costs, in particular for smaller businesses. 4 Whether by design or by default, the current tax proposal will impact a very large group of economically important taxpayers (i.e., small businesses) with limited evidence that they all need to be subject to such complicated tax measures. We note that in prior years, tax administration policy was committed to simplification for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This proposal stands in contrast to this philosophy by introducing concepts and approaches that introduce complexity and cost. Given the breadth of affected taxpayers, we suggest that the Inland Revenue first undertake and publish a regulatory impact analysis that also considers existing and alternative options such as the enhanced enforcement of the GAAR and the more active use of Revenue Alerts. This should include estimates of the revenue at risk, the revenue impact of the proposed changes, the affected population and the potential revenue gain from over-taxation due to the deeming rules taxing all but the most evidenced and contemporaneously reported capital gain amounts. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested dividend quantification approaches (grossed-up ICA, retained earnings, or a combination of the two), and which of these approaches do you prefer? Is there an alternative approach you would suggest? From an accounting perspective, there may be some advantage from improved record-keeping for liquidators in determining the equity component/share capital of a business. However, most businesses never find themselves in a situation of insolvency, thereby reducing the potential benefit of imposing such requirements on all corporate entities. The primary disadvantage of the suggested dividend quantification approaches is the complexity of the calculations. Many SMEs have been trading for years and finding historical financial accounts and information can be difficult. As their accounts are generally not required to be audited, accounts and records for SMEs may not be maintained with the same rigour and detail as larger companies. Furthermore, small businesses are quite mobile with their choice of advisor, meaning changes in tax agents/advisors can create challenges in the continuity of documentation. Poor historical accounting practices can result in small businesses paying more tax than they correctly should when: • the taxpayer can’t prove their ASC/ACDA – the default result is that all of the proceeds are treated as retained earnings, deemed a dividend and taxed, or • accounts can only be partially reconstructed – the balance of the proceeds that can’t be shown to be capital gains are treated as retained earnings, deemed a dividend and taxed, even when in actuality that portion should have been recognised as capital gains. As an example, in Australia a temporary loss carry back offset was introduced which required taxpayers to ascertain their franking account balances in order to claim the amount. Our members in Australia reported that there were significant challenges for small businesses and their tax agents to review these accounts to properly ascertain the correct franking account balance, and the ATO undertook significant work to prepare guidance, online tools, forms and education materials to assist advisors and businesses to properly apply the rules. This experience highlighted the need for the tax administration to invest in and properly manage the implementation of a significant and complex change. It also evidenced the challenges for small businesses to be able to comply, especially when there had been limited prior awareness of the need to accurately and contemporaneously maintain such records. Given the complexity and substantial tax consequences of an inability to properly ascertain the grossed-up ICA or retained earnings, the need for education and support from the Inland Revenue is even more critical. 5 Do you agree with the proposed approach (outlined in Example 3) for calculating dividends and ASC adjustments for corporate groups? The challenge in evaluating the proposed approach is that specific issues with the calculation are usually identified during implementation, rather than in the design phase. Due to the range of potential permutations and combinations of the more simplistic examples provided in the Discussion Paper, it is highly likely that conceptual and practical problems will be encountered as the rules take effect. We recommend that Inland Revenue continue to engage with advisors and businesses to remedy any deficiencies arising during implementation in a timely manner. We also hold concerns that some tax agents, particularly those who are not professional accountants, may require substantial support from Inland Revenue to ensure that they are correctly applying the rules. Even further support would be needed for businesses that seek to manage their taxes themselves. We recommend that simplified approaches and de minimus thresholds be considered to better confine the impact to targeted taxpayers and reduce the impact on small business. Is the approach outlined in Example 4 for a sale of one controlled company to another (existing) controlled company (potentially generating a deemed dividend from both companies) correct conceptually? As per our response to the previous question. Ch a p t e r 5 – AS C a n d AC DA t r a c k in g a c c o u n t s – P o l ic y o p t i o ns Whether the proposed transitional rule is appropriate? We agree that the transitional issue identified in the Discussion Paper, in relation to a lack of contemporaneous accounts and the difficulty in retrospectively calculating ASC and ACDAs, cannot be underestimated. As is acknowledged, some businesses may never be able to properly establish their exact ASC and ACDA and, depending on the scope of the rule, may ultimately be taxed on capital gains. We seek that Inland Revenue takes a practical and reasonable approach when reviewing transactions in the coming years, and some form of assurance from the Commissioner about their compliance approach would help advisors and businesses to adapt. In terms of transactions occurring after the law is enacted, the proposal appears to assume that businesses and their advisors will properly understand their obligations and establish the relevant accounts and records from that date. We expect that a period of at least 12 months will be needed to: • prepare Inland Revenue guidance, support products and education sessions for advisors and businesses • refresh or build advisors’ expertise and proficiency in this area • establish proper record-keeping processes in businesses and closely held groups • update software products to include and promote this functionality. Therefore, we recommend that Inland Revenue be provided with the discretion to adopt a tailored approach to implementation, recognising the high compliance burden and tax costs associated with these changes. We also consider digital service providers (DSPs) to be critical to the implementation of the proposed changes, as they will support the transition and help maintain the integrity of records into the future. However, the information entered into the software needs to be correct, and there is considerable cost associated with the collation and maintenance of this data and associated records. To reduce the overall cost of the proposal, we suggest that the Government consider introducing a de minimis threshold or simplified rules for small businesses. Whether the Commissioner should be able to reopen a return and on what basis? We do not support annual reporting to Inland Revenue, but if progressed, we do not agree with an unlimited period of review being made available to the Commissioner. 6 Given that the ASC and ACDAs become relevant only upon sale/liquidation of the company and there is a taxpayer incentive to maintain accurate records due to the high tax cost of failing to do so, the case for mandatory reporting and providing the Commissioner with an associated unlimited period of review (i.e., Option 1) is unclear. Where the concern is that the Commissioner will be forced to accept reported ASC and ACDA amounts after the period of review has elapsed, Option 2 provides a more pragmatic solution where the onus is on the taxpayer to maintain records and Inland Revenue is able to consider these as part of the review of the sale transaction. This second approach is similar to that taken for capital gains tax (CGT) in Australia where historical records are required to substantiate the cost base of CGT assets. Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity? As indicated in our previous responses, we do not believe the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity. There is limited data in the Discussion Paper to assess the potential impacts, however, we expect that all businesses will experience increased compliance costs and, of greater concern, there is the real likelihood of improper taxation of capital gains due to weaknesses in many businesses’ record-keeping processes. We believe that these costs will outweigh the expected benefit – given that paragraph 1.11 of the Discussion Paper suggests that the Government’s concerns are centred on the behaviour of 350 high wealth individuals, but the proposed changes will potentially affect hundreds of thousands of New Zealand businesses and their owners. At a practical level, businesses who do not use an agent are unlikely to be able to apply the rules properly and we reiterate the importance of ensuring that tax agents and advisors are properly qualified and competent to perform these services given the potential tax costs if done incorrectly. The proposal that a company will be deemed to have their ASC and ACDA to be zero if not reported to Inland Revenue on a timely basis is also extremely punitive and highly disproportionate to the risk sought to be addressed by the Government. In the future, accounting software will likely reduce the costs and inefficiencies as records are maintained contemporaneously and can be transferred between different tax agents and different software products. However, CPA Australia’s Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey consistently finds that the current digital capability of New Zealand businesses lags behind the rest of the Asia-Pacific (with the exception of Australia) and that there is limited appetite for investment in technology, particularly for compliance obligations rather than business growth. The Government should therefore be mindful of the current capacity of New Zealand businesses to absorb greater compliance costs, particularly as they emerge from the events of the past two years. It is important to understand that many businesses are not currently in a position to transform their accounting systems or establish and maintain detailed records for far-off events. Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns? As per our earlier response, we do not support a requirement to report annually to Inland Revenue. The proposed design creates a very strong incentive for the taxpayer to keep contemporaneous records, because if they are unable to do so, the entire sale proceeds including unsubstantiated capital gains will be subject to tax. Ch a p t e r 7 –Pe r s on a l s e r v ic e s i n c o m e att r ib u t io n – Pr o p o s a l Fundamentally, we do not support the repurposing of the PSI rules to dictate the commercial decisions of New Zealand services businesses. The PSI attribution rule was intended to prevent the recharacterisation of what is, essentially, employment income. Corporate structures are chosen for a wide variety of non-tax related reasons, and we are concerned that the proposed changes will significantly diminish the economic choices and growth prospects of many businesses. There are a multitude of reasons why companies retain their earnings, including setting aside capital for future growth and investment, to fund business acquisitions, to hire staff or to take risks. 7 In Australia, the PSI rules are specifically designed to carve out personal services businesses (PSBs) from the PSI regime in recognition of their different economic nature. Anti-avoidance provisions remain available to the ATO to address any mischief in relation to PSBs. The New Zealand proposal stands in stark contrast to the Australian design by seeking to actively capture businesses under the PSI regime and to remove the safeguards that protect businesses from tax rules restricting their economic choices. In combination, the proposed changes to the PSI test suggest that the majority of small personal services businesses will be required to attribute income to the working person, without regard to the clear economic benefits of corporate structures. Net income will be taxed through the working person at individual tax rates, leaving nothing available to the business to improve the balance sheet. For start-ups and new businesses in particular, this can significantly impede access to capital, introduce cash flow difficulties and reduce growth prospects. It is also costly, inefficient and contrary to the purpose of corporate entities to expect balance sheets to be supported by injected capital funded from post-tax income of the individual. Such policies begin to significantly distort the functionality of a company, with tax rules effectively removing the prospect of business profit and eliminating the economic benefits of retained earnings. In our view, the Government should be supporting small business growth and encouraging entrepreneurship rather than demanding businesses retain no earnings so that income can be taxed at higher rates. While this may provide a short-term boost to government revenues, in the long run it will impede business growth and entrepreneurship in New Zealand. If the Government is seeking to ensure that working persons report an appropriate level of income for the provision of their personal services to an associated entity (i.e., remuneration for their labour), then consideration should instead be given to alternatives such as the introduction of a domestic transfer pricing regime 1 . The administrative approach taken by the ATO in Australia has been to issue PCG 2021/4 Allocation of professional firm profits - ATO compliance approach. This Practical Compliance Guideline explains the ATO’s approach to assessing the risk that profit allocation arrangements in professional services firms trigger the Australian general anti-avoidance rules, known as Part IVA, and the likelihood of a review. We believe that the decision in Penny and Hooper v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 95 provides Inland Revenue with the basis to manage the risks described in the Discussion Paper, including the use of market rates, by applying the existing GAAR, rather than expanding the PSI regime to all personal services businesses. We also note that should the deemed dividend proposal be progressed, the PSI proposal becomes unnecessary as any retained earnings not otherwise distributed will be taxed in the hands of the controlling shareholder/working person at individual tax rates upon sale of the business. Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? The removal of this test will expose a significant number of personal services businesses to the PSI regime. The Discussion Paper does not provide data on the number of potentially affected businesses, nor the expected increase in government revenue. The Government is proposing that any business – regardless of whether they have one, or one hundred, buyers – will fall under the PSI rules, disregarding the fact that the buyer test can be seen as a proxy for the level of commerciality. A higher number of buyers indicates the business is more likely to carry higher levels of commercial and legal liability risks or hold more valuable business assets, such as client lists or long-term contracts for example. We are not sufficiently convinced of the economic and policy basis for the proposal, except to divert income from the company to the working person with the result that commercial businesses will be treated as if they hold no 1 That is, entities would be required to remunerate working persons at market wages to ensure that transactions between related parties remain at arm’s length and removing the ability to shield income earned through the provision of labour. 8 economic value except for the services provided by the working person, merely so that a higher tax rate can be applied. This conceptual approach does not acknowledge the risks borne by the corporate entity, nor the life cycle stage of the business and presumes that such a structure provides no commercial or economic purpose or benefit. We do not believe that this is the correct economic characterisation of such businesses, and consequently do not agree with the proposed change. Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? This proposed change further expands the captured taxpayer population to include the many small businesses with a part-time staff. Again, this test can be viewed as a proxy for the intensity of labour provided by the working person. A lower percentage indicates that business income is less likely to be solely generated by the working person, and therefore should not be attributed as employment-type income. A reduction in the threshold to 50 per cent again disregards the economic value generated by other natural persons participating in the business and significantly constrains the ability of the business to increase its value. We therefore do not agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold from 80 percent to 50 percent. Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? Further to our earlier comments on arm’s length remuneration, if the issue is the use of corporate structures to reduce an individual’s tax liabilities and the proposed changes to the one buyer and natural person supplier tests broaden the application of the PSI rules to virtually all personal services businesses, we question why businesses with a higher asset intensity should be entirely exempt. In the interests of equity, we suggest that any policy changes affecting remuneration or income attribution apply to all individuals who provide their labour to a related entity, regardless of their level of assets. This ensures that all individuals operating their business through such a structure are treated equitably under the tax laws and that certain taxpayers are not discriminated against simply because of the industry in which they operate. Which of options one and two do you consider to be preferable? Is there another option that you think would be better than either of the thresholds suggested in this chapter? Per our previous answer, we question whether the proposed changes to the PSI rules are an appropriate policy response. Therefore, we do not have a view on the substantial business assets test threshold. Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000? While we do not agree with the proposed changes to the PSI rules, if progressed, an increase in the net income threshold will presumably carve out a large number of taxpayers from the regime. However, predicting annual net income for many businesses can be difficult, so it is likely that many businesses will still have to consider the PSI rules throughout the year due to such uncertainty.

PO Box 956, Queenstown, New Zealand, Tel: +64 3 450 1900 29 April 2022 Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution c/o Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON 6140 Dear Sir/Madam Dividend Integrity and Personal Service Income Attribution Trojan Holdings Limited (“Trojan”) is writing to submit on the Government Discussion Document “Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution” (the “Discussion Document”). The Trojan Group is a significant South Island base group of companies with interests in transport, tourism, commercial property, technology and other service businesses. These interests are held both wholly within the Trojan Group or as joint venture investments, often as a source of capital to encourage growth in the Queenstown Lakes area. Trojan is a responsible corporate citizen who takes its tax obligations seriously. The group is a significant employer in the Otago region and pays significant taxes across the group. Trojan is submitting because it is concerned about the dividend integrity measures proposed in the Discussion Document including the overreach beyond their stated objective. Trojan’s submission is focussed on the proposals in Part 1 of the Discussion Document. We note the following concerns with the proposals: •The proposals in Part 1 of the Discussion Document are intended to address dividend stripping where “a shareholder of a company avoids receiving a taxable dividend by selling their shares for a non-taxable capital sum, often without a change in the economic ownership of the acquired company”. Trojan submits that the proposed changes are unnecessary in order to combat dividend stripping as there is already specific legislation in place to counter this. Trojan considers that the issue could therefore be addressed through enforcement of the existing provisions together with any necessary refinements to address obvious deficiencies in the existing provisions. This could be combined with extending the existing guidance (which is very comprehensive and clear) to provide Inland Revenue’s views on any new areas of concern. Well advised and responsible taxpayers such as Trojan will always seek to comply with the existing rules and would therefore welcome increased enforcement and expanded guidance to assist with compliance rather than suffer unintended consequences and increased compliance costs resulting from the current proposals. If legislative change is considered necessary, then Trojan submits that this should be more targeted anti-avoidance provisions to cover only the perceived mischief. The current proposal would apply extremely widely and catch a significant number of transactions where there is no tax-avoidance motive and are therefore a clear example of overreach. PUB-016 PO Box 956, Queenstown, New Zealand, Tel: +64 3 450 1900 • The proposals as currently drafted do not include any exclusions on transfers of shares on the death of a business owner. As a result, the transfer of a business to surviving family members could result in a potentially significant tax liability thus giving rise to an effective death duty/inheritance tax. Similarly, such an effective tax on transfers of intergenerational wealth would have an impact on estate planning and deter existing business owners from transferring to the next generation with potential detrimental impacts for business growth; • There should not be a different tax outcome from selling shares compared to selling the business and then winding up the company which could be the case under the current proposals. For example, to the extent that a company had excess imputation credits, any deemed dividend on a sale of the shares would be greater than the liquidation distribution. • The proposals as currently drafted could give rise to differing outcomes for commercial joint venture partners and in particular give rise to tax liabilities on transfers between the JV partners. For example, where a business is struggling and one JV partner wants to buy out the other (e.g. as one wants to try and turn around the business but the other doesn’t). In such circumstances, the potential for different tax treatment between a share sale and a wind up could result in one of the parties deciding to wind the business up (with a resulting loss of productivity and jobs) rather than selling their share to the other. • The proposals in Part 1 appear to be based on an assumption that retained earnings arise as a result of cash being left in a business in order to avoid the owners paying a higher tax rate. The commercial reality is that retained earnings generally fund the business assets which in turns drives growth of the business. This also contributes to a strong balance sheet which enables businesses to grow, create employment opportunities and to better survive cyclical downturns and disruptive events such as the COVID pandemic. • As a general point, given the recent announcements by the Minister of Revenue we consider that there should be no new tax legislation introduced until the proposed tax principles legislation is enacted. This is necessary to ensure that any new tax legislation does not immediately contravene the tax principles to be codified in the new act. Please let us know if you have any queries in relation the points raised above. Your sincerely Neil Johnston CFO 2 May 2022 Dividend Integrity and Personal Services Income Attribution c/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Well ington 6140 Dear S ir /Madam Re: Di vidend Integrity and Personal Services Income Attribution I am writing to you regarding the discussion document entitled ‘Dividend Integrity and Personal Services Income Attribution’ (referred to as “the Discussion Document”). Specifically, the primary focus of our submission is on the following two policy areas: 1.Shareholders being taxed on the sale of shares in a company to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings; and 2.The changes to the personal services company rules that effectively remove when small businesses can use the lower company tax rate. BusinessNZ accepts that the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39% on 1 April 2021 has meant that the potential for some type of avoidance to take place is heightened. Therefore, in principle we do not have an issue with Inland Revenue investigating certain aspects of tax policy that may be affected by a higher top personal tax rate. However, in this instance, we believe that the proposals by Inland Revenue go far beyond what the business community would typically expect in terms of pragmatic and justified options to minimise avoidance measures. Instead, they represent a significant regulatory overreach that will likely create several unintended consequences that will directly harm many businesses, particularly small to medium sized enterprises. Regardi ng the two issues outlined above that are discussed in the Discussion Document, BusinessNZ, along with the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG), sent a joint letter to the Ministers of Finance, Revenue and Small Business on 28 April that specifically outlined the broad concerns of the business community, along with strongly opposing the proposed changes. The joint letter is attached to this submission. Recommendation: That Inland Revenue take into account the views expressed in the joint letter by CTG and BusinessNZ that was sent directly to Ministers.

As representatives of Business, we are doing so because we are concerned that the dividend integrity measures proposed in the Discussion Document: • are not justified by their stated objective of limiting the ability of individuals to avoid the 39% (or 33%) tax rate, since that objective can be achieved by enforcement of the existing law. Inland Revenue has in the past two decades had a high success rate before the courts in cases involving alleged avoidance of the top personal tax rate and has settled numerous cases with the benefit of those case law precedents. It is unclear why Inland Revenue now says (as justification for the Discussion Document proposals) that it lacks the resourcing to apply the same laws it has successfully enforced in the past; • will potentially apply to all business sale transactions, whereas they are more appropriately limited to internal restructuring which avoids the 33% or 39% tax rates, and even then, only if it is established that there is a compliance problem which cannot be solved with Inland Revenue’s existing legislative tools (including the existing avoidance, dividend and fringe benefit tax rules) and the audit and data analytic capabilities unlocked by its new sophisticated computer system; • would impose new costs and complexities on many businesses, the vast majority of which are not engaged in the tax avoidance practices to which the Discussion Document refers; • would result in some cases in more onerous tax consequences (and greater potential for d istortion of economic activity) than would arise under a capital gains tax (which the Government ruled out). For instance, the Discussion Document proposals would result in tax payable when a business is sold at a loss (see example 1 in the Appendix); • would (given the preceding point) cut across existing tax policy settings that were put in place to remove tax- related barriers to bringing new owners into a business (including the business continuity test that enables losses to be carried forward when a company is sold if a business continuity test is met) and to enabling New Zealand businesses to compete internationally; • will result in a number of other unfair outcomes, as illustrated by the examples in the Appendix. CTG and Business New Zealand – Joint letter on dividend integrity proposals We are also concerned that the proposed changes to the personal services income attribution rules will take the existing rules far beyond the “quasi-employment situations” which were originally contemplated when the rules were enacted in 2000. Instead, any labour-intensive small business with multiple customers, such as tradespeople, or (for example) a one or two-person hairdresser or beautician business, could be caught by the proposals. The proposals could especially disadvantage such businesses while in their start-up phase, during which most of the income comes from the work of the founder and the business may not (yet) have substantial business assets. The founder may wish to retain profits in the company in order to acquire more equipment and take on more staff, but would be taxed at the 33% or 39% rate on profits they retain, while their larger competitors will be taxed at 28% on profits they retain. The proposals would, therefore, tilt the playing field against small labour-intensive start-ups. Conclusion Our respective bodies are concerned that the proposals in the discussion document represent a significant overreach and will apply far wider than transactions which have been deliberately entered into in order to avoid the 39% tax rate. If it is determined that the proposed measures are needed at all, they should be significantly scaled back to ensure they are targeting only the mischief in question, and only once it is established that there is a compliance problem which cannot be solved with Inland Revenue’s existing legislative tools and its sophisticated computer system. Yours sincerely John Payne For the Corporate Taxpayers Group For Business New Zealand We note the views in this document are a reflection of the views of the two business groups and do not necessarily reflect the views of individual members. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) 3 APPENDIX Proposals would impose new costs and complexities on businesses Part I of the Discussion Document proposals would recharacterise the proceeds of sale by a controlling shareholder of shares in a company, by deeming part of the proceeds of sale to be a dividend. The proposals would affect the owners of the thousands of SMEs across the country who may wish to sell any level of shareholding in their business. It is the view of our organisations that in many instances the outcomes under these proposals are equal to, or worse than, the outcomes under a comprehensive capital gains tax. Below are some examples to illustrate the potential impact of the proposals: 1. A small business owned by a single shareholder had a cost base of $300,000. The business had been successful prior to the pandemic, and the company has retained earnings of $150,000. The pandemic has adversely affected the business’s future prospects and t he owner, who has reached retirement age, sells the shareholding for $200,000. The owner, therefore, sells at a loss of $100,000, but (under the proposals) would have income for tax purposes of $150,000. 2. A profitable business which reinvests its profits into growing the business by expanding or purchasing new assets will be deemed to provide a dividend to a majority shareholder in the event that any shares are sold; this is regardless of the fact that profits were reinvested/spent by the business. 3. Different owners have different o utcomes based on blood relationships and when they exit the business: a. Company F is equally owned by Shareholders X, Y, and Z. The shareholders are all siblings. Shareholder Z wishes to sell their share of Company F and Shareholders X and Y agreed to purchase t he shares to re sult in them owning 50% of the shares each. Shareholder Z is deemed to receive a dividend equal to 1/3rd of the retained earnings in Company F because Shareholder Z is deemed to be a controlling shareholder due to being a sibling to the other shareholders. b. Company G is equally owned by Shareholders U, V, and W. The shareholders are all friends. Shareholder W wishes to sell their share of Company G and Shareholders U and V agreed to purchase the shares to result in them owning 50% of the s hares each. Shareholder W has no tax consequences of selling the shares. c. Company G is equally owned by Shareholders U and V. Shareholder V sells their shares to Shareholder U. Shareholder V has no tax consequences of selling the shares. d. Company G is owned by Shareholder U. Historically Company G also had 2 other shareholders (V and W). Shareholder U decides to sell Company G to an unrelated party. Shareholder U is deemed to receive a dividend of the full balance of retained earnings in Company G. 4. Company I is a start-up company owned by Shareholders R and S. Company I has invested heavily in research and development. Company I has benefited from the R&D Tax Incentive, receiving $1m (and consequently $1m of imputation credits). While Company I has not yet reached break-even point or become profitable, its future prospects are positive; as such Shareholders R and S wish to sell the business to pursue a new innovative idea. Shareholders R and S are deemed to receive a dividend of up to $3.57 million ($1 million ICA balance divided by the company tax rate) when they sell Company I to its new owners. The above examples demonstrate the clear over-reach of the rules and the potential for inappropriate results based on slightly different fact patterns; we can provide more examples if required. Observations on the dividend integrity discussion document April 2022Jim Gordon, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd 2 • Introduction to the discussion document• Contents • ASC and capital profits• The modified attribution rule• Dividend integrity • The objective• The proposal• Who is affected• A transaction tax• Examples of over-taxation• Examples of operational issues Topics 3 • In March 2022 Government released a Ministers’ discussion document titled “ Dividend integrity and personal services attribution” (the DD). • Submissions close towards the end of April – the standard 6 weeks.• At least the dividend integrity part of this is intended to be in a tax bill to be introduced in August, with the objective of enacting it in early 2023. • There is a very short period of time for officials to analyse submissions and draft legislation. Introduction 4 The stated objective of the DD is to limit “the ability of individuals to avoid the top 39% \[marginal tax\] rate (or the second-highest personal income tax rate of 33%) by diverting their income through entities taxed at a lower rate”. This is an understandable objective.Further, it arguably points to codification of existing law to discourage certain forms of avoidance – perhaps a la the MMS legislation. The DD – the objective 5 • In certain circumstances amou nts can be distributed by a company tax free – ASC on a qualifying distribution and both ASC and ACDA on a liquidation. • Officials are understandably proposing that ASC and ACDA amounts be confirmed annually by companies with the historical stuff included if possible. • I agree with this. The issue is how to operationalise it – I don’t further discuss this. Available subscribed capital (ASC) and available capital distribution amount (capital profits or ACDA) 6 • This is an attempt to codify Penny and Hooper so that income from personal services is attributed to the individual who performed the services. • The targeting is unclear – does it apply to the plumber who employs an apprentice? If so, do they know the need to make submissions? The modified attribution rule 7 • The DD misrepresents Penny and Hooper . The case is not about inadequate salaries – it is about the alienation of personal services income while still spending the income . • A surgeon who operates through a company and draws no salary may not be committing tax avoidance? • A surgeon who receives 75% of the net profit of their operating company with the other 25% being left in the company not be committing tax avoidance? In both cases further enquiry is needed. Penny and Hooper 8 The stated objective of the DD is to limit “the ability of individuals to avoid the top 39% \[marginal tax\] rate (or the second-highest personal income tax rate of 33%) by diverting their income through entities taxed at a lower rate”. • The dividend integrity proposal goes far further than this and will grossly over-tax a number of shareholders who are neither avoiding tax nor diverting income • Further, the DD has limited details of how the dividend integrity proposal will be operationalise d and there will be problems here Dividend integrity – the objective 9 • When a shareholder (with or wit hout associated persons) controls a company and sells shares t hey (the shareholder) have a potential tax obligation. • The tax obligation is based on the higher of: • The vendor’s share of retained earnings (R E), grossed up for the ICA balance (e.g. $72 + $28 = $100) • The vendor’s share of the ICA balance grossed up to get to the pre-tax income (e.g. $28 / .28 = $100) Dividend integrity – the proposal 10 The main group affected will be family owned companies, the vast majority of which will be SMEs• SME family owned companies couldn’t have been more specifically targeted if someone se t out to do it deliberately, but I accept that this wasn’t deliberate Dividend integrity – who is affected 11 The dividend integrity proposal is a transaction tax• Thus it will interfere with ever yday ordinary transactions and cause economic distortions • It is interesting that the DD doesn’t acknowledge this Dividend integrity – a transaction tax 12 • The following examples presume that 100% of the company is sold. The over-taxation exampl es are first, followed by the operational examples • They will all occur in practice• “RAP” is revenue account property Dividend integrity – the examples 13 1. A capital gains tax2. An arbitrary and capricious tax3. Taxation of revaluation reserves from RAP4. Capital losses5. Taxation of no gain – 2 separate examplesDividend integrity over-taxation examples 14 Core example 31/3/2021 Share capital – ASC $1,000 Retained earnings $800 Shareholder’s funds $1,800 On its creation the company had capital or $1,000 and a bank loan of $800. For the loan to be repaid the company must sell assets, retain earnings or obtain further loans or capital. In this case, as is common, it retained earnings to repay the bank loan.At no stage has the shareholder ov erdrawn their current account. Given that there is no avoidance or income diversion the sale of the shares for $1,800 should not, from a tax policy perspective, cause any ta x to be paid by the shareholder, unless it is intended to tax capital gains. Under the dividend integrity proposal t he shareholder is taxed on $800 (plus any ICs). Example 1 – a capital gains tax 15 Core 1 2 3 Share capital – ASC $1,000 $1,000 $1,000 $1,000 Retained earnings $800 $800 $800 $800 Shareholder’s funds $1,800 $1,800 $1,800 $1,800 Sold for $1,800 $2,500 $900 $700 Shareholder’s taxable income (plus any ICs) $800 $800 $800 $700 Results from scenarios 2 & 3 are cl early arbitrary and capricious Example 2 – an arbitrary and capricious tax 16 31/3/2021 Share capital – ASC $1,000 Retained earnings $720 Shareholder’s funds $1,720 The retained earnings come from a revaluation of RAP. Thus no tax is current ly payable by the company, but future tax has been provided for. This results in double taxation. The company has $280 to pay when the RAP is realised and the shar eholder has to pay tax now on t he $720 at their marginal rate. Why should the shareholder’s tax depend on whether a re valuation of RAP is done? This is especially given that there is no requirement for assets to be at valuation? Contrary to what is implied in the DD IFRS/GAAP is not used or required to be used by say 95% of New Zealand’s companies and probably by 99%+ of NZs SMEs companies. Thes e companies can chose to value RA P at tax book value, cost or market. Example 3 – revaluation reserves 17 31/3/2021 Share capital – ASC $1,000 Retained earnings $720 Capital losses (realised or unrealised) -$800 Shareholder’s funds $920 If the shareholder sells the company for $920 they have made an actual loss of $80 ($1,000 in, $920 out), However, the shareholder’s deemed dividend income is $720 grossed up for any ICA credits. If the company was liquidated there would be no dividend. This results in taxation where the shareholder has made no gain. Example 4 – capital losses 18 31/3/2015 & 2021 Share capital – ASC $1,000 Retained earnings $800 Shareholder’s funds $1,800 On its creation the company had capital or $1,000 and a bank loan of $800. For the loan to be repaid the company must sell assets, retain earnings or obtain further loans or capital. In this case, as is common, it retained earnings to repay the bank loan.The present vendor shareholder purchased the company on 1/4/2015 for $1,800 and sold it on 1/4/2021 for $1,800. The retained earnings are all from pre- acquisition profits. At no stage have any of the shareholders overdrawn their current accounts.Given that there is no avoidance or income streami ng the sale of the shares should not, from a policy perspective, cause any tax to be pai d by the vendor shareholder. Furt her, the present vendor shareholder has made no untaxed gains over the period they owned the company. Example 5 – taxation of no gain – 1 19 31/3/2021 Share capital – ASC $1,000 Retained earnings $NIL Shareholder’s funds $1,000 On its creation the company had capital or $1,000 and m ade widgets using a novel method. In its first 5 years it made real income and paid the sharehol der a good salary and retained after tax income. At no stage was there an overdraw n shareholder current account. The market caught up and for the next 5 years the company made losses that reversed its retained income.The company is now sold for the amount the shareholder originally put in as capital - $1,000. Why should the shareholder be deemed to have received a divi dend based on the grossed up ICA balance which was created when the company made its profits? The result is over-taxation. Example 5 – taxation of no gain – 2 20 5. When the shares are sold mid-y ear how is the retained earnings measured? 6. How does the vendor get knowledge of R E and ICs after they have sold? 7. How and when is the ICA balance measured? Dividend integrity operationalisation issues 21 31/3/2021 31/3/2022 Share capital – ASC $1,000 $1,000 Retained earnings $800 $8,000 Shareholder’s funds $1,800 $9,000 Shares are sold mid-year – which retained earnings balance is used? What if the purchaser has changed the modus operandi of the company after he or she acquired the com pany which caused the pattern of retained earnings to change significantly? Example 5 – how is the retained income measured? 22 31/3/2021 Share capital – ASC $1,000 Retained earnings $800 Shareholder’s funds $1,800 Shares are sold 31/3/2021 or 1/4/2021 – how does the vendor find out what the retained earnings and the ICA are as they will have no access the company’s books? The company accounts may not be done for another 12 or even 24 months! Example 6 – vendor knowledge of R E and ICA? 23 31/3/2021 Share capital – ASC $1,000 Retained earnings $720 Shareholder’s funds $1,720 Shares are sold 31/3/2021 or 1/4/2021 – but the tax on the income is only paid on P3 (after 1/4/2021). This results in double taxation. The company has $280 to pay and the shareholder has to pay tax on the $720 at their marginal rate. Example 7 – how & when is the ICA balance measured? Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 29 April 2022 PwC 2 II. Submissions We submit on the following areas: Dividend avoidance and share shares 1.1. Avoidance measure (para 3.1) Proposal The Government is proposing to deem a “dividend” to arise where there is a sale of shares by a “controlling shareholder” to the extent that the company and its subsidiaries have undistributed retained earnings (excluding any non-taxable capital gains). The proposed deemed dividend amount on the sale of shares would be the higher of: the amount of retained earnings less non-taxable capital gains plus ICA balance; or the ICA balance divided by the company tax rate. Comment The Discussion Document intends to “\[limit\] the ability of individuals to avoid the top 39% rate...by diverting their income through entities taxed at a lower rate”. We submit the proposal to deem a dividend to arise will not achieve this stated intention because it will impact taxpayers who are neither (1) avoiding tax nor (2) diverting income. By way of example, the tax obligation for an individual under the proposed rules with $72 of retained earnings and $28 of imputation credits would be the higher of: The individual’s share of retained earnings plus the ICA balance (e.g. $72 + $28 = $100; or The individual’s share of the ICA balance divided by the company tax rate (e.g. $28 / 28% - $100). There is no requirement, in either of the above scenarios, that the taxpayer should be avoiding or diverting income for the proposal to apply. While we appreciate that conceptually, the $72 of retained earnings may be viewed as business profits of the company and therefore can be argued as not being a “capital” amount, the reality is that retained earnings does not necessarily equate to the true economic position of the company - e.g where the amount has been reinvested into the business. It is not unreasonable to see this proposal as a limited form of capital gains tax in the absence of any avoidance concerns. In our view, what is being proposed goes beyond an avoidance or integrity measure. Instead, it is a fundamental shift of New Zealand’s tax system in that it looks to disregard the separate legal identity of companies and move towards full integration. In our view, Inland Revenue has the power to invoke section BG 1 of the Act where there is a tax avoidance arrangement (such as the case with example 1 in the Discussion Document). Submission That the proposals do not proceed and that the intended outcomes should be achieved by Inland Revenue’s application of section BG 1. Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 29 April 2022 PwC 3 1.2. Limitation to controlling shareholders will cause inequitable outcomes (para 3.22) Proposal The Discussion Document states that the proposal to deem a dividend for retained earnings should be limited in application to a “controlling shareholder”, being one that, together with its associates and other shareholders acting together, holds more than 50% of the shares. Comment The principle of horizontal equity is a key pillar of the New Zealand tax system (recently affirmed by the 2019 Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Final Report). It is described as the principle that people who are in the same position should pay the same amount of tax. One fundamental concern we have with the proposal is the lack of horizontal equity. This would manifest itself in two ways, between (1) “controlling shareholders” versus portfolio shareholders and listed companies and (2) controlling shareholders with different degrees of sophistication. As to (1), the rationale is that it is the “controlling shareholders” who will have the ability to control whether a dividend is paid by the company or not. However, this does not alter the fact that a minority or portfolio shareholder would still benefit from the share sale if there is in fact an amount of the disposal price that represents undistributed business profits. In this case, two taxpayers in the same economic position are subject to different tax outcomes. As to (2), we are concerned that the proposals would unduly affect small and medium sized businesses. While the proposals expressly apply to business of all sizes, in practice, smaller businesses will be affected more given the nature of the accounting treatment adopted by these businesses (which would impact the calculation of retained earnings) as well as the need for these businesses to reinvest funds into the business to grow (vs. having dividend paying policies which larger scale businesses may have). Sophisticated taxpayers are usually able to better navigate tax complexity and will likely find ways to release value from the business in a way which is not caught by the proposed deemed dividend rules. Submission That, if the Government proceeds with the proposal, further consideration should be given to how the proposal can be more horizontally equitable. 1.3. Deemed dividend limited to RE but does not extend to goodwill etc (paras 3.30) Proposal The proposal to deem a dividend in respect of retained earnings would not apply to the capital receipt of goodwill created upon the sale of a company. Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 29 April 2022 PwC 4 Comment The retained earnings of a company does not represent the cash balance or economic income earned - it is an accounting concept. We submit that retained earnings is an inappropriate tax base for income tax as it does not necessarily reflect the true business profit which would be received by the shareholder. An example of where the usefulness of retained earnings as a basis for tax is eroded include where the company has external funding and no capital gain. To illustrate: Suppose a $1.5m commercial property was acquired in a company which is funded by: $1m of share capital (ASC) $0.5m bank loan Opening balance sheet: Assets Liabilities / Equity Property $1.5m Bank loan $0.5m Share capital $1.0m Over the life of the company, the value of the property remains flat and the profits from rental activity are used to repay the bank loan. Closing balance sheet: Assets Liabilities / Equity Property $1.5m Retained earnings $0.5m Share capital $1.0m In this case, the taxpayer will be subject to tax on the $500k of retained earnings, even though there has been no overall increase in the value of the property, the taxpayer has not entered an avoidance arrangement, and no income has been diverted. This is caused by the use of external funding which has been repaid with retained earnings. Another example of where the usefulness of retained earnings as a basis for tax is eroded is where a company has capital losses. This would be the case if the balance sheet were as follows: Available subscribed capital $1,000 Retained earnings $720 Capital losses ($500) Equity $1,220 In this case, the taxpayer would be incentivised to liquidate the business rather than sell it, as the tax on retained earnings of $720 would be higher than the tax on the dividend on liquidation of $220 (subject to the ICA balance). Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 29 April 2022 PwC 5 This illustrates why we consider the distinction between realised retained earnings and capitalised future earnings (i.e. goodwill) is unsupportable from an economic efficiency perspective. The proposals would penalise companies with more traditional earning patterns (which use retained earnings to fund growth) as compared to high-growth companies, which may be loss-making but valued highly due to their future earnings potential. A business investing heavily in research and development may have no profits but large unrecognised goodwill. The proposal would not impose a deeded dividend on this value. We understand that one justification for the proposal is that value received by an individual to be used for private consumption should ideally be taxed at the individual’s marginal income tax rate, but that outcome is not achieved by the use of retained earnings as the basis for tax. Similar to retained earnings, the amount of imputation credits that is held by a company may not reflect the true “undistributed” business profits. To deem a dividend to arise in these circumstances would result in overtaxation for those shareholders and arguably be imposing tax on a true capital gain. Submission That the Government does not proceed with the proposal. Further significant work is required to ensure any changes to the law does not result in unintended consequences, in particular the potential for overtaxation and that it is in fact consistent with policy intent (i.e. avoidance of the 39% tax rate). 1.4. “Acting together” (paras 3.23) Proposal The proposal would apply if the shareholder controls the company immediately before the sale, together with associates and other shareholders acting together. Comment It is common for shareholders of companies to have entered shareholder agreements. These may apply to situations where a shareholder resolution is required to sell shares, or for decisions under a management share scheme. There is a question as to whether shareholder agreements will cause all shareholders party to the agreement to be regarded as “acting together” such that minority shareholders would be treated as being a “controlling shareholder” under the proposal. Furthermore, whether this would bring in private equity type investors. We note that one of the key areas of concern noted is the ability for a “controlling shareholder” to be able to control dividend payments and that it is mostly a concern for closely-held companies. The application of an “acting together” type approach could go beyond the issue that is outlined in the Discussion Document. Submission If the proposal is to proceed, the meaning of “acting together” should be given further consideration to ensure it does not go beyond the intended scope. Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 29 April 2022 PwC 6 1.5. Operational issues (Chapter 3) Comment We note a number of operational issues which could arise if legislation were enacted based on the current proposals: The calculation of retained earnings may be subject to variability because International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is not used, nor required to be applied, by most New Zealand companies. The calculation of retained earnings may be difficult when shares are sold mid-year (rather than at year-end, when equity balances are typically calculated). For New Zealand income tax purposes, additional guidance may be required as to how to calculate this amount on top of the existing accounting rules. There is a question as to how and when is the ICA balance should be measured for the purposes of the proposal. Submission That the operational issues noted above be addressed in the event the Government proceeds with the proposal. ASC and ACDA tracking accounts 2.1. Tracking accounts Proposal Under current law, there is no explicit requirement for a company to maintain records in relation to its ASC or ACDA. At paras 5.4 to 5.10, the Discussion Document proposes two options: 1. ASC and ACDA accounts are to be maintained and reported to Inland Revenue annually. 2. ASC and ACDA accounts are to be maintained as evidence, with no requirement to report these to Inland Revenue annually. Comment We support the introduction of option 1. In our view, option 2 reflects current practice as taxpayers (and their advisors) will often carry out the ASC and ACDA calculations where they are being relied on for the purposes of sections CD 22 or CD 26. The issue with current practice is that taxpayers (and their advisors) must often rely on documentation that is either incomplete or missing (especially in relation to share issues on incorporation and historic capital gains derived). Therefore, we consider the requirement to provide the information to Inland Revenue to be preferred on the basis that this will lead to better information in the future. However, we support option 1 provided that this requirement to report these accounts to Inland Revenue is on a prospective basis only. We would also ask that any legislation address how the statute bar would affect historical filings and confirm that no penalties should be imposed for the failure to file returns. Submission That option 1 be adopted, subject to our comments above. Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 29 April 2022 PwC 7 Personal services income attribution 3.1. Proposals go beyond the parameters of “Penny & Hooper” Proposal From para 6.9 onwards, the Discussion Document refers to Penny & Hooper v Commissioner of Inland Revenue\[2011\] NZSC 95 as a reason to support the proposals to widen the “personal services” attribution rules – i.e. codifying the decision from Penny & Hooper so that Inland Revenue does not have to rely on the general anti-avoidance rule where they feel there is mischief. Comment In our view, the current proposals go beyond the parameters of Penny & Hooper. It is important to note that in that case, tax avoidance was found whereby Penny & Hooper did in fact benefit from the funds personally (i.e. available for private consumption) even though they were paid an “artificially low” salary. Under the current proposals, income that is legitimately left in the company to fund growth in working capital or investment in brand development and customer relationships will be attributed to the shareholders, even if there is no tax avoidance. That is, it would be possible to structure a business using corporate vehicles and pay oneself a market value salary and still be subject to the highest marginal tax rate on all income, rendering a company and a sole trader identical for tax purposes. Submission Should these changes be enacted, a requirement that the arrangement involves an “artificially low” salary be introduced also. 3.2. Horizontal equity concerns Comment Similar to our concerns with the share sale tax, we also have concerns of coherence and equity with these proposals as is the case with the deemed dividend proposals. In particular, we are unable to reconcile the fact that under these proposals, a services business will have a very different tax profile to one that produces and trades in goods. Under the current rules, we consider that the horizontal equity concerns are minimised due to the current “80 percent one buyer” and “80 percent one natural personal supplier” rules ensuring that the attribution rules only apply in limited circumstances where predominantly one individual is supplying services to predominantly one client. Submission The current “80 percent one buyer” and“80 percent one natural personal supplier” rules remain in place to limit the personal attribution rules affecting genuine services businesses.

It provides specialist tax advice to individuals, businesses in the SME sector and law and accounting firms needing advice on specific transactions. The company also has a public policy focus and as part of this regularly makes submissions on policy proposals and new legislation. This submission has been prepared based on our discussions with Inland Revenue officials and our involvement with the preparation of the submission of the Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand. ("ATAINZ"). We would like to thank Inland Revenue for the opportunity to engage in discussions on these proposals which we found informative and useful. The views expressed here are those of Baucher Consulting Limited and are not a representation of any opinion or statement of ATAINZ. The focus of our submission is on those parts of the proposals which we consider most affect our clients. It begins with some general commentary on the discussion document followed by our responses to the specific questions asked. General commentary on proposals We are concerned at the scope of the proposals in Parts I and Ill of the discussion document which we consider will fall disproportionately on small businesses which make up the majority of our clientele. Although the discussion document suggested that attempts to circumvent the 33% rate are already occurring in our view it provided little evidence of the potential amount of tax involved. In particular, we have not seen sufficient evidence to support the need for the proposals outlined in Part Ill of the discussion document. Baucher Consulting Limited PO Box 32-582, Devonport, Auckland 0744 • ph (09) 486 6200 • www.baucher.tax In relation to the proposals in Part I, these are driven by concerns regarding the excessive retention of earnings and imputation credits and the possible circumvention of a tax charge on distribution through the means of a sale of shares. As the discussion document notes the absence of a general capital gains tax means sales of shares are not generally taxed. However, as we noted in our discussion with Inland Revenue officials, in the majority of cases in the SME sector in which I advise, a sale of business to a third party usually involves a sale of assets and not a sale of shares. In such circumstances, the recent purchase price allocation rules will apply to the sale and the vendors will then liquidate the trading company and be subject to the relevant rules regarding distributions at that point. Against this background we consider a better alternative would be to introduce a limit on how long imputation credits may be retained without being distributed. For example, such a time limit could be ten years from the end of the imputation year in which the credit first arose. As discussed with officials, it would be reasonable to expect a company to have adopted some form of distribution policy within ten years of start-up. Under our suggestion, the imputation credits would expire if not distributed within the relevant period. Companies would therefore be incentivised to distribute retained earnings in order to ensure the benefit of imputation credits passes through to shareholders. Advisors already pay close attention to imputation credit accounts so we consider introducing time limits should not significantly increase compliance costs for companies. Although such a rule would have its own complexities, we consider it is preferable to the recharacterization approach proposed. In our view the recharacterization would be complicated to apply and would intervene excessively in commercial transactions carried out at arms’ length. We consider the proposed extension of the personal services income attribution rule in Part III of the discussion document goes too far. We would limit any potential extension to businesses with net income in excess of the $180,000 threshold above which the 39% tax rate applies. We note that Figure 1 in the discussion document indicates that some self- employed taxpayers appear to be attempting to avoid higher tax-rates at the thresholds for the 30% and 33% rates ($48,000 and $70,000 respectively). Given recent inflation and that the current tax rates and thresholds have not been adjusted since 2010, we suggest that such taxpayers may be relying on excessive drawings to meet normal household expenditure. If so, Inland Revenue already has existing tools such as applying the prescribed rate of interest to overdrawn shareholder/proprietor current accounts which it can use to counter perceived avoidance. It may, however, wish to consider treating the full amount of overdrawn current accounts as a dividend. We understand this is the approach in Australia and the United Kingdom. In relation to employees acting as contractors, we consider Inland Revenue should deploy further resources into investigating whether “contractors” are in fact genuine contractors or de-facto employees. Reflecting on our experience as part of the Government’s Small Business Council, we wonder whether tighter application of the existing law to deem contractors to be employees might help boost productivity within the SME sector. Furthermore, we consider the issue of defining contractors as employees might become more important if the Government’s proposed Social Insurance Scheme is implemented. We are concerned the personal services attribution proposals could mean owners of businesses in the same industry might be subject to very different tax treatment simply because of how one or two employees are utilised. We consider such an outcome would do little for the public perception of the integrity of the tax system. Overall, although we accept the introduction of the 39% income tax rate requires integrity measures to ensure its broad application, we consider the proposals unfairly target the SME sector. Owner/operator companies, such as electricians, plumbers and other trades represent a significant proportion of small business enterprises. These proposals would complicate the compliance burden of such businesses. Responses to specific questions Part I Question Submission Is deeming a dividend to arise when shares are sold (while the company has retained earnings) an appropriate policy outcome? Not in every circumstance Question Submission Is limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule to sales of shares by a controlling shareholder appropriate, or do you think this is too broad or too limited? Recharacterisation is appropriate in so far as it applies to related party transactions Is the conceptual basis for quantifying the deemed dividend (that is, undistributed income, not including untaxed capital gains) appropriate? On the basis that the proposals are effectively targeting undistributed income this basis is broadly acceptable. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested dividend quantification approaches (grossed-up ICA, retained earnings, or a combination of the two), and which of these approaches do you prefer? Is there an alternative approach you would suggest? We are not sure either of the proposed methods adequately deal with issue of excess imputation credits relative to retained earnings because of losses incurred subsequent to when imputation credits arose. As noted in our introductory comments we consider a time bar limit on how long imputation credits may be retained without being distributed is our preferred approach. Do you agree with the proposed approach (outlined in Example 3) for calculating dividends and ASC adjustments for corporate groups? We consider the example illustrates the complexity of the proposals. We believe our suggestion for time-limited imputation credits may by-pass some of the complexity involved. Is the approach outlined in Example 4 for a sale of one controlled company to another (existing) controlled company (potentially generating a deemed dividend from both companies) correct conceptually? Part II Question Submission Whether the proposed transitional rule is appropriate. Yes Whether the Commissioner should be able to reopen a return and on what basis Not for companies subject to transitional rule Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity. We consider the approach is reasonable. We think it likely much of this information is already being recorded permanently. Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns. We recommend triennial reporting. Part III Question Submission Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? No, we are not convinced there is clear evidence of mischief which requires the change Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? No, as noted above we consider this an unnecessary expansion of the rule. We are also concerned it would introduce confusion for smaller businesses as to where the boundary arises. Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? We consider the suggested thresholds are too high and overstate the impact of inflation since 2000. 1 Submission to Government Discussion Document Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution Submission submitted by Howard Severinsen Date 29 April 2022 My su bmission relates to the above. 1 The i nformation published invites submissions. It states that.... Despi te these claims and many website/link searches and blind alleys, there seems to be no mention of how submissions should be made. So we are not off to a good start. 2 The whol e tone of the document is about taxpayers re-arranging their affairs in order to avoid the new, 39% top tax bracket. It contains no analysis of how it might affect businesses legitimately going about their business prior to the introduction of the 39% bracket. New Zealand is said to be a nation of small businesses. This omission is a serious omission in my opinion. At the very least there should be an analysis of unintended consequences of the proposed changes to the proposal. It also suggests a deeper failing with the introduction of the 39% tax bracket and any consequential affects. Why weren’t these thought of earlier? 3 The c onsultation document and its tone throughout suggests to me that most small businesses have full knowledge of what the future holds for them. And that they arrange their affairs with that full knowledge. I submit that in many cases this will not be the case. Take the electrician with a van and tools for example. Does she know how many clients she is likely to have in the forthcoming financial year? Will it continue to be many small clients, or will she perhaps win that bigger job for the retirement village that she has been chasing? I submit that the proposed changes to the attribution rules will cause her to seriously consider closing down her nascent business and just taking a job with the bigger company down the road. This doesn’t feel like a more efficient outcome to New Zealand to me. Surely we want to encourage people to take on business ventures. PUB-021 2 4 Support for the 39% rate. The consultation document states its ambition/purpose to support the integrity of the 39% rate. Yet inexplicably there is no intention to change the $70,000 threshold to $180,000! If this wasn’t actually very important this would be laughable. The purpose of the proposals should be more honestly restated if the $70,000 threshold is to be retained. You choose the language. Perhaps this is the deliberate matter to be later conceded, to show that consultation was meaningful. 5 The document indicates a degree of pre-determination and power on the behalf of an individual. See one extract below (and similar tone in many other places). I submit that reality is quite different. There are two parties to any employment/business arrangement – employee/supplier and employer/client. The client needs any contractual arrangements to ‘’work” from their point of view too. Suppliers don’t have carte blanche to impose their chosen structures. Clients are often careful to avoid creating any form of an employment agreement. The document is out of touch with the dynamic in this area. 6 The examples given are pitiful. How many clients does Bill’s company have? How was Bill’s company revenue distributed amongst those clients? Is he now deemed to be an employee of each of his clients in terms of the Employment Relations Act 2000? What is the before and after situation for Bill? 7 Good tax policy should be fair. I submit that the propped changes are not fair. They discriminate (quite viscously) on scale. Take the example of Bill. What if ten individual Bills join together? The new entity – TentimesBill – will presumably pass both the 80% rules and the business assets rule. Purely because of scale. Larger businesses have more clients/customers – smaller ones have fewer. I submit that the proposed measures as described are not fair. It would penalise micro sized businesses, purely due to the scale of their operations. And New Zealand has many, many micro sized businesses. The proposed changes would drive many of them out of existence. 8 Good tax policy should be efficient – both in terms of compliance and collection and any business changes or arrangements caused by them. I submit that the proposed changes would lead to significant manoeuvring to make arrangements in accordance with the market signals received. Changing many “A Plus Accounting Ltd”s into “TentimesBill”s wouldn’t be efficient. The accounting and legal costs would be high and ultimate borne by the eventual clients. 3 9 I submit that the most relevant finding in the quoted case of Penny & Hooper was in fact the use (or misuse actually) of artificially low salaries. The proposed changes outlined in the consultation document seem like a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. Surely there must be an easier way to tackle use of artificially low salaries rather than the changes proposed? I note that Penny & Hooper used a trust to avoid tax. As trusts are tased at 33% anyway, I wonder whether this practice is very common in 2022? An individual needs to earn about $332,000 to be paying overall tax of 33% on their total income. There would be a rather narrow band of individuals that this applies to. Perhaps there is not much tax leakage via trusts? 10 The changes as described appear to discriminate against the provision of services as opposed to the provision of goods. This doesn’t seem to be fair. 11 if the proposals continue in any form there should be a phase in period. This would allow those adversely affected time to consider their business prospects and either make adjustments in a planned manner or close down those businesses affected. Please include me in any further consultation on this matter.

We consider the proposals go beyond preventing individuals avoiding tax or diverting income to lower tax-rate entities and have the potential to over tax shareholders undertaking neither of these activities. Further, these proposals will impose additional compliance costs on businesses required to comply. 2. As noted in the discussion document the proceeds of selling shares held on capital account are treated by our tax system as a non-taxable capital receipt. These proposals effectively represent a capital gains tax on share sales. 3. The proposal represents a tax on a transaction and as such will interfere with everyday transactions and cause economic distortion. There seems to be an underlying presumption that if a shareholder sells their shares in a company their motivation is to avoid paying tax on retained earnings. The reality is very few share sales are motivated by such a purpose and those that are will fall foul of existing avoidance rules. 4. A further underlying presumption seems to be that businesses are conducted through companies to avoid income being taxed at individual tax rates. As noted in the discussion documents there are many good reasons for trading through a company that nothing to do with tax. While some professional people may use companies to engage with their employer (for which we have attribution rules), for most people the selection of a company as a trading entity will be driven by commercial considerations: not a desire to avoid the top personal tax rate. 5. There also seems to be a presumption that earnings are retained in a company solely to avoid paying tax at the top personal tax rate. This overlooks the commercial reality that many entities retain funds to finance the company’s growth rather than as a source of funds to spend on shareholders. 6. The statutory definition of “tax avoidance” effectively means that every transaction that effects a person’s income is tax avoidance. Therefore, the definition of tax avoidance arrangement requires the tax avoidance purpose or effect to be more than incidental. This is an element that is missing from both this proposal and that relating to the personal services income attribution rule. Circumstances and transactions have been identified that can be construed as “tax avoidance” (any transaction that impacts income is), but no regard is had for whether that tax avoidance effect is merely incidental. In a minority cases it will not be, but in the vast majority it will not be. To stop the minority, normal business transactions are interfered with and additional compliance costs imposed on businesses, particularly SMEs. 7. Underscoring our concerns is the distinct lack of consultation (generic tax policy process) on these matters before the discussion document was published. Our firm has no issue with Government wanting to ensure personal services income is taxed at the appropriate personal marginal tax rate – but the proposals in this document go well beyond that. Earlier Page | 3 consultation would have improved the proposals, provided better focus for submitters and better outcomes for Government. Chapter 3 – Questions for Submitters Is deeming a dividend to arise when shares are sold (while the company has retained earnings) an appropriate policy outcome? 8. No: this represents a fundamental change to our tax law It shifts the focus from the transaction at hand, the sale of shares, to a piercing of the corporate veil to attribute the company’s realised earnings to the selling shareholder. While officials may believe moving our company tax base to a more integrated model is desirable for personal services income, attempting to do this for all businesses under the guise of dividend integrity is very disappointing. 9. The proposal focuses solely on the retained earnings and imputation credit account of the company and has no regard to what creates the value that the shareholder is realising on the sale. 10. For example, consider the situation where a company is formed with a $100 of share capital and a $100 loan from the bank to fund the acquisition of $200 of capital assets. The company trades successfully and uses retained earnings to repay the bank loan. The shareholder has increased their shareholder funds (capital) from $100 to $200 by repaying debt funding. The company still has $200 of capital assets, but now funded by $100 share capital and $100 retained earnings. There has been no diversion or avoidance of tax. The income has been earned by the company and it has paid tax on it. The retained earnings are not available for distribution to the shareholder as they are required to fund the company’s assets, but under this proposal the shareholder will be required to pay tax on the retained earnings on the sale of their shares. Should the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule cover all of scenarios A, B, or C, or only one or two of these scenarios? 11. Example 1 is presented as justifying the inclusion of Scenario A (no change in economic ownership) in the proposed rule. The example represents a dividend strip that would fall foul of the existing dividend stripping rule. This transaction has a clear tax avoidance purpose. 12. However, we fail to see how Example 1 justifies the application of an anti-avoidance dividend stripping rule to all share transactions that do not involve a change in economic ownership. This example relies on the sale of all the shares in Bullseye to Purchaser to obtain the advantage of the inter-corporate tax exemption. The proposed rule would apply to any sale of shares in Bullseye to Purchaser, yet a sale of less than 100% does not obtain the tax advantage claimed to justify the proposed transactions. 13. Any transaction whereby Shareholder sold less than 100% of the shares in Bullseye to Purchaser that was followed by a dividend by Bullseye used to clear Purchaser’s debt to Shareholder would in our view full foul of the existing anti-avoidance rules. 14. There are many commercial reasons why a corporate group may wish to restructure ownership of group members. For example, to rationalise group structure, to bring Page | 4 companies trading in similar businesses or areas within a subgroup, to the position part of the group for sale, or to facilitate an amalgamation. These transactions are not motivated by tax avoidance, but commercial imperatives. Extension of dividend stripping rules to these types of transactions imposes a tax cost on normal commercial restructurings. These companies are not retaining earnings to avoid taxation, but to fund ongoing business operation. 15. Example 2 is presented as justification for including Scenario B (sale to an unrelated company) in the proposed rule. Again, this example is the sale of 100% of Bullseye’s shares to Purchases and relies on the inter-corporate tax exemption to obtain a tax benefit and arguably could be attacked as avoidance. 16. We do not consider that this example provides justification for extension of dividend stripping rules to every sale of shares to an unrelated company. Where the share sale will result in a breach of shareholder continuity (any purchase of over 34% of the company, but less than 100%) a dividend will be paid before the shareholding change. The purchaser does not want to acquire a company with reserves that are not covered by imputation credits nor do existing shareholders want to receive unimputed dividends in the future. 17. As stated earlier there is the presumption that the sell down of shares is motivated by a tax avoidance purpose. The reality is that the reasons why a shareholder will sell down their shareholding in a company are many and varied. For example, as part of a succession plan or to introduce employees as shareholders. Selling down shares in a profitable business, with the consequent dilution of ownership interest, to avoid paying tax on retained earnings will be toward the very bottom of the list of reasons. Yet this proposal will impose tax on and interfere with many transactions that have nothing to do with avoiding tax. 18. Example 3 is presented as justification for including Scenario C (sale to unrelated individual) in the proposed rule. This example is not commercially realistic. A purchaser in this case would discount the purchase price to recognise they were acquiring a company without imputation cover for its retained earnings or require the company to declare a dividend before acquiring the company. We fail to see how this justifies the extension of dividend stripping to sales of shares to unrelated individuals. At best there is a deferral of tax, if no dividend is declared, but this is only the case if the company would have paid a dividend had the share sale not occurred and there is no requirement on the company to do so. 19. As noted above there are many reasons why a shareholder will sell down their shareholding in a company. Selling down shares in a profitable business, with the consequent dilution of ownership, to avoid paying tax on retained earnings will be toward the very bottom of the list. Again, this proposal will impose a tax cost on and interfere with many transactions that have nothing to do with avoiding tax. 20. We consider this proposal represents a significant change to our tax system whereby the earnings of a company are effectively being attributed to its shareholders. Legally, these earnings are those of the company until the company elects to distribute them to its shareholders. If shareholders wish to pay tax on company income, they have the option of electing for the company to become a look-through company. Page | 5 21. However, as above, if the Government’s desire is to move to a more integrated model for the taxation of companies that is a policy decision for Government; but this should not be undertaken as part of an exercise that is addressing the issue of the taxation of personal services income. Is limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule to sales of shares by a controlling shareholder appropriate, or do you think this is too broad or too limited? 22. We oppose these proposals in their entirety. However, we consider the 50% threshold to be arbitrary. The examples used to justify the inclusion of Scenario A and Scenario B require a disposal of 100% of the shares to obtain the avoidance of tax on the distributions. As discussed above these benefits do not arise when a lesser level of shareholding is involved and therefore, provide no justification for applying the proposed rule to a sale of anything less than a 100% of the shares. 23. The setting of the threshold creates the perverse position where a 49% shareholding in a company will provide a shareholder with a better return than the 50% shareholding. In that the 49% shareholder can exit the company without incurring a tax impost, whereas any reduction in the 50% shareholding will incur a tax impost. 24. We note that the rationale for 50% appears to be that 50% gives control of the company and the ability to influence dividend policy. It cannot be assumed that associated persons owning 50% or more of the shares collectively means they control a company. Family members disagree about the direction of the company and their different circumstances may they have different views of the company’s dividend policy. It should not be assumed that associated family members will all vote the same way. Is the conceptual basis for quantifying the deemed dividend (that is, undistributed income, not including untaxed capital gains) appropriate? 25. Undistributed income does not necessarily represent the funds available for distribution to shareholders. The existence of capital losses may mean retained earnings are not available for distribution. The discussion document dismisses making allowances for capital losses on the basis it is effectively allowing a deduction for a capital loss. The oversimplifies and misunderstands the position. 26. To make a distribution a company must satisfy the solvency test. The existence of capital losses will impact a company’s solvency meaning a company may be unable to distribute its retained earnings due to the impact of capital losses on solvency. Under this rule an exiting shareholder would potentially pay tax on retained earnings the company had no ability to distribute. In this situation there is no avoidance of tax on those retained earnings as they were not distributable in normal circumstances. 27. Consider a company with $10,000 of share capital, $7,200 of retained earnings and a capital loss of $8,000. The shareholder’s funds are $9,200 representing a capital loss of $800. If the shareholder elected to liquidate the company, the shareholder would receive a $9,200 tax-free return of share capital. However, if the shareholder choose to sell the company for $9,200, under this proposal the shareholder would be treated as receiving a $9,200 taxable dividend ($7,200 retained earnings grossed up to a $10,000 with the addition of imputation credits and then reduced to the sale price of $9,200). Page | 6 28. Further retained earnings may include revaluation of revenue account property, this is unrealised income with tax payable in the future. For example, consider a property development entity that has revalued its development land by $1,000,000. The net of tax value of $720,000 is carried in to retained earnings and provision is made for the future tax liability of $280,000. Currently, there is no tax payable because the property has not been sold. However, under this proposal an exiting shareholder would pay tax on this amount without the benefit of imputation credits. Later when the company sells the land it will pay tax on the land sale resulting in double taxation. 29. Therefore, the tax outcome for a shareholder could depend on whether a company is required to revalue revenue account property, chooses to (for example to satisfy banking covenants) or has the option to value at tax book value or cost. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested dividend quantification approaches (grossed-up ICA, retained earnings, or a combination of the two), and which of these approaches do you prefer? Is there an alternative approach you would suggest? 30. Both approaches have no regard to actual amounts available for distribution. The liquidation approach is rejected as being too complex. However, we consider both the proposed alternatives involve significant complexity. 31. A critical issue that arises is when are retained earnings to be determined? This should be at the date of the share transfer if the intention is to ensure a shareholder pays tax on company earnings derived while the person is a shareholder. This is fine where a sale occurs at balance date and may also work where there is a significant shareholding change and settlement accounts are prepared. However, in other circumstances where minor share sales occur, financial statements would not normally be prepared. The need to determine retained earnings for the purposes of the proposed rules will incur additional compliance costs for what could be a minor shareholding change. This would act as a barrier to majority shareholders transferring minor shareholdings to the likes of employees or family members wanting to join the business. 32. Providing for retained earnings to be determined at the balance date prior to the transaction or after the transaction is simply shifting the tax liability of the vendor to the purchaser or vice versa. 33. This approach has the potential to tax scenarios where the shareholder has not derived any gain. Consider the situation where a company is formed with a $100 of share capital and a $100 loan from the bank to fund the acquisition of $200 of capital assets. The company trades successfully and uses retained earnings to repay the bank loan. The shareholder has increased their shareholder funds (capital) from $100 to $200 by repaying debt funding. The company still has $200 of capital assets, but now funded by $100 share capital and $100 retained earnings. The present shareholder purchased the company for $200 from the original shareholder and has paid all income derived during their ownership either a dividend or shareholder-employee salary. They are now selling the company for $200 represented by the $100 of share capital and $100 of retained earnings that existed when they acquired the company. Under this proposal, they will pay tax on the $100 of retained earnings that existed in the company when they acquired it despite having paid tax on all income while they were a shareholder and not making any gain on the sale. Page | 7 34. The use of grossed up ICA creates potential over taxation. As noted above, to make a distribution a company must satisfy the solvency test. Reference to ICA balance has no regard to the company’s ability to pay a dividend. 35. We disagree with the suggestion that the dividend on sale should be the greater of that determined under the retained earnings approach and the gross up of the ICA balance. 36. We consider that, if a dividend is to occur on the sale of shares, that dividend should be capped at the amount of the retained earnings. A company is limited to the amount of its retained earnings when paying a dividend. If a company pays a dividend more than its retained earnings it is distributing either capital reserves or share capital. Therefore, as a rule a company will avoid doing this as it is converting non-taxable amounts to taxable amounts. By calculating a sale dividend based on the ICA balance, the exiting shareholder is being overtaxed. Where the dividend able to be fully imputed by the ICA balance exceeds the retained earnings, there are no retained earnings on which tax is being “avoided”. 37. A further issue that arises is when is the ICA balance to be determined and what adjustments are to be made? For example, assume a share sale on 31 March 2022. The ICA balance at 31 March 2022, will not include imputation credits that arise from the final provisional tax instalment for the year (due 7 May 2022) or any terminal tax payment for 2022 (not due until 7 February 2023 or 7 April 2023). An exiting shareholder will at that date be attributed the company retained earnings for the 2022 year, but a third or more of the company’s tax will not have been paid. The deemed dividend to the exiting shareholder will not be fully imputed resulting in double taxation of the income. The company will then pay tax on the income, which has now become ASC, resulting in a ICA overhang next time a controlling shareholder exits and further tax will be payable on what is effectively income attributed to the shareholder that exited on 31 March 2022, but is taxed again due to the ICA gross up. Therefore, one amount of income is effectively taxed three times, once in the original exiting shareholders name due to a lack of imputation credits, then in the company’s, and then in the hands of a later exiting shareholders hands due to the ICA overhang created by the original share disposal. 38. The example assumes a sale at balance date, but how will this work when the sale occurs during an income year when the timing of tax payments will affect the dividend attributed to an exiting shareholder. 39. A further consideration is the impact of refunds. The balance of an ICA may be overstated due to a refund that has not been received. If the ICAs are deemed attached to a dividend paid to an exiting shareholder, this may prevent a company receiving a refund that it is owed. 40. Under the current system where the final provisional tax payment occurs after the end of the income year and the final tax payment may be more than 12 months later, the ICA balance may only reflect the retained earnings position more than 12 months after balance date. This creates the potential for significant over taxation and double taxation. 41. A significant overhaul of the imputation regime and the ability to accrue future tax payments and refunds to determine the ICA balance at the time of a share sale to prevent over taxation will be required. Page | 8 42. The approach of grossing up the ICA will also result in over taxation where a company has moved from a profit-making position to a loss-making position or vice versa. Consider a company with $1,000 of share capital. It trades successfully for several years accumulating retained earnings of $720 and $280 of imputation credits. Over the next few years, it suffers losses of $720 leaving it with no retained earnings. The shareholder sells the business for $1,000 being the amount of its share capital. However, due to the existence of $280 of imputation credits the $1,000 sale prices becomes a taxable dividend to the shareholder. Had the shareholder decided to liquidate the company, the $1,000 would have been a non-taxable distribution on liquidation. Do you agree with the proposed approach (outlined in Example 6) for calculating dividends and ASC adjustments for corporate groups? 43. We note that corporate group for this purpose is defined as 50% common ownership. This is below the normal 67% for a group of companies. While 50% is consistent with the ownership level for the proposal to apply, there is the potential for confusion if a different grouping threshold applies than normally applies for income tax. 44. The process of consolidating the retained earnings and ICAs of each individual company has the potential to compound all the issues identified above and lead to significant over taxation of the shareholder and potential double taxation. For the reasons outline above we do not consider that simply adding up ICA balances will provide the correct result. Is the approach outlined in Example 7 for a sale of one controlled company to another (existing) controlled company (potentially generating a deemed dividend from both companies) correct conceptually? 45. We disagree with this proposal. 46. This is an over complication. The starting position for this proposal was a shareholder selling shares in a company with retained earnings to another wholly owned company should result in the shareholder deriving a dividend from the target company. The justification being that the some of the consideration received is in lieu of the dividend the shareholder could have received from the target company. 47. This further proposal makes the leap that the purchasing company, by purchasing the target company, is making a distribution of its retained earnings to the shareholder. Therefore, the dividend in the first instance should be from the purchasing company and only from the target company if the purchase price exceeds the dividend deemed from the purchaser. 48. While we disagree with the rationale behind the dividend integrity proposal, if there is a belief that shareholders are selling share in a company to avoid receiving a dividend from it then surely the dividend should come from the company they are selling not the one that is acquiring it. 49. Alternatively, if the view is that the transaction is undertaken not to avoid a dividend from the target company but to access the retained earnings of the purchaser without receiving a dividend, why restrict this rule to share purchases. By this rationale every time a shareholder sells a capital asset to a company can be viewed as the shareholder accessing the retained earnings of the company without receiving a taxable dividend. Page | 9 50. For example, consider an individual selling a company that owns a piece of land held on capital account worth $2 million to another company the individual owns. Depending on the retained earnings level and ICA balance of the purchasing company some or all the $2 million would be a taxable dividend to the shareholder. Alternatively, if the land was sold from one company to the other it would be a $2 million capital receipt to the first company. That company could then be wound up and the funds distributed to the shareholder potentially on a non-taxable basis as ASC and ACDA depending on how the land was funded (assuming the land is not still 85% commonly owned at the time of liquidation, which it will not be, for example, if the purchasing company has developed and sold it). The alternative provides the correct tax outcome, the proposed rule the incorrect outcome. 51. Further why should the tax outcome be different for the shareholder that sells a company owning land worth $2 million to the purchasing company and a shareholder who sells the land to the company. Under this proposal the former results in the shareholder potentially deriving a $2 million taxable dividend. The latter a $2 million capital receipt. 52. Again, there is a presumption of a tax avoidance purpose for a transaction that may be undertaken for valid commercial reasons. As a tax on transactions this proposal will interfere with everyday transactions and cause economic distortion through imposing artificial tax outcomes. 53. As discussed above the determination of the dividend amount from the purchasing company and potentially also the target company is fraught with issues. Page | 10 PART II ASC AND ACDA TRACKING ACCOUNTS General Comments 55. We agree that ASC and ACDA are for many companies poorly tracked over their life and considerable time can be spent trying to establish these amounts for the purpose of a share repurchase or liquidation distribution. 56. However, many SMEs have minimal ASC that does not vary over the life of the company. The tracking of ASC is more problematic when dealing with larger companies that have been involved with multiple transactions over an extended period. This can be a time- consuming process and lead to some uncertainty as to the correctness of the ASC amount and robustness of supporting evidence. While best practice would suggest tracking ASC is desirable, this is often not done. 57. We are supportive of a requirement to track ASC. This is unlikely to impose significant compliance costs on SMEs and timely tracking will be beneficial to companies involved in more complex business transactions. 58. For many SMEs a lack of understanding of what comprises ACDA means it is rightly or wrongly assumed that the capital reserve accumulated for accounting purposes is its ACDA. Even for larger companies, a liquidation requires a review of the make up of accounting capital reserves to determine the ACDA. 59. We are supportive of a requirement to track ACDA. For SMEs we do not foresee this as being an onerous requirement and for larger companies will provide long run benefits. 60. We consider that a benefit from a requirement to track ASC and ACDA will be to provide greater certainty to companies undertaking share purchases and liquidations that they have correctly identified these amounts. 61. However, we consider the proposal does not provide as much benefit to taxpayers as it could by proposing no limit be placed on the Commissioner’s ability to challenge a return in relation to the ASC or ACDA memorandum accounts. We disagree with this. 62. We consider annual ASC and ACDA returns should be subject to the same time-bar as the income tax return with which they are filed. This will provide greater certainty to companies undertaking share repurchases and liquidations as to their ASC and ACDA balances. They would then only need to be concerned with the potential challenge to transactions within the last four years rather than being concerned with having evidence to substantiate transactions that may have occurred many years earlier. 63. One of the primary difficulties with ASC and ACDA for long-standing companies is that companies need to have records of transactions that occurred ten, twenty, thirty or more years ago. Not only are they required to keep these records, but they may also need to understand how that transaction was treated under tax law at the time or need to re- examine the transactions treatment in light of current legislation. This can create significant uncertainty as to the actual level of ASC and ACDA with the onus on the company to prove the correctness of those balances. 64. The ability to disclose transactions impacting ASC and ACDA on an annual basis and have the treatment of the disclose transactions placed beyond challenge after four years will Page | 11 greatly reduce the compliance costs faced by companies and decrease the uncertainty around the correctness of the balances. Chapter 5 – Questions for Submitters Whether the proposed transitional rule is appropriate. 65. We agree that the proposal should only apply prospectively. 66. However, we suggest that consideration should be given to introducing a process by which retrospective approval of ASC and ACDA balances existing at the date these rules come into force. Some companies, particularly those that have existed for some time or been involved in complex transactions, may see value in having the Commissioner approve their starting ASC and ACDA balance especially if a time-bar was available. Whether the Commissioner should be able to reopen a return and on what basis. 67. As discussed above, we consider that ASC and ACDA returns should be subject to the same time-bar as the income tax return with which they are filed. Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity. 68. We have discussed this in our general comments above. 69. We consider the balance between compliance costs and tax integrity would be improved if companies were to obtain the benefit of the certainty provided by a time-bar on ASC and ACDA returns. Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns. 70. We are supported of the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts being reported as part of the annual return and considered they should gain the benefit of the time-bar applying to that return. Page | 12 PART III PERSONAL SERVICE INCOME ATTRIBUTION General Comments 71. We disagree with these proposals. 72. The personal services income attribution rule was designed specifically to counter individuals contracting through a company to provide their services in substitution for entering an employment relationship with the intention of avoiding the top personal tax rate. It achieves this objective. The discussion document suggests this rule is too easy to structure around by providing services to multiple buyers. This is not an example of the rule being structured around, but of a scenario that the rule was not intended to cover. The rule is narrowly targeted to capture arrangements that involved contracting through an interposed entity in substitution for entering an employer-employee relationship to avoid tax. 73. The Penny & Hooper case involved taxpayers restructuring their affairs to reduce the income derived in their personal names and thereby reduce the tax payable on that income. Key features of that case were a restructuring due to a change in tax rates and the taxpayers continuing to enjoy an unchanged level of income, through income being channelled through trusts, but without incurring the higher level of taxation. 74. We consider that this proposal amounts to a significant change to the basis on which entities in New Zealand are taxed. The personal services income attribution rule was designed to combat a specific avoidance arrangement. Penny & Hooper dealt with taxpayers arranging their affairs to avoid tax. 75. This proposal, as with the dividend integrity rules, seems to be predicated on the basis that trading through a company is tax avoidance. This represents a significant shift in tax policy. 76. If there are concerns with individuals artificially suppressing their income, we do not consider that the income attribution rule is the appropriate tool for doing this. It was designed for a situation where there was little commercial justification for trading through a company and the “business” was really an employer-employee relationship. Attributing all company income in these circumstances is appropriate as the company’s income would otherwise be the working person’s salary. 77. This is different from an individual or individuals conducting a business through a company and providing services to a range of clients. There are genuine commercial reasons for trading through a company and genuine commercial reasons for retaining income within the business. The application of the income attribution rule ignores those reasons. At the same time, we acknowledge that if the reasons for retaining income are tax motivated a mechanism is required to counteract that. However, we do not consider the income attribution rule and proposed modifications are the appropriate mechanism Page | 13 Chapter 7 Question for Submitters Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? 78. No. 79. This change significantly alters the scope of this rule from being targeted at a specific tax avoidance arrangement to treating the use of a company as a tax avoidance arrangement. The 80% threshold exists to prevent structuring out of the rule by adding a secondary minor source of income. 80. Example 8 is used as a justification for this rule. It involves Bill being paid $70,000 and the balance of the income being left in the company or made available as loans to Bill. If the surplus funds are left in the company then Bill does not have use of the funds. However, this change is suggesting that despite the company utilising the funds and Bill not having access to it, he should nonetheless pay tax on it. Alternatively, if the funds are loaned out to Bill, he will be incurring interest on the loan or if no interest is charged deriving a taxable dividend. Bill would be incurring 4.5% interest, which is taxable to the company, to save paying an extra 5% tax. While a small benefit may accrue in the short run any benefit will be eroded through interest charges and increased tax payable by the company. At some point, Bill will need to repay the funds (which will be difficult if used to finance his lifestyle) or a dividend will need to be declared to clear the overdrawn current account meaning Bill pays the additional tax on the income. Overall, this scenario results in more tax being paid due to the interest charge on the loans and there is no tax avoidance. 81. Further if Bill is paying himself a $70,000 salary while enjoying a $150,000 lifestyle through borrowing surplus income from the company, there would seem to be clear grounds for challenging this as a tax avoidance arrangement. This was one of the issues addressed in Penny & Hooper. 82. As noted above, this proposal means the rule goes from targeting a specific avoidance arrangement to deeming a decision to trade through a company to be tax avoidance. There are many reasons why an individual may choose to trade through a company, concerns about personal liability and the limited liability afforded by a company is a primary one. 83. An individual trading through a company wants to enjoy the fruits of their labour, the company is there for commercial reasons not to avoid tax. Very few individuals will choose a $70,000 lifestyle rather than a $150,000 lifestyle to avoid paying tax. No evidence has been provided to show that this is a real issue. 84. Further as was noted in Penny & Hooper there are legitimate reasons why an individual may choose to elect to retain funds in a company, such as funding future expansion or saving for replacement or upgraded equipment. The attribution of income to the individual, when there is a genuine reason for retaining some earnings in the company becomes problematic as the company will accumulate retained earnings on which no tax is paid. The existing rule allows for deemed imputation credits and elections to be treated as a qualifying company with respect to certain distributions, but still leaves open the potential for double taxation and adds additional compliance costs to anyone trading through a company for valid commercial reasons. We are also concerned with how this will interact with the proposal for share sales to give rise to dividends and the potential for double Page | 14 taxation to arise where income has been retained in a company, but attributed to the working person for tax purposes. 85. This proposal will also result in different tax outcomes for taxpayers depending on the type of business they choose to pursue. An individual trading through a company to provide personal services to a wide range of customers will be subject to attribution. An individual trading through a company utilising significant assets will not be. An individual that elects to undertake a retail business through a company will not be. Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? 86. No. 87. Again, this significantly alters the scope of the rule from targeting arrangements substituted for employment relationships to targeting trading through a company as tax avoidance. 88. If the policy rationale is that this rule is the need to prevent an individual avoiding tax on income arising from their personal exertion, then this threshold should be set at a high level. An argument could be made that 80% is too low. Dropping the threshold to 50% means the individual is being attribute a sizeable portion of income that does not arise from their personal exertion. This seems contrary to the justification for the rule. 89. This also seems to create an arbitrary distinction where one or two individuals providing personal services through a company is subject to attribution, but three individuals providing the same services through a company are not. Penny and Hooper may be caught if they practice together through a company, but if they add a third orthopaedic surgeon to the company they are not. Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? 90. The thresholds suggested are arbitrary with no basis provided for them. 91. We support keeping this threshold as low as possible. It is preferable that this proposal disrupts the business activities of as few as taxpayers as possible and, accordingly, support a low substantial asset threshold. 92. We disagree with the exclusion of motor vehicles from the asset calculation. While it may be true that in some cases, they are not integral to the work performed, that will not be the case in every situation. In some cases, a vehicle may be retained exclusively or nearly exclusively for business purposes. 93. Accordingly, we do not consider vehicles should be excluded. Alternatively, their value for these purposes could be reduced for non-business use. For example, only half the value of a vehicle used 50% of the time for busines would be included in the calculation of substantial business assets. Page | 15 Which of options one and two do you consider to be preferable? Is there another option that you think would be better than either of the thresholds suggested in this chapter? 94. For the reasons, stated above we prefer the second option which provides for a lower threshold. Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000? 95. As discussed, we disagree with this proposal. If it is to be enacted, it is preferable that it disrupts the business activities of as few as taxpayers as possible and, accordingly, endorse increasing the net income threshold to $180,000. This is consistent with the original intent of the rule of preventing avoidance of the top personal tax rate. 29 A pril 2022 Depu ty Commissioner Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution Intro duction I make some high-level points on this discussion document. I make this in my personal capacity. Proposals The discussion document proposes: 1 That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings. 2 That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their available subscribed capital and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. 3 That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule be removed. Submission General policy From a general policy position I agree that income derived from personal services should be taxed to the person that performed the services at their personal marginal tax rate. As Tax Director of the then New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants when the decision in Penny and Hooper was released we responded to this by working with Inland Revenue to educate practitioners on the implications of the Supreme Court decision. This involved a country-wide road show with senior IR legal staff. The Institute also lobbied Policy Advice as it was then to make policy changes to effectively legislate the outcomes in Penny and Hooper to prevent any future abuse and make the rules clearer for all. The Institute’s approach in this regard was rejected. As above, I remain of the view that a better statutory framework is put in place to set the boundaries or limits on how income derived from a person’s personal exertion is taxed. PUB-0 I accept this essentially means a move closer to a more integrated basis of taxation – but in the context of personal services income there is a case for this. However, I do not support moving to a more integrated basis for business taxation generally. Those proposals not only over tax business income they put material inefficiencies into New Zealand’s small businesses and family arrangements. While the Government has every right to consider a more integrated regime and how that could work, I would have expected that to have been the topic of a discussion document, rather than seeing this mooted as part of a discussion that was premised on small businesses avoiding tax under the guise of a document entitled dividend integrity. In terms of the proposals to better capture ASC and capital gain amounts I note that currently these items are captured in accounting reports, but have no objection to rules that better ensures a permanent record of these amounts is kept. In this context, an option to consider is the time of paying a dividend as the time of confirming ASC amounts to IRD. This forces the matter to be considered if a share buy-back is undertaken, rather than when a return is filed. Personal services attribution The document asks: Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? The test should be reformed. The default should be that where a person substantially controls the income then the income can be treated as belonging to that person. So, for example, a sole practice doctor or dentist. That is move the test to an income control basis. Thus, even when staff are engaged to perform the services that give rise to the firms income, if the income is controlled by a key shareholder, stakeholder, or business owner then this income should be attributable to that person (after normal expenses). If no one person has control over the income then attribution should not occur at all and the normal business rules / shareholder salary and dividend rules apply. Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? Attribution of personal services income is appropriate when derived by a person that has control over the income. Lowering the threshold is obviously one solution but the issue you have is when that is measured. You don’t want to get to the end of the year to measure this as unexpected outcomes may arise. Rather the test needs to be understood at the outset. I prefer rights to control the business income. In my view, when you have more people involved in delivering the services that generate the income then there is less risk the income is not taxed at the correct rate. As above, my preference is to focus on professionals that control the bulk of the income. So for example, a property valuer that has 2 staff who are also valuers can be considered to derive the bul k of the firm’s income directly as that person has control over the treatment of the net income. On the other hand, a lawyer in a large law firm, although a partner, will not have control of the firm’s income. Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? 1 Public.Consultation@ird.govt.nz 29 April 2022 Dear Sir/Madam Submissions on “Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution” discussion document We refer to “Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution” (or “Discussion Document”) first published in March 2022. Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission. We set out our general comments below, and specific submissions on the proposals in the attached Appendix. The proposals as outlined should not proceed In our view the proposals as outlined in the Discussion Document should not be progressed. The proposed changes go far beyond supporting the integrity of the top personal income tax rate. A decision to move New Zealand tax settings towards greater integration of corporate income is a significant departure from the status quo. The Discussion Document does not in our view adequately outline the breadth of what is being proposed, nor include adequate consideration of the various flow-on consequences that would arise. Instead, the broad-reaching proposals are labelled as integrity measures, which belies their significance. We are concerned that the deemed dividend and personal services amendments, in particular, will have significant overreach applying to scenarios which pose little or no integrity risks to the tax system. Appropriate integrity measures that protect the tax base are warranted, but what is being proposed in this Document in our view goes well beyond that. Significant reforms to the proposals are needed to make them workable and better targeted at the integrity risks. Alternatively, a move towards greater corporate income integrations needs more careful policy consideration. In either case, we would not want to see the proposals as outlined rushed through Parliament. Officials should take the time to work through the issues raised by submitters ahead of making broad sweeping reforms. The volume of current consultations undermines effective consultation Furthermore, we regret that we have not been able to dedicate as much time and effort into considering these proposals as we believe is warranted, given their significance. This is because this consultation falls at the same time as active consultation on many other significant proposed changes. This is also the busiest time of year for tax professionals. We are concerned that issues will therefore be missed, and retrospective legislative fixes will be needed in time to correct mistakes. While we appreciate that officials are working to a set legislative timetable, we would prefer officials to take additional time to consider the proposals more carefully. PUB-025 3 Appendix Detailed submissions A - Dividend Integrity 1. Policy outcomes go beyond addressing integrity risks 1.1. As noted above, the dividend proposals would have effects beyond those stated in the Discussion Document. Fundamentally, a decision to seek greater integration of corporate incomes is a policy decision that cannot be viewed as merely an integrity measure to support the 39% rate. 1.2. Integrity concerns typically relate to taxpayer behaviours that undermine the intent or application of the law. Usually, these behaviours involve contrived and dishonest actions or structuring to avoid or undermine tax laws. We would be concerned if the choice to not distribute all corporate earnings was somehow seen in the same light. In our view further indicators of integrity concerns should be present, before corrective action is applied. That approach ensures the rules are appropriately targeted at the problematic behaviours. 1.3. We support measures that improve the integrity of the tax system, but those integrity measures should in our view be appropriately targeted at the problematic behaviour. Broad brush proposals that apply to all small and medium enterprise (‘SME’) corporate structures, ignoring specific taxpayer motivations and behaviour, go too far. 1.4. If the Government wants to consider greater corporate income integration, the policy discussions should reflect that intent and outline the related implications. We do not think integrity concerns should be used as justifiers for such broad policy proposals. 2. Corporate retained earnings do not indicate that an integrity problem exists 2.1. The Discussion Document appears to suggest officials are concerned with the degree of earnings retention and high levels of imputation credit account (‘ICA’) balances in New Zealand companies, as indicative of an integrity issue. In our view, retained earnings and high ICA balances should not immediately be seen as integrity risks. Businesses retain earnings for a variety of reasons. Profits accumulated in ‘SMEs in particular are most commonly reinvested into the capital of these enterprises. This investment directly grows New Zealand businesses and the economy. 2.2. Much of the retained earnings (in the companies targeted by the proposals) was likely generated before the reintroduction of the 39% rate for individuals, and even before the reduction of the corporate rate to 28%. Therefore, it is difficult to see why retaining earnings ought to be seen as a risk to the 39% rate in the absence of additional indicators of foul play. 2.3. Further, in our experience, share sale transactions do not involve the sale of cash. It is not commercially advantageous for investors to acquire cash-heavy businesses, and purchasers routinely require surplus cash to be paid via pre-completion dividends. As such we question the degree of the stated integrity risk that the proposals aim to address. 3. Capital gains taxation should not be introduced by stealth 3.1. The proposed changes appear to be an attempt to resolve issues caused by New Zealand’s lack of a comprehensive capital gains tax. The current Labour government has repeatedly publicly stated 4 it will not implement a capital gains tax. Yet the current proposals would tax capital gains on in- scope share sales. 3.2. If Parliament’s intention is to tax capital receipts, then Parliament should introduce a capital gains tax. Piecemeal amendments that tax only certain capital gains, erode the coherence of the tax system and arbitrarily pick winners and losers. 3.3. We question the justification for taxation of only certain capital gains, earned only by certain taxpayers. If integrity and fairness are the motivations behind these proposals than it is unreasonable to exclude large, listed and foreign-owned companies from the proposals, while targeting closely controlled SMEs. Similarly, we question the justification for ignoring share sales by minority shareholders, given the same tax outcomes arise for all shareholders in these companies. In our view none of these differentiations are justifiable from a policy perspective. 4. Existing avoidance measures can address integrity concerns 4.1. The Discussion Document acknowledges there are already rules to address dividend integrity issues. Two of the three examples provided involve transactions where the ultimate economic ownership doesn’t change, and officials note existing rules apply in these circumstances. If these rules are inadequate, then changes should be limited to bolstering the rules, not broadening them to apply to non-problematic scenarios. 4.2. The Discussion Document appears to suggest the real issue may not be with the adequacy of existing rules, but with Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce them. For example, at \[3.3\] officials note failure to follow existing rules may “not be known or pursued by Inland Revenue”. We suggest that problems enforcing the current rules would likely extend to the proposed changes. 4.3. If law changes are needed to support Inland Revenue’s effective enforcement of the avoidance rules, then targeted measures to address specific failures in the current settings are warranted. Specific anti-avoidance rules that apply in cases of clearly problematic behaviour can be designed. But that is not what is being proposed here, instead all share sales regardless of motivation or outcome are caught. 4.4. We observe the move from rules that consider all relevant facts and intentions to “brightline” type tests is becoming a broader trend in New Zealand’s tax policy settings. While brightline tests are easier to evidence, and therefore enforce, they are also blunt tools. Brightline tests do not target their application as well as tests that consider specific facts and circumstances. Corrective action is applied more broadly as a consequence, which can result in unfairness. 4.5. In our view additional tests are needed here, such as a requirement for the structure or transaction to be contrived, lacking in substance, or resulting in no meaningful change in economic ownership. That approach ensures the corrective action (deeming the dividend to arise) is better targeted at the problematic behaviour. 5. Proposed changes do not achieve equity between shareholders that have received regular dividends and shareholders of companies that have reinvested retained earnings 5.1. Officials appear to be of the view that retained earnings should properly be paid out as regular taxable dividends, and that the proposed changes would achieve an equivalent result from a tax perspective. 5.2. Retained earnings will in many cases have built up over many decades. If the rules presume dividends should have been paid regularly over time (including years where shareholders’ tax rates may have been much lower than 39%), then deeming income to arise in the year of sale is 5 punitive. This approach artificially forces shareholders into the top marginal rate and taxes only those shareholders that own shares at the point of sale. 5.3. By focussing on retained earnings in a Discussion Document considering integrity issues, officials appear to be suggesting that shareholders are choosing not to pay dividends in order to avoid paying income tax at the top marginal tax rate. In our view this presumption is false. The top rate of 39% was not in existence at the time much of the retained earnings were accumulated. Furthermore, many shareholders would have been subject to much lower marginal rates at the time decisions were made to reinvest rather than pay out dividends. 5.4. Finally, the proposed changes represent a form of dividend streaming. The shareholders affected by the proposals are those “holding the baby” at the point of sale. Given the arbitrary threshold of 51%, retained earnings may have been accumulated during periods the controlling shareholder had a non-controlling interest in the company. 6. Behavioural changes have not been adequately considered 6.1. We are concerned that the Discussion Document does not appear to recognise nor consider the wide-reaching implications of these proposals. In our view, the proposals will lead to widespread changes in investment behaviour in New Zealand. Yet the Discussion Document does not discuss these outcomes, nor propose mitigations to the extent the consequences are undesirable. 6.2. Before the proposals are progressed further, careful consideration of the impacts of these changes is necessary in light of their effect on the wider economy. 6.3. We list below several behavioural consequences we believe officials ought to consider further before progressing these proposals: • The proposals will discourage investment in New Zealand businesses, slowing growth and the drive for productivity increases. • Investors would be incentivised to invest in offshore businesses or to prioritise overseas expansion over domestic growth, which is not good for the New Zealand economy. • Shareholders will be incentivised to proceed with asset sales over share sales which undermines the intent of the rules. • The proposed changes incentivise investors in growth and start-up businesses to divest interests at earlier stages, distorting taxpayer decision making contrary to the BBLR principles underpinning New Zealand tax policy design. • The proposed changes would incentivise investment by and sales to offshore investors and shareholders holding less than 51% of a company’s shares (including those working in concert with non-associated persons), as these shareholders attract more favourable tax treatments under the proposals. This further compounds New Zealand’s growing wealth inequity issues. • The proposals favour “big business”, which may have a focus on short-term investor returns over long-term investment and growth. The focus on SMEs over listed and foreign companies appears unjustified and arbitrarily picks winners and losers. 6 • The proposals would unfairly restrain SME businesses from restructuring for succession planning, compared with larger listed corporates. • Many divestments of New Zealand SME businesses occur in the course of owner retirement. This proposal will disincentivise these retirees from making investments that would inject capital into the economy more broadly. That is because the return on productive investments would be weighed against a guaranteed tax saving of 11% if dividend income was distributed slowly over retirement. • The proposals will disincentivise routine and beneficial commercial practices such as the implementation of employee share schemes. 6.4. In our view the proposals overall distort investment behaviour in a way that negatively impacts growth and productivity. We believe that the negative consequences of these behavioural changes will outweigh the increase in revenue that would be raised if the proposals were progressed. 7. Practical issues not considered 7.1. The Discussion Document is particularly light on key details about how the proposed changes would work in practice. There are many practical issues that appear not to have been considered. For example, how double taxation would be prevented in successive commercial transactions, and how the associated persons rules would apply or be enforced. These issues will need further consideration before the proposals could be progressed. B - Personal Services Attribution rules 8. Proposals go too far and should not proceed 8.1. Similar to our submissions on the deemed dividend proposals, we believe the proposed amendments to the Personal Services Attribution rules go too far. The reformed rule would apply to alter tax consequences in circumstances well beyond the integrity scenarios for which it was initially designed. 8.2. In our view this rule is aimed at individuals who are in “disguised employment”. Whereas Penny and Hooper was concerned with structuring to avoid top tax rate through the payment of unrealistic salaries. The Discussion Document appears to conflate these two issues. Widening a rule aimed at addressing disguised employment, to effectively tax all services businesses as if they were sole traders, goes beyond scope. We question the rationale for distinguishing between service providers and sellers of goods, which is in effect what these proposals would do. 8.3. Therefore, we do not support the removal of the 80% one buyer requirement or broadening of the significant asset tests. These tests are necessary to distinguish employment-like arrangements from a broader class of services businesses which should not be subjected to this rule. 8.4. If there is a specific avoidance concern not addressed by the personal services attribution rule, we recommend implementing an appropriate but targeted solution. The proposals should seek to identify problematic scenarios and to target those. A decision to more broadly move towards greater corporate income integration cannot be seen as an integrity measure. 7 C - Available Subscribed Capital reporting 9. Support for reporting mechanism 9.1. We recently provided comments on the draft operational statement ED0239 Available Subscribed Capital record keeping requirements confirming our support for policy measures implementing the reporting of ASC and ACDA to Inland Revenue. The Discussion Document is silent on this recent consultation process and whether those submissions have been considered by Policy officials. 10. Annual reporting is preferable, but time bar should apply 10.1. Consistent with our submission in the paper referred to above, we support a mechanism for reporting ASC and ACDA annually. However, a time bar mechanism should also be implemented to achieve a level of certainty for taxpayers. 10.2. This allows for manageable record keeping when compared with the status quo. Given that presently companies would need to maintain decades’ long records which, as acknowledged in the Discussion Document undermines accuracy. A time bar that provided 4 yearly certainty would allow taxpayers to align ASC and ACDA records with the standard 7-year retention requirement. This would alleviate compliance costs and improve integrity. C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department By email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 27 April 2022 Re: Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution Dear Sir Thank you for the opportunity to submit on the proposed Dividend Integrity and Personal Services Attribution rules published on 16 th March. We support a comprehensive discussion on the proposed rules, as small businesses are the backbone of our economy. We are happy to talk to our submission, our contact details are below. We support the recommendations made by the Tax Working Group and suggest these should be referred to in proposing structural changes to the Income Tax settings. Part I: Sale of Shares Comments on questions for submitters: •Is deeming a dividend to arise when shares are sold (while the company has retained earnings) an appropriate policy outcome? We submit that deeming a dividend to arise unilaterally when shares are sold, based on the company’s retained earnings is not appropriate as an income tax policy, since the retained earnings amount does not reflect the real economic gain made by the shareholder. If the intention is to tax the gains made by the shareholder over the time of their owning the shares that have not already been taxed as dividends, then a comprehensive capital gains tax would be more appropriate. The situation where shares can be sold to a company, and that acquiring company being able to pay out the previous shareholder the retained earnings of the original company avoiding the top personal tax rate that would apply to a dividend can be prevented by a deemed dividend rule which applies only to the sale of shares from an individual or trust to PUB-026 s 18(c)(i) s 18(c)(i) a company. This limited-scope option would be appropriate as a tax-avoidance prevention measure while not creating a large compliance burden on small businesses. Small businesses are typically funded by retained earnings or shareholder loans, rather than issuing shares and holding share capital. By leaving their profits in the company, the shareholder is putting that money at risk. Corporate tax rates are typically low by design, and this encourages businesses to retain funds to reinvest into business activity and strengthen their balance sheets, which in turn helps the growth and stability of the economy. It is common for small businesses to sell shares of less than 34% from the controlling shareholder to the next generation; or to a key employee as part of the succession planning process. This is often done in stages and is an important process in the long-term viability of private enterprise. The sale is within the threshold to carry forward Imputation Credits, and typically retained earnings have been used to fund the working capital and capital assets of the business so cash is not available to pay out large dividends in cash. If the business is in a position to pay regular dividends, over time the new shareholders will use their dividends (taxed at their personal tax rate) to pay the original shareholder for their share purchase. This results in no tax leakage and allows business to sustainably manage succession. The driver for the proposed changes is the differential between the top personal tax rate and the corporate tax rate. This gap is not large compared to other countries, such as Australia which has a corporate tax rate of 25% (for companies with up to AUD 50m revenue) for the 2022 financial year, and a top personal tax rate of 45%. The absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax in New Zealand results in unequitable tax outcomes and should be addressed directly rather than indirectly, the changes applying to all asset classes and investor types, not just small private business. • Should the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule cover all of scenarios A, B, or C, or only one or two of these scenarios? It is only the sale of shares to another company, such as described in Scenario A and B that allows earnings to be paid out to the original shareholder at the company tax rate. In the case of a sale to an individual such as Scenario C, that individual will have to pay for the shares from after-tax income, which was taxed at their personal tax rate, so there is no tax leakage in that scenario. • Is limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule to sales of shares by a controlling shareholder appropriate, or do you think this is too broad or too limited? Limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule based on a control percentage creates distortions. An individual may purchase shares in a listed company for the general purpose of financial benefit, and not be taxed on the resale. The same investor might buy 51% of a private company and pay 39% tax on the eventual gain on resale. s 18(c)(i) s 18(c)(i) We submit that the deemed dividend rule should be limited to the sale of shares from an individual or trust to a company. This should apply regardless of whether that shareholder was a major or minor shareholder. • Is the conceptual basis for quantifying the deemed dividend (that is, undistributed income, not including untaxed capital gains) appropriate? We submit that it is not appropriate to assume that all undistributed income equates to a dividend as this does not reflect the realities of business. In the “Other issues” heading 3.42, the document notes that the retained earnings might be used to fund capital losses. This is common, for example a business may make an acquisition that is not successful and have to write-off the goodwill. In private enterprise retained earnings would have been risked to make the investment and ultimately fund this non-deductible loss. • What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested dividend quantification approaches (grossed-up ICA, retained earnings, or a combination of the two), and which of these approaches do you prefer? Is there an alternative approach you would suggest? The deemed dividend quantification approach should be designed to reflect as close as possible the actual economic gain received by the seller. We submit that the value of the benefit should be based on the retained earnings balance at the most recent balance date. To reduce compliance costs, it would be preferable to use the opening retained earnings figure rather than the exact equity at the time of sale, since the share sale could happen at any time during the year and calculating retained earnings at the exact date reliably would be unrealistic for many small businesses. By way a suggestion, consideration could be given to the actual share price if this is less than the retained earnings due to capital losses incurred by the company. • Do you agree with the proposed approach (outlined in Example 3) for calculating dividends and ASC adjustments for corporate groups? A dividend from a company within a group of companies is currently exempt income, we submit that this should be no different for deemed dividends. • Is the approach outlined in Example 4 for a sale of one controlled company to another (existing) controlled company (potentially generating a deemed dividend from both companies) correct conceptually? s 18(c)(i) s 18(c)(i) We submit that the deemed dividend should only arise on the sale of shares from an individual or trust to a company, not from a company to a company, or from any entity or individual to an individual. Part II: ASC and ACDA tracking accounts • Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity. We submit that the rules should be simplified as detailed in the submissions above to be more easily understood an applied consistently. • Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns. The amount of equity that was taxed as a deemed a dividend could be identified separately in the company financial statements and reported in the IR10, rather than maintaining extra memorandum accounts. Part III: Personal services income attribution Questions for submitters • Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? We do not agree with removing the test. There are many reasons why a small service business might choose to operate through a company rather than directly and to retain income within the company. There are already robust rules to tax the provision of private benefits by a company to an employee or shareholder and these are sufficient to prevent abuse of companies for tax avoidance. Removing the rule would penalise small service businesses that are starting out with a small asset base while they build up equity. • Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? Reducing the threshold from 80% to 50% would be likely to catch more of the smaller business starting out who are still reliant on a few customers. The young family starting out in business even in a small way needs to be retaining company profit to grow a business venture which should only be taxed at 28% on that retained income. This is particularly true of businesses requiring assets and machinery in order to grow. s 18(c)(i) s 18(c)(i) • Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? A small company is likely to have a passenger vehicle as a key business asset, either a car for a travelling salesperson or a work van. For a small business their home is normally also their workplace, so the vehicle isn’t used for travelling to work, but for travelling to do the work. The definition of passenger vehicles needs to be clarified – potentially referencing work related vehicles under the FBT rules. We agree with point 7.10 that increasing the threshold is not as likely to impact legitimate small businesses due to the 25% rule. • Which of options one and two do you consider to be preferable? Is there another option that you think would be better than either of the thresholds suggested in this chapter? • Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000? If the “80 percent one buyer” test remains at 80% we don’t feel this is necessary. In summary our submission is that companies are a practical commercial structure that works for many businesses, large and small, public and private. The relatively low company tax rate encourages entrepreneurship, investment in productive assets and maintenance of a strong balance sheet – keeping the NZ economy stable and growing. Any changes to tax the retained earnings in a company need to simply address the actual issues relating to dividend stripping in share sales to companies, however in order to achieve the state objectives of this proposal we see the consideration of a comprehensive capital gains tax as the only equitable solution. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss the points raised in this submission should this be desired.

Taxation of the sale of shares 1 The government proposes that when a shareholder sells their shares, they will be taxed as a dividend on a portion of the shares if: a.They are a controlling shareholder; or b.If they are “acting together” with other shareholders where they and the other shareholder control the company. 2 The taxable dividend will be the greater of; a.The shareholder interest in the retained earnings of the company (grossed up for imputation credits) b.The quantum of imputation credits in the company (gross up by the tax rate). 3 We disagree with the proposal for the following reasons: a.There is no clearly articulated policy objective that the proposal is targeted at. The stated problem is avoidance of the 39% tax rate by earning income in a company. The proposal seems targeted at the SME Olivershaw Limited Level 3 120 Featherston Street WELLINGTON PO Box 30 504 Lower Hutt 5040 Phone: 04 577 2700 Fax: 04 577 2701 PUB-027 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) OLIVERSHAW Limited Tax specialists Page 2 sector. Our experience is that most SME owners extract as much profits as they can from the companies they control because they need to do so to meet personal expenditure commitments. Such payments from the company will be taxed at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. The Document does not support the significant change to the law proposed based on any evidence that avoidance of the 39% rate is widespread in the SME sector. Moreover, the proposal is not limited to situations where a person on a 39% marginal tax rate could be said to derive income through a controlled company. For example, the proposed rule could tax at a 39% tax rate the sale proceeds of shares in a company where the combined company taxable profits and shareholder income never exceeded $180,000. That is because the income derived over a number of years would be deemed under the proposal to be derived in the year the shares are sold. b. The proposal would deem the consideration for the sale of shares to be a dividend when it clearly is not a dividend in form or substance. Broadly, for tax purposes a dividend arises when what is in effect the retained earnings of a company are distributed to shareholders. There are deemed dividends covering, for example, expenditure incurred for the benefit of shareholders. There is then no distribution of the company’s retained earnings but there is the economic benefit of not earning revenue it would otherwise have earnt to the benefit of the shareholder. In the case of the sale of shares, however, there is no dividend equivalent transfer of value from the company to the shareholder. The retained earnings remain in the company and will continue to be taxed as a dividend on distribution. That is unless under the proposal to increase ASC is able to be distributed tax-free (see below). It is true that the vendor shareholder accesses cash from the share sale but that is paid by the purchaser not the company. This is not a dividend but a payment by the purchaser for the dividends that will be paid in the future. c. To reduce double taxation, when a deem dividend arises when a shareholder sells shares, a portion of the retained earnings is converted into ASC. This is extremely complex and will create many errors, especially in group situations. Further and more concerning there are considerable restrictions when a company can return ASC and therefore this proposal will likely prevent companies paying dividends or result in double tax. d. Taxing the gross proceeds from the sale of shares will in some cases result in taxable income exceeding the economic income of the shareholder. This can arise in a number of situations such as when the shareholder had previously acquired the shares and there existed pre- acquisition retained earnings. The document provides conflicting comments on this including is no deduction for pre-acquisition retained earnings to there being a deduction in the group context. Such an outcome is bad policy. e. The proposals are not practical and therefore not workable without substantial compliance costs. The workability of the proposals requires detailed analysis. The proposals rely on the calculation of retained earnings however the Document assumes this is a given. There needs detailed discussion how this is calculated and what rules are to be applied to this especially noting most taxpayers caught by these rules are not subject to accounting standards. Taxpayers with identical commercial position but different accounting treatment will have completely different tax OLIVERSHAW Limited Tax specialists Page 3 implications, this is an interesting outcome. As noted above, to reduce double taxation, when a deem dividend arises, a portion of the retained earnings is converted into ASC. This is extremely complex and will create many errors, especially in group situations. Further and more concerning there are considerable restrictions when a company can return ASC. Therefore the proposal will likely prevent companies paying dividends or result in double tax. Finally, applying the proposals to the sale of a single company is complex, however where there is a group of companies, this compounds the complexity. f. Taxing the greater of retained earnings and the gross up of imputation credits will add to the problems. Where there is non deductible revenue (or capital expenditure) there will be surplus imputation credits in excess of the retained earnings of the company. Where shares are sold and the proposed tax is triggered, assuming there is either ASC or capital gains, there will be a tax liability greater than the revenue reserves. This is clearly over taxation and the Document does not explain why this is justified. The adverse economic effect of the proposals would outweigh any base protection it might achieve. The proposal will result in a tax liability for shareholders when they dispose of shares and this will undoubtedly prevent some commercial transactions from occurring. This can apply when introducing employees, succession planning and mergers and acquisitions. We understand officials are now focussing on example A, namely where a company is sold but the major shareholder retains ownership. As an initial comment we are not sure why the existing avoidance provisions do not adequately address this situation as we understand the Inland Revenue has been successful in challenging restructures under this provision. We can see benefit in providing more clarity with this provision, namely the amount that is taxed is the retained earnings of the entities and specifically the capital gains of the entities should not be taxed, or sought to be taxed under avoidance provision. We would be happy to discuss further. Conclusion taxing the sale of shares 4 Conclusion: a. These proposals should not proceed for the above reasons Determination of a company’s ASC and available capital distribution amount (ACDA) 5 There are two proposals 6 Option one: Require the amount of ASC and the capital gain amount to be determined annually and reported to Inland Revenue. 7 Option two: Require taxpayers to record the information to evidence that they have calculated the dividend amount correctly (with Inland Revenue determining the amounts in the absence of reliable evidence), with no annual reporting requirement.

PUBLIC Dear David, DIVIDEND INTEGRITY AND PERSONAL SERVICES INCOME ATTRIBUTION General Comments Deloitte welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Government’s discussion document on Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution (the Discussion Document). Overall, whilst we agree that limiting the ability of individuals to avoid the top 39% rate (or the second-highest personal income rate of 33%) is a valid aim, we do not support the measures proposed. The reasonings for our position are summarised below and relate to the proposals resulting in considerable overreach as compared with the problem statement and issues of horizontal equity. We include further specific discussions and examples attached as Appendices 1 - 3. We are happy to discuss the details of our submission with Officials. DIVIDEND INTEGRITY MEASURE Summary of submission points General Comments We believe that there is considerable overreach in the proposals when considered against the proposals’ stated aim to prevent tax structuring to avoid the 39% tax rate. The proposals will result in retained earnings being taxed in the hands of the shareholder, irrespective of the fact that the earnings have not been distributed to the shareholder. In some cases, the taxable amount may exceed the gain made by the shareholder on the sale of the shares. The proposals disregard the fact that the retained earnings of a company belong to the company. Retention of earnings is a common and sensible business practice to facilitate growth and provide resilience to changing economic circumstances. Reinvesting earnings in a business is not structuring to avoid the 39% tax rate, even when there is a controlling shareholder. The effect of this proposal is tax on capital sale proceeds which is contrary to Government’s commitment to not introduce a capital gains tax. Imposing a lump sum tax on taxing historical earnings in the year of sale, also does not align with the reality that profits are earned over time. The objectives of the Discussion Document could be achieved by using the START system to help enforce the existing anti-avoidance, dividend and fringe benefit tax rules and do not require new draconian, prescriptive and, in many cases, arbitrary rules. We have seen through external presentations by Inland Deloitte Level 12 20 Customhouse Quay Wellington 6011 PO Box 1990 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Phone: +64 4 470 3500 Fax: +64 4 470 3501 www.deloitte.co.nz 3 May 2022 Dividend Integrity and Personal Services Attribution c/o David Carrigan Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Sent via email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz PUB-028 PUBLIC Revenue that the START system has significant data analytic capability and Inland Revenue should be able to use that system to identify taxpayers who appear to be acting in a manner which is motivated by the introduction of the 39% tax rate. Conceptual Issues  We disagree with the scope of work in tranche one of this wider project. Consultation would have been more effective to determine the reasons why companies retain income and whether they should be respected as corporate retained earnings or whether there might be limited situations where they should be attributed to shareholders.  To the extent that a business is retaining income and that income remains in the company we don’t see any mischief to be addressed. To the extent that the retained earnings of the company are accessed by the controlling shareholder (via loans or other means), then that is the area which warrants some further examination and the creation of clear rules if it is determined there is an issue which warrants a policy response.  We believe that the notable increase in the imputation credit account (ICA) balances are likely to be because companies are being incentivized to invest in growth rather than short-term income as opposed to the Discussion Document’s conclusion that dividends are not paid to shareholders to avoid higher tax rates.  It seems from our discussions with Officials that the wider proposals applying to third party share sales are based on their views that all profits should at some stage be subject to tax in the hands of shareholders, notwithstanding the fact that in most cases reinvested profits will remain in the business and will never be distributed.  We also believe that the proposal on inter-group restructuring is fraught with technical issues and ambiguities and is applied arbitrarily. Proposed Changes:  We submit that Part 1 of the Discussion Document proposals should not proceed. Instead Government and Inland Revenue resources would be better applied to codifying a more targeted dividend stripping rule to deal with the perceived current abuse in the context of associated party transactions if it is in fact the case that the existing rules are not sufficient to protect the tax base. AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL or AVAILABLE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT TRACKING ACCOUNTS Summary of submission points:  While we agree that taxpayers should be maintaining records of available subscribed capital and available capital distribution amounts, we don’t believe the administration and compliance costs created by requiring these accounts to be maintained and filed with Inland Revenue are justified. Collecting this information comes at a cost, and for a large number of taxpayers, that cost is not justified as they won’t distribute capital amounts to shareholders.  If it is decided that this information is filed, the information should be accepted by Inland Revenue and subject to the time bar. PERSONAL SERVICES ATTRIBUTION Summary of submission points:  We submit that there is no compelling evidence that change is required to justify these proposals. We note that in our meeting with Inland Revenue Officials, no examples were able to be provided by Officials of this being a significant issue that required legislative change.  These proposals will impinge on commercial behaviours concerning how small businesses are structured.  We submit that more clarity should be provided on the scope of the income that could be attributed, the measurement of the threshold, and which assets will be captured. PUBLIC Ultimately, we believe that these proposals do not align with policy objectives and commercial reality. What these proposals will do is burden already struggling small businesses with additional compliance costs, when in most instances there has been no tax motivated behaviour. If you have any questions or would like to seek consultation from Deloitte directly on any of the above matters, please do not hesitate to get in contact. Yours sincerely Robyn Walker Partner for Deloitte Limited (as trustee for the Deloitte Trading Trust) s 9(2)(a) PUBLIC Appendix 1 Dividend Integrity I. General Comment We believe that the proposed Dividend Integrity measures are removed from the commercial reality of owning and operating businesses. Canvassing our experiences from dealing with companies, we can see a number of key reasons why the proposals are problematic. 1. The proposal goes significantly further than just discouraging people to structure around the highest personal tax rate and will impose significant taxes and compliance costs on companies and shareholders where personal tax rates are not a factor in their commercial decisions. 2. The proposals contradict the normal commercial practice of keeping retained earnings in a business to facilitate growth and expansion. Paragraph 1.11 of the Discussion Document states that: Inland Revenue analysed existing data it holds on 350 high wealth individuals (individuals and families with more than $50 million in net assets) and found that they used or controlled 8,468 companies and 1,867 trusts. For 2018, these 350 individuals paid $26 million in tax, while their companies and trusts paid $639 million and $102 million respectively, showing a significant amount of income earned through lower tax rate entities. The conclusion above does not recognise that growing businesses require working capital. This retention of profits is necessary to facilitate growth and is done by companies regardless of the owner’s wealth. Hence, in most instances, profits are retained if it is in the company’s interest rather than to respond to tax rate changes. It is noted that based on the data above, on average each high wealth individual is declaring income of around $240,000, if on average they are directly paying $74,285 in tax (it is unclear whether the data provided by Inland Revenue includes imputed dividends, but we assume it does not). This suggests to us that people are paying themselves a fair amount of remuneration for personal exertion, assuming they are working in their businesses. Further, introducing a new exit tax on shares, where none previously existed, will potentially dissuade serial entrepreneurs from divesting investments and starting new ventures. This is an issue when the government repeatedly says it wants to encourage these as a pathway to future prosperity. 3. The proposals introduce a new tax on capital sale proceeds by recharacterising some or all of an amount received from the sale of shares into a dividend (calculated by reference to retained earnings and imputation credit balances). This runs contrary to the Government’s commitment not to introduce a capital gains tax as discussed in paragraph 2.5. Some of the unintended consequences of the proposals highlighted above can be demonstrated through an example. Example 1 A and B are married and have been running SolarCo for 30 years as a family business. They set up the company when solar technology was first becoming mainstream and continued to operate the business making moderate profits. Each year A & B would be paid salaries that were fair for work undertaken in the company, bearing in mind their desire to grow the company. Remaining profits would be retained to help PUBLIC the business grow, including funding investment into new technology, acquiring a building, and funding the cost of trading stock. In 2023, A and B are approached with an offer to buy SolarCo, on the basis that solar energy has soared in popularity and future earning potential has increased. At this time, A and B have retained earnings and an ICA balance. A and B will have a deemed dividend, and each will be taxed at 39%, despite the amount being attributed to 30 years of work. The example helps illustrate that the main group that will be affected by these proposals will be family-owned companies. A significant majority of these companies are SMEs. These are people who have invested their time, energy, and sometimes all their assets to grow their businesses. The challenges faced by these companies are more pronounced now because of the impacts of COVID-19. II. Conceptual Issues A. Scope of Tranche 1 Proposals Paragraph 1.17 defines the scope of Tranche 1 which “concerns dividend integrity and income attribution measures relating to the use of closely-held companies and trusts by high-income individuals.” Additionally, tranche two will deal with trust integrity and company income retention issues, 1 while a possible tranche three could consider integrity issues for the taxation of portfolio investment income, such as Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) taxation. 2 We disagree with how these proposals are being progressed in tranches. We believe that tranche one should be better spent on evaluating the reasons which exist for companies to retain income. This would provide a better platform to evaluate potential tax reform to ensure that proposals sit with the policy objectives which are related to the 39% tax rate. It would also allow Officials to obtain information about, and understand the growth and productivity benefits that accrue from, companies not fully distributing/attributing profits to shareholders on an annual basis. B. Insufficient proof to support the tax problem The Discussion Document makes the following observations in par 2.23: Since the first increase in the top personal tax rate to 39% in 2000, New Zealand has seen a notable increase in the imputation credit account (ICA) balances of non-listed companies. This suggests that smaller or fewer dividends are being paid to shareholders. However, we believe that the analysis conducted was insufficient to conclude the above. This is because the rise in ICA balances could be attributed to other factors. For example, an alternative hypothesis is that companies are being incentivised to invest in growth (with productivity benefits) rather than short-term income for shareholders. Consequently, the proposals may result in a reduction in productivity gains or in investment (shareholders may be incentivised to take more earnings from the company on an annual basis to reduce the likelihood of a dividend on sale at higher marginal tax rates). 1 Paragraph 1.18 of the Discussion Document. 2 Paragraph 1.20 of the Discussion Document. PUBLIC We also note that any increases in imputation credit accounts and/or increases in retained earnings could also be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby businesses have a new appreciation of the need to maintain strong balance sheets. Businesses who have also benefitted from any form of COVID-19 business support from the Government have also been discouraged from passing profits through to shareholders in the form of dividends 3 . It seems from our discussions with officials that the wider proposals applying to third party share sales are based on their views that all profits should at some stage be subject to tax in the hands of shareholders. Officials appear to have philosophical issues with shareholders receiving an untaxed capital gain in situations where a purchaser uses a holding company and can potentially extract retained earnings at a later stage without a tax impost. While that might be the case to some extent, in most cases reinvested profits will remain in the business and will never be distributed. After discussing what issues arise on the scope, premise, and nature of the problem statement, we now turn to some operational issues of the proposal. C. The Discussion Document’s Proposal The Discussion Document proposes the following in paragraph 1.29: That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings. This will trigger a residual tax liability for the shareholder. The company should also have an increase in its ASC. This ASC increase will address a current inequity in the imputation credit continuity rules and prevent double taxation upon liquidation. We will discuss the potential issues with such a proposal under two sections: related party sales and non-related party sales. D. On related company sales The general rule proposed involves recharacterising share sales as dividends in the hands of the selling shareholder, with the quantum of the dividend determined with reference to retained earnings and imputation credit account balances. 4 We first look at share sales between related parties. We refer to Example 5 in the Discussion Document of Pepperidge Profit Accumulating Biscuits Limited (PABL) to illustrate the operational issues that may arise. 1. There seems to be a risk of double taxation in the case of PABL. In Example 5, the Discussion Document claims that the proposals will prevent double taxation in the event of liquidation since the deemed net dividend (gross deemed dividend less deemed imputation credit) has already been treated as a dividend. However, we believe that there is still a potential for significant double taxation here. The foreign shares here is an example of double taxation. The tax rules have been designed to tax the foreign income in a particular way, which taxes only $250,000, not $300,000. However, these rules then tax the remaining $50,000 of income. This would not be the outcome for a look-through company or partnership. 3 “We are reviewing the accounts of our customers who received one or more Resurgence Support Payment (RSP). The review is to make sure customers met the eligibility criteria and used these payments in line with the RSP terms and conditions. If we find your client was ineligible or has passed the RSP through to the business owners, shareholders, partners, trustees or other members of the business, or used the RSP for personal expenses, we may act to recover these payments.” Source: https://www.ird.govt.nz/updates/news-folder/resurgence-support-payment-review- underway 4 Paragraph 3.1 of the Discussion Document PUBLIC In Example 5, Paul is being taxed entirely at the 39% tax rate despite the profits being accumulated over 15 years, many of which the top personal rate would have been 33%. This approach will result in punitive over- taxation. 2. The proposals need to provide more guidance as to who could be associates in such transactions. Paragraph 3.23 states that: “The proceeds from a share sale would be recharacterised as a dividend if the shareholder (together with associates and other shareholders acting together) controls the company immediately before the sale. It should not matter how large the block of shares sold is, as long as the control criterion is met. This is so there is no ability to avoid recharacterisation by selling shares in small “drip feed” parcels.” The lack of definition of who could be associates can cast a wide net to varying degrees of organisational and familial relationships. The association rules will treat family members within 2 degrees of blood relationship as a single person under these proposals. With all due respect, family arrangements can be complex and there are a number of non-tax reasons why family members may want to exit family businesses. We also note it will need to be clear what family member shareholders should be aggregated to determine if a company is closely controlled. For example, in Example 5, if PPAB had three additional shareholders Penny (Peter’s sister), Petra (Patty’s sister) and Pedro (Petra’s son), while Penny and Petra are each within 2 degrees of blood relationship with Peter and Patty, they are only within 3 degrees of connection to Paul and Pam; likewise, Pedro is associated to Petra, but is only within 3 degrees of relationship to Peter and Patty, 4 degrees to Paul and Pam and 5 degrees to Penny; so should Penny, Petra and Pedro’s shareholdings be factored to when determining whether Paul’s share sale is caught by the rules? 3. The proposal should also clarify what transactions could be captured in this rule. As noted above, in our discussions with Officials’ they have indicated there is more concern where there are holding companies introduced in a manner that could allow value to be extracted from the group tax free. As such, it’s unclear whether there are issues with the genuine sale of businesses between family members where no holding companies are created or are involved (or holding companies are introduced using a share for share exchange). E. On non-related party sales The Discussion Document clarifies that the dividend recharacterisation rule extends to sales to unrelated companies and individuals as per paragraph 3.15. It is proposed that a dividend recharacterisation rule may be applied to Scenarios A, B and C. All scenarios have the same consequence for the seller, although they have different consequences for the buyer. It seems appropriate that the shareholder who owned shares in a company when the company earned income would be taxed on the income when shares are sold for a price that includes the value of the company’s retained earnings. Failure to tax the retained earnings component of the sale price would also allow deferral of the top-up tax to be extended for a potentially lengthy period. In the context of third-party transactions, we do not believe a problem exists. Sales of companies to third parties are almost always priced on a ‘debt-free, cash-free’ basis, with typically minimal cash transferring as part of working capital. What the rule will tax then in third party transactions, is not profits retained in cash, but profits reinvested in the assets of a business, a point already discussed above. Further by calculating the taxable income with reference to imputation credits may result in the taxable income exceeding the maximum legally permitted dividend that the shareholder could have received. PUBLIC We note that the application of these rules to non-related party sales creates practical issues, such as determining retained earnings balances given there is a 364/365 chance that a transaction will not occur on a companys’ balance date. Distortion of Merger and Acquisition Activity We submit that the proposals in the Discussion Document will also distort commercial Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activity. Below are some examples of how the rule may distort or influence behaviours in the M&A space.  The rule will be problematic for ‘locked box’ deals. Profits earned between the locked box date and the completion date economically belong to the purchaser, but will be taxable for the seller, not reflecting the economics on a locked box deal.  We see that this rule will likely apply to all sales of profitable companies by private shareholders and will add complexity and compliance costs every time. Hence, we do not support the extension of these rules to unrelated party sales because besides being an overreach, this will also distort M&A activity.  The proposals will also encourage corporate investors to acquire 100% of acquired entities to ensure that they are able to access the wholly owned group inter-corporate dividend exemption in the event that they are deemed to have received a distribution of un-imputed retained earnings on disposal of a controlling interest. This could have a negative impact on capital markets. Inequitable outcomes The proposals in the Discussion Document will also result in inequitable outcomes that may undermine the integrity of the tax system. Below are some worked examples that could illustrate these issues.  If a business is owned 51:49 by two shareholders, only the 51% shareholder would be subject to tax under this rule. In a second example, if a business owned 49% by two unrelated shareholders and 2% by an employee, the rule would not apply at all. This has the potential to result in materially different tax outcomes for shareholders in similar positions.  A foreign-owned company sells out its shares to local management. Five employees own the company 20% each. Over time, several shareholders progressively sell out their shares to the remaining shareholders, until there are two shareholders left owning 50% each. The first three shareholders have no tax consequences of their sale assuming they had a capital account investment. However, when either of the final two shareholders wants to leave, they could trigger the application of these rules as they are now controlling shareholders 5 . Depending on how control is defined, those shareholders will have a tax obligation in relation to 50% of the retained earnings and/or ICA balance relating back to when the company was first established. This is considering that some imputation credits may have been forfeited during prior shareholding changes.  The proposal will result in inequitable outcomes for companies that have been profitable but have losses carried forward at the time of sale. For example, if Business A makes $100 in year 1, it pays $28 tax and has $72 of retained earnings. In year 2, Business A makes a $100 loss. Overall, Business A has made $0 economic profit. On sale, the shareholders of Business A will be deemed to receive a dividend of $100 ($28 imputation credits / 28%), despite not having made an overall economic profit. 5 We note it is not completely clear from our correspondence with Officials whether the rules would apply only to “greater than 50% shareholders” or to “50% or greater shareholders”; at a minimum, if there was only one shareholder left in this example, that person would have a tax liability on exit that no other shareholders face PUBLIC  Capital losses are also not reflected in the outcome of these proposals. For example, Business C buys Business D for $1 million market value. Business D makes $100,000 profit, pays tax, and does not distribute dividends. A pandemic impacts the company and Business C needs to sell. Subsequently, Business C is able to find a buyer willing to buy Business D for $900,000. Business C does not make any gain (i.e. market circumstances mean the company value has actually decreased). Business C will have a dividend of at least $100,000 (being the imputation credit balance of $28,000 / 28%). However, Business C will still have tax on a dividend but without a recognition that they have made a capital loss. F. Employee Share Schemes Given the wide variety of structures used to transfer economic ownership to employees, we are concerned that the proposed rule could have unintended consequences for employee share schemes and the (non-tax) benefits they provide. Consideration should be given to excluding transfers of shares to employees from the rule to avoid creating a barrier to their introduction (through tax cost or complexity). G. General corporate structuring The rule will apply to internal restructures or sales of shares but with added complexity. Example 7 in the Discussion Document suggests the purchasing company will be the entity deemed to pay the dividend, rather than the acquired entity with a second potential dividend being deemed paid by the acquired company. There will be a host of compliance issues to work through, even for the most basic restructures, and this again will mean additional compliance costs. We submit that there needs to be clear guidance to explain when corporate restructuring can take place without triggering tax liabilities. H. On succession planning The Discussion Document does not include any guidance on how the rule should apply to the transfer of shares on death or on the settlement of a trust. Consequently, it is unclear whether these would trigger a tax cost. Therefore, we submit that more consideration would need to be given to these matters. III. Our Proposed Changes We acknowledge the concern in the proposal when there are transactions between associates which are structured to avoid taxes. However, the wider proposals cast a wide net and capture a wide range of shareholders who are not engaging in the types of activities the Discussion Document is trying to prevent. Additionally, there is already a targeted anti-avoidance rule which prohibits this. The Discussion Document states that: 6 Dividend stripping arrangements are mostly governed by anti-avoidance legislation. Such legislation can be complex to administer and costly to litigate. However, with a targeted scope and clear guidance, these anti-avoidance rules could be more simple and more cost- effective than the proposals contained in the Discussion Document. We would be interested in understanding what information gaps currently exist and whether there is existing data in the START system which could help Inland Revenue identify potential dividend stripping transactions for review, Finally, we submit that if there are any changes to the scope of the proposal, more consultation should be undertaken on the revised proposals prior to legislation being introduced. In such an event, we are more than willing to engage with Inland Revenue on this issue. Such consultation will ensure that the proposals align with commercial practice. 6 Paragraph 2.7 of the Discussion Document. PUBLIC Appendix 2 ASC and ACDA Tracking Accounts I. The Proposal Paragraph 1.29 states that: That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their ASC and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. These accounts would be similar to the imputation credit accounts already required to be kept but would have fewer entries. II. Our submissions We acknowledge and support the aim to have formal clarification that companies should maintain a record of their available subscribed capital (ASC) and available capital distribution amount (ACDA) if they wish to utilise these amounts. However, our preference is that these accounts be maintained by the taxpayer and not to be filed with Inland Revenue. This is because the formal collection of this data will impose compliance costs on both Inland Revenue and taxpayers for minimum purpose. This will be especially so if taxpayers are required to calculate/disclose their historical ASC balance (although we note this is not currently proposed). If a taxpayer wishes to undertake a transaction which would use ASC or distribute a capital gain, then the onus should be on the taxpayer to substantiate the relevant balance. This is consistent with the position which Inland Revenue has already articulated in “OS 22/01 Available Subscribed Capital record-keeping requirements”. Inland Revenue should not underestimate the potential compliance costs involved for taxpayers in constructing and maintaining these accounts; particularly for large and complex groups of companies which have gone through restructures. We have experience in spending literally hundreds of hours to locate historic records to reconstruct ASC and ACDA balances. The time involved was a necessary cost for that particular taxpayer; but for many taxpayers they will never need this information. While the Discussion Document notes at paragraph 5.12 that as a transitional measure existing companies would not be required to reconstruct existing ASC / ACDA balances, it begs the question of what the point would be of applying these rules to existing companies at all – it would be “ultimately pointless” as the account balances would be meaningless; and if filed with Inland Revenue they would be incorrect. In addition, some current year transactions (i.e. a share for share exchange) require determination of a historical ASC balances in order to determine the amount of ASC arising for the current year transaction. Our preferred order of outcomes would be: 1. No new rules. All companies are made aware of the onus of proof requirements under OS 22/01. 2. Newly incorporated companies after enactment of the rules are required to maintain records of ASC and ACDA. Records are not filed with Inland Revenue. Taxpayers have the option of not holding contemporaneous records at their discretion. Inland Revenue undertake to not request ASC/ACDA records unless the taxpayer has undertaken a transaction which utilises one of these amounts. 3. As above, but existing companies are required to maintain a record of ASC/ACDA transactions after date of enactment of the rules. In the event that taxpayers are required to lodge these accounts with Inland Revenue, we submit that the Commissioner’s ability to challenge a return to be subject to the time bar. This is contrary to what paragraph 5.6 PUBLIC proposes, whereby it states that “the Government does not propose placing a time limit on the Commissioner’s ability to challenge a return in relation to the ACDA and ASC memorandum accounts.” Lastly, we note that if employee share schemes are created, tracking these accounts will be burdensome to the taxpayer. Therefore, consideration must be given in such scenarios; in particular whether businesses can opt to not monitor and document relatively small ASC amounts on a real-time basis (particularly where there is low likelihood of the taxpayer ever seeking to return the ASC to shareholders) with the detail of these amounts being able to be determined and included at a later date if the ASC is to be utilised. PUBLIC Appendix 3 Personal Services Attribution I. The Proposal Paragraphs 1.29 – 1.30 propose: That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule (that is, at least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to one buyer in particular and/or an associate of the buyer) be removed. Should the 80 percent threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test (that is, at least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services is derived from services that are performed by the working person and/or a relative of theirs) be reduced to 50 percent? At what level should the threshold for the substantial business assets test (currently the lower of $75,000 or 25% of the associated entity’s income from personal services for the income year) be set? II. Submissions We make the following submissions  We note that the scope of the personal services attribution rule is proposed to be materially widened. The expansion of these rules will mean that a large portion of small businesses in New Zealand will need to attribute business earnings to owners. This means that there will be a higher tax cost on the profits that are retained as working capital to grow the business. Again, as a recurring theme in this submission, we believe this is an overreach with an unintended consequence of reducing funds available for reinvestment in the business.  We do not support these changes because there is no compelling evidence that change is required.  Inland Revenue already has other mechanisms at its disposal to void any egregious arrangements where individuals are accessing cash from a business and not paying the appropriate individual tax on the cash received without resorting to changing existing rules.  These proposals will introduce inappropriate distortions between services and other types of small businesses where some will be subject to tax at individual tax rates and others will be able to continue to benefit from the lower company tax rate.  The proposals will create incentives for small businesses to amalgamate. For example, rather than three plumbers running separate businesses which are subject to the PSIA rule, the three plumbers may form a single company so the “\[50%\] one natural person supplier rule” cannot apply. III. Threshold Issues We also do not support the changes to the one natural person supplier test and the substantial asset threshold for the following reasons. Lowering the threshold from 80 percent threshold to 50 percent will distort behaviours in a commercial setting. For example, this will induce employers to go into a partnership rather than as a sole principal; and it will be very difficult for businesses to measure who’s exertion the business income is coming from (will all small businesses be required to maintain timesheets to establish whether more than 50% of income is attributable to a particular individual?). We also submit that the substantial business asset thresholds are too high especially if it is set at $200,000 for businesses run by tradespeople or specialists. Lastly, there must be more guidance on the following points:  Whether all income will be attributed once the 50 percent threshold is exceeded;  How such threshold will be measured; and PUBLIC  How a luxury vehicle will be defined. Overall, we do not believe these proposals align with the problem statement in the Discussion Document and will disproportionately impact small businesses and tradespeople in New Zealand. Public.Consultation@ird.govt.nz 2 May 2022 Dear Sir/Madam Submission on Dividend integrity discussion document We refer to the “Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution” discussion document published in March 2022 (“Discussion Document”). Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission, and for allowing the small extension. NZ Private Capital is the voice of private capital in New Zealand. Our members partner with businesses across every sector of the market to help them grow. Businesses backed by private capital investment make a significant contribution to growing the nation’s economy. As the leading voice for private capital investment, we support our industry through advocacy on important policy issues, helping shape regulatory frameworks and encouraging members to contribute ideas and challenges that accelerate growth ambition. Submission NZ Private Capital considers that the ‘dividend integrity’ proposals in the Discussion Document should not be progressed. Alternatively, if they are progressed they should only be progressed as a targeted anti-avoidance rule that supplements the existing avoidance rules in place in the legislation. Our key submissions are as follows: 1.Existing avoidance law New Zealand has strong general and specific anti-avoidance rules already in place which are likely to capture the vast majority of situations in which avoidance of the 39% personal income tax rate may occur. If additional specific scenarios are identified or envisaged where unintended avoidance of the tax base may occur, then such scenarios should be limited by well considered and specific legislative changes. A shortage of resources to investigate and/or litigate those instances where such avoidance may be occurring is not valid justification for introducing law which not only captures the intended scenarios, but many more and with unintended consequences. 2.Counterproductive to growth and productivity increases in great NZ businesses With New Zealand’s productivity lagging behind many of its global or OECD comparators, reinvestment in great New Zealand businesses for improvement and growth in revenues, employment and scale should be encouraged, not artificially deterred. By adding an artificial tax effect (the deemed distribution of retained earnings) to the sale of shares in a company, the proposals will significantly complicate the investment and realisation of capital in New Zealand businesses. PUB-029 Any policy that seeks to distort the growth agenda and potentially inhibit reinvestment in these businesses will only further slow NZ’s drive for creativity and productivity increases and reduce ambition to create world-leading businesses with significant, exciting employment opportunities for our generations to come. Business owners should be free to make rational decisions as to either reinvestment or distribution based on the opportunities available to the business. 3. Artificial and negative distortions created to NZ Inc Furthermore, rules which create distortions and inappropriate incentives, should be avoided at all costs. One specific outcome or consequence of the current proposals may be for New Zealand founders / owners of businesses to seek offshore investment and control of their businesses much earlier in their lifecycle. This both disadvantages New Zealand based investors or collective investment vehicles in comparison to their foreign counterparts, but also means this Government would be encouraging value creation to be occurring more in the hands of foreign investors than it would its own country and investors, moving significant wealth offshore. 4. Multiple taxation of the same economic amounts The proposals also have the perverse potential of taxing the same economic income multiple times. Transactions in shares as opposed to assets occur for very legitimate commercial and legal reasons, and would rarely be tax motivated. The provision of ASC as a means of mitigating the taxing of the same economic income multiple times over does not work unless every such business sale occurs via way of an asset sale and liquidation. This does not reflect commercial reality. In most situations it is not commercially preferable to proceed as an asset sale due to the added complexities of transferring employees and assigning contracts / transferring assets. We welcome any discussions you may wish to have with us on the matters raised below. Please contact either Brad Wheeler or Colin McKinnon. Yours faithfully Brad Wheeler Colin McKinnon Chair – Policy & Regulatory Working Group Executive Director Email: Mobil e: Graeme Olding Barney Cumberland s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) 2 The purpose of the personal services attribution rule, as it is currently implemented, is to mitigate the risk of tax avoidance in situations where “...individuals who, using an interposed entity, sell their labour to a buyer in the specific situation where these individuals would likely have traditionally supplied their labour as employees, rather than as independent contractors” (refer para 6.3 of the discussion document; emphasis added). This is a specific scenario where there is a credible risk that the only reason for supplying personal services via a separate legal entity rather than a traditional employment agreement is to avoid personal income tax. The current “80% one buyer” test and the “80% one natural person supplier” test are, in combination, a good proxy for this situation. The qualifier that personal services would likely otherwise be supplied through a traditional employment arrangement is essential because it limits the application of the personal services income attribution rule to the only situation in which it makes sense – i.e., where it is likely that the related tax payer is deliberately avoiding tax that would otherwise have to be paid on their salary or wages as an employee. The effect of the proposed changes will be to disconnect the personal services income attribution rule from this qualifier and will dramatically broaden the range of businesses to which the personal services attribution rule applies, many of which will be businesses supplying services of a type and in a manner which could not be achieved through a conventional employer/employee arrangement. As a result, the changes will render the rule effectively arbitrary in its focus on personal services. To wit: How is a small personal services business that supplies more than one client and which is “mostly” (>50%) reliant on the efforts of a single individual any different from a tax avoidance perspective to any other small business that is similarly reliant on the efforts of a single individual? The proposed changes will mean profits generated by sole operator personal services businesses will be treated differently from corporate profits more generally just because they are attributable “mostly” to the efforts of a single person. This is wholly unreasonable. The proposed changes to the personal services income attribution rule are motivated by the Government’s observation that there has been a significant increase in structuring activity since the introduction of the 39% personal income tax bracket. While it seems reasonable to assume that some of this activity is for the purpose of tax avoidance, the proposed changes will also impact small businesses that were legitimately established for asset protection and were set up and operating before the introduction of the 39% tax rate was announced. This is unfair. The proposed changes are also motivated by the Government’s desire to find a solution to the perceived tax avoidance problem that does not require the Government to do the hard work of actually proving that particular business structures have been adopted specifically for the purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Paragraph 32 of the regulatory impact statement notes, “Inland Revenue’s general experience has been that, when there is a specific and identifiable situation where avoidance is a concern, it is usually better to have a specific rule that addresses the concern than it is to rely on the general anti-avoidance rule.” The proposed changes to the personal services income attribution rule do not achieve this. In fact, they achieve the opposite – they move a specific and narrowly framed rule that targets a specific and identifiable tax avoidance situation to a blunt instrument that will broadly target all sole operator small businesses. For these changes to be justified, surely the Government should have to demonstrate that the majority of small business structures that fall within scope of the revised rule can reasonably be suspected of having been set up primarily for purpose and effect of tax avoidance. At the moment the Government is merely surmising that some of them have been. In my view, the proposed changes to the personal services income attribution rule amount to lazy policy. Beyond identifying that structuring activity seems to be occurring, neither the discussion document nor the associated regulatory impact statement provide any substantive analysis or quantification of the scope, magnitude, or characteristics of the real-world problem that could be used to inform the development of specific policy targeting that problem. Nor do they provide any 3 analysis or quantification of the impacts of the proposals – which will be significant on those real businesses covered by the proposed changes. The proposals amount to a “tax grab” on small businesses, apparently justified by nothing more than hypothetical supposition. To the extent that tax avoidance is occurring in small businesses, it is ultimately a function of what those businesses are paying for their inputs and how the profits are returned to the shareholders. The proposed changes to the personal services income attribution rule do not address either of these things. Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? I do not agree. With reference to Para 6.3 of the discussion paper, the purpose of the personal services attribution rule is to mitigate the risk of tax avoidance in situations where “...individuals who, using an interposed entity, sell their labour to a buyer in the specific situation where these individuals would likely have traditionally supplied their labour as employees, rather than as independent contractors.” The “80% one buyer” test, in combination with the “80% one natural person supplier” test, is a good proxy for this situation. Removing the “80% one buyer” test would mean that the personal services attribution rule will apply to consultants and contractors who work for multiple clients in situations far removed from the traditional employer/employee scenario. In my case, I work as an independent consultant and would normally expect to work for several clients in any given year. With reference to the IRD’s own guidelines (https://www.ird.govt.nz/roles/employees/self-employed-or-employee), I am self- employed. The nature of my work is such that I am engaged to solve specific problems or provide certain advice to my clients. This work would not and could not otherwise be done as an employee of the client organisations. The justification for the proposed change to the “80% one buyer” test seems to rest on the assertion that, irrespective of the number of clients served, “the taxpayer is performing work and being paid for it – the entity is effectively just a conduit for the taxpayer’s income-earning activity. Consequently, the taxpayer should be taxed on their fee income at the applicable marginal rate.” (Refer para 6.14 of the discussion document). The embedded assumption is that the individual would receive the same level of remuneration regardless of the commercial structure under which the services are provided. This is not the case and conflates two different values – the value of the inputs vs the value of the outputs. To illustrate, consultants in my field with an equivalent level of experience can expect to charge out at anywhere from $180 - $300 per hour depending on the nature of the client, the work, and the commercial arrangements. My average hourly rate invoiced for FY21/22 was $220 per hour. Assuming an average level of productivity, I could expect to generate average revenue of ~$300,000 per year in direct billings, which reflects the output value of my services. As a salaried employee, however, my expected income would be less. In my case, prior to commencing as an independent consultant I was employed on a salary of ~$160,000 per year. Through my company, I currently withdraw the equivalent of a salary of $180,000 which I believe is in line with market rates for the services I provide and the level of salary that I could expect if I was to seek employment with another company. This reflects the input value of my services. It is expected that a company (whether my own or another) that sells my services should profit from the difference between input and output values. Those profits are not personal income and should not be taxed as such until such time as they are returned the shareholder(s). The proposed removal of the “80% one buyer” test would, however, see the profits of my company treated as my personal income even though I could not otherwise realise income at that level through traditional employment arrangements and the services I provide would not otherwise be provided through 4 such arrangements. If I provided the same services via employment with a larger consultancy my personal income would be equivalent to what I currently draw from my company, but that company would not be subject to this tax penalty on the resulting profits. It amounts to the Government deciding how the profits of my company should be taxed for no other reason than I am a sole operator. This is wholly arbitrary, unfair, and unjustified. The “80% one buyer” test should be retained. Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? I do not agree. With reference to Para 6.3 of the discussion paper, the purpose of the personal services attribution rule is to mitigate the risk of tax avoidance in situations where “...individuals who, using an interposed entity, sell their labour to a buyer in the specific situation where these individuals would likely have traditionally supplied their labour as employees, rather than as independent contractors.” The “80% percent one natural person supplier” test, in combination with the “80% one buyer” test, is a good proxy for this situation. Reducing the threshold for the supplier test would mean that the personal services attribution rule will apply to small businesses where the services are supplied by and are fundamentally the product of the collaborative efforts of more than one individual. This fails to recognise that revenue earned through collaborative working is not revenue that can be earned working alone. In my case, I work as an independent consultant but often engage sub-consultants to support my service delivery. While my personal services account for more than 50% but less than 80% of my company’s revenue, the services that I provide in conjunction with other consultants cannot be provided by me alone – it is the joint effort that provides the service and the benefit to the client. The proposed change in threshold would see profit resulting from those joint efforts being taxed as if I had earned it alone. This is wholly unfair and unjustified. The threshold for the “one natural person supplier” test should remain at 80%. Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? No comment. Which of options one and two do you consider to be preferable? Is there another option that you think would be better than either of the thresholds suggested in this chapter? No comment. Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000? No comment.

To add salt to the wound, big publicly-listed companies will be exempt from these tax hikes. But Inland Revenue are aiming for the kings but shooting the peasants! For many business owners it will result in more tax payable than if there was a full capital gains tax. This is all insanity gone nuts! Small business are the biggest employers in NZ. It's crazy.

David Parker and the rest of his incredibly bad, out-of-touch Labour government lackies are obviously on a mission to kill one of the powerhouses of New Zealand's economy. Small businesses in this country are already staggering under the weight of increased holidays and sick leave for their employees plus multiple increases in the minimum wage, all in the middle of a pandemic ! That's madness on its own let alone this new threat.

Our submissions in response to the Discussion Document are set out below. Key submissions 2 The stated rationale for the proposal to tax undistributed retained earnings by deeming a dividend to arise when shares are sold (the Dividend Proposal) is to counter the retention of after-tax profits by companies in order to avoid paying tax at the top marginal tax rate (i.e. by realising the value of after-tax profits through selling capital account shares instead). In our view: 2.1 the Dividend Proposal goes well beyond an integrity measure or avoidance rule. It is not targeted at individuals who are on the top marginal tax rate. Instead it represents a fundamental change to the tax system. The Dividend Proposal would effectively derecognise capital gains arising to equity holders and ignore the commercial realities that taxpayers face when selling shares; and 2.2 there is a fundamental issue with the way officials have presented the Dividend Proposal as an integrity measure without discussing the significant change in underlying tax policy that it represents. 3 If the Dividend Proposal is targeted at companies not paying dividends, officials should consider whether this can be adequately addressed by existing anti- avoidance rules (including sections BG 1 and GB 1), or whether a new specific anti- avoidance rule may address officials’ concerns. Further guidance in relation to existing anti-avoidance rules, or the introduction of a new specific anti-avoidance rule could address officials’ concerns with the integrity of the 39% tax rate without significantly altering the way in which companies are taxed. For example, it may be appropriate for Inland Revenue to update the guidance published in Revenue Alert RA 18/01 Dividend Stripping now that wedge between the corporate tax rate and the top marginal tax rate has increased from 5% to 11%. PUB-040 s 9(2)(a) 092675749/9177938.6 2 4 The Discussion Document notes in various places that the Government has declined to introduce a capital gains tax. In our view, this policy decision by the Government should be respected and the policy response from the Department should not be to seek to legislate away the existence of capital gains. 5 This attempt to derecognise capital gains through the Dividend Proposal results in sub-optimal outcomes when compared to a capital gains tax, and because it seeks to derecognise a real-world capital gain is incoherent with other existing tax rules. As a result, we anticipate it would be extremely difficult to ensure compliance and that introduction of the Dividend Proposal would have unintended consequences. Key design issues include: 5.1 the lack of rollover relief included in the Dividend Proposal; 5.2 the lack of a permanent loss carry back regime to operate alongside the Dividend Proposal (e.g. so that a company’s ICA broadly moves up and down in tandem with accounting retained earnings in order to genuinely reflect the dividends a company could pay prior to sale); and 5.3 the lack of opening balances included in the Dividend Proposal (no attempt to mitigate possible retrospective effect). 6 If, notwithstanding our comments above, the Dividend Proposal were to be adopted, the scope of the rules must be narrowed so that: 6.1 deemed dividends are calculated by reference only to a company’s ICA balance— otherwise a wider review of the appropriateness of shareholder continuity rules for ICA balance must be undertaken in tandem with the introduction of the Dividend Proposal, and the ICA rules would, in our view, require amendment with retrospective effect; 6.2 the rules operate on a go-forward basis only (i.e. transitionary rules ensure that historic retained earnings are not captured by the Dividend Proposal); and 6.3 the rules only apply to sales of shares by natural persons subject to the 39% tax rate. Additional submissions Should apply to 39% shareholders only 7 At paragraph 3.43 the Document suggests the Dividend Proposal should apply where shares in an operating company are sold by a holding company. The stated reason for applying the Dividend Proposal to companies disposing of shares is that, without such a rule, holding companies could be used to frustrate the Dividend Proposal. However, selling a company from within a corporate holding structure is not always relevant to the integrity of the 39% rate. 8 In our view, the Dividend Proposal must be much narrower in its potential application if it is to be properly understood and applied by taxpayers. Narrowing the scope of the rule to natural persons who would be subject to tax on the top marginal rate would achieve this. 092675749/9177938.6 3 Problems with quantifying deemed dividend 9 There are problems with quantifying a deemed dividend with reference to either: (i) grossed-up accounting retained earnings less non-taxable capital gains; or (ii) a company’s ICA balance divided by the company tax rate. Imputation credits are not refunded when a company has made losses and so an ICA balance may bear very little resemblance to the actual retained earnings a company has available to distribute. Even more fundamentally, accounting income is not calculated in accordance with tax principles and we expect significant work would need to be done before the accounting concept of retained earnings could be used as a general starting point for quantifying any deemed dividends. Problem with retrospective / unintended consequences 10 As an example, suppose: 10.1 From January 2018 to August 2019: Restaurant Co Ltd (RCL) is established by Original Owner and runs as a profitable business. RCL reinvests all retained earnings over this period, amounting to $300k. 10.2 On 1 August 2019: Original Owner sells RCL to New Owner. 10.3 From 1 August 2019 to now: RCL made pre-tax profits of $100k in FY20 and paid $28k in income tax. In FY21 and FY22 YTD RCL has made significant losses and New Owner is in the process of selling the business. 11 If New Owner sold RCL now and did not have an ‘opening balance’ to coincide with the introduction of the Dividend Proposal, New Owner would potentially be taxed on: 11.1 retained earnings that were attributable to Original Owner from January 2018 to December 2019; or 11.2 cash dividends that could have been paid, but were instead reinvested and lost of $72k. 12 In either case, neither RCL nor New Owner will necessarily have the funds to meet the tax payable in respect of New Owner’s deemed dividend receipts. The potential for retrospective effect and unforeseen consequences must require that if the Dividend Proposal is adopted, it is only adopted prospectively. 13 Please let me know if you would like to discuss these submissions. Yours faithfully Graeme Olding Partner s 9(2)(a)
Page 2 Summary table Overall comments The analysis should consider whether and how tax settings affect FDI, and it does not appear to do this. The analysis should take account of the work undertaken for the New Zealand Treasury LTIB. The work should be used to develop a forward-looking policy framework, and should be broader and consistent with the Government’s policy developed in the Living Standards Framework. General comments The analysis does not take into account transfer pricing arrangements, which might have a material effect on the tax raised by FDI. The comparison with other economies does not consider differences in situation, nor is it up to date. More work should be done to determine how to quantify costs not quantified to date. Specific measures None of the specific measures proposed seem viable, with the exception of the Nordic tax system. However, as this would involve introducing an effective capital gains tax, we do not believe this is viable in either the short or medium term. Our more detailed comments are below. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 3 Overall comments Foreign direct investment The aim of the long-term insights briefing (LTIB) was to examine how New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to affect decisions for overseas firms to invest into New Zealand. This draft has also benchmarked New Zealand’s tax settings against those in other countries. It is our understanding that this work forms part of Inland Revenue's role as steward of the tax system, to ensure the long-term health of the system. FDI is vital to the New Zealand economy. We have high infrastructure needs and will continue to have in the coming years. We also have an aging population and will arguably need to increase productivity if we are to fund increasing government superannuation and related health costs. The draft briefing paper notes in paragraph 1.7 that "New Zealand's investment demand exceeds the pool of domestic savings of domestic residents, so we rely to a considerable extend on imported capital to fund domestic investments." That is, we need FDI. What do we need to do as a country to access further FDI/make it more attractive for foreign investors to want to invest here? It is not clear to us whether this draft briefing paper achieves its aims. There is no analysis of the effect that tax settings have on FDI, nor evidence provided that there is a connection on the two factors. The draft outlines how each of the different options would affect Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs) but provides little analysis as to whether any of the options would improve FDI. There is no consideration as to how much FDI will be needed and to what extent the various options may affect it. This is fundamental. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 4 It seems from the draft briefing paper that there is not a lot of data about whether or how tax settings affect FDI. In that case, it may have been preferable to limit the scope to discovering if or how tax settings affect FDI before undertaking further analysis. We understand that the purpose of the report is to present options rather than recommendations or conclusions. However, the briefing paper does not provide any real insight as to what the suggestions would or could do for FDI in New Zealand. Without this step, the research has limited utility. While the briefing paper provides a good summary of the factors considered it is relatively narrow in scope. New Zealand's inability to improve productivity over an extended period is a fundamental issue. This is acknowledged yet the paper does not consider the taxation of individuals. It is primarily focused on efficiency and hence can be criticised because it departs from mainstream government policy which would consider overall well-being in accordance with the Living Standards Framework. We believe that all four capitals should be considered in a long-term insights briefing, not just financial and physical capital. 1 Work undertaken by the New Zealand Treasury The draft briefing paper refers to the complementary Treasury project undertaken in 2021. At paragraph 5.5 it notes that the Treasury LTIB 2 raised the importance of the sustainability of the tax system given future fiscal pressures such as an aging population, rising healthcare demand and the wider costs of Covid-19. 1 https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/tp/living-standards-framework-2021-html 2 Briefing and Long-Term Fiscal Position He Tirohanga Mokopuna 2021, the New Zealand Treasury Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 5 Despite this reference, the work in the draft LTIB seems to have been undertaken in isolation from the earlier Treasury work. In our view, the Treasury findings should be used as a reference point in the Inland Revenue analysis. The Treasury insights consider issues that will impact New Zealand and its citizens. Inland Revenue should consider broadening the scope of its briefing paper to be more relevant. Given the Treasury findings, it may have made sense to assume the tax system was needed to increase revenue (or at least maintain current levels) when considering how best to attract FDI. Once the level of revenue needed has been determined, the next step should be to determine whether non-residents are being taxed appropriately. Are non-residents paying sufficient tax relative to New Zealand residents? If not, how could they be taxed more or less? The draft LTIB considers options for reform in isolation. In our view this work should form part of a larger project across IR and Treasury to determine whether non-residents are paying the right amount of tax and/or the impact that tax settings have on attracting the required level of FDI into New Zealand. Outcome of the work In our submission on the scope, we recommended that the work done as part of the LTIB be used to develop a framework to evaluate policy decisions going forward. It would have been useful if the draft LTIB had considered the direction of tax reform more generally. For example -does New Zealand need more FDI? Is there a link between tax settings and FDI? Are current tax settings for non-residents appropriate? If not, what types of changes would be useful? Which are likely to affect FDI? Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 6 From there, a framework could be developed to inform tax policy decisions going forward. Instead, the draft LTIB has generated specific and isolated reform options that may be either implemented or not. We recommend that the analysis in the draft LTIB be extended to consider any overall policy trends or frameworks that should be pursued in future international tax policy development. General comments Overlay of transfer pricing requirements The analysis also fails to take into account transfer pricing rules. The transfer pricing rules mean that non-residents do not always calculate and return tax in the same way as domestic residents. Overseas entities operating in New Zealand often transact with related parties. This is particularly true of internationally recognised brands. Product manufacture and development (whether goods or services) is done centrally to ensure quality and consistency. International firms set up entities in market countries to market and distribute their product. As you are aware, transfer pricing is a set of rules that requires cross-border associated party transactions to be conducted on an arm's length basis. The aim of the rules is to ensure that the multinational enterprise is returning sufficient profit in New Zealand relative to the economic activity performed here. Overseas entities are required to have robust transfer pricing documentation. This involves documenting (and often agreeing with Inland Revenue) the method used to determine their New Zealand profit. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 7 There are two general categories of transfer pricing methods. The first is transaction methods, which look at the price paid for the goods or services. The second category is profit methods, which look at the profit made on transactions here. Many overseas firms use a profit method, usually one agreed with Inland Revenue. For example, a large soft drink manufacturer might investigate and agree to return profit based on a percentage of sales; and to pay tax on that profit. That is, non-residents do not always calculate and return tax in the same way as a domestic resident. Where a profit method is used, which is common, most of the measures outlined in the draft LTIB will be irrelevant. An overseas firm's decision to invest in New Zealand will not be influenced by depreciation rates, indexation, incentives for specific businesses or an allowance for corporate equity if their taxable income is a percentage of sales. Thin capitalisation may still be relevant. Comparison with other economies The draft briefing uses OECD comparative analysis to determine the merits or otherwise of the New Zealand tax system Some of the information used in the comparisons is out of date. For example, the tax rates for companies in other jurisdictions. This is discussed further in the Appendix under our comments on Chapter 6 of the draft briefing paper (Reducing the company tax rate). Another limit on the OECD comparative analysis is the lack of consideration of capital gains tax. As the draft LTIB notes at 3.21, New Zealand is unusual in that regard. Thus, although Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 8 table 3.1 (page 28) shows that buildings are highly taxed by international standards, this ignores that we do not tax on exit (other than by way of tax depreciation recovery capped at cost). The work underpinning the draft briefing also relies heavily on comparisons with other small, open economies (see in particular figure 3.1 on page 31). While this is useful, we note that the other economies considered (for example Norway, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands) generally have contiguous land borders with other large economies; or are situated very close to a larger market (for example, Ireland, which is part of the EU). New Zealand faces some unique challenges. Foreign investors may choose not to put their money here for many reasons. Distance, size and a lack of familiarity with the country or culture mean that overseas investors are less likely to place their money here. Australia is more likely to attract foreign capital than New Zealand because it is larger, has (arguably) a more attractive climate, and is better known on the international stage. These merits are nothing to do with its tax system. This is discussed further under "Unquantified costs", below. Unquantified costs In our submission on the scope of the LTIB, we noted factors that do not concern the rate of tax but may affect a business's decision to invest here. Examples of these are:  Distance from markets  Compliance costs  Market size  Familiarity with market  Climate  Ease of doing business Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 9 We realise these will not be easy to quantify; however, we recommend more work is done to determine how they may be taken into account. As well as our general comments, we have commented on each of the individual measures considered in the Appendix, under the chapter headings used in the draft briefing paper. We would be happy to discuss our submission with you. Please contact Jolayne Trim. Yours faithfully John Cuthbertson FCA Scott Mason FCA CA ANZ NZ Tax and Financial Services NZ Tax Advisory Group Chair Leader Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 10 Appendix: Specific measures Chapter 6: Reducing the company tax rate We have looked at the economic analysis in chapter six of the draft LTIB. In summary, the chapter considers whether a reduction in the company tax rate would decrease EMTRs. While the analysis is extensive, we do not believe it gives sufficient justification for reducing the company tax rate. The trend analysis for corporate tax rates ends at 2019. However, the world has changed in the past three years. In 2019. In the spring budget of 2021, the United Kingdom announced an increase in their corporate tax rate (for those companies earning more than £250,000) from 19% to 25%. We understand that the US has also signalled interest in increasing its corporate tax rate in order to pay for the cost of the pandemic, although legislation has yet to be introduced. This global trend to higher corporate taxation is one material factor which deserves consideration and reflection. Moreover, the OECD work on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is well advanced. As you are aware, BEPS looks to impose a standard set of tax rules on some of the world's largest multi-national entities to ensure that they are paying sufficient tax overall. At a high level, it would involve coordination between countries to enact similar tax rules in each country. This points towards greater global cooperation in some respects, rather than the global competition which sits as a fundamental part of this analysis. The current misalignment of tax rates – in particular, the 11% differential between the top personal tax rate and the corporate rate – has resulted in Inland Revenue having to Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 11 undertake additional anti-avoidance activity and Government suggesting further integrity measures. The integrity measures will add significant complexity to the system and have the potential to blur the lines of our current tax policy framework – including the distinction between income and capital gains. There is also limited reconciliation to previous advice provided by Inland Revenue. For example, the recommendation of the Secretariat to the Tax Working Group in 2018 advised against a reduction in corporate income tax, saying: 3 "All of this leads us to conclude that, on balance, in the judgement of the Secretariat it would not be in New Zealand’s best interests to lower the company tax rate." In addition, the company tax rate should not be reduced without considering the other factors we refer to in our overall and general comments at the start of the submission. Overall, we do not believe it would be appropriate to reduce New Zealand’s company tax rate. 3 Paragraph 40 of the report, Appendix 2: Company tax rate issues Background Paper for Sessions 6 and 7 of the Tax Working Group (2018), available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-09/twg- bg-appendix-2--company-tax-rate-issues.pdf Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 13 Chapter 7: Accelerated depreciation The analysis considers whether allowing additional depreciation deductions would improve EMTRs. Broadly speaking, accelerated depreciation is a means to give businesses additional deductions for capital costs. The draft briefing paper considers two main methods:  Depreciation loading; and  Partial expensing Undertaking this type of change would go to the heart of our tax policy system, which is a "broad base low rate" structure. This proposal seems similar to initiatives undertaken towards the end of the 20th century where the tax system was used by some governments as a tool to incentivise particular businesses or industries. As it runs against the overall philosophy of our tax system, it should not be undertaken without wider consultation on the structure of the system as a whole. As we have noted in our general comments, this work is not explored in the draft LTIB. Our preference would be to move to a more simplified system of depreciation rates rather than reintroduce loadings, which will bring in further complexity. We would support consideration of partial expensing, particularly for items that are currently black hole expenditure Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 15 Chapter 8: Indexation This chapter considers whether our income tax system should be indexed for inflation. Broadly speaking, the concept is premised on the basis that a component of the income received by individuals and businesses is compensation for inflation. This is particularly true of interest income, which is partly compensation for the time value of money and partly compensation for the value of the money reducing in real terms over the time it is held by the borrower. This chapter of the draft LTIB explains that, in theory, the two could be split out and only actual income taxed. In reality indexation is likely to lead to further complexity, it would permeate through or need to be considered for all income sources and could potentially result in a significant reduction in Government revenue. The draft LTIB notes that no other country has adopted this approach.

Broadly speaking, "thin capitalisation" refers to a set of rules that govern interest deductibility for foreign owners. The aim of the rules is to prevent foreign companies that do business here from sheltering their New Zealand profits against interest deductions so that they pay little or no New Zealand tax. The rules work by limiting the amount of deductible interest over a certain debt threshold. While increasing the debt threshold may improve EMTRs, this option should not be considered in isolation. As we have mentioned earlier in our submission, an overall policy decision needs to be made as to whether non-residents pay the right amount of tax currently before making changes to the thin capitalisation rules. Moreover, taxation of non-residents is often borne ultimately by New Zealand residents through lower wages or rental income. If the measure was implemented, it could increase New Zealand's productivity through higher wages or rental incomes earned from non - residents. However, it is also possible that the increased return received by the non - resident through paying less tax could be simply retained by the non-resident as additional profit. It is not clear whether either of the potential changes in tax settings would attract additional FDI, or merely benefit existing foreign investors.

The draft briefing paper notes that:  In theory this would add more neutrality to the tax system; and  It would be practically impossible to implement unless changes were made to the personal income tax system. We agree with both these points. However, our overall comment is that implementing an ACE would be too complex, particularly given the changes needed to the personal tax system. We note that a separate issues paper has been released which proposes, among other things, a change to the rules regarding share sales 4 . If this change is to be made (which we disagree with), it should be evaluated on its own merits and not be implemented as a stepping-stone to an allowance for corporate equity. 4 Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution: A Government discussion document, 16 March 2022 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tp/publications/2022/2022-dd-dividend-integrity- psa/2022-dd-dividend-integrity-psa-pdf.pdf?modified=20220315155634&modified=20220315155634 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 Page 22 Chapter 12: Dual income tax system The final option considered in the draft paper is the introduction of a dual, or "Nordic", income tax system. Broadly speaking, a Nordic tax system is one where high, progressive tax rates are applied to labour income and lower rates to capital income. While the paper does not provide any recommendations it would seem that, of all the options considered, this would be the most attractive. We agree. While there is no data to suggest that it would increase FDI, it is the most coherent suggestion, would effectively reduce EMTRs and would alleviate some of the other issues currently facing the tax system such as the incredible level of complexity in the new bright-line test rules, denying interest deductions on residential property and the taxation of share sales. However, this option would, in essence, involve introducing a capital gains tax. This is unlikely to be politically palatable in the short or medium term. Moreover, as we have previously mentioned, the current tax rate differentials have created additional complexity in the tax system which is not desirable. For these reasons, we do not believe this is a realistic option.

(2) In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge, and despite anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to— (a) the resources available to the Commissioner; and (b) the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all persons with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) the compliance costs incurred by persons. 8. In short, the Commissioner is statutorily charged to be, and is in fact, anything but impartial in relation to possibilities that might be construed as causing or having the possibility of causing reductions in net revenue. Put another way, this choice of topic was a brave one on the terms prescribed. ‘F’ because IRD has purported to do its analyses impartially and has soundly failed 9. For over 35 years IRD has promoted and successfully pursued a “broad base low rate” (“BBLR”) paradigm. It has been so successful in this that, capital gains aside, there are probably more examples of systematic over-taxation than there are of systematic under-taxation1. BBLR has become an unchallengeable metaphor for what the IRD considers an effective tax system for a small open economy and one generating the highest net revenue over time. And IRD is rightly proud of this and entitled to be so. 10. However, to define a scope for this LTIB topic impartially, never-mind to carry it out impartially, the Commissioner must first get outside of its BBLR metaphor and she has not. BBLR currently infects the choice of scope, the work that has not yet been done, the amount of investment in the project, the lack of collaboration, the timing of requiring submissions and the structure of the draft report. Dare I say it, the paper appears designed to conclude BBLR whatever evidence it encounters in its way, including no matter how compelling. 11. By way of example, in chapter 3 of the draft LTIB evidence is presented that NZ’s FDI is woeful. That fact is left hanging. Then, buried at paragraph 5.7 is the conclusion: “At the same time, chapter 3 provided evidence that New Zealand does appear to be an outlier in the way it taxes inbound investment. Costs of capital and EMTRs are higher in New Zealand than in most other OECD countries.” 12. Surely the conclusion “does appear to be an outlier” is a key finding and one that merits deep exploration? 13. Given the typically very high quality of IRD policy papers and related processes on matters consistent with its BBLR metaphor these defects cannot be dismissed as accidental. On the other hand, those defects could well be evidence of a ‘Kodak’ moment2 for the Commissioner. Conversation killer 14. I observed earlier that this topic choice was a brave one. I must unfortunately now qualify that it could have been brave. Instead, in its lack of bravery, it comes across as in my view as an unashamed attempt to kill an important conversation. Might yet be saved: 15. First, by dropping BBLR as a unidirectional relic necessitated by a time and tax administration system that is no longer so readily compartmentalised. 15. Second, by developing a more mature metaphor for the role of tax and tax systems in regulating the economy – a metaphor befitting a modern economy and the $1.5b investment in START. As Deirdre McCloskey, author of "The Rhetoric of Economics", says "metaphors are not just a pasted-on ornament ... they're terribly consequential." 16. Third, and mandatory (for impartiality), would be to approach the topic from a wider perspective than tax (i.e. limiting the focus to tax is like analysing liver function whilst ignoring the body of which it is a part – an LTIB put out by the Commissioner must surely deal with the real world not merely first year university tax theory and equivalent level assumptions?)3. Footnotes: 1 Note every occasion where policy papers have identified over-taxation and excused this on the basis of fiscal constraints. 2 An infamous moment when Kodak could have gone on to dominate digital photo technology having invented it but could not follow through to reinvent itself – instead the market did and the rest is history. 3 In line with what at least one submitter on the scoping document recommended.

BusinessNZ took the opportunity to submit on IRD’s previous Document that consulted on its proposal to focus its 2022 Long Term Insights Briefing (LTIB) on tax and its impact on investment and productivity. We agreed on this focus given investment and productivity are important factors affecting long-term living standards in New Zealand. Therefore, we are pleased to see the release of the current Document, and broadly support the LTIB process whereby key future issues are examined by Government Departments every three years. The Document examines a number of potential measures to initiate a process of discussion. We welcome the decision to look at a number of different options, rather than concentrate on only a few that may not provide the broadest spectrum of choices to consider. We agree with the point raised in the Document that there is unlikely to be a single best option, so it is important to consider and rank the best options going forward given it may involve a number of difficult questions and conversations to be had. As we have mentioned previously to IRD, we believe the main challenge for New Zealand will be to ensure that as a small country, it is sufficiently internationally competitive and that the full suite of taxes on individuals and business is not onerous, curtailing growth and/or risk-taking. While we obviously have an interest in taxes affecting the business community, we are also very cognisant of New Zealand’s tax system in general, taking into account that taxes fall on both individuals and 2 entities. A tax system that works well as a total system, with minimal distortions, has the best chance of improving economic growth. We believe the main aim of tax policy is for New Zealand to continue its journey towards achieving a broad-based, low-rate tax system, collecting taxes in the most optimal way possible, and creating minimal disruption for the general population. In terms of this specific Document, we agree with the point made in paragraph 12 that “the aim of this draft LTIB is to start a conversation”. BusinessNZ sees it as the start of a journey towards meaningful change in lowering the costs of capital and improving inbound investment in New Zealand. 1. Setting the Scene Benchmarking and the case for change In our submission on the initial LTIB in September 2021, we noted that Document’s sobering statistics about New Zealand’s current investment an d economic path, which highlight the need for a deeper examination of our investment and productivity challenge. The current Document provides further evidence for the case for change. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 of the current Document that outline foreign direct investment (FDI) and outbound direct investment (ODI) illustrate how far New Zealand lags behind the countries we typically compare ourselves with. We agree that there is unlikely to be a silver bullet to properly address our weak productivity and poor economic performance over a number of years, and believe that a mix of policy changes is required to lift our performance. We believe a fundamental question that IRD needs to ask itself both now and ahead is , ‘W hat would be the tax policy mix that would make a foreign investor look to New Zealand to invest?’ . If this question is kept top of mind when assessing future policy options, we believe there will be a greater chance of ensuring new tax policies int egrate with existing ones to create the best platform for raising investment. A cross-g overnment effort The Document rightly acknowledges the fact that while tax policy is an important element in addressing productivity issues, tax policy alone is not always sufficient in ensuring the best solution. Instead, broader policy settings often need to be examined to ensure policy changes that have the best opportunity for success. BusinessNZ str on gly agrees that regulatory and policy settings will also play a significant role in addressing our productivity and investment concerns. Therefore, we support the publication of LTIBs across key Government departments to promote wider discussion around future policy options. We note that chapter 5 of the Document mentions the 2021 Treasury LTIB that BusinessNZ also submitted on. Given the Treasury LTIB was very much focused on 3 long-term fiscal pressures from the aging population and rising healthcare demand, the link between future options that both Treasury and IRD outline are obvious. Ideally, we would want the collective works of briefings across Government depart ments to be examined to ascertain what broad policy frameworks should be changed and/or introduced. This means Government policy needs to take a coordinated and considered approach, rather than the ad hoc, silo-bound, and often reactionary approach currently evident. Recommendation: That the Government takes a coordinated approach across government to the various LTIBs being produced. Estimated cost of capital In our submission to the Tax Working Group in 2019, we noted that there is significant scope for the Government to conduct some updated research on the dynamic effects of reducing the CTR. While modeling work can only be as good as the structure and information fed into the model, there continued to be a serious hole in terms of research in this area where the Government tends to view changes in a static sense only. We noted that there is every chance that research into the dynamic implications of further reductions in the CTR may provide the greatest broad economic benefits, compared with changes in other direct taxes. We even supported private sector involvement via an economic agency becoming involved to help in the research. Therefore, BusinessNZ is pleased to see that the current Document provides some in- depth modelling (based on OECD work) so as to provide a better understanding of the policy implications of various options. Chapter 3 of the Document provides a useful outline of how New Zealand’s company tax rate and tax depreciation rules likely compare to those in other OECD countries. In an attempt to analyse potential options, we support the modelling work IRD has undertaken on how tax rules can affect the cost of capital. While we acknowledge the caveats placed on the model IRD produced, it nevertheless provides a useful gauge of the likely outcomes of various tax rate changes. We agree with the statement made in paragraph 3.20 of the Document, “... that any economic model is no more than a partial insight. In particular, the OECD model treats the tax rules as certain and assumed to continue forever.” As a number of submitters inc luding BusinessNZ have previously outlined, certainty has been in short supply. Haphazard decision-making that seems to be more political than policy- orientated has left the business community experiencing extreme uncertainty about the direction of Government policy. A clear and consistent policy pathway needs to be shown to entice investors to New Zealand, as opposed to the constant chopping and changing currently being experienced. 4 While we acknowledge the limitations and key assumptions of the OECD model used, table 3.1 summarising the data by country paints a fairly stark picture of where New Zealand currently sits with regard to estimated costs of capital over the four asset classes. A ranking of 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd and 18 th of 38 OECD countries tells us that if the table was ranked by overall ranking instead of alphabetically by country, New Zealand would rank first overall for cost of capital. Unlike paragraph 3.25 which states “The OECD data suggest that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capita l,” we would go a step further and say without question New Zealand has the overall highest costs of capital in the OECD. Furthermore, Paragraph 3.30 points out that, “L ittle difference exists between New Zealand’s costs of capital for the three main types of business investment included in the data ... thus New Zealand’s tax settings appear to be reasonably neutral across these three different aggregate assets.” While this is technically true, it misses the broader point above, that our overall ranking is significantly out of line with most other countries. In short, the neutrality of our tax settings across these assets does nothing to improve our chances of being seen as a viable country for investment. Last, it does not surprise us that the restoration of building depreciation for commercial and industrial property in 2020 reduced the cost of capital for buildings from 4.9% to 4.1%. BusinessNZ strongly objected to the removal of depreciation on these buildings when it was initially discussed in 2010, given it placed New Zealand as a policy outlier with the rest of the world in terms of standard global tax practice. However, it should be pointed out that its reintroduction simply returned New Zealand to what is typically considered normal tax policy settings and cannot really be viewed as a recent proactive policy change to improve our investment competitiveness. 2. Options for the Future The Document considers seven possible tax changes to initiate a process of discussion. For each option, we have included the specific questions asked in the Document, along with our overall thoughts and recommendations regarding their ability to see firms increase their investment in New Zealand. The only overarching point we would like to make regarding the various options is that we have to be careful to avoid ‘paralysis by analysis.’ There are always costs and benefits associated with every policy option. However, the fact that some options would lead to certain costs should not automatically preclude them from consideration. Instead, we would expect that the policy journey to improve firms’ inbound investment would eventually outline concrete options that the public and private sector s broadly view as the best way forward. 5 A. Reducing the Company Tax Rate If New Zealand wished to reduce EMTRs, should reducing the company tax rate be an option to be considered? If governments wanted to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs without reducing the progressivity of the tax system, what accompanying tax changes would you suggest? Would the case for or against company tax rate cuts depend materially on what happens to company tax rates in other countries? If there were a cut in the company tax rate, should there be changes to other tax rates at the same time? Figure 3.1 in the Document highlights how high New Zealand’s company tax rate (CTR) and Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTR) are, compared to not only other small, advanced economies, but also larger advanced economies. Whereas New Zealand once had a very competitive CTR and EMTR, this advantage has eroded over time. BusinessNZ has consistently argued for many years that our broad tax rate settings need to remain competitive to ensure we remain a viable and attractive country to invest and reside in. Unfortunately, we are now at the point where significant decisions need to be made to reverse our failing economic fortunes. Some view the CTR as only one part of the overall assessment when deciding upon investing in a country. However, we believe the CTR is still considered a ‘headline’ rate when initial comparisons across countries are made. Obviously, we would expect any company that is looking to run operations in another country to do their due diligence, which would include examining the wider tax system of a country. Nevertheless, the setting of the CTR can often provide the first ‘look in the room’ regarding competition for foreign investment, with a favourable rate warranting further examination by the company. To undertake a deeper look at costs of capital and EMTRs in New Zealand, we support IRD’s examination into the key set of assets involving commercial and industrial buildings, plant, machinery and equipment, as well as a zero-depreciation asset. Further modelling work that culminates in table 6.1 in the Document shows reductions in the CTR would narrow the range of EMTRs, thus lowering costs of capital for investments that are heavily taxed and reducing tax subsidies for investments that are subsidised. With regard to consistency, paragraphs 6.21 to 6.29 examine the issues of consistency, fairness and efficiency of personal income tax. While BusinessNZ understands the implications around fairness of a tax system that has significantly differing company and personal tax rates, the discussion seems to miss an obvious point that we believe should be addressed. Prior to 1 April 2021, the top personal tax rate was 33%, which represented a 5- percentage point difference between the company tax rate, and a match for the trust 6 rate. The increase in the top personal tax rate to 39% since 1 April 2021 has already led to a significant difference of 11 percentage points between that and the company tax rate. New Zealand now has the largest percentage point differential for some decades. Historically, a gap between the company and the top personal rate can cause distortions and encourage avoidance. We note that paragraph 6.23 does mention that ‘... reducing the company tax rate would exacerbate these gaps unless personal rates were cut at the same time. Cutting personal tax rates may be supported by some future governments but not by others.’ Table 1 below outlines the percentage point difference scenarios for the top personal tax rate at 33% and 39%, along with the three company tax rate options as outlined in chapter 6. Table 1: Top Personal Tax and Company Tax Rate Differentials Top Personal Tax Rate Company Tax Rate Percentage Point Difference 33% 28% 5% 33% 24% 9% 33% 20% 13% 39% 28% 9% 39% 24% 15% 39% 20% 19% This table tells us that a 33% top personal tax rate means more options are available if seeking to lower the company tax rate, and that a cut in one rate should also see a cut in the other. The full tax picture of global comparisons Paragraph 6.25 notes that even with a relatively new top marginal tax rate of 39%, the 11-percentage po int difference between that and the company tax rate is not large compared with other OECD countries. The Document also notes that only six other OECD countries had a smaller gap than this in 2020. However, the Document does not elaborate on the dollar thresholds at which the top personal tax rate kicks in, across the various OECD countries. While Australia has a top personal tax rate of 45% and begins at the same dollar amount as New Zealand’s (AUS$180,000), there are a number of other countries that New Zealand typically compares itself with that have a top personal tax rate that begins at a much higher dollar amount. Therefore, it would be useful for any future consultation work to include analysis of where New Zealand sits regarding the top rate and the threshold where it begins. Paragraph 6.32 outlines the current state of play in Australia, noting a reduction in the company tax rate there would increase incentives for profits to be streamed to Australia. It also points out the two-tiered company tax rate system in Australia, 7 which has a lower 26% rate for small-medium sized companies. While Australia has decided to go down this policy route, in no way would BusinessNZ support New Zealand doing the same, in an attempt to alleviate the issue around gaps in personal versus company tax rates. As we outlined to the Tax Working Group in 2018, a progressive CTR would move New Zealand away from the broad-based low-rate system we support, and in our view would create the unintended consequences outlined by the Tax Working Group. This would most probably lead to gaming via changes in the structures of the larger companies, and move us further away from a flat tax structure. Therefore, any change in the CTR should be a decrease that benefits all businesses. Global trends Paragraph 6.33 notes recent indications that there may be some movement back towards higher CTRs internationally, especially since the COVID- 19 response has led to a weakening fi scal position for many countries. In addition, new international tax frameworks that would result in a global minimum CTR of 15% targeted at income from intangibles may indeed reverse the long downward trend in CTRs that have been ongoing for decades. Ho wever, we believe New Zealand needs to be nimble in its tax policy decisions to ensure it covers every competitive position possible. Alignment is an important factor to consider, but this does not automatically mean increases and decreases in the CTR should be viewed equally. Therefore, if some countries that New Zealand typically compares itself with raise their CTR, there is an argument to be had that we could look to lower ours for competitive purposes. Further analysis could determine if the loss in revenue from the decrease would be outweighed by the overall increase in new business investment. The key point from BusinessNZ’s perspective is that this should be viewed as an opportunity and not a potential threat. As the Document mentions a number of times, New Zealand is a relatively small advanced remote economy that has to regularly compete with much larger co untries that are able to influence global settings. Simply put, what New Zealand does or does not do has a much lesser impact than what ot her countries do that might affect us. For instance, a drop in the CTR to 15% in the USA is, on balance, likely to have a larger effect on New Zealand than what would happen in the USA if we decided to do the same thing. As a small open economy, we should always seek opportunities that present themselves to remain competitive, while ensuring we hold true to the integrity of the tax system. If the future trend is indeed towards higher CTRs, it makes little sense for New Zealand to simply follow that trend. Recommendation: That a decrease in the company tax rate is given the highest priority when examining how to improve New Zealand’s inbound investment. 8 Implications for unincorporated enterprises and domestic SMEs operating as companies Building on the discussion above, BusinessNZ is pleased to see that the document asks an important question regarding whether personal tax rates should be cut at the same time as the company tax rate. The Document takes the view that a reduction in the company tax rate, because of cost of capital concerns, should not provide a case for lower personal taxes. Instead, it should, “... ensure that company income is adequately taxed at the personal level to ensure that company income ends up being taxed at appropriate personal rates”. BusinessNZ understands the point being raised in the Document. However, as we have pointed out, the practical implications of a company tax rate at say 20 or 24% and the continuation of a top personal tax rate of 39% does open a significant differential between the two rates. There is no doubt that this would move New Zealand further away from its traditional broad-based low-rate tax system. From our perspective, any serious consideration involving a reduction in the CTR should also take into account a reduction in the top personal tax rate to ensure ongoing integrity of the tax system. Recommendation: That a decrease in the company tax rate is accompanied by a decrease in the top personal tax rate to ensure New Zealand retains its broad-based low-rate tax system. Should future company tax rate cuts be signalled in advance? In principle, BusinessNZ supports steps that provide improved settings for business, and certainly around the policy path ahead. If the Government decided to cut the company tax rate, we would broadly support the move. Unfortunately, we note that, especially in recent times, politics have played too great a part in tax rate changes. Examples include announcements of tax cuts that have ended up not occurring. We have no problem with political parties announcing what changes they will make as part of their taxation policy heading into a General Election. However, we have seen in recent years the practice of an incumbent Government passing legislation to reduce personal tax rates etc, but for these not to be enacted till after the election. This strikes us as purely distractive electioneering, rather than a genuine attempt towards best tax policy practice. Often, there is very little reason for such changes to have to wait till after an election to be enacted. Recommendation: That future tax rate cuts are both signalled and enacted within a Government’s political term. 9 B. Accelerated Depreciation If New Zealand wished to reduce EMTRs, should accelerated deprecia tion be considered as an option? If accelerated depreciation measures are considered, should these be restricted to new investments or available for both new and existing investments? If accelerated depreciation measures, or other measures that increase the present value of depreciation deductions, are considered, are there reasons to prefer depreciation loading, partial expensing or some other scheme? While the Document points out that Australia introduced a partial expensing scheme as part of its response to COVID-19, we believe any re- introduction on this side of the Tasman should be based on long-term tax policy planning, rather than one-of f economic shocks such as COVID-19. Given the on again/off again history of accelerated depreciation in New Zealand, we believe there needs to be a willingness across the policy and political spectrum to see its return. This would help minimise the incidence of chopping and chan ging as noted above. BusinessNZ submitted to the Government as part of the 2009/2010 Tax Working Group review, saying we were not convinced that the options of reducing the loading figure or removing it, were the best steps forward for raising productivity levels, given the 20% addition to depreciation claims was introduced to encourage investment in income-producing assets. In addition, the savings for the Government by way of changing the policy was estimated to be around $0.3B, which in the scale of the Review seemed a punitive policy change for little gain. Therefore, we placed the options of removing or reducing loading as one of the ‘least supported’ as part of the review. We were disappointed the Government at that time decided to remove accelerated depreciation. We have continued to hold the view that some sort of return to the pre-2010 policy of a 20% loading for purchases of new machinery and equipment should be allowed. One option outlined in the Document sees accelerated depreciation being restricted to new assets only, which would mean that firms owning depreciable assets on the day a new scheme came into force would not benefit from a higher deprecation rate on these assets. While BusinessNZ sympathises with those businesses who would be caught in the time period where no accelerated depreciation on new assets were allowed, we generally agree with the point made in the Document that if the policy was implemented to incentivise investment, there would seem little reason to allow it on investments that have already taken place. Recommendation: That some form of accelerated depreciation is reintroduced in New Zealand. 10 The analysis undertaken in the Document shows that both forms of accelerated depreciation (depreciation loading and partial expensing) reduce some of the higher costs of capital and EMTRs. In ter ms of which specific measure should be considered in the future, the Document believes depreciation loading would be better targeted at reducing costs of capital and EMTRs on the most heavily taxed depreciable assets. However, it should also be pointed out that partial expensing provides a significant benefit to all depreciating assets. While BusinessNZ does not have any strong views regarding deprecation loading vs partial expensing, our interest is more geared towards having an overall accelerated depreciatio n scheme that best facilitates increased inbound investment, while still ensuring the general elements of good tax policy are maintained. Therefore, we are open to not only the two options outlined, but also the possibility of other options that may be suggested through the submission process. Recommendation: That the scheme for the reintroduction of accelerated depreciation is predicated on the best options to improve inbound investment, while maintaining good tax policy practice. C. Indexation Might comprehensive indexation of the tax base, including indexation of interest, depreciation and trading stock, be worth considering further and does the answer depend on future inflation and interest rates? Might partial indexation of the tax base, including indexation of depreciation deductions or indexation of both depreciation deductions and trading stock, be worth considering further and does the answer depend on future inflation and interest rat es? The two questions above examine the issue from either a comprehensive or partial indexation of the tax base. In principle, BusinessNZ is not against the idea of further consideration of indexation. If we were to look at personal taxes, we believe there is every justification to regularly index the personal tax rate thresholds. Although the Document clearly states that what it is examining here is different from the idea of inflation-indexing personal income tax thresholds, in many ways the same logic applies. Therefore, we see no reason why such measures should not be considered for other areas of tax policy. However, as the Document rightly points out, complexity and practicality need to be taken into account when considering indexation. The fact that no other OECD country has comprehensively indexed their own tax system illustrates the potentially fraught compliance path ahead. Any steps taken in this space need to be well thought-through. 11 In relation to the current IRD Discussion Paper entitled The Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand, the way in which New Zealand administers its tax administration in a digital setting is very much open for change, with the private sector most likely becoming a key partner. Therefore, over time, there is every possibility that advances in technology and the increased use of private-sector software may present indexation as a viable option for a number of areas. However, that is a conversation still in its infancy, begging the question of whether indexation is an option for the near-term, or more appropriately the medium-or longer-term. Comprehensive or partial indexation? The Document asks for views on whether a comprehensive or partial index is the best way forward. Given our expectation of further policy work on digital tax administration in the foreseeable future, we are conscious of not putting the cart before the horse in terms of which option would best work for improving the neutrality of the tax system. This is perhaps a question better asked at a later date. How do these measures compare with other ways of reducing higher EMTRs and reducing current tax distortions? In comparison with other measures, we believe some of the other options outlined in the Document would be more appropriate to pursue at this time. However, this does not mean we should simply discard indexation as a viable option in the near future. As mentioned above, the speed at which the private and public sectors can collaborate to create products serving the specific needs of taxpayers will determine whether indexation can be introduced efficiently and effectively in the short-, medium-, or long-term. Recommendation: That indexation is given further consideration at a future date when the relevant digital technology is at a sufficient level for this to occur. D. Incentives for Specific Businesses or Industries Are there specific businesses or industries where spillovers are large enough to justify lower tax rates? Are there specific businesses or industries where economic rents are large enough to justify higher tax rates to fund lower general business tax rates? Are there any other arguments for specific incentives? As mentioned in the Document, “T he main objective of this policy option is to favour specific industries or activities where it is believed there will be too little of these industries or activities without an incentive.” Overall, BusinessNZ does not support incentives for specific businesses or industries. We have strongly supported New Zealand’s broad-based low-rate system, which has served the country well over many decades. The use of incentives is 12 effectively ‘picking winners,’ which historically no Government has ever been able to do properly. We believe that once tax incentives are considered, this opens a Pandora’s Box of concerns about what incentives should be introduced. We concur with the view expressed in the McLeod review and mentioned in the Document, that arguments for favourable tax treatment due to positive externalities or other benefits can become a platform for practically any lobbyist’s reform agenda. As overseas evidence has shown over many years, there is no doubt the introduction of incentives distorts the market and creates its own set of problems requiring attention. BusinessNZ would strongly object to any further consideration being given to the option of incentives for specific businesses or industries. Recommendation: That the LTIB does not consider the future use of incentives for specific businesses or industries. E. Dual Income Tax System Is a dual income tax worth consid ering further as a way of allowing costs of capital and EMTRs to be reduced? Would a dual income tax be worth considering as a way of reducing distortions in the way that different forms of savings are taxed? Would a dual income tax be an attractive or unattractive measure on progressivity grounds? Is a dual income tax only worth considering in the future if it becomes harder to tax capital income at high marginal tax rates? BusinessNZ is not against the idea of examining other countries’ tax systems to ascertain whether part or all of them could be introduced in New Zealand. It is important that the fundamental structures of New Zealand’s tax base are examined from time to time to ensure they are the best fit for the competitiveness of the country. Specifically, the dual income tax systems adopted by Nordic countries have been discussed for some time now, including as far back as 2009 when examining New Zealand tax reform. As the Document rig htly points out, the introduction of a dual income tax system would represent a complex tax change and would present many detailed issues to work through. Therefore, if this was given serious consideration, there would have to be clear and unequivocal net benefits for New Zealand given our overall need for increased investment and reduced cost of capital. Investigating a dual income tax system would require addressing a number of fundamental issues, such as New Zealand’s use of transfer payments (including Working for Families), along with how high we would need to increase personal tax 13 rates (and other taxes such as GST) to compensate for a low tax rate on capital income. While a dual income tax system may directly address some of the concerns we share around how to improve inbound investment in New Zealand, we believe that this option is not one that should be given first priority. From our perspective, this option represents the most radical solution, which should only be considered once other policy mechanisms have received consideration. Recommendation: That a dual income tax system is only considered further when other tax setting options have been investigated for the improvement of inbound investment into New Zealand. F. Thin Capitalisation and Allowance for Corporate Equity Would it be sensible for the tax rules to be as neutral as possible between foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment or are there good grounds to promote one form of investment over another? If so, what should be promoted and why? Is the current 60% thin capitalisation safe harbour broadly reasonable? If not, should it be increased or decreased? If problems of integration with personal taxes could be resolved, would an ACE be a viable tax reform option if governments wish to reduce EMTRs and make investment decisio ns more neutral? Are there viable ways of integrating an ACE with personal taxes and, if so, what are they? If an ACE system were to be introduced, would it be viable to levy a tax on firms with negative equity? If not, would the neutrality properties of the tax be sufficiently compromised for this to be an unattractive option? The two remaining areas for change involve thin capitalisation and an allowance for corporate equity. Regarding the former, BusinessNZ believes further investigation into the optio n of increasing the safe harbour threshold is warranted, given we believe there is potential for the benefits to outweigh the drawbacks if comprehensive future research is undertaken. Interestingly, the last time the Government made a change to the safe harbour threshold for inbound investment was following the Tax Working Group review of 2009/10. At that time, IRD considered the 75% safe harbour was too generous and encouraged multinationals to over-allocate debt, rather than equity, to New Zealand. Therefore, from the 2011-12 income tax year it was reduced to 60%. The decrease in the safe harbour was also one way of making a fiscal gain given other tax changes at that time created a fiscal cost. 14 In our submission at that time to the 2009/10 Tax Working Group, we noted that lowering the safe harbour threshold from 75% to 60% could lead to more questions than answers and urged caution. The IRD paper recommending the drop did not specify the net benefit from reducing the threshold. The figure of 75% was essentially arbitrary, based on judgment and compromise, and so the reduction was one of the least supported options by BusinessNZ at that time. Now in 2022, the discussion has returned to the possibility of returning tax settings to previous levels. While we have no stro ng view as to what a revised safe harbour threshold should be, the fact that we did not support the decrease in 2010 indicates that on balance, we favour it increasing. Also, if this is considered a viable option in the future, we encourage IRD undertake greater sensitivity analysis around a revised safe harbour threshold, including how it would sit with other possible future changes to improve inbound investment. Recommendation: That the option of increasing the thin capitalisation safe harbour for inbound investment includes further sensitivity analysis regarding what an optimal threshold level should be. Regarding the option of allowance for corporate equity, the Document states that this, “... would be an option that would reduce the cost of capital on inbound investment without inducing firms to take on additional debt finance and apply to a much broader set of inbound investment.” While the Document do es a good job of laying out the theoretical model, it also highlights some significant practical obstacles to overcome, including how it would properly integrate with personal taxes. While BusinessNZ is not against this as a future option, we believe greater weight should be placed on other potential changes first, to ascertain whether they would provide a better pathway towards improving firms’ inbound investment in New Zealand. Recommendation: That the option of allowance for corporate equity is not considered at this time. 3. In Summary: Ranking of Options Table 2 below ranks the most preferred options through to those that should not be considered. BusinessNZ believes a reduction in the company tax rate and accelerated depreciation are two options of immediate benefit, while most of the remaining options will require further in-depth investigation and consultation. Of the seven options, we place incentives for specific businesses or industries last and prefer no further work be carried out in this space. 15 Table 2: Prioritisation of Options Future Options Ranking Reducing the company tax rate Most preferred Accelerated depreciation Worth further investigation Thin capitalisation Worth further investigation Indexation To be considered in the future Allowance for corporate equity Possible consideration for the future Dual income tax system Possible consideration for the future Incentives for specific businesses or industries Should not be considered Thank you for the opportunity to comment, and we look forward to further developments in this space.

PUB-04 PO Box 473, Wellington 6140 New Zealand tel. + 64 4 260 2230 fa x. + 64 9 921 6001 www.maynewetherell.com 22 April 2022 By email LTIB first draft c/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Submission on Inland Revenue's Draft Long-term Insights Briefing Introduction 1. Thank you for the opportunity to submit on Inland Revenue’s Draft Long-term Insights Briefing: Tax, Foreign Investment and Productivity (Draft LTIB). 2. The Draft LTIB is primarily concerned with the broad tax settings affecting foreign investment, including questions as to the tax rate, depreciation rates and thin capitalisation settings. These settings will affect the cost of capital for investment into New Zealand, as the Draft LTIB explains. 3. This submission focuses on how legislative design, and the way tax settings are implemented, may also affect incentives for firms to invest into New Zealand. As the Draft LTIB states (at \[3.20\]): Complexity of legislation and compliance costs may ... have a negative impact on investment, especially if these cause foreign investors to question whether it is worth finding out if investing into New Zealand would be a good idea. If different rules apply to different types of firms, this can add to the complexity. Summary of submission 4. It is appropriate for the Draft LTIB to recognise the complexity of tax legislation, and associated compliance costs, as potentially having a negative impact on foreign investment. We elaborate on that proposition in this submission, drawing on what we have observed in practice in advising foreign investors. 5. We submit that the Long-term Insights Briefing, when finalised, should: (a) recognise generally (as paragraph 3.20 of the Draft LTIB does) that the way tax laws are implemented and the legislation drafted may have a negative impact on foreign investment; 2971583-1 – Submission on Inland Revenue's Draft Long–term Insights Briefing 1 (b) note that, other things being equal, legislative rules and tests that depart from international norms or conflict with principles set out in double tax agreements to which New Zealand is party, will be more likely to have such a negative impact; and (c) note that tax regimes such as the hybrid and branch mismatch rules (Anti-hybrids Rules), which make the tax treatment of amounts paid by a New Zealand branch or entity dependent upon an investigation of chains of payments within a multinational group and the tax treatment of those payments outside New Zealand, impose especially high compliance costs on New Zealand businesses and may disincentivise investments from particular countries. Examples illustrating effect of complexity of legislation and associated compliance costs on foreign investment Approach 6. We acknowledge that it may be more difficult to model the impact on foreign investment of the complexity of legislation and associated compliance costs than (for example) the impact of tax rates or thin capitalisation limits. It is, nonetheless, possible to identify that there is likely to be such an impact, and value in documenting this impact in the finalised Long-term Insights Briefing. 7. In many recent tax law reform initiatives, prescriptive or bright-line rules have been proposed in place of the enforcement of existing less prescriptive rules. It has been argued that the existing law is difficult for Inland Revenue to enforce, and that more prescriptive rules will be less resource-intensive for Inland Revenue. This was one aspect of the justification for enacting the restricted transfer pricing rules (Restricted TP Rules), which we discuss below. 1 8. The argument that more prescriptive rules will be less resource-intensive has a superficial attractiveness, at least from Inland Revenue’s viewpoint. The cost of fact-intensive disputes is highly visible, even if the number of cases that are disputed is a tiny fraction of all cases in which the rules are applied. On the other hand, if the costs to taxpayers of complying with the more prescriptive rules is greater than their costs would have been under the existing law, that cost is unlikely to be visible (at least from Inland Revenue’s viewpoint), yet that increased compliance cost may affect all taxpayers who have to apply the rules, not just the fraction who would otherwise find themselves in dispute. 9. Seeking to better understand what features of legislative design drive higher compliance costs for taxpayers is therefore likely to be of value. It may help to guide decisions as to how future tax reforms should be implemented, and should help to counter the superficial attractiveness of the assumption that rules that are less resource-intensive for Inland Revenue are necessarily the lowest compliance cost option for New Zealand as a whole. Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, Commentary on the Bill, at pages 10 and 11. Eg, at page 11: “It can be difficult for Inland Revenue to challenge such arrangements under the transfer pricing rules as the taxpayer is typically able to identify a comparable arm’s length arrangement that has similar conditions and a similarly high interest rate.” And, at page 11: “Transfer pricing disputes can take years to resolve and can have high costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue.” 2971583-1 – Submission on Inland Revenue's Draft Long–term Insights Briefing 1 2 10. In this submission, we discuss two examples (being the Restricted TP Rules and the Anti- hybrids Rules). Both examples concern rules that affect the tax treatment of cross-border transactions and therefore have the potential to affect foreign investment into New Zealand. Example one: Restricted TP Rules 11. The Restricted TP Rules (sections GC 15 to GC 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007) apply to certain cross-border related party debt. The rules can require that debt to be priced ignoring certain features (such as subordination or a term exceeding five years), and based on an assumed credit rating rather than the borrower’s actual credit rating. Consequently, the rules will commonly result in the permitted rate of interest for New Zealand tax purposes being less than the arm’s length rate determined under ordinary principles. 12. This outcome gives rise to at least two difficulties for foreign investors contemplating an investment in New Zealand that involves cross-border related party loans. Both difficulties arise from the fact that New Zealand’s Restricted TP Rules depart from international norms: (a) The first difficulty is that the Restricted TP Rules expose investors to the possibility of double taxation. If New Zealand allows a deduction for (say) 5%, but the lender is required to recognise income based on the actual arm’s length rate (say, 6%), the 1% difference is in effect taxed twice. It also results in additional advisory costs in New Zealand and the other relevant jurisdiction. (b) The second difficulty is the cost to the prospective investor of understanding New Zealand’s Restricted TP Rules. Prior to the enactment of the Restricted TP Rules, an advisor explaining the effect of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules to a prospective investor could do so easily: the rules limited a deduction to an arm’s length amount. Sophisticated investors were familiar with this internationally recognised concept. The arm’s length principle has, in particular, been reflected in double tax agreements, which foreign investors rely on as a source of predictability as to the tax consequences of a cross-border investment. Explaining the Restricted TP Rules to such an investor, however, is obviously more difficult and therefore more costly (in terms of advisory costs as well as management time required to understand unfamiliar rules). In addition, in our experience, investors tend to be less comfortable working with regimes that depart from international norms to which they are accustomed. Example two: Anti-hybrids Rules 13. The Anti-hybrids Rules in subpart FH of the Income Tax Act 2007 were intended to implement recommendations in two OECD reports to counter mismatches in the characterisation of entities or transactions as between the tax laws of different countries. Such differences in the characterisation of an entity or transaction are not uncommon, especially in arrangements involving the United States of America (which is one of New Zealand’s largest trading and investment partners). 14. The Anti-hybrids Rules are highly complex. Aspects of the rules refer to, and must be read with, the OECD reports, which together run to more than 500 pages. Not all countries have 2971583-1 – Submission on Inland Revenue's Draft Long–term Insights Briefing 3 implemented the OECD reports, and those that have done so have sometimes included exceptions or other measures to reduce complexity and compliance costs. New Zealand, in contrast, has sought to implement the reports comprehensively. Unlike the arm’s length principle in the transfer pricing context, there is no international norm as to the tax consequences of hybrid arrangements. 15. One rule that is especially complex is section FH 11, the imported mismatch rule. The imported mismatch rule may disallow a deduction for an otherwise deductible payment by a New Zealand entity if that payment is relevantly connected with a hybrid mismatch that arises in one or more other countries that do not have their own rules to counteract hybrid mismatch arrangements. Section FH 11 therefore may result in disallowance of a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand subsidiary in a multinational group because that payment can be traced or linked to some other payment, elsewhere in the group, which results in a hybrid mismatch between two other countries. 16. The rule can therefore require New Zealand resident entities that are part of a multinational group to trace payments for which a deduction is claimed in New Zealand within the group, and to obtain information regarding the tax treatment of those other payments that do not involve New Zealand. We are aware of New Zealand businesses having decided not to contract with related entities in jurisdictions in which a hybrid mismatch might arise, even though the lowest cost (pre-tax) option is to do so, in order to avoid the compliance costs and risks associated with the imported mismatch rule. Such practices, if common across an industry, will likely result in increased costs to consumers. Conclusion 17. The examples outlined above illustrate that rules that are complex, especially in a way that departs from international norms, or that are especially onerous to comply with, have the potential to be a barrier to foreign investment into New Zealand. It is appropriate that the finalised Long-term Insights Briefing record that these features of tax legislation may have such an effect, so that that can be taken into account in considering the legislative design for future tax reforms and the merits of simplification measures in relation to existing rules.

LTIB Draft Response 26 April 2022 If the objective is to ensure tax has no impact on marginal FDI, the obvious answer is that no tax should be imposed on FDI. The LTIB Draft does not go that far. However, it would be useful to establish and state a target acceptable impact of tax on FDI. This will make it easier to assess the impact of tax on certain scenarios and also to consider policy solutions. The model – convert to financial statement format Despite a former Minister of Finance’s response to a complaint regarding the use of formulae, “you should be able to understand it”, I consider the model used is not readily accessible. The work to solve the equations and understand what they are doing to test the assumptions and conclusion is considerable. Economists and some others are used to doing this work. More readily accessible language is that of financial statements – balance sheets, profit and loss (with attendant tax calculations) and cashflows. The model should be converted to this format and be made available for consideration. I appreciate this may not be simple to do. IR should therefore take a collaborative approach to developing this version of the model. It does not have to produce a definitive version, simply a version which can be tested and considered and improved where necessary. Clearly stating this as its approach should enable a ready response to any reaction which says the model is wrong (when first published). (Some of) the model’s assumptions The model has assumptions (as it must). Some are simplifying, others are derived from observation. I comment on a few: • The level of gearing is based on observed levels of debt in the economy. However, the modelled scenario, as I understand it, is not one represented in the observed levels. The model assumes a declining level of revenue over the expected life of the investment to match the declining value of the investment. In that scenario, I would expect the investment to be geared to the allowable thin capitalization level at the start of the investment and for debt to be repaid in step with the declining value of the investment (to maintain the maximum level of debt allowed). I would expect the tax impact on cost of capital to be lower than produced by the assumption made. I would also expect that to be more realistic. (I have separate comments on the observed levels of debt and the impact of inflation.) • The draft notes that it is not possible to determine the effect of the restricted transfer pricing (RTP) rules. That is a gap that should be remedied. IR has completed international questionnaires on the impact of the RTP rules (amongst others). There is also practical experience of the application of those rules which I suggest would show something in the order of 66% of an arms-length rate is allowed under the RTP Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: TinTaxNZ@icloud.com. This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. LTIB Draft Response 26 April 2022 rules. As the RTP rules do not allow an arms-length rate of interest for related party borrowing, they must in principle increase the cost of capital. • The model appears to assume that AIL is deductible while NRWT is not. For an NZ taxpayer subject to the financial arrangement rules, both would be deducted as a matter of course. In either case, whether or not there is a gross up clause, AIL and NRWT would be included in the cashflows from the loan financial arrangement and would be treated as interest expense. (The thin capitalisation rules and RTP may of course limit the allowable deductible but that does not seem to be the assumption being made.). The reasons for this assumption should be made clear or corrected. Observed level of debt Unlike the modelled scenario (with declining revenues), the observed levels of debt will be for businesses which expect to grow. Further, the initial investment will likely be historical. The observed level of debt and therefore the cost of capital calculated is an ex post and not an ex ante calculation. This can be justified as a cost of capital if the growth is seen to be financed by additional capital investment through retained earnings (i.e. each year a decision is made to reinvest profits). This means the observed levels of debt and the resulting cost of capital will be the result of multiple marginal investments made. Of interest therefore should be whether the tax system or other factors mean that the additional investment is made as an equity and not a geared investment. As above, the observed level of debt, is unlikely to be what would be done in practice for a known declining level of investment. A more realistic scenario should therefore be included in the modelled calculations of the cost of capital. Impact of inflation The model results show inflation as having the most impact on the cost of capital. As a policy response to address the impact of inflation would be substantial and technical, testing this impact is critical. Some comments: • An accounting model version of the model would show the assumptions made more readily. These can be more widely tested. • If prices are assumed to rise with inflation (as many contracts would allow a CPI adjustment), an investor can be expected to still have a cost of CPI x CIT. It is not clear that this is the only reason the model is showing a higher cost of capital for inflation (i.e. does the revenue decline reduce for inflation to reflect a CPI adjusted increase) . Note that I assume this is the tax cost of inflation as the deduction for the Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: TinTaxNZ@icloud.com. This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. LTIB Draft Response 26 April 2022 original investment does not change under current tax settings. Accordingly, any CPI adjusted revenue would be fully taxable. • Further, given reported increased business profits in the current inflation environment, businesses may be able to mitigate the impact of tax by other measures (including raising prices at a rate greater than inflation.). This alternative, to a tax policy response, should be considered and researched (i.e. is a tax policy response required at all because other mitigations will reduce the tax impact). Dual income systems I have not focused on this possible policy response. However, I note there are proposals to further integrate company and personal tax through the taxation of sale of shares. The comments in that discussion document imply further integration rather than less. This is likely to be at odds with a dual income system. Observed investment The message from the Draft is that New Zealand’s cost of capital is higher than other countries. Despite that there is FDI. Does this mean that any effort to reduce the cost of capital is unnecessary? It may be unnecessary because there are no additional investments to be made? These questions should be addressed before considering policy responses. The impact of the home investor’s tax and OECD measures My reading of the Draft is the focus is on New Zealand’s tax system and its impact on cost of capital. As the Draft rightly notes, the availability of credits and exemptions affects the total cost of capital for an FDI investor. Credits and exemptions may be available at different levels of the investment chain. For example, a credit for NRWT may be available for interest income derived by the FDI investor who makes a loan. It is however rarely available to the ultimate portfolio investor in the FDI investor (i.e. a shareholder in an FDI investor company will be taxed on profits distributed as dividends without any credit for NRWT on the components of the profit distributed.). Further, an exemption (full or partial) may be available through the FDI investor using particular features of a tax regime (e.g. using a share buyback to distribute excess cash rather than paying a dividend). Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: TinTaxNZ@icloud.com. This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. LTIB Draft Response 26 April 2022 These effects have historically meant that a lower effective tax rate in New Zealand (and elsewhere) are optimal for an FDI investor. It is worth modelling the home country effects of New Zealand FDI for the ultimate FDI investor. This should inform the possible policy responses. However, we note the Pillar 1 and 2 responses proposed for the Inclusive Framework countries by the OECD. These proposals will not affect all FDI investors – they will not all be covered by one or both of the proposals. However, a minimum tax may alter behaviour. This should also be modelled. Economic equivalence and capital gains Broadly, the differences to an expected tax cost of capital are due to tax applying to a different result than the economic one. (For example, the effect of debt reduces the cost of capital because an equity investment is treated as a debt investment. The effect of inflation is due to nominal and not real returns being taxed.) I take from this that the “standard” is the measure of tax against the real economic return. As the Draft acknowledges, the model does not account for capital gains, It is not clear why the OECD model, from which the Draft’s is derived, does not account for capital gains taxes. The expectation is that taking into account capital gains taxes would show a lower cost of capital for New Zealand than other countries. If so, not modelling capital gains may miss an opportunity to show that New Zealand’s tax regime is competitive. However, it may also be the case that the effect of participation and non-resident exemptions mean that capital gains taxes do not apply to FDI into other countries. (For example, using Australia, a non-resident selling shares is generally exempt from Australia’s capital gains tax unless the shares constitute Taxable Australian Real Property (“TARP”). Equally, exemptions may apply when an Australian sells a foreign investment. This issue should be addressed as the LTIB project is progressed as the tax effect of capital gains should be an important part of the FDI decision. General comment The above implies on-going analysis and discussion. I encourage IR to continue its work through formal and informal consultation before it finalizes its LTIB.

PUB-06 Corporate Taxpayers Group 29 April 2022 LTIB topics c/o David Carrigan Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON 6140 Dear David Tax, Foreign Investment and Productivity: Draft Long-Term Insights Briefing Introduction In its submissio n on 6 September 2021, t he Corporate Taxpayers Group ("the Group") supported Inland Revenue scoping its curre nt Long-Term Insights Briefing ("LTIB"). The Group cons iders the LTIB process to be a valuable one a nd supports continu ing t his process. We have been a sked for feedback o n the draft LTIB. Our overall feedback is that the Group struggle s to understand the focus ofthe d raft LTIB. Paragraph 1 of t he Execut ive Summary states that t he draft LTIB: "Examines how New Zealand tax settings are likely to affect incentives for firms to invest into New Zealand and benchmarks New Zealand tax settings against those in othercountries." This seems to be a focus on the taxation of inbound investment and w hether t his is increasing the cost of capital, reducing investment, and thus lowering potential productivity and wages. However, paragraph 9 of t he Executive Summary states that the a im of t he draft LTIB is to initiate a process of discussion on whether to change our tax settings more generally a nd "how best to change it if change is deemed desirable". It then lists possib le changes for cons ideration with detailed quest io ns of views on each of these: • Acut in the company tax rate • Accelerated depreciation provisio ns • Inflati on indexation of t he tax base • A higher thin capitalisation rule safe harbour • An allowance for corporate equity • Specia l industry-specific or firm-specific incentives • A dual i ncome tax system. Contact the CTG: We note the views in this document are a reflection of the views c/o Robyn Walke r, Deloitte ofthe Corporate Taxpayers Group and do not necessarily reflect PO Box 1990 the views of individual members. Wellington 6140, New Zealand DDI: 04 470 3615 Emai l: robwalker@deloitte.co.nz CTG - Submission on LTIB 29 April 2022 Page 2 of 10 This seems a much wider focus t ha n the p reviously stated focus o n i nbound investment. We term the above broader tax policy settings in contrast to the narrower tax policy settings on how New Zealand taxes inbound investment. The rationa le for this focus o n broader tax policy settings seems to be based on the argument advanced in t he draft LTIB that a lthough New Zealand has high effective margina l tax rates (EMTRs) o n i nbound investment as measured by OECD and s imilar studies, actual EMTRs on particular investments are highly variable a nd in some cases a re much lower than the data for EMTRs on inbound investment suggests and may even be negative. A general lowering of EMTRs on inbound investment may therefore not be welfa re enha ncing. Reform may be better focused o n t he broader tax policy settings by trying for more uniform (and positive) EMTRs across the board. If this is the argument being advanced, it would assist ongoing dia logue if that were clearer. The Group would support reforms to the broader tax policy settings t hat would increase investment in a way that improves productivity and is welfare enhancing to the extent these are cons istent with the Group's (4 C's) principl es of: High certainty a nd low business risk Low compliance costs Positive contribution of tax to society Internatio na l competitiveness with our major trading partners and competitors, especially Australia. Some of t he measures suggested for consideration (such as a cut in t he corporate tax rate) seem justified on this basis. However, the measures have potent ia l ramifications for the tax system and more detailed analysis seems necessary before the Group could come to a definitive view on them. For example, as the d raft LTIB recognises, comprehensive indexation of t he tax base ra ises numerous issues. The Group supports developing a p rocess where reform of these broader tax settings can be discussed with a vi ew to improving productivity. The Group does not, however, consider t hat this should be at t he cost of not giving consideration to the evidence o n how current policy discourages inbound investment. While there are caveats and gaps in our knowledge and data, t he Group submits that the economic theory a nd the evidence in the draft LTIB strongly support a policy direction of lowering tax o n i nbound investment, so as to lower t he cost of capital, increase investment and thus enhance productivity and wages. However, the Group believes that recent policy changes have been consistently increasing tax o n i nbound investment. Consideration of measures to reduce the variability of EMTRs in the broader policy setting can be advanced in tandem with measures that reflect a change of d irection so that tax policy a ims to attract inbound investment instead of penalising it fo r fiscal gain at every opportunity. What t he Group is suggesting is that t he LTIB be used to develop a process whereby the strategic directio n of tax policy is established in a way that accords with national welfare a nd is clear, pragmatic, reasonably simple and consistently forms the basis of advice Officials provide to government. We consider this is very achievable and something New Zeala nd had in the past but has now been lost. The number of incoherent ad hoc policy announcements we now see is testimony to that. Adopting a clear and pragmatic approach to t he taxation of inbound investment would be a good place to start. This seems like ly to mean rolling back some of t he international tax measur es adopted over the past few years . We do agree, however, that consideration should also be g iven to t he broader tax policy settings. CTG - Submission on LTIB 29 April 2022 Page 3 of 10 The Group's reading of t he draft LTIB is that it sets out three categories of issues: 1. The impact on investment a nd productivity ofthe hig h EMTRs New Zeala nd has o n capital in general and inbound investment in particular. 2. Issues with t he a lig nment of the company tax rate and personal tax rates and the ro le of capital gains tax in buttressing misalignment. 3. The tax treatment of particula r types of investment - depreciation, indexation, a nd specific tax concessions. The Group recogni ses that these can be viewed as related issues. Hig h tax rates on capital can be reduced by a r eductio n in the company tax rate but that gives rise to misalig nment of t he company and personal rates. Alternatively high tax rates can be reduced by more generous tax rules o n over-taxed types of investment (depreciation, indexation, and concessio ns) but that can lead to more variable rates depending on types of investment unless the more favourable tax treatment is limited to those types of investment facing highest rates. While recogn ising these relationships, a more constructive d ia logue on future tax policy settings seems more likely to be obtained by a more structured discussion. In ourview this involves: • Establishing that our EMTRs on capital i n general a nd inbound investment are too hig h. Pragmatic policies to reduce those rates should be advanced to the extent feasible . This could involve rolling back some recent measures to increase EMTRs. • The above would include considering more generous depreciation rates and measures successfully adopted by other countries to reduce tax on investment. • A policy goal of al ig nment of company and personal rates is a barrier to initiatives that might otherwise be pursued and t he need for a lignment and the extent t he tax system can efficiently and fairly operate with a lower company tax rate should be explored. As a final general comment, if the final LTIB is to canvass broader tax policy settings, then i t would seem useful to d iscuss this in the context of Treasury's paper "Looking to t he Future - New Zealand's Long-Term Fiscal Challenges". Th at paper envisaged a n i ncreasing levelof taxatio n being required to fund increasing gove rnment expend iture. In t he Group's submissio n on the Treasury paper we noted note t hat a ny materia l increase in the overall tax burden is likely to put pressure on the robust and sound tax system based o n income tax and GST we currently have. The Group concluded: "In any such reconfiguration of tax policy settings t he Group's view is t hat priorit ies s hould be consistent with the policy objective of a tax system that is conducive to increased domestic and i nternational investment in New Zealand business with increased productivity from that investment. In particular: • The company tax r ate should be at a n internationally competitive level. • The tax rules need to be designed so as to attract inbound fore ign investment • We need to avoid high personal tax rates that d iscourage or impose high costs on the employment of internationally mobile skills." The Group considers these points relevant to t he broader tax setting issues raised by the draft LTIB. CTG - Submission on LTIB 29 April 2022 Page 4 of 10 The Group has no comment on the methodology used to calculate EMTRs, leaving t hat to those with expertise in that area. The Evidence as to the EMTRs New Zealand Levies on Inbound Investment The d raft LTIB clearly present s t he evidence that New Zealand has gone from having internatio nally a relatively l ow corporate tax rate to a hig h corporate tax rate (page 10). It a lso shows that relative to other countries our EMTRs on inbound investment are now h ig h (page 28). This p resents a clear message t hat New Zealand is a highly taxed country that in tax terms is not attra ctive to fore ign investors . The d raft LTIB suggests we should compare ourselves with other small, advanced economies when considering our internatio na l competitiveness. The Group agrees noting New Zeala nd is geogra p hically distanced from foreign in vestors and t ra d ing partners . Tax barriers seem more important to small economies trying to attract the sort of investment that advanced economies need to lift productivity. In generalan MNE will want to invest in USA and China. Those countries also offer economies of scale making detailed investment analysis on potential investments cost-effective. New Zealand has to stand out. A message t hat we choose not to be internationally competitive in our tax settings sends a very clear adverse message. The draft LTIB demonstrates that by comparison with other small, advanced economies New Zealand stands out -but for t he wrong r easons. We a re the highest taxing of s uch economies by a significant margin (page 31). Finally, the d raft LTIB usefully extends t he no rmal OECD EMTR analysis to consider some recent quite micro changes to tax policy settings - such as changes to t hin capitalisation, AIL and NRWT ru les (Chapter 4). It co ncludes that these have further increased the EMTRs New Zeala nd levies, making us an even less desirable place to invest in. Despite t he above, the draft LTIB does not seem to conclude that our policy settings in this area a re wrong. This seems to be because it points to investments w here in t heory EMTRs on foreign investment can be much l ower than the OECD type models capture . An example given i s an appreciating asset w here costs are expensed a nd that is financed by interest bearing debt in times of moderate or more inflation. The combination of no tax on the gain in the appreciating asset (no capital gains tax), expensing and t he allowance of deductions for nominal interest means, naturally enough, that rather t han t he EMTR being positive, it is n egative -the investment produces a positive rate of return but income tax losses. Obvi ously, this combination of circumstances should produce the tax loss g iven by the theory. However, t here are in our view important caveats to suggest ing that such theoretical models negate t he more obvious conclusio ns that New Zealand under current policy is v iewed as a country t hat from a tax perspective is un welcoming to fore ign investment: • This is a combinatio n of circumstances that is not reflected in much of the investment we require such a s infrastructure. Such i nvestments are highly taxed a s per the international comparisons of EMTRs . • The theoretical modelassumes the losses over the investment p hase resulting from expens ing, the deduction for nominal interest and the non-taxation of the growth in value flowing from the increased present value of future taxable profits can be immediately used. Taking the example of a n IT firm; such a firm often incurs h ig h deductible personne l costs in its development phase, that produces tax losses. It then expects to make s ubstantial profits as it rolls out product(s). The draft LTIB would seem to see the early losses as g iving rise to a tax subsidy because the firm is building up t he present value of future income w hile making overall tax losses, thus in economic terms expensing t he costs of an asset. However, in pra ctice more often t ha n not the losses are only able to be carried CTG - Submission on LTIB 29 April 2022 Page 5 of 10 forward against future taxable income. As a result, t he "immediate expensing" is theoretical but not real. This applies most specifically with foreign investment in such firms. • An economic consideration of the impact of not taxing appreciating assets should take into account the risk assumed in acquiring them. Consideration can be given to the wider tax settings g iving rise to such negative EMTRs, but this does not justify ignoring t he high EMTRs curre nt policy levies on inbound investment in general. Do high EMTRs on Inbound Investment Matter? Surprisingly, in the Group's view, whether the h igh EMTRs New Zealand levies on inbound investment n egatively impacts on New Zealand's cost of capital a nd the level of investment available to us does not seem to get much focus in the draft LTIB. The LTIB would benefit from more consideration of this. The Group considers that t he analysis should begin with the economic theory and literature. As the d raft LTIB discusses, the economic theory is t hat taxing foreign investors increases the costs of capital, reduces investment, p roductivity and wages. The economic incidence of t he tax o n foreigners is not borne by the foreigners but by domestic labour because fo reign investment is very sensitive to local tax. Our understand ing is that economic literature over recent years has increasingly seen t his t heory as reflective of the real world suggesting that our h ig h EMTRs o n foreign investment s ig nificantly damage investment and productivity here. This seems especially likely given we are a small open economy. New Zealand does not figure on t he radar screens of most large international investors. If our tax settings seem unattractive, investment options here are unlikely to be even considered. As the draft LTIB notes, there are caveats to a nd assumptions u nderlying the theory-the presence of: • Overseas tax credits to offset New Zealand tax, • Location specific economic re n ts in New Zealand, • Sunk investments. However, all theories have caveats and assumptions. Fundamental to most economic analysis is the assumption of pure markets. Even t hough i t is clear that many markets are far from pure, the theory is useful in modelling the real world modified by the knowledge t hat economic theory will d iverge from reality in some respects. Officials' starting position should be that there needs to be very strong evidence that the economic theory and literature suggesting h ig h welfare costs from high EMTRs on foreign investment does not apply in the case of New Zealand. The Group is unaware of a ny such strong evidence. The Group concedes t hat t here is a little amount of empirical evidence supporting a high correlatio n between foreign investment a nd EMTRs. That may s imply reflect the number of such studies. There are, however, a n umber of reasons w hy an empirical correlation between EMTRs and the level of foreign investment may not reflect the extent of the welfare costs of our high EMTRs: • The most valuable foreign investments are of a long-term nature and thus consider t he lo ng term i mpact of tax policy settings. While empirical studies measure the immediate impact of current settings, long term investors are concerned with the overall strategic di rectio n of t hose settings. This CTG - Submission on LTIB 29 April 2022 Page 6 of 10 means a reduction in t he company tax rate may not have its full impact on investment decisio ns for some t ime. It a lso means that the strategic direction of reform and messaging are as important as the current ru les. Countries attractive to foreign investors (such as Singapore and Ireland) have a clearly s ig nalled tax welcoming mat. Our perspective is that New Zealand used to signal it welcomed fo re ig n i nvestment with a lo ng-term d irection of lowering EMTRs but in more recent times a diffe rent strategic direction and messaging has been adopted with a number of measures increasing tax on foreign investment being announced and justified on t he basis of combating "tax avoidance" (particul arly by mult inatio na ls) or closing " loopholes." This is a very clear negative message to long term investors while wrongly focusing on the legal, as opposed to the more relevant economic incidence, of the tax measures proposed. • In t he tax a rea complex technical tax rules meet t he complexity of t he realworld. It is thus d ifficult to model the likely impact of quite detailed tax ru les. For example, various measures to increase the tax New Zealand applies to hybrid instruments would be ha rd to model empirically. However, the impact has been to impose much h ig her tax wedges o n t he internatio na l funding of our banking sector and that flows through to h ig her cost of borrowing throughout the economy. • How tax laws are admin istered can be as important as the detail of t he rules. It seems reasonable to hypothesise that our generally honest and competent tax administration is a natio na l benefit in t his regard (and i nvestment to maintain those standards s hould be made). However, in recent times IR seems to have taken a relatively aggressive approach c halleng ing tax benefits t hat fore ig n investors rel i ed upon. Again, such a factor is not likely to be able to be incorporated into empirical studies on the impact of EMTRs on investment . On t he basis of t he above the Group considers t hat t he LTIB should be clearer on the likely negative impact of our internatio nally high EMTRs o n inbound investment. Implications for the LTIB In t he Group's view the LTIB should form the basis for a dialogue that can establish a clear strategic direction for New Zealand tax policy settings. This should be based o n an analys is of the relevant economic theory and literature fleshing this out with feedback as to what is impacting on investment decis io ns in t he real world. While anecdotal feedback may be seen as lacking modelling rigour, it usefully supplements modelling to give con text to how taxes work in reality. The policy that emerges from that will be incremental but s hould be consistent with the strategic direction. Of necessity cons iderable pragmatism will be required in turning strategy into actual policy. Based on the theory and literature, the focus should be o n reducing to the extent possible t he EMTRs o n i nvestment and especially inbound investment. We do not consider that the d rah LTIB makes a convincing case fo r focusing instead on reducing the variability of EMTRs on d ifferent forms of investment under domestic tax ru les. Reducing the variability of EMTRs s hould instead be pursued to the extent possib le and justified in tandem wit h t he overall need to reduce tax barriers to investment. In other words, we do not see a strategic approach of lowering EMTRs for investment generally as inconsistent with a lso making EMTRs o n types of investment less variable. The (McLeod) Tax Review 2001 raised the inherent tension between a policy objective of a lignment of personaland top personaltax rates and reducing EMTRs on capital and in particular inbound investment . It n oted however t hat the apparent high EMTRs on inbound investment were lowered to t he extent the investment was fina nced by debt (at least fo r Fore ign Direct Investment -FDI). The implication at least is that low tax o n debt investment is a useful feature of our tax system by ameliorating the otherwise h ig h EMTRs. CTG - Submission on LTIB 29 April 2022 Page 7 of 10 The draft LTIB is useful in expanding the OECD type EMTR ana lysis to incorporate t his aspect. However, in r ecent years in the name of closing "loopho les" t he scope of the transfer pricing rules, thin capita lisation ru les, NRWT and AIL has been expanded so as to increase the tax we impose o n debt financed investment. It would be useful i f the LTIB clarified Officials thinking on t he extent to which New Zealand should be taxing i nbound debt investment so as to provide a basis for ongoing dialogue on the issue. There are obvious limitations in t he McLeod Review approach and these are alluded to in the draft LTIB: • It may ameliorate high EMTRs o n FDI but has limited impact o n the EMTRs on Foreig n Portfolio In vestment (FPI). • The interest deductio ns that lower EMTRs can be offset by the tax on interest imposed by the investor's home jurisdiction. Responses to t hese points have been considered in the past a nd in novative t hinking should be encouraged. For example , cons ideration could be given to cashing out a proportion of imputation credits received by foreign investors. One r esponse to the tax t hat investor home jurisdictions imposed on interest was that New Zealand allowed deductio ns on an accrual basis whereas NRWT (and often home jurisdictio n tax) was imposed only on paymen ts. However, t his was identified by Officia ls as a "loophole" and NRWT has been extended to cover accrued i nterest costs. It is always necessary to bear in mind t hat we have to desig n tax ru les pragmatically and perfect solutio ns are seldom available. The d r aft LTIB seems to imply a view t hat t he longer-term alignment of the company and top persona l rate may not be a stable policy setting for New Zealand. This seems to be the basis for the d raft LTIB raising alternative tax policy settings not based o n such a lig nment -an allowance for corporate equity a nd a dual i ncome tax system. These raise complexities and issues of t hei r own. There is a naturaltendency to see faults in the settings we have close experience with but underestimate t he issues alternatives give rise to. It would be useful to assist dialogue on this to develop a clearer view as to limits where lack of a lig nment of tax rates is likely to create unmanageable integrity issues without radical change. For example, governments could be re laxed about income not readily substitutable fo r employment income not being taxed at personal r ates. Governments could be re laxed about any income re-invested and not used in persona l consumption being taxed at less than personal tax rates. The less concerned governments are about taxing all income at personaltax rates the more a reduction in the company tax rate (which the Group would support) can be seen as viable. I mplicit in the draft LTIB seems to be the view that any reduction in t he company tax rate (or a more general move to a dua l income tax system) would need to be buttressed by the taxation of capital gains -at least o n the sale of shares. The Group is not convinced by t he comments in the draft LTIB o n this point. Any consideration of the role oftaxing capital gains needs to take into account notjust a ny buttressing benefits such a tax would involve but also its d isadvantages. The problems with taxing capital gains are many and varied as set out in the report of the Tax Working Group, even by the majority w ho supported such a tax. This included complexity ofthe ru les, complia nce costs, lock-in effects, and the impact of taxing gains only on realisation so that the tax becomes t ransactiona l in nature. The taxing of share gains seems especially problematic, particularly how taxing s hare gains can work efficiently under an imputation system. One problem identified was that t he capita l gains tax designed by the TWG would have increased t he tax levied o n CTG - Submission on LTIB 29 April 2022 Page 8 of 10 New Zealanders investing in New Zealand companies but not increase t he tax levied o n New Zealanders investing in offsho re companies (or fore igners investing in New Zealand companies). The potent ia l result was seen as the hallowing out ofthe New Zealand equity market to the detriment ofthe economy generally. Indexation, Depreciation and Concessions The d raft LTIB ra ises the option of comprehensive indexation of the tax base. The rationale is that even at moderate levels of inflation a nomina l tax system creates considerable variability in t he EMTRs applying to diverse types of investment a nd the draft LTIB seems to suggest these can be more economically costly than high EMTRs o n inbound investment. Examples are: • High EMTRs on inventory • High EMTRs on depreciable assets especially short-lived assets. • L ow or negative EMTRs on debt financed investment. Comprehens ive indexatio n of t he tax base has been explored in t he past and found to be impractical. Indexatio n of fina ncia l assets (debt) seems especially problematic. That is not only on grounds of complexity and compliance costs but conceptually. For example, a business that has issued debt at low interest rates would find t hat if inflation increases materially in realterms its interest rate would become negative. It would then be deemed to have derived taxable income even though it has to continue to pay interest as a cash outflow. This would be a materia l risk fo r firms increasing uncertainty ofthe impact of our tax laws. The Group does not consider this to be a viable optio n. The Group does however cons ider partia l i ndexation measures could usefully be considered. That would include indexing depreciation deductio ns (so the book value of assets is increased each year for inflation) and moving inventory to say a LIFO from FIFO system. Such measures would seem consistent with a lo ng-term strategy of decreasing EMTRs on investment and inbound investment in particula r. The Group also considers t h at overseas examples of successful tax concessions should be considered. We provided examples in t he Group's 6 September 2021 submission on the Long Term Insig hts Consultative Document. Specific tax concessio ns are most likely to be justified in attracting internationally mobile activities that other countries court with attractive offers. The main economic argument against tax concessions is that they need to be funded by higher taxes on other firms (assuming a set revenue need) a nd they d ivert resources to activities generating a lower overall return. However, such objections do not hold to the extent tax concessions attract activities here that contribute tax revenue but would not locate he re without concessions and that engage resources (including personnel) that would otherwise not be here . With r espect to depreciation rates, t hese have been set based o n models of the economic life of assets. It would be appropriate to questio n this approach a nd explore further the basis on which actual investment decis io ns are made. As technology makes investment t imeframes shorter it seems like ly t hat investment timeframes are much less than modelled economic life of assets. This suggests higher depreciation rates t ha n curr ently available. We attach as a n Appendix t he Group's comments in relatio n to the questions for response in Chapters 7 to 12 of t he briefing. Pl ease let us know if you have any queries in relatio n to the matters set out in this letter, we would be happy to d iscuss these further.

Level 1, 804 Colombo Street PO Box 6, Cashel Street Christchurch, New Zealand Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 5 May 2022 By email: policymaster@ird.govt.nz Re: Submission on Selected Areas of the LTIB Dear Sir/Madam 1.0 Introduction and overview 1.1 We refer to the draft long term insights briefing (LTIB) dated February 2022 for which submissions were required by 14 April 2022. We wish to make a submission in general terms referencing specific aspects of the LTIB but also drawing upon subsequent policy announcements regarding Tax Principles and the topic of a Wealth tax. 1.2 The focus of the LTIB is how to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and postulates various initiatives to attract further investment, most notably a reduction in the company tax rate and depreciation allowances or specific industry-based incentives. 1.3 This approach is diametrically opposed to the comments made in the context of developing a Tax Principles Act which talks about consistent treatment across taxpayers with the same economic income, and seeks to establish a progressive tax rates scale as economic income increases. 1.4 As an initial observation, there are some fundamental contradictions between these two approaches. 1.5 Firstly, based upon the information provided in the LTIB New Zealand requires further capital to feed economic growth from which tax revenue will be derived. 1.6 Secondly, the proposal to attract foreign capital presupposes concessions in tax rate either by a reduction in corporate rate across the board, an increase in depreciation allowances or specific industry incentives or a combination of all three. Economic value created by foreign direct investment will be owned by the foreign owners, not New Zealand tax residents. As a consequence, with the mobility of capital, if a more preferred or tax efficient destination for that foreign capital is identified then it is possible that the capital will leave New Zealand to find that lower taxed higher return destination. PUB-07 Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 2 of 6 1.7 One of the major distortions in the New Zealand tax system and investment options is the extent of domestic investment in housing stock both for personal occupation and for investment purposes. We have seen that this emphasis has played a part in an allocation of a very high proportion of investment capital to housing stock, but also providing incentives for investment due to the returns achieved which have been self-fulfilling given the economic settings that have prevailed in recent years (low interest rate, finite housing stock and high levels of demand). 1.8 The LTIB ignores outward direct investment (ODI) on the basis that recent tax changes to our international tax regime finalised in 2009 which were intended to be concessionary have not resulted in an increase in ODI of any magnitude. We see the taxation of ODI is more complicated than this. If we are to attract and retain the owners of investment capital in New Zealand then we need to ensure that the portion of the investment capital allocated to offshore investments is taxed efficiently. At the moment, ODI is discouraged by several tax settings and interpretations adopted. 1.9 The philosophy of our approach to ODI should be that it facilitates investment capital, or the owners of investment capital, residing in New Zealand and investing globally from New Zealand. 1.10 For example, if foreign tax credits cannot be claimed against New Zealand income tax in the year in which they arise they are forfeited. Because New Zealand measures taxable income differently to other jurisdictions it may be that there is foreign tax credit leakage as a result of that which could be due to timing issues for example. The taxation of foreign exchange, the timing of the recognition of economic interest under our financial arrangements regime can give rise to timing differences, as can depreciation rates. The compliance cost of managing ODI through all of its various structural options, combined with the inability to carry forward or match foreign tax credits to the New Zealand liability to which they relate provides an impediment to ODI. 1.11 Further, our interpretation of double tax treaties with respect to the availability of foreign tax credits is a further impediment, and is potentially contrary to international law principles. Double tax treaties are intended to do just that – remove double taxation. However, when determining the quantum of the credit to be allowed in New Zealand we have interpreted the words of the treaty to be that a credit is only available proportionate to the income to which it relates. Unlike other tax credits such as imputation credits which can offset any other form of income, a credit for foreign withholding tax is limited to the proportion of income that the tax bears. For example, if 10% is withheld from interest income then the recipient of that interest income can only claim a maximum 10% credit. If through managing ODI via trust arrangements, a taxable distribution of interest is made together with the entire foreign tax credit the recipient will only be able to claim 10% as opposed to the entire credit. This dramatically reduces the flexibility of Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 3 of 6 managing the tax on foreign sourced income derived via ODI, contrary to principles applied to the rest of the tax system. Clearly the tax credit for non-resident withholding tax is severable from the income to which it relates. It can be dealt with separately at trust law. But our interpretation of the double tax treaty preserves the right to view that eligibility very narrowly with the result that a credit is denied in situations where it should reasonably be made available. We make it hard for the tax on ODI to be managed effectively. As mentioned above, the most clear example is the inability to carry forward foreign tax credits notwithstanding that the timing and measurement of income and expenditure between two jurisdictions will naturally be different. As a consequence the effective tax rate and the compliance cost to manage ODI increases providing a significant disincentive. 1.12 We would like to see a review of these rules to try and encourage foreign capital to come to New Zealand and invest via New Zealand by providing more flexible foreign tax credit rules to reduce the effective tax rate of ODI and reduce compliance costs. 1.13 Our tax system also provides disincentives for large organisations to headquarter in New Zealand, or remain headquartered in New Zealand. Previously, section DB 55 provided a deduction for all head office costs in relation to the stewardship of overseas investment entities. With its repeal, albeit belatedly, an international organisation with a headquarters based in New Zealand will be denied a deduction for expenditure incurred on stewardship functions which cannot be attributed to the provision of services to its subsidiaries offshore and validly claimed as a deduction in that offshore jurisdictions. This introduces significant disincentive for successful New Zealand organisations to remain headquartered in New Zealand, and for foreign entities to come to New Zealand and establish headquarters here. We think that there should be a review of the economics of providing a deduction for those stewardship costs as section DB 55 used to do, and more broadly a review of the impediments to entities with international operations basing themselves in New Zealand. 1.14 A significant segment of successful businesses with overseas operations are involved in information technology, communication and related intellectual property services. As the proportion of New Zealand’s income from exporting these skills and intellectual property assets greater focus will fall on how tax effective the New Zealand tax system is for those companies. We have mentioned above the inflexibility around the management of foreign tax credits. With respect to ODI by New Zealand businesses in the intellectual property and services sector, greater compliance costs are imposed through the controlled foreign company regime treating any intellectual property with the remotest connection to New Zealand as requiring a full attribution and compliance under New Zealand law to its New Zealand shareholders or owners. That is, where a New Zealand business derives income offshore from intellectual property which has or had a connection with New Zealand it must file a tax return returning the income of that foreign entity calculated under New Zealand rules, including foreign exchange and other timing Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 4 of 6 differences, as part of it’s New Zealand tax obligations. If there is any difference between the New Zealand tax rate on that net income calculated according to our rules, and the amount of tax paid offshore, then a further payment will be required in New Zealand. As you can imagine, where businesses have multiple offshore jurisdictions this adds significantly to compliance costs in New Zealand and provides further encouragement for those businesses to relocate offshore. 1.15 We understand the underlying principle that royalty income and licence revenue is viewed as passive income which is mobile. That said, intellectual property will find its offshore market and be taxed accordingly. We propose that the treatment of offshore or foreign sourced revenues from intellectual property based businesses be reviewed to ensure that our tax system is not creating an impediment or disincentive for those businesses to continue to be based in New Zealand and execute their international growth strategies. 1.16 We do wonder whether the normal pattern of a sale of the intellectual property in toto to an offshore owner is significantly affected by the way in which we tax international organisations headquartered in New Zealand. We think further research needs to be undertaken to establish whether there is in fact a disincentive, and what type of changes might need to be made to remove those impediments or disincentives, let alone providing any incentive compared with bricks and mortar businesses. With an increasing mobility of skills, and the ability to work remotely, it is important to review the settings applied to these businesses so that New Zealand can retain both its skills and revenues from intellectual property. If our rules provided some incentive (or remove current disincentives) for IP-based companies to headquarter in New Zealand then that could increase the level of investment capital and skills capital New Zealand has in what is a very competitive international market. 1.17 Finally, there has been much discussion regarding the fairness of our tax system and the levels of tax applied to high-net-worth individuals when considering their economic income. There is a natural segue from the preceding comments to this issue. Any form of wealth tax imposed upon high-net-worth individuals will take capital out of the productive sector and reallocate it to the public sector. From our review of budget numbers, given the growth in the economy currently and in recent times being experienced, there is sufficient tax revenues from today’s tax settings in order to fund the government expenditure. This is a complex and interrelated issue. Working for families tax credits reallocate income currently such that the bulk of tax cash flows are in fact funded by the highest income earners. There are inequities between the taxation of capital and income. However, we believe the real inequity is the rate of tax that income has born which funds consumption. By consumption we mean living expenses, which for a high-net-worth individual includes luxury houses, travel, motor cars et cetera. If we had a measure to ensure that no matter how funded, an individual pays tax based upon the amount of their consumption per annum then there would be an equity reached, combined with a Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 5 of 6 progressive tax rate scale. If a high-net-worth individual consumes the same amount as an average wage earner, and chooses to invest and continue to compound their investment capital, as opposed to consume it, then they should not be taxed differentially for doing so. As observed in the LTIB the key issue is a lack of investment capital. Taxing that investment capital on an unrealised or realised basis transfers resources from the private sector investment capital pool to the public sector social spending pool. If that transfer is not required then taking this approach reduces the investment capital available to the economy to fund future growth, which includes jobs and tax revenues which can then fund social services as the government of the day determines. Taking this approach, there is equity as between individuals if they are both taxed at marginal rates on the total consumption. We acknowledge this presents measurement issues which we have undertaken some consideration of which would tax distributions from trusts in particular having regard to the use to which the funds are applied. This approach would effectively abandon the ability to live from capital - living costs would be treated as income regardless of how they are funded, whether it be from tax paid trust income or capital gains. There would need to be credit given for underlying tax paid so that the uplift related to the additional tax paid at the natural person level depending on their marginal tax rate. The framework provided by our imputation credit regime could equally be applied to trusts to facilitate the passing through of underlying credits. 1.18 Adopting a different approach to impose a wealth tax provides a disincentive for that capital to remain in New Zealand rather than an incentive to allocate that capital to productive sources as opposed to consumption. This will exacerbate our deficit of investment capital and provide further influence to government spending with potential attendant inflation risks. The fundamental question is that capital collected via the wealth tax that is imposed due to a redistribution philosophy better invested by government or better invested productively by the private sector with consequential benefits in terms of economic growth, jobs et cetera? We think the latter approach produces a far superior economic outcome when the effect of retaining capital, and ideally attracting or encouraging the allocation of capital to productive sectors and the tax revenue that flows from that as well as employment is taken into account. Providing further capital to the government to allocate or reallocate will produce an inferior economic outcome, particularly where the government can fund all necessary social services under the current model/balance sheet. 1.19 Introducing a wealth or redistribution tax will be regressive. The current approach to provide support to lower income families through working for families is supported as an effective mechanism to ameliorate the effect of the percentage of income consumed, and which bears GST, and serves to redistribute a level of wealth via the tax take. Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 6 of 6 1.20 The palatability of proposed initiatives to impose another layer of tax which will increase the effective tax rate in New Zealand and make us less attractive as an investment destination needs to be factored into the determination of tax principles. 1.21 Why not provide a fair system to tax consumption and provide incentives to allocate capital to productive investment. That would provide an opportunity to deal with the bias towards property investment in New Zealand. 1.22 At a principle level, why should we tax the unrealised wealth of New Zealanders and take capital from the economy and allocate it to government, when the best place for that capital is to remain in its productive role. It is acceptable for individuals to be wealthy and to have created wealth as long as they are taxed fairly against their fellow man (or woman). A person who is a high consumer will pay for that whereas a person who is more frugal and focused on investment will benefit from investing in the productive sector which will benefit our economy. We would welcome further discussion on the principles that we have raised. Clearly, we do not have the resources to model the effect of taxing consumption for income tax purposes but believe it to be feasible and would result in removing much of the concern around the ability of high-net-worth individuals to reduce their marginal tax rate through tax planning and the source of funding for their consumption. Our approach does require an acceptance that no matter who owns investment capital it should be taxed in accordance with the entity which derives it, as opposed to being attributed to natural person shareholders. If the investment capital is invested productively then we should let it do its job, rather than impose economic costs and distortions by seeking to attract foreign investment capital. Adopting this approach would encourage all persons to consider investing as opposed to consuming, where possible. Yours sincerely, Brett Whyte Principal
Comments on “Tax, foreign investment and productivity”: Draft long-term insights briefing, February 2022 by Jack M. Mintz President’s Fellow School of Public Policy University of Calgary April 15, 2022 General Comments By and large, this is a well-constructed detailed analysis of the impact of taxation on foreign direct investment. It contains some very useful information making the case that New Zealand has a higher cost of capital for foreign direct investment compared to OECD countries due to taxation. Its strength is its careful review of various options with respect to company tax reform, which I found particularly well developed. In my review of the document, I want to raise several general issues that need more attention for further development. Specifically, • Why do we care about foreign direct investment (as opposed to the sum of domestic and foreign controlled investment)? • What taxes should be included in evaluation of effective tax rates on capital investment and how might this affect New Zealand’s ranking? • What alternative forms of international financial arbitrage could be considered in measuring effective tax rates? • How does income and capital risk impact effective tax rates? While I will try to reference some additional papers relevant to this discussion, I am afraid that I will borrow many concepts from the work that I have developed in the past forty years. Since 1984, I have worked with Finance Canada to help develop marginal effective tax rate (METR) analysis based on original work with Robin Boadway and Neil Bruce (the first piece published in the Canadian Journal of Economics in 1984). I have published many extensions to this work over the years considering risk and tax losses, inventory holdings, small businesses, financial arbitrage and complicated issues such as tax holidays, asset-based capital taxes, minimum taxes, time-to-build capital models, resource taxation and international taxation (such as interest limitations, double-dip financing and deferral taxation of subsidiary profits). I apologize for perhaps too much attention to this work but the points I raise should be relevant to further analysis to build upon this excellent paper by New Zealand’s Inland Revenue department. Below, I begin with several general points listed above. This will be followed by very specific comments on individual paragraphs through the report. 1 Why foreign direct investment as focus? New Zealand’s economic growth and productivity depends on total capital formation, both private and public investment. Of private investment, both domestic and foreign direct investment is critical for growth. As the paper makes clear, it is focused on foreign direct investment as an earlier paper written by Inland Revenue addressed tax policy and productivity. However, some justification is needed as to why limited foreign direct investment is a problem as opposed to private investment in general. In some recent work, I happened to look at company investment as a share of GDP for various countries (OECD statistics), including New Zealand as shown in the figure below. As seen below, company gross fixed capital formation in New Zealand is better than Australia after 2015 and OECD countries in general. As the paper points out (page 11), foreign direct investment as a share of GDP in New Zealand is well below that in Australia and the OECD in general. Company Gross Fixed Capital Formation as a share of GDP There are differences in methodology when comparing fixed capital formation with foreign direct investment data that is important to keep in mind. Fixed capital formation is based on investment in real capital (e.g. machines, structures, and land). while foreign direct investment is typically measured as investment in foreign assets (equity and debt) with at least 10 percent ownership (which typically includes takeovers, retained earnings and greenfield investments). The point is whether New Zealand as an underinvestment problem with insufficient foreign direct investment. A considerable literature has developed over the years regarding the benefits and costs of foreign direct investment. Benefits include access to international technology and management, higher rates of innovation and better productivity. It would be valuable for both policymakers and the public to know this literature and any documentation of FDI benefits in New Zealand. 2 What are the relevant tax policies impacting investment? The paper focuses on company income taxes and withholding taxes on related and unrelated party debt interest. Yet, when it comes to the taxation of capital investment, several other taxes should also be considered including sales taxes on capital purchases, asset-based taxes (capital taxes and property taxes), and transfer taxes (stamp duties, real estate transfer taxes and financial transaction taxes which can impact interest rates). Non-credited withholding taxes on royalties and fees are also relevant. Data limitations might make it difficult to include some taxes such as municipal property taxes that are not easily measured by industry for most countries. The New Zealand paper focuses on firm-level taxation for large companies and both firm and individual level taxation on dividends and capital gains (the latter absent in Australia) for small businesses. I will discuss below the issue of international financial arbitrage in an open economy. However, it is appropriate to exclude New Zealand’s personal taxation in evaluating effe ctive tax rates on FDI. Some accounting firms will include taxes on labour such as payroll and personal income taxes in the cost of capital. This is incorrect to do so since it biases upwards effective tax rates. To understand this point, suppose two taxes are imposed on companies: company income taxes and an employer payroll tax. As often measured by some analysts, the effective tax rate would be equal to firm level taxes divided by profits gross of the company income and payroll taxes. However, the denominator of the effective tax rate is also expressed as after-tax profits plus company and payroll taxes. If the capital-labour ratio goes to zero, the effective tax rate is basically payroll taxes divided by payroll tax, or 100 percent. Instead, one should measure effective tax rates separately on capital, labour and other inputs (such as energy) and aggregate them to measure an effective tax rate on the marginal cost of production. 1 In work that I have done over the years 2 , we include sales taxes on capital purchases (which are important in some countries when some sales taxes are not refundable such as in Brazil, United States and Canada), asset-based taxes (except municipal property taxes), transfer taxes and withholding taxes applied to both residents and non-resident investors. The New Zealand paper covers the relevant ones for New Zealand since VAT is refundable for businesses and no transfer and general asset-based taxes are applied. However, when comparing rankings, it makes a significant difference as to which taxes are included. In our calculations, the stamp duty in Australia adds about 3 points to the METR, which would result in Australia having a 1 See K. McKenzie, J. Mintz and K. Scharf, “The Measuring Effective Tax Rate in the Presence of Multiple Inputs: A Production-Based Approach”, International Tax and Public Finance, Vol 4 (3), 1997, 337 - 360. 2 For the latest version, see Philip Bazel and Jack Mintz, “2020 Tax Competitiveness Report: Canada’s In vestment Challenge” , SPP Research Paper 14(21), The School of Public Policy, University of Calgary, September 2021. Finance Canada also includes sales taxes on capital purchases and asset-based taxes except property taxes. They do not include withholding taxes and real estate transfer taxes. 3 higher METR than New Zealand. The retail sales tax in the United States adds almost 5 points to the METR which in aggregate is 22.6 percent. The OECD work only focuses on company income taxes as pointed out by the paper. It is also quite selective with sectoral and asset coverage which includes manufacturing, office buildings estate, transportation, communication, power, computers, software and research and development. 3 Excluded are resource sectors (agriculture, forestry, mining and oil/gas/coal) and other service sectors (business services (including many technology firms), construction, finance, wholesale and retail trade). The paper should acknowledge these limitations as various other studies have a wider breadth of coverage such as the Congressional Budget Office (United States) and Finance Canada. 4 The important question, after adding more sectors and assets to the model, is whether it makes any difference to the qualitative conclusion that New Zealand investment is more heavily taxed with a METR of 20.1 percent than most OECD countries except for Costa Rica, Japan and Chile (company income tax only). It is also above the OECD average of roughly 23 percent. In our work, using tax depreciation of 2 percent (declining balance) for structures, the New Zealand METR would be 25.7 percent. However, with our estimates, New Zealand’s METR would be below five OECD countries: Japan (38.8 percent), South Korea (29.3 percent), Australia (28.1 percent), France (28.0 percent) and Germany at 26.1 percent). 5 6 Many 3 As the New Zealand paper notes, research and development is a small portion of capital in its METR model, consistent with most other studies. What should also be noted is that R&D might be supported by grants instead of tax support. For example, the US relies much more grants than tax support, which would result in a lower METR on capital if such support were included. In our work, we often exclude R&D since an international comparison should include both grants and tax support. When we have included tax and grant support, the METR declines by less than two points. 4 Construction, mining and oil/gas and research and development are particularly complex to model since it involves a time-to-build model with two stages . Inputs (exploration, research and development, labour and capital) are hired to build capital (an office building, mineral reserves or a product) which takes several years. Once the capital is available for use (a building, reserves or patent), production takes place that leads to depreciation, amortization or depletion of the capital. For an example of time-to-build modelling for oil and gas, see J. Mintz, “Taxes, Royalties and Cross-Border Investments,” in International Taxation and the Extractive Industries, ed. P. Daniel et al. (Washington D. C.: International Monetary Fund, Routledge, New York and London, 2016). 5 In Bazel and Mintz 2021 (and earlier work), we use Finance Canada estimated economic depreciation rates for assets based on relatively up-to-date Statistics Canada analysis rather than BEA data that is out-dated. The average declining balance economic depreciation rate for structures is 6.7 percent (declining balance), over twice as high as average industrial and commercial depreciation rate used by New Zealand. An important factor in these est imates is the degree to which capital good prices fall, which might be higher in a Canada depending on the type of structures involved and temperature. However, Statistics Canada did find a substantial increase in economic depreciation in the past several years due to technological obsolescence (pipeline depreciation rates, for example, doubled when estimates were made in the past decade and half compared to the 1980s). 6 If we matched the economic depreciation rate to tax depreciation rate at 2 percent for a METR of 19.8 percent, New Zealand would have a METR below 12 countries: Belgium (23.3 percent), Costa Rica 23.1 percent), United States (22.6 percent) Portugal 22.1 percent), United Kingdom (21.2 percent), Austria ( 20.6 percent) and Norway 4 countries that end up having a higher METR than New Zealand are due to other taxes on capital such as transfer taxes (Australia, France, Germany, South Korea and United States), asset-based taxes (Japan and United States) and sales taxes on capital purchases (United States). The point is that there METR measurements vary significantly depending on the coverage of capital-related taxes, sectors, assumptions, and estimated parameters. The paper might wish to refer to some other studies to support the conclusion that New Zealand is a relatively high- tax country with respect to FDI. International Financial Arbitrage The most vexing problem in modelling effective tax rates on capital is with respect to financial arbitrage. Company investors include individuals who pay personal income tax on dividends and realized capital gains, pension funds that typically pay no tax on their capital income (although Australia is an exception) and non-residents who pay New Zealand withholding taxes and company or personal income taxes to their host governments. The key issue is that there are host of different tax rates across individual and intermediary investors. Taking into account both company and personal taxes, some models have equalized before-tax rates of return on capital with differing after-tax returns. Others, perhaps arguably better grounded in theory, equalize the after-personal-tax returns earned by investors. Another approach is for the firm to be indifferent in issuing debt and equity (the cost of debt net of company tax savings is equal to the cost of equity finance), which implies after-personal-tax rates of return vary. The New Zealand paper makes crucial assumptions that are helpful in sorting out international financial arbitrage. Foreign-owned multinational operating in New Zealand would invest in capital at the international rate of interest for debt and cost of equity finance. New Zealand savings are too small to affect the international cost of funds as it is a small open economy. Some empirical support might lend itself to home bias, based on asymmetric information, in equity financing that would be relevant to New Zealand-owned enterprises but for foreign- owned company investments in New Zealand companies, home bias is less relevant. The paper assumes that the international interest rate on bonds is not equal to cost of finance on page 7 in the appendix, but these are equated in value (paragraph 2.13 page 12). This is a questionable assumption if investor tax rates on equity and debt are not the same. If one were to consider a global financial equilibrium, the international cost of funds at the margin would come from the investor who is indifferent between debt and equity, considering both company and personal income taxes 7 . This would be a global individual investor as corporate financial (20 percent). I note that the OECD estimate of the METR for Canada is about half of the estimate made by Finance Canada primarily due to the ab sence of many sectors and certain non-company income taxes. 7 The marginal source comes from investors who would be indifferent between equity and bond assets (Miller, M. H. 1977. “Debt and Taxes.” Journal of Finance, vol. 32: 261–275. 1977). This implies that the marginal investor would be taxed on income with equal effective tax rates on equity and bonds, accounting for both corporate and 5 intermediaries and untaxed pension funds would prefer debt for tax reasons to avoid paying the company income tax. The paper might want to include some sensitivity calculations for different forms of international tax arbitrage in terms of how it impacts the cost of capital. A significant advantage of the New Zealand paper model is to invoke an assumption similar to a static trade-off model for debt finance whereby companies trade off the bankruptcy/risk costs of debt finance with benefits of corporate tax deductibility. A weighted average cost of funds is used to discount future cash flows and the value of tax depreciation allowances. 8 Assuming the international investor is the marginal source of finance, the cost of equity would therefore be below the interest rate since the equity income is typically taxed more favourably (ignoring risk which is discussed below). One could also include bankruptcy cost in the cost of debt as well (by using a corporate bond rate). However, the relevant personal taxes that affects the cost of equity finance depend on some sort of financial theory explaining dividend and retained earnings decisions. The “new” dividend theory argues that retained earnings is the marginal source equity finance (consistent with the “pecking-order” model of finance) so that dividend taxes are irrelevant in that they are capitalized in equity values. The after-tax cost of equity finance is therefore determined by the cost of finance reduced by (accrual-equivalent) capital gains taxes for the international investor which would be equal to the bond interest rate net of personal taxes paid on bond income. An alternative approach is the “traditional dividend theory” whereby dividends convey information to investors about the company’s performance – both dividend and capital gains taxes affect the cost of equity finance. For the international investor, the after-personal tax cost of equity finance is reduced by both accrual-equivalent capital gains taxes and the dividend tax. 9 Two additional complications are relevant to international arbitrage: incentives for foreign multinationals to finance investment in New Zealand with debt and incentive to shift profits out of New Zealand. personal taxes. Ass uming binding constraints limiting short selling of securities, other investors would only hold debt or equity depending on their tax rates. Suppose the marginal investor is not taxed on capital gains and dividends at the individual level but fully taxed on interest. This would imply that the marginal investor holding New Zealand stocks would have an investor tax rate on interest equal to 28 per cent (those with higher personal tax rates would only buy equity and those with lower tax rates would buy only bonds). 8 This approach is similar to A. Auerbach (https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\_papers/w0254/w0254.pdf) and R. Boadway, N. Bruce and J. Mintz, “Taxation, Inflation and the Effective Marginal Tax Rate on Capital in Canada”, Canadian Journal of Economics, 1984, 17 (1), 62-79. The OECD model is based on King and Fullerton (1984) that calculated METRs for each type of finance and then aggregated the METRs resulting in different discount rates for cash flows and tax depreciation allowances. No particular financial theory would support this latter approach. 9 If international investors equate the after-tax returns on equity and bonds, then i(1-m) = r(1 -t), with i = bond interest rate, r = cost of equity finance, m = tax rate on interest income and t= tax rate on equity income. For the average G-7 individual investor we estimate the interest tax rate is 28 percent and the weighted average dividend and accrual-equivalent capital gains tax on equity income to be 22 percent. That implies the net -of-risk cost of equity finance to be about four-fifths of the bond interest rate. 6 Companies prefer to finance their international operations with debt issued in countries with high company tax rates and weak currencies (currencies that depreciate due to risk or high inflation). With a weak currency, a bond’s expected value will fall leading to a capital loss. If the capital gains tax rate is below the regular tax rate, a firm issuing the bond in a country with a weak currency will benefit from this tax differential. Such exchange rate gains and losses could impact on the cost of finance for a subsidiary operating in New Zealand. Until recently, New Zealand has had a relatively low inflation rate at a strong credit rating (unlike the 1980s and early 1990s when Kiwi bonds issued by multinationals were popular). The primary incentive for multinationals to issue bonds in New Zealand is to take advantage of its relatively high company tax rate compared to many countries with company tax rates below 28 percent. As the paper notes, foreign companies might use more debt relative to assets, reducing the METR. However, New Zealand’s inflation rate has climbed to six percent. Although less than the United States, it is above some other countries like China and Japan that could result in further debt financing in New Zealand. Like other countries, New Zealand has developed transfer pricing and thin capitalization rules to limit base erosion. However, some of these ru les add additional complexity to modelling the METR. The thin capitalization rule is based on the ratio of New Zealand debt/asset ratio to the worldwide average. In the theoretical section of the paper (pp. 23 to 25), it does not appear that the theory for modelling investment takes into account the impact of capital investment and debt on the ability to deduct interest expense. Higher capital investment in New Zealand reduces the ratio of debt to assets (equity plus debt) enabling the company to issue more debt in New Zealand and lower the METR. 10 A further complication is related to tax planning that could impact the METR calculation. With transfer pricing, investment in New Zealand will generate income that is partly taxed in other countries to the extent that profits are shifted abroad. This results in a lower METR on capital for FDI. If companies are using tax structures that enable “double dipping” for interest, the cost of finance will be much lower as company is able to deduct interest expense in multiple jurisdictions. 11 Without data, it is difficult to determine how much the METR is affected by tax planning strategies that are partly curtailed by thin capitalization rules. However, these issues need further exploration. To that end, the global minimum company income tax will also affect the METR to the extent a company pays the top-up-tax either in the jurisdiction where the parent resides or in New Zealand should it impose a qualifying domestic minimum tax. While New Zealand company income tax rate is well above the minimum rate, it is possible some companies might pay 10 See R. Altshuler and J. Mintz, “U.S. Interest Allocation Rules: Effects and Policy”, International Tax and Public Finance, Vol. 2, No. 1, 1995, pp 7-36. analysis of the US water-edge interest limitation based on debt divided by domestic and net foreign assets. While these differ in impact compared to a world-wide ratio used by New Zealand, the point is that such rules can impact the METR calculation. See also Chen and Mintz 2009 at https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection\_2010/fin/F34-3- 13- 2009-eng.pdf. 11 See Jack Mintz and Alfons Weichenrieder, The Indirect Side of Direct Investment, (MIT Press), 2010. 7 minimum tax with relatively fast write offs for capital (which is circumscribed in New Zealand). Much of this new with effects not fully understood yet. Risk The New Zealand recognized that the analysis becomes significantly complex when risk is considered (Appendix p. 28). It could be criticized for ignoring risk, but this is not the case. If risk is associated with income or gross profits (revenues net of current costs) and companies can fully write off losses on marginal investment from inframarginal profits, the model used is quite consistent. Leaving aside investor personal taxation, investors hold equity so long as the expected return on equity net of risk is equal to the bond interest rate. With full loss deductions, the cost of risk is implicitly deducted from the company income tax base, thereby resulting in risk not affecting the effective tax rate measure. For example, suppose the expe cted return on equity is 10 percent and cost of risk is 6 percent, leaving a net-of-risk return on equity equal to 4 percent. If the safe bond interest rate is 4 percent, the investor is indifferent between equity and bonds. Should the government impose a profit tax equal to 50 percent, after tax expected return falls from 10 to 5 percent. The cost of risk falls from 6 to 3 percent (due to full sharing of losses), leaving a net of risk return on equity equal to 2 percent. If bond interest is subject to a 50 percent tax rate as well, then the after-tax return falls from 4 to 2 percent. The investor is still indifferent between equity and bonds. If the expected return on equity is increased by one point as well as the risk premium, the effective tax rate remains the same at 50 percent. As the paper acknowledges, these equivalencies with respect to risk break down in two ways. The first is related to “capital risk” 12 , which arises from unknown economic depreciation of assets. Since tax depreciation is based on historical prices, the government does not share such capital risk. The capital risk term is added to the economic depreciation term, which is not multiplied by one minus the company tax rate. Given net revenues streams generated by capital investment are taxed, the lack of capital risk sharing raises the METR. It is not known how to measure this risk although Bulow and Summers used the risk premium from stock markets as a proxy. 13 The New Zealand paper notes this but wisely does not provide any estimates of capital risk impacts given the lack of estimates. Income risk impacts the METR when loss offsetting is restricted. Even if losses are carried forward, they are not indexed at a nominal interest rate. The losses may also expire with a firm (although might be transferred to another company in a takeover). The New Zealand paper recognizes this issue but misses an important conclusion. Depending on its history, the lack of 12 As termed by J. I. Bulow and L. H. Summers, \[1984\]: "The Taxation of Risky Assets," Journal of Political Economy, 92, 20-39. 13 The METR should be calculated based on the cost of capital measured net of both depreciation and income or capital risk. V. Jog and J. Mintz, “Corporate Tax Reform and its Economic Impact: An Evalua tion of the June 18, 1987 Proposals”, in Economic Impacts of Tax Reform, ed. with J. Whalley, Canadian Tax Foundation, Toronto, 1989 . 1989 show the impact of capital risk on the METR for Canada compared to the METR when only income risk is present. The METR is exceptionally higher using stock market premia. 8 loss offset under income risk can lead to higher or lower METRs. For those with a history of profits but incurring losses for the first time or start-up companies, the lack of loss-offsetting increases the cost of capital and the METR. However, if a firm is carrying forward past tax losses, the cost capital and METR may be reduced since profits are sheltered from taxation. 14 Obviously, i t would be very difficult to assess the impact of risk on New Zealand companies without detailed history on the timing of profits and losses in each sector. It should be recognized that some sectors might be more impacted by risk resulting in potentially higher METRs by examining estimates of equity risk premia. Further, international studies could be used to compare New Zealand’s risk premia with other countries to understand the potential bias to enable some sensitivity calculations. Conclusion: What is the best company tax? As I final comment, I return to an overarching question that is quite relevant to company tax reform: what is the best company tax structure for productivity and competitiveness? Many companies will argue for competitiveness whereby a tax break might be needed given tax preferences available in other countries. This leads to a non-neutral domestic policy with some sectors more heavily taxed than others. An alternative view is not to compete on a case-by- case basis with other jurisdictions. Instead, one should pursue neutrality with equal tax burdens across business activities within New Zealand to improve productivity within New Zealand. The New Zealand paper makes a strong case for the latter (par. 2.28 in the main paper) in explaining the value of neutrality in this respect even if other trading countries choose a different approach favouring some jurisdictions. 14 See R. Altshuler and A. Auerbach, “The Significance of Tax Law Asymmetries: An Empirical Investigation” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 105, No. 1 (Feb., 1990), pp. 61-86. 9 Detailed Comments Below I provide a list of other comments beginning with the main document numbered by each paragraph rather than page. 1.18 One might want to use the word “reduce” rather than “cut” since the latter is harsher in sound. Figure 1.4: The switch in colours for countries compared to the earlier graphs makes it harder for the reader to follow. New Zealand should be red throughout. 1.27 The cost of capital formula could be adjusted for capital gains on holding assets as noted later. Economic depreciation is equal to d-q (d= physical wear and tear and q= real capital gains). One can modify equatio by imposing a tax rate on real capital gains for holding assets (the real capital gains can be obtained from deflators for assets assuming they are available). That would give NZ an advantage but empirically show how important it might be compared to other countries. 1.29 There are other small markets around the world (e.g. Ireland) that attract a lot of FDI. 1.32 Even if there are externalities, one cannot conclude what is the best form of intervention. Research support might be better given through a grant system rather than through the tax system as noted here. Further, if the global minimum tax goes through, NZ might want to switch tax credits into grants. 2.18 Do you have any estimates of “rents”. Once rents are adjusted for risk, how much is actually earned in NZ. If small, why worry about it? Further, are taxing rents accruing to foreigners appropriate or is it a form of tax exportation (as a fiscal externality)? Should rents be taxed on a source or consumption basis (note the VAT collects rents on a consumption basis for a country)? 3.3 As mentioned earlier, it would be helpful to make clear what assets, sectors and other key assumptions are used in the Hanappi OECD paper. Perhaps a box describing its methodology would be useful since the NZ paper relies so much on the OECD model comparisons. 3.9 Not sure I understand the statement here. A NZ multinational could be New Zealand controlled but still have a large portion (even majority) of its shares owned by non-residents. I know in Canada many large Canadian-controlled companies have significant non-resident ownership. 3.16 A point often forgotten is that a firm reinvesting profits causes its share value to increase (perhaps dollar for dollar). This results in capital gains that in many countries is taxable at least on a realization basis. Note NZ had top personal rate equal to the corporate income tax rate at one time – one could make a case for shares not be to be subject to capital gains taxes (as I 10 recall the top dividend tax rate net of the credit would also be zero if the company paid profit taxes at an effective rate equal to the top personal rate). With the drop in company income tax rates below the NZ top personal tax rates, capital gains taxation becomes more critical as noted in the paper. 4.4 Tax depreciation rates are provided throughout. It would be useful to readers to make clear that all reported rates are for declining balance (I understand that straightline can be used for real estate). 4.8 Some explanation is needed to explain why assets with faster depreciation rates have higher effective tax rates with inflation at 2 percent compared to no inflation. Inflation raises the cost of inventory and depreciable capital since cost deductions are based on historical prices. However, the deductibility of nominal interest is a benefit to the firm. The intuition is that assets that turnover more often than longer-lived assets, face a higher penalty (it is opposite of the argument made by Arnold Harberger that an investment tax credit favours investment in short-lived assets). I did differentiate the cost of capital with respect to the inflation rate using the assumption that a one-point increase in inflation causes the nominal interest rates to rise by one point. However, there is an alternative assumption: with personal taxation on nominal interest (and fixed after-tax return on bonds and equity), inflation would cause returns to rise by more than one point (a factor equal to 1 divided by the one minus the personal tax rate on equity or debt in this case). The appendix should be used to clarify these results. 4.8 It should be pointed out whether FIFO is used for inventory valuation as well as an assumption that inventories are held for less than one year. It is not immediately clear that the result is the same for the case of investment with 100% economic depreciation. 4.20 and 4.21 I am puzzled by the argument in this paragraph that a fully creditable withholding tax on interest causes the cost of borrowing to New Zealand to fall. It did not make sense to me in a typical small open economy setting. The effective tax rate might rise since both the company and fully creditable withholding tax are included as taxes (in the absence of the NRWT there would no NZ revenue but there would be foreign taxes payable that are not included in the METR). This does raise an issue about measuring the METR for NZ taxes, ignoring taxes paid by the parent. 5.4 The point that reductions in company income taxes removes the tax on profits earned on old capital is correct. However, this could be offset by a one-time wealth tax on the company to capture the benefit (this was suggested by the US Treasury report in 1984 when Reagan tax reform was proposed). 5.19 When discussing options for reform some mention should be made about the global minimum tax. Given NZ’s company income tax rate, modest reductions will not have an impact on minimum taxes. However, accelerated depreciation and tax credits could be clawed back. 11 5.19 I agree that indexation for inflation is complicated but perhaps worthy when inflation rates become high enough. Also, removing indexation is a signal of tougher monetary policy to curb inflation. Of OECD countries, Mexico corrects liabilities for inflation as well as depreciation, inventory costs and capital gains. Chile has a partial correction for the liability side. Other countries that index profits for inflation include Argentina and, on the asset side, the Dominican Rep ublic. As mentioned, some countries dropped indexation such as Israel and Brazil when inflation was controlled. However, even at 2 percent, inflation does create distortions. 5.19 The allowance for corporate equity will result in more companies in a tax loss position. If losses deductions are restricted, that creates a more unstable company tax over time (the move to lower rates and broaden bases in the mid-1980s was in part driven by the instability caused by growing loss pools). If losses are fully refundable, NZ could become a dumping ground for losses if other countries do not provide full loss refundability. 6.18 Does the global minimum tax put a floor on income from intangibles only. The carveout eventually equal to 5 percent of labour compensation and tangible assets may not be equal to income earned on tangible assets. 6.20 It is not clear as to why one cannot have a separate rent tax on location-specific rents over and above the company income tax. In fact, many countries do this for resource profits that are location specific . For example, the British Columbia, Alberta, UK and Norway have a general company tax applied to all sectors and then a specific company tax applied to rents earned by mining or oil and gas companies (in Alberta and British Columbia the additional tax is called a royalty or mining profit tax respectively, but it is essentially a rent tax for oil sands and mining respectively). If the company income tax is reduced, Norway raises the specific company tax rate as an offset. If rents are not related to location but instead innovation, what would be the implication for company tax policy in NZ? This should be made clear. 6.29 The problem of imposing a rent tax with full taxation of dividends and realized capital gains is that it becomes a double tax on rents. Companies will have an incentive to pay out rents in deductible payments like royalties, employment compensation or fees. The Mirrlees Report was consistent in that it recommended rent taxation at both the personal and company levels. 6.33 Even in 2019 and 2020, the weighted average company income tax rate among OECD countries has slightly fallen (not increased). However, some countries have been raising rates. It is true the simple and weighted average company income tax rates have fallen over time but a wide variation in statutory tax rates across countries remains. The race to the bottom is not leading to convergence to zero. I believe 137 countries have not signed the agreement for Pillar Two at this point although the final outcome still hinges on unanimity in Europe and US Congress passing legislation. If countries put in place the minimum tax, some might reduce the general company income tax rate to maintain productivity or competitiveness, as some experts predict. 12 7.3 It could be mentioned that the investment tax credit is equal to accelerated depreciation multiplied by the company income tax rate (under the global minimum tax accelerated depreciation will be preferable given the approach to timing differences and deferred tax liabilities that maintain some value – the ITC benefit can be entirely clawed back). 7.7 One could introduce an allowance for inventory costs as an offset for inflation that has been adopted by some countries in the past. 7.15 It is not at clear that only taxpaying firms with high METRs are of concern. Start-up companies could have an even higher METR by not being able to use cost deductions when in a loss position (the METR could be higher than the taxpaying firm METR). 7.17 One could have different acceleration depreciation rates for structures and machinery to provide a “neutral” tax preference for different economic depreciation rates. 8.16 If inflation provides a benefit to companies issuing debt but results in higher taxes on interest income for bond investors, is a correction for liabilities required if corporate and personal income tax rates are equal? 9.2 If there are specific liabilities associated with subsidiaries in a country, different from the corporate group, equity and debt financing may not be perfect substitutes. Further, managerial incentives for a subsidiary are affected by the choice of internal debt versus equity. 9.4 Given opportunities for tax planning, such as double-dip interest deductions, the high NZ company income tax rate makes such planning more attractive (tax relief is the sum of company tax rates faced by the parent and subsidiary). 9.5 As mentioned above, the METR is affected by the ratio of global debt to assets used to limit interest deductions. A company increasing its investment in New Zealand will find it can write off more interest expense, giving an extra incentive for investment. In other words, thin capitalization could actually reduce the cost of capital when this happens. This should be explicitly modelled. 10.5 It should be mentioned that the ACE recommended by the Mirrlees report would be compatible its suggested personal tax reform, which uses a tax free allowance for savings. This is much different than keeping capital income taxes at the personal level. 10.6 The ACE removes the tax on marginal inbound investments if we know how to measure the true normal rate of return that exempts profits. Using the government long term bond rate might not be sufficient to recognize risk when loss offsetting is imperfect, as the paper mentioned below. Further, marginal investments for multinational companies might have negative METRs if they can borrow abroad to finance investment in NZ, getting a second deduction for equity costs (a point recognized elsewhere) as found in Belgium. Further, 13 companies can lease capital abroad and still benefit from ACE. International tax planning will be easier. 10.9 If the global minimum tax is adopted by New Zealand would ACE be clawed back? Box on page 77. I suggest adding the word “taxable” in front of retained earnings. 10.14 How would the risk premium be assessed? If loss offsetting is imperfect or firms are credit constrained (eg. smaller companies), we really don’t know how to measure the appropriate interest rate. If the allowance is wrong, the METR will be higher or lower than zero. If one looks at carry forward rates for cash flow taxes in Australia, Canada, Norway and UK, they are all over the map. Further, the ACE will increase the incidence of non-taxpaying companies that in itself creates instability in the tax system as companies try to trade tax losses. 11.3 One could also mention investor or equity financing tax credit incentives. These often undermine productivity since it encourages companies with poor economic prospects to issue equity to investors who are focussed on tax benefits. 11.12 Would a patent box regime with benefits tied to R&D activities be a good idea? 11.4 It would be useful to understand how much location-specific rent is earned in NZ. 11.15 Not all countries are able to get away with 78 percent tax rates on rents (most countries provide a deduction of the rent tax from taxable company income). It helps that the Norwegian government has a controlling share of some of its oil and gas companies. Countries with low rents and political instability provide a greater share of rents to attract the top resource companies. Note the METR with a resource rent tax is not zero when the company income tax is based on shareholder profits (there are important interaction effects), a point that I have made in several papers. 11.18 In a principal-agent model with the government as owner of the resource serving as the principal and the agent being a company with unknown quality, the contract will result in rent sharing in order to attract the best agent to satisfy a participation constraint (see Laffont and Mortimont). The discussion regarding Norway is more theoretical than consistent with experience. 11.23 Perhaps more should be said about tax holidays that many countries use (happily not New Zealand). Such holidays can result in higher METRs than the regular system given the lack of interest deductibility and mandatory accelerated depreciation as a company with long-lived assets has little depreciation to be taken at the end of the holiday. They open opportunities for tax planning as well. 12.3 With regard to full relief for double taxation do you include both dividends and capital gains? Capital gains arising from after-tax reinvested profits have already been taxed once. 14 Footnote 41 Company income tax collections depend not only on company tax policy. Norway has significant company tax revenues due to resource profits (Canada collects now 4 percent of GDP in company tax revenues largely due to its resource-based industrial structure). It might be useful to show what company tax revenues come from which sectors in New Zealand early in the document. 12.8 A significant reason for Sweden adopting the dual income tax was to reduce the disparity in effective tax rates on housing versus other assets. With mortgage interest deductibility and an insufficient including of imputed rent in the tax base, many Swedes refinanced their homes with debt resulting in tax losses from home ownership that was used to reduce their taxes. The dual income reduced the incentive to finance housing with debt (I heard this in a seminar given by one of the key individuals involved with the reform). 12.11 In recent years with negative real rates, taxation of nominal interest drives the real rate even more negative. This provides additional incentive for investment by borrowers, making the distortion even worse. 12.27 The exempt return is problematical to estimate for reasons given above. With negative interest rates for government bonds in Europe, some countries have had to adjust their allowance policies. Comments on the appendix. 1.6 I would have introduced interest deductibility under the company tax in equation 1. It is done later so at least provide a forewarning since it is surprising not to see it here. It is provided clearly later in equation (4). While I would have started with a different cost of finance, I do find the presentation otherwise quite well done especially the clarity with equation (4). 1.8 Should depreciation be discounted by the nominal weighted average cost of finance (adjusted for company income taxes), not the real discount rate? The analysis later makes clear it is nominal finance costs that are used for discounting. Again, it would have been easier to have started with nominal and real costs and taxation in equation (1). 1.13 I am not clear how A is calculated until presented in 1.22. Some reference should be provided to the later discussion. 1.29 A reminder for a reader should be given why “m” is the appropriate tax rate given the imputation system for dividends. 2.13 As I mentioned above in discussion international financial arbitrage, it is not clear that the real return on equity should be equal to the real return on debt. Perhaps some justification should be provided here like equal personal tax rates for the marginal investor including zero. 15 2.16 It might be useful to different the cost of capital with respect to P show that the cost of capital rises by A(1-t) so that assets written off more quickly (higher A) results in a bigger inflationary impact. I derived this under the assumption that nominal interest rates rise point by point with inflation. 2.20 Are debt and assets based on market value, real values or book values? 2.28 It would be useful to be clear about inventory valuation under the company taxlaw. Is it FIFO, LIFO, averaging or optional? If averaging, then that affect the cost of capital by reducing the inflationary impact by a half. 2.54 It does not seem to me that actual interest rate limitation has been modelled to derive the METR. I should mention it can be complicated when the parent also faces an interest rate limitation rule in their own jurisdiction as well. No one has modelled both sides that I know of. 16
Comments on: “Draft Long-term Insights Briefing Paper: Tax, Foreign Investment and Productivity” These comments combine reflections on both elements of the Draft LTIB: the Main Report (MR) and the Technical Appendices (TA). A. OVERALL ASSESSMENT This is impressive work, and was a pleasure to read. I learnt a good deal, not only on New Zealand specifics, but also on the assessment of alternative corporate tax regimes more broadly. The coverage is comprehensive and appropriate. 1 The technical analysis is careful and clear—it is of the highest professional standards. The presentation of pros and cons of the reform options is very balanced. And the exposition strikes a good balance between comprehensibility and rigor. The Draft LTIB thus does an admirable job of reaching the objective set out in MR ¶12 “of “start\[ing\] a conversation on what people see as the most important objectives for reform and whether particular reforms are worth considering further. enabling an informed public discussion of these issues.” All this means that my comments are relatively minor, being mainly suggestions for clarification or elaboration. I hope they are helpful. B. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 1. Framing the Problem Exaggerating somewhat, the report is rooted in two claims: (1) Conceptually, a higher EMTR than is found in other countries is a—implicitly, the—major potential tax impediment to inward investment, and (2) Empirically, there is reason to suppose that EMTRs in New Zealand are indeed high relative to those found elsewhere, because of the OECD work cited. Both elements—especially (1)—may merit some elaboration. In turn: What about the effective average rate of tax? One strand in the literature has highlighted the potential importance of the effective average tax rate (EATR), 2 rather than the EMTR, in driving cross-border location decisions. The classic example is of a case in which some lumpy investment must be located in either of two countries: if pre-tax profitability is the same, it will be located wherever total tax is the lowest; and that total tax will reflect not just the EMTR but also, independently, the statutory rate (because the latter influences the rate at which intra-marginal earnings (rent) are taxed). And of course EATRs and EMTRs, while linked, do not necessarily track each other, in the sense that a high (or low) EATR can go with a low (or high) EMTR. The authors are of course fully aware of this, and mention the EATR in MR ¶3.2. So it seems to be a conscious decision not to pursue the EATR aspect—it would be helpful to know the reason! Some working in this area do appear to see the arbitrariness of the assumptions needed to calculate 1 I have just one observation on this below. 2 Following in particular Devereux and Griffiths (2003). forward-looking EATRs as a major weakness (this not the first paper I have noted to be quietly reluctant to use EATRs)—but they are arguably not much more so than those needed to calculate EMTRs. Or perhaps the view is that a comparison of EMTRs and statutory rates is just as informative—though then perhaps the report might linger a little more on the statutory rate aspects and their significance not just for transfer pricing issues but also for location decisions. In any case, the reader may wonder if available EATR numbers tell much the same story as the OECD’s EMTRs. Table A below reports two such readily available sets of numbers for OECD members: one is from the Oxford University Center of Business Taxation (CBT), the other from one column (chosen more of less randomly) in Table 3 of Hannapi (cited in the report). These do show New Zealand as being on the high side in terms of the EATR, though not dramatically so: New Zealand has the 9 th or 13 th (respectively) highest EATR. In both sets of figures, moreover, this is not far off the mean: 3 less than one standard deviation in each case. What about other estimates of the EMTR? The OECD estimates of EMTRs naturally come with some stamp of authority. But they are not the only estimates, and one might wonder if others—not necessarily better, but also not necessarily worse—tell the same story. The last two columns of Table A report estimates from CBT and Bazel and Mintz (2021). These leave rather different impressions: New Zealand is 5 th in the CBT numbers, which us reassuringly similar to the OECD, but noticeably lower, at 13 th , in Barzel-Mintz. If one looks beyond the ranking, however, to the likely significance of New Zealand’s difference from others, even in the CBT case the EMTR is only a little more than one standard deviation from the mean. 4 So,,,, One takeaway from all this may be that New Zealand may not be quite such an outlier as the Table in MR Figure 3.1 Panel B may suggest, at least in terms of the EATR that arguably most matters for Inward investment. Perhaps more important, however, it may be worth highlighting earlies the health warnings around the use of METRs: that they provide “no more than a partial insight” (MR ¶3.2) and that “ Small changes in assumptions can lead to large differences in reported EMTRs. Moreover, as will be discussed in later chapters, they can affect conclusions.” (TA ¶2.72)—not least, it might be added, they can also change rankings; and rankings themselves can mislead if they reflect very small differences. Indeed one 3 The mean turns out to be much the same as the median. 4 What also stands out from the table is how different can be the estimated EMTRs, for the same country, under the different methodologies: for Japan, for instance, CBT has an EMTR of 19.2 while Bazel-Mintz has 28.7. (Strikingly, however, those for New Zealand are very similar: though not much can be read into that, given the apparent differences in methodologies, reflected in a very different means). This also implied that the ordering of countries—not just the position of New Zealand—can be very different: for instance, the 4 countries with the highest EMTRs are entirely different in the CBT and Bazel and Mintz (2021) numbers. The differences (beyond levels) between the estimates are much smaller for the EATR, though other columns in Hannapi might give a different conclusion. lesson of the report—implicit, but perhaps worth making explicitly—is that one needs to look much deeper than the kinds of rankings of “the” METR that so naturally attract attention. 2. What significance of the Inclusive Framework agreement? While there a few references to developments in the Inclusive Framework, this is such a major development in cross-border international taxation, that it might be useful to consider explicitly its implications for New Zealand and for thinking about the various reform options. These implications may be limited—and I imagine much work on this is underway!—but if so it would be helpful to understand if and why that is the view taken in the Report. Two aspects come to mind in relation to Pillar 2 (the minimum tax): a. It may very well be that the moderately high rate and broad base mean that few entities in New Zealand will currently have effective rates below 15 percent and so be subject to the top up. Is that a basic assumption of the analysis? Even if that is so, one could imagine that some of the incentives discussed in general terms in Chapter 11 might bring effective rates for affected entities below 15 percent, so that their effect would be to some degree (though not wholly) diluted—this may be worth noting as potentially limiting their effectiveness. (Perhaps too, as noted below, mention might be made of non-refundable tax credits as one way to get an entity’s total tax below the otherwise absolute minimum of 15 percent of excess profit). The Pillar 2 rules of course will only apply, however, for multinational groups large enough to be in-scope of the minimum: is the presumption that there are or will be no such multinationals large enough to be likely affected by any incentives that New Zealand might consider, or an implication that they would/ought to be designed not to apply to such entities? b. Even if New Zealand is not directly affected by the minimum, its application elsewhere will have indirect effects that might be significant: -Outward profit shifting will presumably be less of a concern, as, with global adoption, the lowest rate achievable elsewhere would be in the region of 15 percent. That may reduce pressures on the level of the statutory rate. (This is mentioned briefly in MR ¶6.13). -In relative terms, higher taxation elsewhere may make New Zealand a more attractive location even with unchanged policies there (because EA/MTRs rise elsewhere). -Less positively, a reduced ability to shift profits out of New Zealand makes investing there less attractive: in effect, it raises the EMTR. 5 The importance of this effect is likely to remain largely imponderable, but: to get a broad sense: Is there any readily available information on the likely extent of outward profit shifting from New Zealand? 5 This point goes back (I think) to Hines and Rice (1994). It may be worth noting in the Report that the calculated EMTRs do not include a profit shifting-induced reduction. Also: c. Any reflections to offer on Pillar 1? Perhaps this is more a matter of revenue than of incentives for inward investment? 3. Another option: Cash flow taxation? The selection of reform options for consideration in the LTIB is well done, and wholly appropriate. There is just one other alternative that it might be useful to mention (or indicate why it is not pursued): cash flow taxation. This has been so prominent in the debate on corporate tax reform— and with interest revived by elements of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US—that the absence of any mention is striking. If felt worthwhile, it may be that offering some remarks on this option would not seem to require additional simulation work, since, as with the ACE (and is indeed hinted in MR ¶10.), the key feature is that the EMTR would be zero. Much of the discussion of the ACE might apply here too: e.g. the implications for integration with personal taxation if the normal return is excluded from tax at corporate level. But perhaps the transition problems (MR 10.24) would be less with a cash flow tax? 3. Mix and match? It might be worth addressing in the MR the question of whether the various reform options considered could be combined. My sense is that a health warning may be appropriate on this: for example, I don’t think one would want to both provide more accelerated depreciation and loosen thin cap rules. 4. Scene-setting It might be helpful to set out at the start of—or in an Appendix to—the MR a short summary description of core aspects of the New Zealand tax system that will come into play in the discussion (corporate and personal tax rates, imputation, typical treatment of depreciation, NRWT, AIL—and the perhaps the quite striking numbers in MR footnote 9 and on the share of profits accruing to foreign companies.) Most readers will of course be more familiar with all this than I am—but I imagine that even for them, as well as for the wider international readership the LTIB will deserve, it may be useful to have all this set out clearly in one place. C. MORE SPECIFIC COMMENTS These are (more or less) in the order they arise in the MR and TA respectively, rather than by possible significance. Main report: 1. ¶2.3: Are there also property taxes in New Zealand that might be relevant? 2. Perhaps use the same color for NZ in Figures 1.1-1.4? 3. Perhaps, in the discussion following ¶2.7, spell out that the argument points to a low EMTR but a high EATR on location-specific rents? The text nearly does this, but not quite—and being explicit here might help the reader understand some of the later discussion 4. It might be helpful too if were possible to give some sense of the extent to which major inward investors into New Zealand may in fact be able to credit taxes paid there (e.g. under GILTI), nuancing the zero-tax argument. The implicit assumption here appears to be that generally they will not be able to—is there good reason to suppose that the be the case? 5. Five lines from end of ¶2.11: specify pre-tax interest rate? 6. In ¶2.20, does the 8.3 percent number reflect/assume no distribution of profits? 7. In ¶2:40, presumably the evidence cited includes effects through domestic investment, not just inward real FDI? 8. P.33, first bullet: I always find counter-intuitive the (perfectly correct, I think) 6 claim that, with historic cost depreciation, higher inflation favors longer-lived assets. My (bad) intuition is that with higher inflation you really value near-term allowances, so that favors short-lived assets. Is the (good, or at least correct) intuition rather that with longer-lived assets the allowances are so far away that in present value they are worth very little even with zero inflation, so further erosion by inflation makes little difference? In any case, a brief explanation would be helpful for the puzzled likes of me. 9. ¶4.7 Explain that b indicates the debt ratio? 10. Footnotes 18-19 dealing with inflation effects are a bit cryptic: a few words explaining how these equations are derived might be helpful (or perhaps that would be best done in the TA). 11. In ¶4.20: (a) I found the argument initially hard to follow: I take it that the key point here is the reference to “cost...to New Zealand” the point being that the actual borrower pays 3 but now the government also collects some tax? Perhaps state this more explicitly? (The point is made much more clearly in the TA than in the MR). (b) I’m not sure why it would be inappropriate to calculate the EMR using the rate actually paid by the borrower—the concept is after all related to private incentives. But I may misunderstand. 6 Perhaps wrongly, I think of this as coming, intuitively, from: The present value of depreciation allowances is 퐷 = 휕 2 퐷 훿/(푟 + 휋 + 훿); so < 0. But this may be wrong. 휕휋휕훿 12. In ¶4.23: (a) Is there a reason to support focusing on this case rather than the other? It seems from the TA that this is because they lead to much the same results, but as noted below my initial suspicion (hence maybe also that of other readers) when reading the MR was that the absence of a CGT would make them quite different. (b) Why 33 percent? (I now presume this is because that is the trust rate—but did not learn for several pages more—the summary suggested above would have helped me!) 13. I also struggled with intuiting the point in ¶4.25 that “There will be small positive EMTRs for very short-lived PME and inventories, but significantly negative EMTRs for...assets where capital expenditure can be expensed”: this is because I would think of expensing as the ultimate short- lived case. 14. In ¶5.19: (a) first bullet: and also reduce transfer pricing concerns? (b) (b) 5 th bullet; the ACE might though forego revenue on non-location specific rents (depending on the rate at which it is set—an EATR issue). 15. In ¶6.24: why now 39 percent?! (Only in the next para do I learn that it’s the top personal marginal rate). 16. The important point in ¶6.23 about the being signs of movement to higher CIT rates may risk being buried away here: perhaps mention at the start of the chapter, or perhaps around Figure 1? 17. In ¶7.5, I didn’t understand the: “An alternative might be to allow some level of partial expensing in lieu of depreciation loading for those for which \* 100%dd== .” Does that not also mean deducting more than 100%? I am missing something here! 18. In ¶7.13: Isn’t though another (reasonable) reason to give accelerated depreciation as rough compensation for inflation, which might, I think, sensibly also be done for ‘old’ investment? 19. In ¶7.15: very good point, but perhaps “no benefit” is a bit strong as presumably there will be an effect when losses carried forward are used? 20. In ¶7.17, I am struck by the unqualified: “assets that depreciate more slowly tend to face lower costs of capital and EMTRs” I thought that, at inflation of zero, historic cost depreciation ‘gets it right’ (as indeed some tables in the MR seem to neatly show). Or does this statement have in mind situations of non-zero inflation? 21. In ¶7.18: Might it be helpful to refer to the evidence on the impact of bonus deprecation in the US? I am not expert on this, but there seem to be some indications that it was at least good for employment; I have in mind e.g. Garrett et al. (2020). 22. Table 7.2: Explain “m” in the title? 23. Example 8.1: Might this usefully be extended to show the ‘right’ tax treatment of interest income? 24. Last bullet after Table 8.1, first sentence: since the table does show negative EMTRs for full expensing, is the point being made here an “even without full expensing” one? 25. In ¶8.18: Why not the actual change in the CPI, which is what the previous arguments would seem to suggest? Is this to counter the risk that indexation will reduce determination to bring inflation back down? Or is it the argument in the next para that is in mind? Or something else? 26. In ¶9.25 (and elsewhere), perhaps clarify that the remark about tax being paid elsewhere is not to inherently devalue tax paid to any country other than New Zealand (which is how it might read) but (I think) to indicate that from the perspective of the investor the effectiveness of the measure is to some degree undermined. 27. On the ACE: Perhaps worth noting one other issue often remarked upon: the likely loss of tax revenue, and the risk of driving non-location specific rents elsewhere, if an attempt is made to recover this by raising the statutory rate. (Though against this, the increased efficiency in the allocation of capital should in itself generate some additional revenue). 28. Around ¶11.3: Perhaps now one should add the possibility of refundable tax credits envisaged under Pillar 2? 29. In Chapter 11: is there any experience with sector-specific incentives in New Zealand to draw on? Foreigners like me may wonder e.g. if the film tax credit (which there is/was?) is seen as a success—or as dissipating some potential revenue from location-specific rents. And on the R&D tax credit? 30. In ¶12.2: What is ‘PIE’? 31. In ¶12.19, lines 3-4: It isn’t clear to me if the claim here is that the capital income part of the dual income tax (i) inherently taxes only the risk-free return (by a portfolio adjustment story) or (ii) less subtly, (as it may later appear, with the Norwegian example) can be designed to do so. If (i), that may need some (not easy!) explanation for the reader. 32. In 12.31, near the end: It is not clear to mean how the Norwegian approach alleviates the lock-in problem: it may be worth elaborating. Technical Appendices 33. In ¶2.9, in saying that no account is taken of inflation, does that mean inflation is taken to be zero? The reader may also wonder: Why the change of policy on accelerated deprecation in 2010? 34. Table A2,2: expositionally, might there a case for putting this before Table A2.1, so starting with the benchmark against which inflation effects can be assessed? 35. Footnote 11: This methodological difference is very interesting. Do we know if it is a general feature that the OECD approach will give a higher overall METR (some kind of convexity in calculating the METR) or is this just a chance feature of the particular example? 36. I puzzled over the distinction between immediate expensing and full depreciation over the first year (and similarly between full depreciation and expensing in MR ¶7.9) until I came upon footnote 12 in the TA ; it would be helpful to include this clarification where it first arises (MR ¶4.25?). 37. In ¶2.43, how it is that the AIL is (it seems) generally not creditable abroad when the NRWT is? 38. In ¶2.55, first bullet: I have lost the plot! Which of the cost of capital expressions derived earlier are being used (amended for the AIL) in Table A2.7 for “all companies” and “domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholder”? 39. In ¶2.64: This is a very interesting table. Could one not (at a bit of a stretch, admittedly) see some signs of clustering in that the 50-60% group has a higher number of groups than any other band? Of course fuller analysis would be required to tease out anything definite: I might be inclined to take a tone here of ‘further research would be needed, but it seems...’ rather than be quite so dismissive of the possibility. 40. In ¶2.75: (a) First bullet: I would find it helpful to have an explanation of why these EMTRs are so similar. Presumably part of it is that the assumed personal tax rate is not far off the CIT rate. But that still leaves me unclear why it is actually lower with full distribution (e.g. where does that come from in comparing (2’) and (2’’)?). (b) Penultimate bullet: I had trouble following the explanation of why there are no longer the high EMTRs: perhaps, for the likes of me, it would help to explicitly compare (2’) or (2’’) with (2)? 41. Table A2.11: I wasn’t immediately clear of the purpose of this; but it seems to relate to the last bullet of ¶2.75, so may be worth referring to it there. 42. In ¶3.3, it wasn’t clear to me how the point attributed to Bulow and Summers fits with what sounds like the quite different conclusion of Summers in ¶3.2.

Summary table Overall comments The analysis should consider whether and how tax settings affect FDI, and it does not appear to do this. The analysis should take account of the work undertaken for the New Zealand Treasury LTIB. The work should be used to develop a forward-looking policy framework, and should be broader and consistent with the Government’s policy developed in the Living Standards Framework. General comments The analysis does not take into account transfer pricing arrangements, which might have a material effect on the tax raised by FDI. The comparison with other economies does not consider differences in situation, nor is it up to date. More work should be done to determine how to quantify costs not quantified to date. Specific measures None of the specific measures proposed seem viable, with the exception of the Nordic tax system. However, as this would involve introducing an effective capital gains tax, we do not believe this is viable in either the short or medium term. Our more detailed comments are below.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Overall comments Foreign direct investment The aim of the long-term insights briefing (LTIB) was to examine how New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to affect decisions for overseas firms to invest into New Zealand. This draft has also benchmarked New Zealand’s tax settings against those in other countries. It is our understanding that this work forms part of Inland Revenue's role as steward of the tax system, to ensure the long-term health of the system. FDI is vital to the New Zealand economy. We have high infrastructure needs and will continue to have in the coming years. We also have an aging population and will arguably need to increase productivity if we are to fund increasing government superannuation and related health costs. The draft briefing paper notes in paragraph 1.7 that "New Zealand's investment demand exceeds the pool of domestic savings of domestic residents, so we rely to a considerable extend on imported capital to fund domestic investments." That is, we need FDI. What do we need to do as a country to access further FDI/make it more attractive for foreign investors to want to invest here? It is not clear to us whether this draft briefing paper achieves its aims. There is no analysis of the effect that tax settings have on FDI, nor evidence provided that there is a connection on the two factors. The draft outlines how each of the different options would affect Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs) but provides little analysis as to whether any of the options would improve FDI. There is no consideration as to how much FDI will be needed and to what extent the various options may affect it. This is fundamental. Page 4 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. It seems from the draft briefing paper that there is not a lot of data about whether or how tax settings affect FDI. In that case, it may have been preferable to limit the scope to discovering if or how tax settings affect FDI before undertaking further analysis. We understand that the purpose of the report is to present options rather than recommendations or conclusions. However, the briefing paper does not provide any real insight as to what the suggestions would or could do for FDI in New Zealand. Without this step, the research has limited utility. While the briefing paper provides a good summary of the factors considered it is relatively narrow in scope. New Zealand's inability to improve productivity over an extended period is a fundamental issue. This is acknowledged yet the paper does not consider the taxation of individuals. It is primarily focused on efficiency and hence can be criticised because it departs from mainstream government policy which would consider overall well-being in accordance with the Living Standards Framework. We believe that all four capitals should be considered in a long-term insights briefing, not just financial and physical capital. 1 Work undertaken by the New Zealand Treasury The draft briefing paper refers to the complementary Treasury project undertaken in 2021. At paragraph 5.5 it notes that the Treasury LTIB 2 raised the importance of the sustainability of the tax system given future fiscal pressures such as an aging population, rising healthcare demand and the wider costs of Covid-19. 1 https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/tp/living-standards-framework-2021-html 2 Briefing and Long-Term Fiscal Position He Tirohanga Mokopuna 2021, the New Zealand Treasury Page 5 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Despite this reference, the work in the draft LTIB seems to have been undertaken in isolation from the earlier Treasury work. In our view, the Treasury findings should be used as a reference point in the Inland Revenue analysis. The Treasury insights consider issues that will impact New Zealand and its citizens. Inland Revenue should consider broadening the scope of its briefing paper to be more relevant. Given the Treasury findings, it may have made sense to assume the tax system was needed to increase revenue (or at least maintain current levels) when considering how best to attract FDI. Once the level of revenue needed has been determined, the next step should be to determine whether non-residents are being taxed appropriately. Are non-residents paying sufficient tax relative to New Zealand residents? If not, how could they be taxed more or less? The draft LTIB considers options for reform in isolation. In our view this work should form part of a larger project across IR and Treasury to determine whether non-residents are paying the right amount of tax and/or the impact that tax settings have on attracting the required level of FDI into New Zealand. Outcome of the work In our submission on the scope, we recommended that the work done as part of the LTIB be used to develop a framework to evaluate policy decisions going forward. It would have been useful if the draft LTIB had considered the direction of tax reform more generally. For example - does New Zealand need more FDI? Is there a link between tax settings and FDI? Are current tax settings for non-residents appropriate? If not, what types of changes would be useful? Which are likely to affect FDI?

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. From there, a framework could be developed to inform tax policy decisions going forward. Instead, the draft LTIB has generated specific and isolated reform options that may be either implemented or not. We recommend that the analysis in the draft LTIB be extended to consider any overall policy trends or frameworks that should be pursued in future international tax policy development. General comments Overlay of transfer pricing requirements The analysis also fails to take into account transfer pricing rules. The transfer pricing rules mean that non-residents do not always calculate and return tax in the same way as domestic residents. Overseas entities operating in New Zealand often transact with related parties. This is particularly true of internationally recognised brands. Product manufacture and development (whether goods or services) is done centrally to ensure quality and consistency. International firms set up entities in market countries to market and distribute their product. As you are aware, transfer pricing is a set of rules that requires cross-border associated party transactions to be conducted on an arm's length basis. The aim of the rules is to ensure that the multinational enterprise is returning sufficient profit in New Zealand relative to the economic activity performed here. Overseas entities are required to have robust transfer pricing documentation. This involves documenting (and often agreeing with Inland Revenue) the method used to determine their New Zealand profit. Page 7 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. There are two general categories of transfer pricing methods. The first is transaction methods, which look at the price paid for the goods or services. The second category is profit methods, which look at the profit made on transactions here. Many overseas firms use a profit method, usually one agreed with Inland Revenue. For example, a large soft drink manufacturer might investigate and agree to return profit based on a percentage of sales; and to pay tax on that profit. That is, non-residents do not always calculate and return tax in the same way as a domestic resident. Where a profit method is used, which is common, most of the measures outlined in the draft LTIB will be irrelevant. An overseas firm's decision to invest in New Zealand will not be influenced by depreciation rates, indexation, incentives for specific businesses or an allowance for corporate equity if their taxable income is a percentage of sales. Thin capitalisation may still be relevant. Comparison with other economies The draft briefing uses OECD comparative analysis to determine the merits or otherwise of the New Zealand tax system Some of the information used in the comparisons is out of date. For example, the tax rates for companies in other jurisdictions. This is discussed further in the Appendix under our comments on Chapter 6 of the draft briefing paper (Reducing the company tax rate). Another limit on the OECD comparative analysis is the lack of consideration of capital gains tax. As the draft LTIB notes at 3.21, New Zealand is unusual in that regard. Thus, although Page 8 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. table 3.1 (page 28) shows that buildings are highly taxed by international standards, this ignores that we do not tax on exit (other than by way of tax depreciation recovery capped at cost). The work underpinning the draft briefing also relies heavily on comparisons with other small, open economies (see in particular figure 3.1 on page 31). While this is useful, we note that the other economies considered (for example Norway, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands) generally have contiguous land borders with other large economies; or are situated very close to a larger market (for example, Ireland, which is part of the EU). New Zealand faces some unique challenges. Foreign investors may choose not to put their money here for many reasons. Distance, size and a lack of familiarity with the country or culture mean that overseas investors are less likely to place their money here. Australia is more likely to attract foreign capital than New Zealand because it is larger, has (arguably) a more attractive climate, and is better known on the international stage. These merits are nothing to do with its tax system. This is discussed further under "Unquantified costs", below. Unquantified costs In our submission on the scope of the LTIB, we noted factors that do not concern the rate of tax but may affect a business's decision to invest here. Examples of these are:  Distance from markets  Compliance costs  Market size  Familiarity with market  Climate  Ease of doing business Page 9 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

We realise these will not be easy to quantify; however, we recommend more work is done to determine how they may be taken into account. As well as our general comments, we have commented on each of the individual measures considered in the Appendix, under the chapter headings used in the draft briefing paper.

Appendix: Specific measures Chapter 6: Reducing the company tax rate We have looked at the economic analysis in chapter six of the draft LTIB. In summary, the chapter considers whether a reduction in the company tax rate would decrease EMTRs. While the analysis is extensive, we do not believe it gives sufficient justification for reducing the company tax rate. The trend analysis for corporate tax rates ends at 2019. However, the world has changed in the past three years. In 2019. In the spring budget of 2021, the United Kingdom announced an increase in their corporate tax rate (for those companies earning more than £250,000) from 19% to 25%. We understand that the US has also signalled interest in increasing its corporate tax rate in order to pay for the cost of the pandemic, although legislation has yet to be introduced. This global trend to higher corporate taxation is one material factor which deserves consideration and reflection. Moreover, the OECD work on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is well advanced. As you are aware, BEPS looks to impose a standard set of tax rules on some of the world's largest multi-national entities to ensure that they are paying sufficient tax overall. At a high level, it would involve coordination between countries to enact similar tax rules in each country. This points towards greater global cooperation in some respects, rather than the global competition which sits as a fundamental part of this analysis. The current misalignment of tax rates – in particular, the 11% differential between the top personal tax rate and the corporate rate – has resulted in Inland Revenue having to Page 11 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. undertake additional anti-avoidance activity and Government suggesting further integrity measures. The integrity measures will add significant complexity to the system and have the potential to blur the lines of our current tax policy framework – including the distinction between income and capital gains. There is also limited reconciliation to previous advice provided by Inland Revenue. For example, the recommendation of the Secretariat to the Tax Working Group in 2018 advised against a reduction in corporate income tax, saying: 3 "All of this leads us to conclude that, on balance, in the judgement of the Secretariat it would not be in New Zealand’s best interests to lower the company tax rate." In addition, the company tax rate should not be reduced without considering the other factors we refer to in our overall and general comments at the start of the submission. Overall, we do not believe it would be appropriate to reduce New Zealand’s company tax rate. 3 Paragraph 40 of the report, Appendix 2: Company tax rate issues Background Paper for Sessions 6 and 7 of the Tax Working Group (2018), available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-09/twg- bg-appendix-2--company-tax-rate-issues.pdf Page 13 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Chapter 7: Accelerated depreciation The analysis considers whether allowing additional depreciation deductions would improve EMTRs. Broadly speaking, accelerated depreciation is a means to give businesses additional deductions for capital costs. The draft briefing paper considers two main methods:  Depreciation loading; and  Partial expensing Undertaking this type of change would go to the heart of our tax policy system, which is a "broad base low rate" structure. This proposal seems similar to initiatives undertaken towards the end of the 20th century where the tax system was used by some governments as a tool to incentivise particular businesses or industries. As it runs against the overall philosophy of our tax system, it should not be undertaken without wider consultation on the structure of the system as a whole. As we have noted in our general comments, this work is not explored in the draft LTIB. Our preference would be to move to a more simplified system of depreciation rates rather than reintroduce loadings, which will bring in further complexity. We would support consideration of partial expensing, particularly for items that are currently black hole expenditure Page 15 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Chapter 8: Indexation This chapter considers whether our income tax system should be indexed for inflation. Broadly speaking, the concept is premised on the basis that a component of the income received by individuals and businesses is compensation for inflation. This is particularly true of interest income, which is partly compensation for the time value of money and partly compensation for the value of the money reducing in real terms over the time it is held by the borrower. This chapter of the draft LTIB explains that, in theory, the two could be split out and only actual income taxed. In reality indexation is likely to lead to further complexity, it would permeate through or need to be considered for all income sources and could potentially result in a significant reduction in Government revenue. The draft LTIB notes that no other country has adopted this approach. Page 17 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Chapter 9: Thin capitalisation The draft briefing also considers New Zealand's thin capitalisation rules. Broadly speaking, "thin capitalisation" refers to a set of rules that govern interest deductibility for foreign owners. The aim of the rules is to prevent foreign companies that do business here from sheltering their New Zealand profits against interest deductions so that they pay little or no New Zealand tax. The rules work by limiting the amount of deductible interest over a certain debt threshold. While increasing the debt threshold may improve EMTRs, this option should not be considered in isolation. As we have mentioned earlier in our submission, an overall policy decision needs to be made as to whether non-residents pay the right amount of tax currently before making changes to the thin capitalisation rules. Moreover, taxation of non-residents is often borne ultimately by New Zealand residents through lower wages or rental income. If the measure was implemented, it could increase New Zealand's productivity through higher wages or rental incomes earned from non- residents. However, it is also possible that the increased return received by the non- resident through paying less tax could be simply retained by the non-resident as additional profit. It is not clear whether either of the potential changes in tax settings would attract additional FDI, or merely benefit existing foreign investors. Page 19 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Chapter 10: Allowance for corporate equity Broadly speaking, an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) would allow a company a deduction for the cost of its equity finance. The draft briefing paper notes that:  In theory this would add more neutrality to the tax system; and  It would be practically impossible to implement unless changes were made to the personal income tax system. We agree with both these points. However, our overall comment is that implementing an ACE would be too complex, particularly given the changes needed to the personal tax system. We note that a separate issues paper has been released which proposes, among other things, a change to the rules regarding share sales 4 . If this change is to be made (which we disagree with), it should be evaluated on its own merits and not be implemented as a stepping-stone to an allowance for corporate equity. 4 Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution: A Government discussion document, 16 March 2022 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tp/publications/2022/2022-dd-dividend-integrity- psa/2022-dd-dividend-integrity-psa-pdf.pdf?modified=20220315155634&modified=20220315155634 Page 22 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, Auckland 1010 PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140 P +64 9 917 5915 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Chapter 12: Dual income tax system The final option considered in the draft paper is the introduction of a dual, or "Nordic", income tax system. Broadly speaking, a Nordic tax system is one where high, progressive tax rates are applied to labour income and lower rates to capital income. While the paper does not provide any recommendations it would seem that, of all the options considered, this would be the most attractive. We agree. While there is no data to suggest that it would increase FDI, it is the most coherent suggestion, would effectively reduce EMTRs and would alleviate some of the other issues currently facing the tax system such as the incredible level of complexity in the new bright-line test rules, denying interest deductions on residential property and the taxation of share sales. However, this option would, in essence, involve introducing a capital gains tax. This is unlikely to be politically palatable in the short or medium term. Moreover, as we have previously mentioned, the current tax rate differentials have created additional complexity in the tax system which is not desirable. For these reasons, we do not believe this is a realistic option. (2)In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge, and despite anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to— (a) the resources available to the Commissioner; and (b)the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all persons with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) the compliance costs incurred by persons. 8.In short, the Commissioner is statutorily charged to be, and is in fact, anything but impartial in relation to possibilities that might be construed as causing or having the possibility of causing reductions in net revenue. Put another way, this choice of topic was a brave one on the terms prescribed. ‘F’ because IRD has purported to do its analyses impartially and has soundly failed 9.For over 35 years IRD has promoted and successfully pursued a “broad base low rate” (“BBLR”) paradigm. It has been so successful in this that, capital gains aside, there are probably more examples of systematic over-taxation than there are of systematic under-taxation1. BBLR has become an unchallengeable metaphor for what the IRD considers an effective tax system for a small open economy and one generating the highest net revenue over time. And IRD is rightly proud of this and entitled to be so. 10.However, to define a scope for this LTIB topic impartially, never-mind to carry it out impartially, the Commissioner must first get outside of its BBLR metaphor and she has not. BBLR currently infects the choice of scope, the work that has not yet been done, the amount of investment in the project, the lack of collaboration, the timing of requiring submissions and the structure of the draft report. Dare I say it, the paper appears designed to conclude BBLR whatever evidence it encounters in its way, including no matter how compelling. 11.By way of example, in chapter 3 of the draft LTIB evidence is presented that NZ’s FDI is woeful. That fact is left hanging. Then, buried at paragraph 5.7 is the conclusion: “At the same time, chapter 3 provided evidence that New Zealand does appear to be an outlier in the way it taxes inbound investment. Costs of capital and EMTRs are higher in New Zealand than in most other OECD countries.” 12.Surely the conclusion “does appear to be an outlier” is a key finding and one that merits deep exploration? 13.Given the typically very high quality of IRD policy papers and related processes on matters consistent with its BBLR metaphor these defects cannot be dismissed as accidental. On the other hand, those defects could well be evidence of a ‘Kodak’ moment2 for the Commissioner. Conversation killer 14.I observed earlier that this topic choice was a brave one. I must unfortunately now qualify that it could have been brave. Instead, in its lack of bravery, it comes across as in my view as an unashamed attempt to kill an important conversation. Might yet be saved: 15.First, by dropping BBLR as a unidirectional relic necessitated by a time and tax administration system that is no longer so readily compartmentalised. 15.Second, by developing a more mature metaphor for the role of tax and tax systems in regulating the economy – a metaphor befitting a modern economy and the $1.5b investment in START. As Deirdre McCloskey, author of "The Rhetoric of Economics", says "metaphors are not just a pasted-on ornament ... they're terribly consequential." 16.Third, and mandatory (for impartiality), would be to approach the topic from a wider perspective than tax (i.e. limiting the focus to tax is like analysing liver function whilst ignoring the body of which it is a part – an LTIB put out by the Commissioner must surely deal with the real world not merely first year university tax theory and equivalent level assumptions?)3. Footnotes: 1 Note every occasion where policy papers have identified over-taxation and excused this on the basis of fiscal constraints. 2 An infamous moment when Kodak could have gone on to dominate digital photo technology having invented it but could not follow through to reinvent itself – instead the market did and the rest is history. 3 In line with what at least one submitter on the scoping document recommended. DRAFT SUBMISSION 22 April 2022 LTIB First Draft c/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Dear Sir/Madam Re: Tax, Foreign Investment and Productivity draft long-term insights briefing I am writing to you regarding the consultation document entitled ‘Tax, foreign investment and productivity’ (referred to as “the Document”). BusinessNZ took the opportunity to submit on IRD’s previous Document that consulted on its proposal to focus its 2022 Long Term Insights Briefing (LTIB) on tax and its impact on investment and productivity. We agreed on this focus given investment and productivity are important factors affecting long-term living standards in New Zealand. Therefore, we are pleased to see the release of the current Document, and broadly support the LTIB process whereby key future issues are examined by Government Departments every three years. The Document examines a number of potential measures to initiate a process of discussion. We welcome the decision to look at a number of different options, rather than concentrate on only a few that may not provide the broadest spectrum of choices to consider. We agree with the point raised in the Document that there is unlikely to be a single best option, so it is important to consider and rank the best options going forward given it may involve a number of difficult questions and conversations to be h ad. As we have mentioned previously to IRD, we believe the main challenge for New Zealand will be to ensure that as a small country, it is sufficiently internationally competitive and that the full suite of taxes on individuals and business is not onerous, curtailing growth and/or risk-taking. While we obviously have an interest in taxes affecting the business community, we are also very cognisant of New Zealand’s tax system in general, taking into account that taxes fall on both individuals and JacksonStone House 3-11 Hunter Street PO Box 1925 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Tel: 04 496-6555 Fax: 04 496-6550 www.businessnz.org.nz PUB-03 2 entities. A tax system that works well as a total system, with minimal distortions, has t he best chance of improving economic growth. We believe the main aim of tax policy is for New Zealand to continue its journey towards achieving a broad-based, low-rate tax system, collecting taxes in the most optimal way possible, and creating minimal disruption for the general population. In terms of this specific Document, we agree with the point made in paragraph 12 that “the aim of this draft LTIB is to start a conversation”. BusinessNZ sees it as the start of a journey towards meaningful change in lowering the costs of capital and improving inbound investment in New Zealand. 1. Setting the Scene Benchmarking and the case for change In our submission on the initial LTIB in September 2021, we noted that Document’s sobering statistics about New Zealand’s current investment and economic path, which highlight the need for a deeper examination of our investment and productivity challenge. The current Document provides further evidence for the case for change. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 of the current Document that outline foreign direct investment (FDI) and outbound direct investment (ODI) illustrate how far New Zealand lags behind the countries we typically compare ourselves with. We agree that there is unlikely to be a silver bullet to properly address our weak productivity and poor economic performance over a number of years, and believe that a mix of policy changes is required to lift our performance. We believe a fundamental question that IRD needs to ask itself both now and ahead is , ‘W hat would be the tax policy mix that would make a foreign investor look to New Zealand to invest?’ . If this question is kept top of mind when assessing future policy options, we believe there will be a greater chance of ensuring new tax policies int egrate with existing ones to create the best platform for raising investment. A cross-g overnment effort The Document rightly a cknowledges the fact that while tax policy is an important element in addressing productivity issues, tax policy alone is not always sufficient in ensuring the best solution. Instead, broader policy settings often need to be examined to ensure policy changes that have the best opportunity for success. BusinessNZ str on gly agrees that regulatory and policy settings will also play a significant role in addressing our productivity and investment concerns. Therefore, we support the publication of LTIBs across key Government departments to promote wider discussion around future policy options. We note that chapter 5 of the Document mentions the 2021 Treasury LTIB t hat BusinessNZ also submitted on. Given the Treasury LTIB was very much focused on 3 long-term fiscal pressures from the aging population and rising healthcare demand, the link between future options that both Treasury and IRD outline are obvious. Ideally, we would want the collective works of briefings across Government depart ments to be examined to ascertain what broad policy frameworks should be changed and/or introduced. This means Government policy needs to take a coordinated and considered approach, rather than the ad hoc, silo-bound, and often reactionary approach currently evident. Recommendation: That the Government takes a coordinated approach across government to the various LTIBs being produced. Estimated cost of capital In our submission to the Tax Working Group in 2019, we noted that there is significant scope for the Government to conduct some updated research on the dynamic effects of reducing the CTR. While modeling work can only be as good as the structure and information fed into the model, there continued to be a serious hole in terms of research in this area where the Government tends to view changes in a static sense only. We noted that there is every chance that research into the dynamic implications of further reductions in the CTR may provide the greatest broad economic benefits, compared with changes in other direct taxes. We even supported private sector involvement via an economic agency becoming involved to help in the research. Ther efore, BusinessNZ is pleased to see that the current Document provides some in- depth modelling (based on OECD work) so as to provide a better understanding of the policy implications of various options. Chapter 3 of the Document provides a useful outline of how New Zealand’s company tax rate and tax depreciation rules likely compare to those in other OECD countries. In an attempt to analyse potential options, we support the modelling work IRD has undertaken on how tax rules can affect the cost of capital. While we acknowledge the caveats placed on the model IRD produced, it nevertheless provides a useful gauge of the likely outcomes of various tax rate changes. We agree with the statement made in paragraph 3.20 of the Document, “... that any economic model is no more than a partial insight. In particular, the OECD model treats the tax rules as certain and assumed to continue forever.” As a number of submitters inc luding BusinessNZ have previously outlined, certainty has been in short supply. Haphazard decision-making that seems to be more political than policy- orientated has left the business community experiencing extreme uncertainty about the direction of Government policy. A clear and consistent policy pathway needs to be shown to entice investors to New Zealand, as opposed to the constant chopping and changing c urrently being experienced. 4 While we acknowledge the limitations and key assumptions of the OECD model used, table 3.1 summarising the data by country paints a fairly stark picture of where New Zealand currently sits with regard to estimated costs of capital over the four asset classes. A ranking of 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd and 18 th of 38 OECD countries tells us that if the table was ranked by overall ranking instead of alphabetically by country, New Zealand would rank first overall for cost of capital. Unlike paragraph 3.25 which states “The OECD data suggest that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capita l,” w e would go a step further and say without question New Zealand has the overall highest costs of capital in the OECD. Furthermore, Paragraph 3.30 points out that, “L ittle difference exists between New Zealand’s costs of capital for the three main types of business investment included in the data ... thus New Zealand’s tax settings appear to be reasonably neutral across these three different aggregate assets.” While this is technically true, it misses the broader point above, that our overall ranking is significantly out of line with most other countries. In short, the neutrality of our tax settings across these assets does nothing to improve our chances of being seen as a viable country for investment. Last, it does not surprise us that the restoration of building depreciation for commercial and industrial property in 2020 reduced the cost of capital for buildings from 4.9% to 4.1%. BusinessNZ strongly objected to the removal of depreciation on these buildings when it was initially discussed in 2010, given it placed New Zealand as a policy outlier with the rest of the world in terms of standard global tax practice. However, it should be pointed out that its reintroduction simply returned New Zealand to what is typically considered normal tax policy settings and cannot really be viewed as a recent proactive policy change to improve our investment competitiveness. 2. Options for the Future The Document considers seven possible tax changes to initiate a process of discussion. For each option, we have included the specific questions asked in the Document, along with our overall thoughts and recommendations regarding their ability to see firms increase their investment in New Zealand. The only overarching point we would like to make regarding the various options is that we have to be careful to avoid ‘paralysis by analysis.’ There are always costs and benefits associated with every policy option. However, the fact that some options would lead to certain costs should not automatically preclude them from consideration. Instead, we would expect that the policy journey to improve firms’ inbound investment would eventually outline concrete options that the public and private sector s broadly view as the best way forward. 5 A. Reducing the Company Tax Rate If New Zealand wished to reduce EMTRs, should reducing the company tax rate be an option to be considered? If governments wanted to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs without reducing the progressivity of the tax system, what accompanying tax changes would you suggest? Would the case for or against company tax rate cuts depend materially on what happens to company tax rates in other countries? If there were a cut in the company tax rate, should there be changes to other tax rates at the same time? Figure 3.1 in the Document highlights how high New Zealand’s company tax rate (CTR) and Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTR) are, compared to not only other small, a dvanced economies, but also larger advanced economies. Whereas New Zealand once had a very competitive CTR and EMTR, this advantage has eroded over time. BusinessNZ has consistently argued for many years that our broad tax rate settings need to remain competitive to ensure we remain a viable and attractive country to invest and reside in. Unfortunately, we are now at the point where significant decisions need to be made to reverse our failing economic fortunes. Some view the CTR as only one part of the overall assessment when deciding upon investing in a country. However, we believe the CTR is still considered a ‘headline’ rate when initial comparisons across countries are made. Obviously, we would expect any company that is looking to run operations in another country to do their due diligence, which would include examining the wider tax system of a country. Nevertheless, the setting of the CTR can often provide the first ‘look in the room’ regarding competition for foreign investment, with a favourable rate warranting further examination by the company. To undertake a deeper look at costs of capital and EMTRs in New Zealand, we support IRD’s examination into the key set of assets involving commercial and industrial buildings, plant, machinery and equipment, as well as a zero-depreciation asset. Further modelling work that culminates in table 6.1 in the Document shows reductions in the CTR would narrow the range of EMTRs, thus lowering costs of capital for investments that are heavily taxed and reducing tax subsidies for investments that are subsidis ed. With regard to consistency, paragraphs 6.21 to 6.29 examine the issues of consistency, fairness and efficiency of personal income tax. While BusinessNZ understands the implications around fairness of a tax system that has significantly differing company and personal tax rates, the discussion seems to miss an obvious point that we believe should be addressed. Prior to 1 April 2021, the top personal tax rate was 33%, which represented a 5- percentage point difference between the company tax rate, and a match for the trust 6 rate. The increase in the top personal tax rate to 39% since 1 April 2021 has already led to a significant difference of 11 percentage points between that and the company tax rate. New Zealand now has the largest percentage point differential for some decades. Historically, a gap between the company and the top personal rate can cause distortions and encourage avoidance. We note that paragraph 6.23 does mention that ‘... reducing the company tax rate would exacerbate these gaps unless personal rates were cut at the same time. Cutting personal tax rates may be supported by some future governments but not by others.’ Table 1 below outlines the percentage point difference s cenarios for the top personal tax rate at 33% and 39%, along with the three company tax rate options as outlined in chapter 6. Table 1: Top Personal Tax and Company Tax Rate Differentials Top Personal Tax Rate Company Tax Rate Percentage Point Difference 33% 28% 5% 33% 24% 9% 33% 20% 13% 39% 28% 9% 39% 24% 15% 39% 20% 19% This table tells us that a 33% top personal tax rate means more options are available if seeking to lower the company tax rate, and that a cut in one rate should also see a cut in the other. The full tax picture of global comparisons Paragraph 6.25 notes that even with a relatively new top marginal tax rate of 39%, the 11-percentage point difference between that and the company tax rate is not large compared with other OECD countries. The Document also notes that only six other OECD countries had a smaller gap than this in 2020. However, the Document does not elaborate on the dollar thresholds at which the top personal tax rate kicks in, across the various OECD countries. While Australia has a top personal tax rate of 45% and begins at the same dollar amount as New Zealand’s (AUS$180,000), there are a number of other countries that New Zealand typically compares itself with that have a top personal tax rate that begins at a much higher dollar amount. Therefore, it would be useful for any future consultation work to include analysis of where New Zealand sits regarding the top rate and the threshold where it begins. Paragraph 6.32 outlines the current state of play in Australia, noting a reduction in the company tax rate there would increase incentives for profits to be streamed to Australia. It also points out the two-tiered company tax rate system in Australia, 7 which has a lower 26% rate for small-medium sized companies. While Australia has decided to go down this policy route, in no way would BusinessNZ support New Zealand doing the same, in an attempt to alleviate the issue around gaps in personal versus company tax rates. As we outlined to the Tax Working Group in 2018, a progressive CTR would move New Zealand away from the broad-based low-rate system we support, and in our view would create the unintended consequences outlined by the Tax Working Group. This would most probably lead to gaming via changes in the structures of the larger companies, and move us further away from a flat tax structure. Therefore, any change i n the CTR should be a decrease that benefits all businesses. Global trends Paragraph 6.33 notes recent indications that there may be some movement back towards higher CTRs internationally, especially since the COVID- 19 response has led to a weakening fi scal position for many countries. In addition, new international tax frameworks that would result in a global minimum CTR of 15% targeted at income from intangibles may indeed reverse the long downward trend in CTRs that have been ongoing for decades. Ho wever, we believe New Zealand needs to be nimble in its tax policy decisions to ensure it covers every competitive position possible. Alignment is an important factor to consider, but this does not automatically mean increases and decreases in the CTR should be viewed equally. Therefore, i f some countries that New Zealand typically compares itself with raise their CTR, there is an argument to be had that we could look to lower ours for competitive purposes. Further analysis could determine if the loss in revenue from the decrease would be outweighed by the overall increase in new business investment. The key point from BusinessNZ’s perspective is that this should be viewed as an opportunity and not a potential t hreat. As the Document mentions a number of times, New Zealand is a relatively small advanced remote economy that has to regularly compete with much larger countries that are able to influence global settings. Simply put, what New Zealand does or does not do has a much lesser impact than what ot her countries do that might affect us. For instance, a drop in the CTR to 15% in the USA is, on balance, likely to have a larger effect on New Zealand than what would happen in the USA if we decided to do the same thing. As a small open economy, we should always seek opportunities that present themselves to remain competitive, while ensuring we hold true to the integrity of the tax system. If the future trend is indeed towards higher CTRs, it makes little sense for New Zealand to simply follow that trend. Recommendation: That a decrease in the company tax rate is given the highest priority when examining how to improve New Zealand’s inbound investment. 8 Implications for unincorporated enterprises and domestic SMEs operating as companies Building on the discussion above, BusinessNZ is pleased to see that the document asks an important question regarding whether personal tax rates should be cut at the same time as the company tax rate. The Document takes the view that a reduction in the company tax rate, because of cost of capital concerns, should not provide a case for lower personal taxes. Instead, it should, “... ensure that company income is adequately taxed at the personal level to ensure that company income ends up being taxed at appropriate personal rates”. BusinessNZ understands the point being raised in the Document. However, as we have pointed out, the practical implications of a company tax rate at say 20 or 24% and the continuation of a top personal tax rate of 39% does open a significant differential between the two rates. There is no doubt that this would move New Zealand further away from its traditional broad-based low-rate tax system. From our perspective, any serious consideration involving a reduction in the CTR should also take into account a reduction in the top personal tax rate to ensure ongoing integrity of the tax system. Recommendation: That a decrease in the company tax rate is accompanied by a decrease in the top personal tax rate to ensure New Zealand retains its broad-based low-rate tax system. Should future company tax rate cuts be signalled in advance? In principle, BusinessNZ supports steps that provide improved settings for business, and certainly around the policy path ahead. If the Government decided to cut the company tax rate, we would broadly support the move. Unfortunately, we note that, especially in recent times, politics have played too great a part in tax rate changes. Examples include announcements of tax cuts that have ended up not occurring. We have no problem with political parties announcing what changes they will make as part of their taxation policy heading into a General Election. However, we have seen in recent years the practice of an incumbent Government passing legislation to reduce personal tax rates etc, but for these not to be enacted till after the election. This strikes us as purely distractive electioneering, rather than a genuine attempt towards best tax policy practice. Often, there is very little reason for such changes to have to wait till after an election to be enacted. Recommendation: That future tax rate cuts are both signalled and enacted within a Government’s political term. 9 B. Accelerated Depreciation If New Zealand wished to reduce EMTRs, should accelerated deprecia tion be considered as an option? If accelerated depreciation measures are considered, should these be restricted to new investments or available for both new and existing investments? If accelerated depreciation measures, or other measures that increase the present value of depreciation deductions, are considered, are there reasons to prefer depreciation loading, partial expensing or some other scheme? While the Document points out that Australia introduced a partial expensing scheme as part of its response to COVID-19, we believe any re- introduction on this side of the Tasman should be based on long-term tax policy planning, rather than one-of f economic shocks such as COVID-19. Given the on again/off again history of accelerated depreciation in New Zealand, we believe there needs to be a willingness across the policy and political spectrum to see its return. This would help minimise the incidence of chopping and chan ging as noted above. BusinessNZ submitted to the Government as part of the 2009/2010 Tax Working Group review, saying we were not convinced that the options of reducing the loading figure or removing it, were the best steps forward for raising productivity levels, given the 20% addition to depreciation claims was introduced to encourage investment in income-producing assets. In addition, the savings for the Government by way of changing the policy was estimated to be around $0.3B, which in the scale of the Review seemed a punitive policy change for little gain. Therefore, we placed the o ptions of removing or reducing loading as one of the ‘least supported’ as part of the review. We were disappointed the Government at that time decided to remove accelerated depreciation. We have continued to hold the view that some sort of return to the pre-2010 policy of a 20% loading for purchases of new machinery and equipment should be allowed. One option outlined in the Document sees accelerated depreciation being restricted to new assets only, which would mean that firms owning depreciable a ssets on the day a new scheme came into force would not benefit from a higher deprecation rate on these assets. While BusinessNZ sympathises with those businesses who would be caught in the time period where no accelerated depreciation on new assets were allowed, we generally agree with the point made in the Document that if the policy was implemented to incentivise investment, there would seem little reason to allow it on investments that have already taken place. Recommendation: That some form of accelerated depreciation is reintroduced in New Zealand. 10 The analysis undertaken in the Document shows that both forms of accelerated depreciation (depreciation loading and partial expensing) reduce some of the higher costs of capital and EMTRs. In ter ms of which specific measure should be considered in the future, the Document believes depreciation loading would be better targeted at reducing costs of capital and EMTRs on the most heavily taxed depreciable assets. However, it should also be pointed out that p artial expensing provides a significant benefit to all depreciating assets. While BusinessNZ does not have any strong views regarding deprecation loading vs partial expensing, our interest is more geared towards having an overall accelerated depreciatio n scheme that best facilitates increased inbound investment, while still ensuring the general elements of good tax policy are maintained. Therefore, we are open to not only the two options outlined, but also the possibility of other options that may be suggested through the submission process. Recommendation: That the scheme for the reintroduction of accelerated depreciation is predicated on the best options to improve inbound investment, while maintaining good tax policy practice. C. Indexation Might c omprehensive indexation of the tax base, including indexation of interest, depreciation and trading stock, be worth considering further and does the answer depend on future inflation and interest rates? Might partial indexation of the tax base, including i ndexation of depreciation deductions or indexation of both depreciation deductions and trading stock, be worth considering further and does the answer depend on future inflation and interest rat es? The two questions above examine the issue from either a c omprehensive or partial indexation of the tax base. In principle, BusinessNZ is not against the idea of further consideration of indexation. If we were to look at personal taxes, we believe there is every justification to regularly index the personal tax rate thresholds. Although the Document clearly states that what it is examining here is different from the idea of inflation-indexing personal income tax thresholds, in many ways the same logic applies. Therefore, we see no reason why such measures should not be considered for other areas of tax policy. However, as the Document rightly points out, complexity and practicality need to be taken into account when considering indexation. The fact that no other OECD country has comprehensively indexed their own tax system illustrates the potentially fraught compliance path ahead. Any steps taken in this space need to be well thought-through. 11 In relation to the current IRD Discussion Paper entitled The Future of Tax Administration in New Zealand, the w ay in which New Zealand administers its tax administration in a digital setting is very much open for change, with the private sector most likely becoming a key partner. Therefore, over time, there is every possibility that advances in technology and the increased use of private-sector software may present indexation as a viable option for a number of areas. However, that is a conversation still in its infancy, begging the question of whether indexation is an option for the near-term, or more appropriately the medium- or longer-term. Comprehensive or partial indexation? The Document asks for views on whether a comprehensive or partial index is the best way forward. Gi ven our expectation of further policy work on digital tax administration in the foreseeable future, we are conscious of not putting the cart before the horse in terms of which option would best work for improving the neutrality of the tax system. This is perhaps a question better asked at a later date. How do these measures compare with other ways of reducing higher EMTRs and reducing current tax distortions? In comparison with other measures, we believe some of the other options outlined in the Document would be more appropriate to pursue at this time. However, this does not mean we should simply discard indexation as a viable option in the near future. As mentioned above, the speed at which the private and public sectors can collaborate to create products serving the specific needs of taxpayers will determine whether indexation can be introduced efficiently and effectively in the short-, medium-, or long-term. Recommendation: That indexation is given further consideration at a future date when the relevant digital technology is at a sufficient level for this to occur. D. Incentives for Specific Businesses or Industries Are there specific businesses or industries where spillovers are large enough to justify lower tax rates? Are there specific businesses or industries where economic rents are large enough to justify higher tax rates to fund lower general business tax rates? Are there any other arguments for specific incentives? As mentioned in the Document, “T he main objective of this policy option is to favour specific industries or activities where it is believed there will be too little of these industries or activities without an incentive.” Overall, BusinessNZ does not support incentives for specific businesses or industries. We have strongly supported New Zealand’s broad-based low-rate system, which has served the country well over many decades. The use of incentives is 12 effectively ‘picking w inners,’ which historically no Government has ever been able to do properly. We believe that once tax incentives are considered, this opens a Pandora’s Box of concerns about what incentives should be introduced. We concur with the view expressed in the McLeod review and mentioned in the Document, that arguments for favourable tax treatment due to positive externalities or other benefits can become a platform for practically any lobbyist’s reform agenda. As overseas evidence has shown over many years, there is no doubt the introduction of incentives distorts the market and creates its own set of problems requiring attention. BusinessNZ would strongly object to any further consideration being given to the option of incentives for specific businesses or industries. Recommendation: That the LTIB does not consider the future use of incentives for specific businesses or industries. E. Dual Income Tax System Is a dual income tax worth consid ering further as a way of allowing costs of capital and EMTRs to be reduced? Would a dual income tax be worth considering as a way of reducing distortions in the way that different forms of savings are taxed? Would a dual income tax be an attractive or unattractive measure on progressivity grounds? Is a dual income tax only worth considering in the future if it becomes harder to tax capital income at high marginal tax rates? BusinessNZ is not against the idea of examining other countries’ tax systems to ascertain whether part or all of them could be introduced in New Zealand. It is important that the fundamental structures of New Zealand’s tax base are examined from time to time to ensure they are the best fit for the competitiveness of the country. Specifically, the dual income tax systems adopted by Nordic countries have been discussed for some time now, including as far back as 2009 when examining New Zealand t ax reform. As the Document rightly points out, the introduction of a dual income tax system would represent a complex tax change and would present many detailed issues to work through. Therefore, if this was given serious consideration, there would have to be clear and unequivocal net benefits for New Zealand given our overall need for increased investment and reduced cost of capital. Investigating a dual income tax system would require addressing a number of fundamental issues, such as New Zealand’s use of transfer payments (including Working for Families), along with how high we would need to increase personal tax 13 rates (and other taxes such as GST) to compensate for a low tax rate on capital income. While a dual income tax system may directly address some of the concerns we share around how to improve inbound investment in New Zealand, we believe that this option is not one that should be given first priority. From our perspective, this option represents the most radical solution, which should only be considered once other policy mechanisms have received consideration. Recommendation: That a dual income tax system is only considered further when other tax setting options have been investigated for the improvement of inbound investment into New Zealand. F. Thin Capitalisation and Allowance for Corporate Equity Would it be sensible for the tax rules to be as neutral as possible between foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment or are there good grounds to promote one form of investment over another? If so, what should be promoted and why? Is the current 60% thin capitalisation safe harbour broadly reasonable? If not, should it be increased or decreased? If problems of integration with personal taxes could be resolved, would an ACE be a viable tax reform option if governments wish to reduce EMTRs and make investment decisio ns more neutral? Are there viable ways of integrating an ACE with personal taxes and, if so, what are they? If an ACE system were to be introduced, would it be viable to levy a tax on firms with negative equity? If not, would the neutrality properties of t he tax be sufficiently compromised for this to be an unattractive option? The two remaining areas for change involve thin capitalisation and an allowance f or corporate equity. Regarding the former, BusinessNZ believes further investigation into the optio n of increasing the safe harbour threshold is warranted, given we believe there is potential for the benefits to outweigh the drawbacks if comprehensive future research is undertaken. Interestingly, the last time the Government made a change to the safe harbour threshold for inbound investment was following the Tax Working Group review of 2009/10. At that time, IRD considered the 75% safe harbour was too generous and encouraged multinationals to over-allocate debt, rather than equity, to New Zealand. Therefore, from the 2011-12 income tax year it was reduced to 60%. The decrease in the safe harbour was also one way of making a fiscal gain given other tax changes at that time created a fiscal cost. 14 In our submission at that time to the 2009/10 Tax Working Group, we noted that lowering the safe harbour threshold from 75% to 60% could lead to more questions than answers and urged caution. The IRD paper recommending the drop did not specify the net benefit from reducing the threshold. The figure of 75% was essentially arbitrary, based on judgment a nd compromise, and so the reduction was one of the least supported options by BusinessNZ at that time. Now in 2022, the discussion has returned to the possibility of returning tax settings to previous levels. While we have no stro ng view as to what a revised safe harbour threshold should be, the fact that we did not support the decrease in 2010 indicates that on balance, we favour it increasing. Also, if this is considered a viable option in the future, we e ncourage IRD undertake greater sensitivity analysis around a revised safe harbour threshold, including how it would sit with other possible future changes to improve inbound investment. Recommendation: That the option of increasing the thin capitalisation safe harbour for inbound investment includes further sensitivity analysis regarding what an optimal threshold level should be. Regarding the option of allowance for corporate equity, the Document states that this, “... would be an option that would reduce the cost of capital on inbound investment without inducing firms to take on additional debt finance and apply to a much broader set of inbound investment.” While the Document does a good job of laying out the theoretical model, it also highlights some significant practical obstacles to overcome, including how it would properly integrate with personal taxes. While BusinessNZ is not against this as a future option, we believe greater weight should be placed on other potential changes first, to ascertain whether they would provide a better pathway towards improving firms’ inbound investment in New Zealand. Recommendation: That the option of allowance for corporate equity is not considered at this time. 3. In Summary: Ranking of Options Table 2 below ranks the most preferred options through to those that should not be considered.

These settings will affect the cost of capital for investment into New Zealand, as the Draft LTIB explains. 3.This submission focuses on how legislative design, and the way tax settings are implemented, may also affect incentives for firms to invest into New Zealand. As the Draft LTIB states (at \[3.20\]): Complexity of legislation and compliance costs may ... have a negative impact on investment, especially if these cause foreign investors to question whether it is worth finding out if investing into New Zealand would be a good idea. If different rules apply to different types of firms, this can add to the complexity. Summary of submission 4.It is appropriate for the Draft LTIB to recognise the complexity of tax legislation, and associated compliance costs, as potentially having a negative impact on foreign investment. We elaborate on that proposition in this submission, drawing on what we have observed in practice in advising foreign investors. 5.We submit that the Long-term Insights Briefing, when finalised, should: (a)recognise generally (as paragraph 3.20 of the Draft LTIB does) that the way tax laws are implemented and the legislation drafted may have a negative impact on foreign investment; PUB-04 2971583-1 – Submission on Inland Revenue's Draft Long–term Insights Briefing 2 (b) note that, other things being equal, legislative rules and tests that depart from international norms or conflict with principles set out in double tax agreements to which New Zealand is party, will be more likely to have such a negative impact; and (c) note that tax regimes such as the hybrid and branch mismatch rules (Anti-hybrids Rules), which make the tax treatment of amounts paid by a New Zealand branch or entity dependent upon an investigation of chains of payments within a multinational group and the tax treatment of those payments outside New Zealand, impose especially high compliance costs on New Zealand businesses and may disincentivise investments from particular countries. Examples illustrating effect of complexity of legislation and associated compliance costs on foreign investment Approach 6. We acknowledge that it may be more difficult to model the impact on foreign investment of the complexity of legislation and associated compliance costs than (for example) the impact of tax rates or thin capitalisation limits. It is, nonetheless, possible to identify that there is likely to be such an impact, and value in documenting this impact in the finalised Long-term Insights Briefing. 7. In many recent tax law reform initiatives, prescriptive or bright-line rules have been proposed in place of the enforcement of existing less prescriptive rules. It has been argued that the existing law is difficult for Inland Revenue to enforce, and that more prescriptive rules will be less resource-intensive for Inland Revenue. This was one aspect of the justification for enacting the restricted transfer pricing rules (Restricted TP Rules), which we discuss below. 1 8. The argument that more prescriptive rules will be less resource-intensive has a superficial attractiveness, at least from Inland Revenue’s viewpoint. The cost of fact-intensive disputes is highly visible, even if the number of cases that are disputed is a tiny fraction of all cases in which the rules are applied. On the other hand, if the costs to taxpayers of complying with the more prescriptive rules is greater than their costs would have been under the existing law, that cost is unlikely to be visible (at least from Inland Revenue’s viewpoint), yet that increased compliance cost may affect all taxpayers who have to apply the rules, not just the fraction who would otherwise find themselves in dispute. 9. Seeking to better understand what features of legislative design drive higher compliance costs for taxpayers is therefore likely to be of value. It may help to guide decisions as to how future tax reforms should be implemented, and should help to counter the superficial attractiveness of the assumption that rules that are less resource-intensive for Inland Revenue are necessarily the lowest compliance cost option for New Zealand as a whole. 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, Commentary on the Bill, at pages 10 and 11. Eg, at page 11: “It can be difficult for Inland Revenue to challenge such arrangements under the transfer pricing rules as the taxpayer is typically able to identify a comparable arm’s length arrangement that has similar conditions and a similarly high interest rate.” And, at page 11: “Transfer pricing disputes can take years to resolve and can have high costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue.” 2971583-1 – Submission on Inland Revenue's Draft Long–term Insights Briefing 3 10. In this submission, we discuss two examples (being the Restricted TP Rules and the Anti- hybrids Rules). Both examples concern rules that affect the tax treatment of cross-border transactions and therefore have the potential to affect foreign investment into New Zealand. Example one: Restricted TP Rules 11. The Restricted TP Rules (sections GC 15 to GC 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007) apply to certain cross-border related party debt. The rules can require that debt to be priced ignoring certain features ( such as subordination or a term exceeding five years), and based on an assumed credit rating rather than the borrower’s actual credit rating. Consequently, the rules will commonly result in the permitted rate of interest for New Zealand tax purposes being less than the arm’s length rate determined under ordinary principles. 12. This outcome gives rise to at least two difficulties for foreign investors contemplating an investment in New Zealand that involves cross-border related party loans. Both difficulties arise from the fact that New Zealand’s Restricted TP R ules depart from international norms: (a) The first difficulty is that the Restricted TP Rules expose investors to the possibility of double taxation. If New Zealand allows a deduction for (say) 5%, but the lender is required to recognise income based on the actual arm’s length rate (say, 6%), the 1% difference is in effect taxed twice. It also results in additional advisory costs in New Zealand and the other relevant jurisdiction. (b) The second difficulty is the cost to the prospective investor of understanding New Zealand’s Restricted TP Rules. Prior to the enactment of the Restricted TP Rules, an advisor explaining the effect of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules to a prospective investor could do so easily: the rules limited a deduction to an arm’s length amount. Sophisticated investors were familiar with this internationally recognised concept. The arm’s length principle has, in particular, been reflected in double tax agreements, which foreign investors rely on as a source of predictability as to the tax consequences of a cross-border investment. Explaining the Restricted TP Rules to such an investor, however, is obviously more difficult and therefore more costly ( in terms of advisory costs as well as management time required to understand unfamiliar rules). In addition, in our experience, investors tend to be less comfortable working with regimes that depart from international norms to which they are accustomed. Example two: Anti-hybrids Rules 13. The Anti-hybrids Rules in subpart FH of the Income Tax Act 2007 were intended to implement recommendations in two OECD reports to counter mismatches in the characterisation of entities or transactions as between the tax laws of different countries. Such differences in the characterisation of an entity or transaction are not uncommon, especially in arrangements involving the United States of America (which is one of New Zealand’s largest trading and investment partners). 14. The Anti-hybrids Rules are highly complex. Aspects of the rules refer to, and must be read with, the OECD reports, which together run to more than 500 pages. Not all countries have 2971583-1 – Submission on Inland Revenue's Draft Long–term Insights Briefing 4 implemented the OECD reports, and those that have done so have sometimes included exceptions or other measures to reduce complexity and compliance costs. New Zealand, in contrast, has sought to implement the reports comprehensively. Unlike the arm’s length principle in the transfer pricing context, there is no international norm as to the tax consequences of hybrid arrangements. 15. One rule that is especially complex is section FH 11, the imported mismatch rule. The imported mismatch rule may disallow a deduction for an otherwise deductible payment by a New Zealand entity if that payment is relevantly connected with a hybrid mismatch that arises in one or more other countries that do not have their own rules to counteract hybrid mismatch arrangements. Section FH 11 therefore may result in disallowance of a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand subsidiary in a multinational group because that payment can be traced or linked to some other payment, elsewhere in the group, which results in a hybrid mismatch between two other countries. 16. The rule can therefore require New Zealand resident entities that are part of a multinational group to trace payments for which a deduction is claimed in New Zealand within the group, and to obtain information regarding the tax treatment of those other payments that do not involve New Zealand. We are aware of New Zealand businesses having decided not to contract with related entities in jurisdictions in which a hybrid mismatch might arise, even though the lowest cost (pre-tax) option is to do so, in order to avoid the compliance costs and risks associated with the imported mismatch rule. Such practices, if common across an industry, will likely result in increased costs to consumers. Conclusion 17. The examples outlined above illustrate that rules that are complex, especially in a way that departs from international norms, or that are especially onerous to comply with, have the potential to be a barrier to foreign investment into New Zealand. It is appropriate that the finalised Long-term Insights Briefing record that these features of tax legislation may have such an effect, so that that can be taken into account in considering the legislative design for future tax reforms and the merits of simplification measures in relation to existing rules.

This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. If the objective is to ensure tax has no impact on marginal FDI, the obvious answer is that no tax should be imposed on FDI. The LTIB Draft does not go that far. However, it would be useful to establish and state a target acceptable impact of tax on FDI. This will make it easier to assess the impact of tax on certain scenarios and also to consider policy solutions. The model – convert to financial statement format Despite a former Minister of Finance’s response to a complaint regarding the use of formulae, “you should be able to understand it”, I consider the model used is not readily accessible. The work to solve the equations and understand what they are doing to test the assumptions and conclusion is considerable. Economists and some others are used to doing this work. More readily accessible language is that of financial statements – balance sheets, profit and loss (with attendant tax calculations) and cashflows. The model should be converted to this format and be made available for consideration. I appreciate this may not be simple to do. IR should therefore take a collaborative approach to developing this version of the model. It does not have to produce a definitive version, simply a version which can be tested and considered and improved where necessary. Clearly stating this as its approach should enable a ready response to any reaction which says the model is wrong (when first published). (Some of) the model’s assumptions The model has assumptions (as it must). Some are simplifying, others are derived from observation. I comment on a few: • The level of gearing is based on observed levels of debt in the economy. However, the modelled scenario, as I understand it, is not one represented in the observed levels. The model assumes a declining level of revenue over the expected life of the investment to match the declining value of the investment. In that scenario, I would expect the investment to be geared to the allowable thin capitalization level at the start of the investment and for debt to be repaid in step with the declining value of the investment (to maintain the maximum level of debt allowed). I would expect the tax impact on cost of capital to be lower than produced by the assumption made. I would also expect that to be more realistic. (I have separate comments on the observed levels of debt and the impact of inflation.) • The draft notes that it is not possible to determine the effect of the restricted transfer pricing (RTP) rules. That is a gap that should be remedied. IR has completed international questionnaires on the impact of the RTP rules (amongst others). There is also practical experience of the application of those rules which I suggest would show something in the order of 66% of an arms-length rate is allowed under the RTP LTIB Draft Response 26 April 2022 Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: TinTaxNZ@icloud.com. This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. rules. As the RTP rules do not allow an arms-length rate of interest for related party borrowing, they must in principle increase the cost of capital. • The model appears to assume that AIL is deductible while NRWT is not. For an NZ taxpayer subject to the financial arrangement rules, both would be deducted as a matter of course. In either case, whether or not there is a gross up clause, AIL and NRWT would be included in the cashflows from the loan financial arrangement and would be treated as interest expense. (The thin capitalisation rules and RTP may of course limit the allowable deductible but that does not seem to be the assumption being made.). The reasons for this assumption should be made clear or corrected. Observed level of debt Unlike the modelled scenario (with declining revenues), the observed levels of debt will be for businesses which expect to grow. Further, the initial investment will likely be historical. The observed level of debt and therefore the cost of capital calculated is an ex post and not an ex ante calculation. This can be justified as a cost of capital if the growth is seen to be financed by additional capital investment through retained earnings (i.e. each year a decision is made to reinvest profits). This means the observed levels of debt and the resulting cost of capital will be the result of multiple marginal investments made. Of interest therefore should be whether the tax system or other factors mean that the additional investment is made as an equity and not a geared investment. As above, the observed level of debt, is unlikely to be what would be done in practice for a known declining level of investment. A more realistic scenario should therefore be included in the modelled calculations of the cost of capital. Impact of inflation The model results show inflation as having the most impact on the cost of capital. As a policy response to address the impact of inflation would be substantial and technical, testing this impact is critical. Some comments: • An accounting model version of the model would show the assumptions made more readily. These can be more widely tested. • If prices are assumed to rise with inflation (as many contracts would allow a CPI adjustment), an investor can be expected to still have a cost of CPI x CIT. It is not clear that this is the only reason the model is showing a higher cost of capital for inflation (i.e. does the revenue decline reduce for inflation to reflect a CPI adjusted increase) . Note that I assume this is the tax cost of inflation as the deduction for the LTIB Draft Response 26 April 2022 Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: TinTaxNZ@icloud.com. This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. original investment does not change under current tax settings. Accordingly, any CPI adjusted revenue would be fully taxable. • Further, given reported increased business profits in the current inflation environment, businesses may be able to mitigate the impact of tax by other measures (including raising prices at a rate greater than inflation.). This alternative, to a tax policy response, should be considered and researched (i.e. is a tax policy response required at all because other mitigations will reduce the tax impact). Dual income systems I have not focused on this possible policy response. However, I note there are proposals to further integrate company and personal tax through the taxation of sale of shares. The comments in that discussion document imply further integration rather than less. This is likely to be at odds with a dual income system. Observed investment The message from the Draft is that New Zealand’s cost of capital is higher than other countries. Despite that there is FDI. Does this mean that any effort to reduce the cost of capital is unnecessary? It may be unnecessary because there are no additional investments to be made? These questions should be addressed before considering policy responses. The impact of the home investor’s tax and OECD measures My reading of the Draft is the focus is on New Zealand’s tax system and its impact on cost of capital. As the Draft rightly notes, the availability of credits and exemptions affects the total cost of capital for an FDI investor. Credits and exemptions may be available at different levels of the investment chain. For example, a credit for NRWT may be available for interest income derived by the FDI investor who makes a loan. It is however rarely available to the ultimate portfolio investor in the FDI investor (i.e. a shareholder in an FDI investor company will be taxed on profits distributed as dividends without any credit for NRWT on the components of the profit distributed.). Further, an exemption (full or partial) may be available through the FDI investor using particular features of a tax regime (e.g. using a share buyback to distribute excess cash rather than paying a dividend). LTIB Draft Response 26 April 2022 Ó Cantin Consulting 2022 Email: TinTaxNZ@icloud.com. This is not intended to be and should not be substituted for specific advice. Statements made in this response should be confirmed for your specific circumstances. These effects have historically meant that a lower effective tax rate in New Zealand (and elsewhere) are optimal for an FDI investor. It is worth modelling the home country effects of New Zealand FDI for the ultimate FDI investor. This should inform the possible policy responses. However, we note the Pillar 1 and 2 responses proposed for the Inclusive Framework countries by the OECD. These proposals will not affect all FDI investors – they will not all be covered by one or both of the proposals. However, a minimum tax may alter behaviour. This should also be modelled. Economic equivalence and capital gains Broadly, the differences to an expected tax cost of capital are due to tax applying to a different result than the economic one. (For example, the effect of debt reduces the cost of capital because an equity investment is treated as a debt investment. The effect of inflation is due to nominal and not real returns being taxed.) I take from this that the “standard” is the measure of tax against the real economic return. As the Draft acknowledges, the model does not account for capital gains, It is not clear why the OECD model, from which the Draft’s is derived, does not account for capital gains taxes. The expectation is that taking into account capital gains taxes would show a lower cost of capital for New Zealand than other countries. If so, not modelling capital gains may miss an opportunity to show that New Zealand’s tax regime is competitive. However, it may also be the case that the effect of participation and non-resident exemptions mean that capital gains taxes do not apply to FDI into other countries. (For example, using Australia, a non-resident selling shares is generally exempt from Australia’s capital gains tax unless the shares constitute Taxable Australian Real Property (“TARP”). Equally, exemptions may apply when an Australian sells a foreign investment. This issue should be addressed as the LTIB project is progressed as the tax effect of capital gains should be an important part of the FDI decision. General comment The above implies on-going analysis and discussion. I encourage IR to continue its work through formal and informal consultation before it finalizes its LTIB. Level 1, 804 Colombo Street PO Box 6, Cashel Street Christchurch, New Zealand Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 5 May 2022 By email: policymaster@ird.govt.nz Re: Submission on Selected Areas of the LTIB Dear Sir/Madam 1.0 Introduction and overview 1.1 We refer to the draft long term insights briefing (LTIB) dated February 2022 for which submissions were required by 14 April 2022. We wish to make a submission in general terms referencing specific aspects of the LTIB but also drawing upon subsequent policy announcements regarding Tax Principles and the topic of a Wealth tax. 1.2 The focus of the LTIB is how to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and postulates various initiatives to attract further investment, most notably a reduction in the company tax rate and depreciation allowances or specific industry-based incentives. 1.3 This approach is diametrically opposed to the comments made in the context of developing a Tax Principles Act which talks about consistent treatment across taxpayers with the same economic income, and seeks to establish a progressive tax rates scale as economic income increases. 1.4 As an initial observation, there are some fundamental contradictions between these two approaches. 1.5 Firstly, based upon the information provided in the LTIB New Zealand requires further capital to feed economic growth from which tax revenue will be derived. 1.6 Secondly, the proposal to attract foreign capital presupposes concessions in tax rate either by a reduction in corporate rate across the board, an increase in depreciation allowances or specific industry incentives or a combination of all three. Economic value created by foreign direct investment will be owned by the foreign owners, not New Zealand tax residents. As a consequence, with the mobility of capital, if a more preferred or tax efficient destination for that foreign capital is identified then it is possible that the capital will leave New Zealand to find that lower taxed higher return destination. PUB-07 Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 2 of 6 1.7 One of the major distortions in the New Zealand tax system and investment options is the extent of domestic investment in housing stock both for personal occupation and for investment purposes. We have seen that this emphasis has played a part in an allocation of a very high proportion of investment capital to housing stock, but also providing incentives for investment due to the returns achieved which have been self-fulfilling given the economic settings that have prevailed in recent years (low interest rate, finite housing stock and high levels of demand). 1.8 The LTIB ignores outward direct investment (ODI) on the basis that recent tax changes to our international tax regime finalised in 2009 which were intended to be concessionary have not resulted in an increase in ODI of any magnitude. We see the taxation of ODI is more complicated than this. If we are to attract and retain the owners of investment capital in New Zealand then we need to ensure that the portion of the investment capital allocated to offshore investments is taxed efficiently. At the moment, ODI is discouraged by several tax settings and interpretations adopted. 1.9 The philosophy of our approach to ODI should be that it facilitates investment capital, or the owners of investment capital, residing in New Zealand and investing globally from New Zealand. 1.10 For example, if foreign tax credits cannot be claimed against New Zealand income tax in the year in which they arise they are forfeited. Because New Zealand measures taxable income differently to other jurisdictions it may be that there is foreign tax credit leakage as a result of that which could be due to timing issues for example. The taxation of foreign exchange, the timing of the recognition of economic interest under our financial arrangements regime can give rise to timing differences, as can depreciation rates. The compliance cost of managing ODI through all of its various structural options, combined with the inability to carry forward or match foreign tax credits to the New Zealand liability to which they relate provides an impediment to ODI. 1.11 Further, our interpretation of double tax treaties with respect to the availability of foreign tax credits is a further impediment, and is potentially contrary to international law principles. Double tax treaties are intended to do just that – remove double taxation. However, when determining the quantum of the credit to be allowed in New Zealand we have interpreted the words of the treaty to be that a credit is only available proportionate to the income to which it relates. Unlike other tax credits such as imputation credits which can offset any other form of income, a credit for foreign withholding tax is limited to the proportion of income that the tax bears. For example, if 10% is withheld from interest income then the recipient of that interest income can only claim a maximum 10% credit. If through managing ODI via trust arrangements, a taxable distribution of interest is made together with the entire foreign tax credit the recipient will only be able to claim 10% as opposed to the entire credit. This dramatically reduces the flexibility of Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 3 of 6 managing the tax on foreign sourced income derived via ODI, contrary to principles applied to the rest of the tax system. Clearly the tax credit for non-resident withholding tax is severable from the income to which it relates. It can be dealt with separately at trust law. But our interpretation of the double tax treaty preserves the right to view that eligibility very narrowly with the result that a credit is denied in situations where it should reasonably be made available. We make it hard for the tax on ODI to be managed effectively. As mentioned above, the most clear example is the inability to carry forward foreign tax credits notwithstanding that the timing and measurement of income and expenditure between two jurisdictions will naturally be different. As a consequence the effective tax rate and the compliance cost to manage ODI increases providing a significant disincentive. 1.12 We would like to see a review of these rules to try and encourage foreign capital to come to New Zealand and invest via New Zealand by providing more flexible foreign tax credit rules to reduce the effective tax rate of ODI and reduce compliance costs. 1.13 Our tax system also provides disincentives for large organisations to headquarter in New Zealand, or remain headquartered in New Zealand. Previously, section DB 55 provided a deduction for all head office costs in relation to the stewardship of overseas investment entities. With its repeal, albeit belatedly, an international organisation with a headquarters based in New Zealand will be denied a deduction for expenditure incurred on stewardship functions which cannot be attributed to the provision of services to its subsidiaries offshore and validly claimed as a deduction in that offshore jurisdictions. This introduces significant disincentive for successful New Zealand organisations to remain headquartered in New Zealand, and for foreign entities to come to New Zealand and establish headquarters here. We think that there should be a review of the economics of providing a deduction for those stewardship costs as section DB 55 used to do, and more broadly a review of the impediments to entities with international operations basing themselves in New Zealand. 1.14 A significant segment of successful businesses with overseas operations are involved in information technology, communication and related intellectual property services. As the proportion of New Zealand’s income from exporting these skills and intellectual property assets greater focus will fall on how tax effective the New Zealand tax system is for those companies. We have mentioned above the inflexibility around the management of foreign tax credits. With respect to ODI by New Zealand businesses in the intellectual property and services sector, greater compliance costs are imposed through the controlled foreign company regime treating any intellectual property with the remotest connection to New Zealand as requiring a full attribution and compliance under New Zealand law to its New Zealand shareholders or owners. That is, where a New Zealand business derives income offshore from intellectual property which has or had a connection with New Zealand it must file a tax return returning the income of that foreign entity calculated under New Zealand rules, including foreign exchange and other timing Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 4 of 6 differences, as part of it’s New Zealand tax obligations. If there is any difference between the New Zealand tax rate on that net income calculated according to our rules, and the amount of tax paid offshore, then a further payment will be required in New Zealand. As you can imagine, where businesses have multiple offshore jurisdictions this adds significantly to compliance costs in New Zealand and provides further encouragement for those businesses to relocate offshore. 1.15 We understand the underlying principle that royalty income and licence revenue is viewed as passive income which is mobile. That said, intellectual property will find its offshore market and be taxed accordingly. We propose that the treatment of offshore or foreign sourced revenues from intellectual property based businesses be reviewed to ensure that our tax system is not creating an impediment or disincentive for those businesses to continue to be based in New Zealand and execute their international growth strategies. 1.16 We do wonder whether the normal pattern of a sale of the intellectual property in toto to an offshore owner is significantly affected by the way in which we tax international organisations headquartered in New Zealand. We think further research needs to be undertaken to establish whether there is in fact a disincentive, and what type of changes might need to be made to remove those impediments or disincentives, let alone providing any incentive compared with bricks and mortar businesses. With an increasing mobility of skills, and the ability to work remotely, it is important to review the settings applied to these businesses so that New Zealand can retain both its skills and revenues from intellectual property. If our rules provided some incentive (or remove current disincentives) for IP-based companies to headquarter in New Zealand then that could increase the level of investment capital and skills capital New Zealand has in what is a very competitive international market. 1.17 Finally, there has been much discussion regarding the fairness of our tax system and the levels of tax applied to high-net-worth individuals when considering their economic income. There is a natural segue from the preceding comments to this issue. Any form of wealth tax imposed upon high-net-worth individuals will take capital out of the productive sector and reallocate it to the public sector. From our review of budget numbers, given the growth in the economy currently and in recent times being experienced, there is sufficient tax revenues from today’s tax settings in order to fund the government expenditure. This is a complex and interrelated issue. Working for families tax credits reallocate income currently such that the bulk of tax cash flows are in fact funded by the highest income earners. There are inequities between the taxation of capital and income. However, we believe the real inequity is the rate of tax that income has born which funds consumption. By consumption we mean living expenses, which for a high-net-worth individual includes luxury houses, travel, motor cars et cetera. If we had a measure to ensure that no matter how funded, an individual pays tax based upon the amount of their consumption per annum then there would be an equity reached, combined with a Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 5 of 6 progressive tax rate scale. If a high-net-worth individual consumes the same amount as an average wage earner, and chooses to invest and continue to compound their investment capital, as opposed to consume it, then they should not be taxed differentially for doing so. As observed in the LTIB the key issue is a lack of investment capital. Taxing that investment capital on an unrealised or realised basis transfers resources from the private sector investment capital pool to the public sector social spending pool. If that transfer is not required then taking this approach reduces the investment capital available to the economy to fund future growth, which includes jobs and tax revenues which can then fund social services as the government of the day determines. Taking this approach, there is equity as between individuals if they are both taxed at marginal rates on the total consumption. We acknowledge this presents measurement issues which we have undertaken some consideration of which would tax distributions from trusts in particular having regard to the use to which the funds are applied. This approach would effectively abandon the ability to live from capital - living costs would be treated as income regardless of how they are funded, whether it be from tax paid trust income or capital gains. There would need to be credit given for underlying tax paid so that the uplift related to the additional tax paid at the natural person level depending on their marginal tax rate. The framework provided by our imputation credit regime could equally be applied to trusts to facilitate the passing through of underlying credits. 1.18 Adopting a different approach to impose a wealth tax provides a disincentive for that capital to remain in New Zealand rather than an incentive to allocate that capital to productive sources as opposed to consumption. This will exacerbate our deficit of investment capital and provide further influence to government spending with potential attendant inflation risks. The fundamental question is that capital collected via the wealth tax that is imposed due to a redistribution philosophy better invested by government or better invested productively by the private sector with consequential benefits in terms of economic growth, jobs et cetera? We think the latter approach produces a far superior economic outcome when the effect of retaining capital, and ideally attracting or encouraging the allocation of capital to productive sectors and the tax revenue that flows from that as well as employment is taken into account. Providing further capital to the government to allocate or reallocate will produce an inferior economic outcome, particularly where the government can fund all necessary social services under the current model/balance sheet. 1.19 Introducing a wealth or redistribution tax will be regressive. The current approach to provide support to lower income families through working for families is supported as an effective mechanism to ameliorate the effect of the percentage of income consumed, and which bears GST, and serves to redistribute a level of wealth via the tax take. Submission on LTIB selected issues 5 May 2022 Page 6 of 6 1.20 The palatability of proposed initiatives to impose another layer of tax which will increase the effective tax rate in New Zealand and make us less attractive as an investment destination needs to be factored into the determination of tax principles. 1.21 Why not provide a fair system to tax consumption and provide incentives to allocate capital to productive investment. That would provide an opportunity to deal with the bias towards property investment in New Zealand. 1.22 At a principle level, why should we tax the unrealised wealth of New Zealanders and take capital from the economy and allocate it to government, when the best place for that capital is to remain in its productive role. It is acceptable for individuals to be wealthy and to have created wealth as long as they are taxed fairly against their fellow man (or woman). A person who is a high consumer will pay for that whereas a person who is more frugal and focused on investment will benefit from investing in the productive sector which will benefit our economy. We would welcome further discussion on the principles that we have raised. Clearly, we do not have the resources to model the effect of taxing consumption for income tax purposes but believe it to be feasible and would result in removing much of the concern around the ability of high-net-worth individuals to reduce their marginal tax rate through tax planning and the source of funding for their consumption. Our approach does require an acceptance that no matter who owns investment capital it should be taxed in accordance with the entity which derives it, as opposed to being attributed to natural person shareholders. If the investment capital is invested productively then we should let it do its job, rather than impose economic costs and distortions by seeking to attract foreign investment capital. Adopting this approach would encourage all persons to consider investing as opposed to consuming, where possible. Yours sincerely, Brett Whyte Principal Comments on “Tax, foreign investment and productivity”: Draft long-term insights briefing, February 2022 by Jack M. Mintz President’s Fellow School of Public Policy University of Calgary April 15, 2022 General Comments By and large, this is a well-constructed detailed analysis of the impact of taxation on foreign direct investment. It contains some very useful information making the case that New Zealand has a higher cost of capital for foreign direct investment compared to OECD countries due to taxation. Its strength is its careful review of various options with respect to company tax reform, which I found particularly well developed. In my review of the document, I want to raise several general issues that need more attention for further development. Specifically, •Why do we care about foreign direct investment (as opposed to the sum of domestic and foreign controlled investment)? •What taxes should be included in evaluation of effective tax rates on capital investment and how might this affect New Zealand’s ranking? •What alternative forms of international financial arbitrage could be considered in measuring effective tax rates? •How does income and capital risk impact effective tax rates? While I will try to reference some additional papers relevant to this discussion, I am afraid that I will borrow many concepts from the work that I have developed in the past forty years. Since 1984, I have worked with Finance Canada to help develop marginal effective tax rate (METR) analysis based on original work with Robin Boadway and Neil Bruce (the first piece published in the Canadian Journal of Economics in 1984). I have published many extensions to this work over the years considering risk and tax losses, inventory holdings, small businesses, financial arbitrage and complicated issues such as tax holidays, asset-based capital taxes, minimum taxes, time-to-build capital models, resource taxation and international taxation (such as interest limitations, double-dip financing and deferral taxation of subsidiary profits). I apologize for perhaps too much attention to this work but the points I raise should be relevant to further analysis to build upon this excellent paper by New Zealand’s Inland Revenue department. Below, I begin with several general points listed above. This will be followed by very specific comments on individual paragraphs through the report. 1 EXT 01 Why foreign direct investment as focus? New Zealand’s economic growth and productivity depends on total capital formation, both private and public investment. Of private investment, both domestic and foreign direct investment is critical for growth. As the paper makes clear, it is focused on foreign direct investment as an earlier paper written by Inland Revenue addressed tax policy and productivity. However, some justification is needed as to why limited foreign direct investment is a problem as opposed to private investment in general. In some recent work, I happened to look at company investment as a share of GDP for various countries (OECD statistics), including New Zealand as shown in the figure below. As seen below, company gross fixed capital formation in New Zealand is better than Australia after 2015 and OECD countries in general. As the paper points out (page 11), foreign direct investment as a share of GDP in New Zealand is well below that in Australia and the OECD in general. Company Gross Fixed Capital Formation as a share of GDP There are differences in methodology when comparing fixed capital formation with foreign direct investment data that is important to keep in mind. Fixed capital formation is based on investment in real capital (e.g. machines, structures, and land). while foreign direct investment is typically measured as investment in foreign assets (equity and debt) with at least 10 percent ownership (which typically includes takeovers, retained earnings and greenfield investments). The point is whether New Zealand as an underinvestment problem with insufficient foreign direct investment. A considerable literature has developed over the years regarding the benefits and costs of foreign direct investment. Benefits include access to international technology and management, higher rates of innovation and better productivity. It would be valuable for both policymakers and the public to know this literature and any documentation of FDI benefits in New Zealand. 2 What are the relevant tax policies impacting investment? The paper focuses on company income taxes and withholding taxes on related and unrelated party debt interest. Yet, when it comes to the taxation of capital investment, several other taxes should also be considered including sales taxes on capital purchases, asset-based taxes (capital taxes and property taxes), and transfer taxes (stamp duties, real estate transfer taxes and financial transaction taxes which can impact interest rates). Non-credited withholding taxes on royalties and fees are also relevant. Data limitations might make it difficult to include some taxes such as municipal property taxes that are not easily measured by industry for most countries. The New Zealand paper focuses on firm-level taxation for large companies and both firm and individual level taxation on dividends and capital gains (the latter absent in Australia) for small businesses. I will discuss below the issue of international financial arbitrage in an open economy. However, it is appropriate to exclude New Zealand’s personal taxation in evaluating effe ctive tax rates on FDI. Some accounting firms will include taxes on labour such as payroll and personal income taxes in the cost of capital. This is incorrect to do so since it biases upwards effective tax rates. To understand this point, suppose two taxes are imposed on companies: company income taxes and an employer payroll tax. As often measured by some analysts, the effective tax rate would be equal to firm level taxes divided by profits gross of the company income and payroll taxes. However, the denominator of the effective tax rate is also expressed as after-tax profits plus company and payroll taxes. If the capital-labour ratio goes to zero, the effective tax rate is basically payroll taxes divided by payroll tax, or 100 percent. Instead, one should measure effective tax rates separately on capital, labour and other inputs (such as energy) and aggregate them to measure an effective tax rate on the marginal cost of production. 1 In work that I have done over the years 2 , we include sales taxes on capital purchases (which are important in some countries when some sales taxes are not refundable such as in Brazil, United States and Canada), asset-based taxes (except municipal property taxes), transfer taxes and withholding taxes applied to both residents and non-resident investors. The New Zealand paper covers the relevant ones for New Zealand since VAT is refundable for businesses and no transfer and general asset-based taxes are applied. However, when comparing rankings, it makes a significant difference as to which taxes are included. In our calculations, the stamp duty in Australia adds about 3 points to the METR, which would result in Australia having a 1 See K. McKenzie, J. Mintz and K. Scharf, “The Measuring Effective Tax Rate in the Presence of Multiple Inputs: A Production-Based Approach”, International Tax and Public Finance, Vol 4 (3), 1997, 337 - 360. 2 For the latest version, see Philip Bazel and Jack Mintz, “2020 Tax Competitiveness Report: Canada’s In vestment Challenge” , SPP Research Paper 14(21), The School of Public Policy, University of Calgary, September 2021. Finance Canada also includes sales taxes on capital purchases and asset-based taxes except property taxes. They do not include withholding taxes and real estate transfer taxes. 3 higher METR than New Zealand. The retail sales tax in the United States adds almost 5 points to the METR which in aggregate is 22.6 percent. The OECD work only focuses on company income taxes as pointed out by the paper. It is also quite selective with sectoral and asset coverage which includes manufacturing, office buildings estate, transportation, communication, power, computers, software and research and development. 3 Excluded are resource sectors (agriculture, forestry, mining and oil/gas/coal) and other service sectors (business services (including many technology firms), construction, finance, wholesale and retail trade). The paper should acknowledge these limitations as various other studies have a wider breadth of coverage such as the Congressional Budget Office (United States) and Finance Canada. 4 The important question, after adding more sectors and assets to the model, is whether it makes any difference to the qualitative conclusion that New Zealand investment is more heavily taxed with a METR of 20.1 percent than most OECD countries except for Costa Rica, Japan and Chile (company income tax only). It is also above the OECD average of roughly 23 percent. In our work, using tax depreciation of 2 percent (declining balance) for structures, the New Zealand METR would be 25.7 percent. However, with our estimates, New Zealand’s METR would be below five OECD countries: Japan (38.8 percent), South Korea (29.3 percent), Australia (28.1 percent), France (28.0 percent) and Germany at 26.1 percent). 5 6 Many 3 As the New Zealand paper notes, research and development is a small portion of capital in its METR model, consistent with most other studies. What should also be noted is that R&D might be supported by grants instead of tax support. For example, the US relies much more grants than tax support, which would result in a lower METR on capital if such support were included. In our work, we often exclude R&D since an international comparison should include both grants and tax support. When we have included tax and grant support, the METR declines by less than two points. 4 Construction, mining and oil/gas and research and development are particularly complex to model since it involves a time-to-build model with two stages . Inputs (exploration, research and development, labour and capital) are hired to build capital (an office building, mineral reserves or a product) which takes several years. Once the capital is available for use (a building, reserves or patent), production takes place that leads to depreciation, amortization or depletion of the capital. For an example of time-to-build modelling for oil and gas, see J. Mintz, “Taxes, Royalties and Cross-Border Investments,” in International Taxation and the Extractive Industries, ed. P. Daniel et al. (Washington D. C.: International Monetary Fund, Routledge, New York and London, 2016). 5 In Bazel and Mintz 2021 (and earlier work), we use Finance Canada estimated economic depreciation rates for assets based on relatively up-to-date Statistics Canada analysis rather than BEA data that is out-dated. The average declining balance economic depreciation rate for structures is 6.7 percent (declining balance), over twice as high as average industrial and commercial depreciation rate used by New Zealand. An important factor in these est imates is the degree to which capital good prices fall, which might be higher in a Canada depending on the type of structures involved and temperature. However, Statistics Canada did find a substantial increase in economic depreciation in the past several years due to technological obsolescence (pipeline depreciation rates, for example, doubled when estimates were made in the past decade and half compared to the 1980s). 6 If we matched the economic depreciation rate to tax depreciation rate at 2 percent for a METR of 19.8 percent, New Zealand would have a METR below 12 countries: Belgium (23.3 percent), Costa Rica 23.1 percent), United States (22.6 percent) Portugal 22.1 percent), United Kingdom (21.2 percent), Austria ( 20.6 percent) and Norway 4 countries that end up having a higher METR than New Zealand are due to other taxes on capital such as transfer taxes (Australia, France, Germany, South Korea and United States), asset-based taxes (Japan and United States) and sales taxes on capital purchases (United States). The point is that there METR measurements vary significantly depending on the coverage of capital-related taxes, sectors, assumptions, and estimated parameters. The paper might wish to refer to some other studies to support the conclusion that New Zealand is a relatively high- tax country with respect to FDI. International Financial Arbitrage The most vexing problem in modelling effective tax rates on capital is with respect to financial arbitrage. Company investors include individuals who pay personal income tax on dividends and realized capital gains, pension funds that typically pay no tax on their capital income (although Australia is an exception) and non-residents who pay New Zealand withholding taxes and company or personal income taxes to their host governments. The key issue is that there are host of different tax rates across individual and intermediary investors. Taking into account both company and personal taxes, some models have equalized before-tax rates of return on capital with differing after-tax returns. Others, perhaps arguably better grounded in theory, equalize the after-personal-tax returns earned by investors. Another approach is for the firm to be indifferent in issuing debt and equity (the cost of debt net of company tax savings is equal to the cost of equity finance), which implies after-personal-tax rates of return vary. The New Zealand paper makes crucial assumptions that are helpful in sorting out international financial arbitrage. Foreign-owned multinational operating in New Zealand would invest in capital at the international rate of interest for debt and cost of equity finance. New Zealand savings are too small to affect the international cost of funds as it is a small open economy. Some empirical support might lend itself to home bias, based on asymmetric information, in equity financing that would be relevant to New Zealand-owned enterprises but for foreign- owned company investments in New Zealand companies, home bias is less relevant. The paper assumes that the international interest rate on bonds is not equal to cost of finance on page 7 in the appendix, but these are equated in value (paragraph 2.13 page 12). This is a questionable assumption if investor tax rates on equity and debt are not the same. If one were to consider a global financial equilibrium, the international cost of funds at the margin would come from the investor who is indifferent between debt and equity, considering both company and personal income taxes 7 . This would be a global individual investor as corporate financial (20 percent). I note that the OECD estimate of the METR for Canada is about half of the estimate made by Finance Canada primarily due to the ab sence of many sectors and certain non-company income taxes. 7 The marginal source comes from investors who would be indifferent between equity and bond assets (Miller, M. H. 1977. “Debt and Taxes.” Journal of Finance, vol. 32: 261–275. 1977). This implies that the marginal investor would be taxed on income with equal effective tax rates on equity and bonds, accounting for both corporate and 5 intermediaries and untaxed pension funds would prefer debt for tax reasons to avoid paying the company income tax. The paper might want to include some sensitivity calculations for different forms of international tax arbitrage in terms of how it impacts the cost of capital. A significant advantage of the New Zealand paper model is to invoke an assumption similar to a static trade-off model for debt finance whereby companies trade off the bankruptcy/risk costs of debt finance with benefits of corporate tax deductibility. A weighted average cost of funds is used to discount future cash flows and the value of tax depreciation allowances. 8 Assuming the international investor is the marginal source of finance, the cost of equity would therefore be below the interest rate since the equity income is typically taxed more favourably (ignoring risk which is discussed below). One could also include bankruptcy cost in the cost of debt as well (by using a corporate bond rate). However, the relevant personal taxes that affects the cost of equity finance depend on some sort of financial theory explaining dividend and retained earnings decisions. The “new” dividend theory argues that retained earnings is the marginal source equity finance (consistent with the “pecking-order” model of finance) so that dividend taxes are irrelevant in that they are capitalized in equity values. The after-tax cost of equity finance is therefore determined by the cost of finance reduced by (accrual-equivalent) capital gains taxes for the international investor which would be equal to the bond interest rate net of personal taxes paid on bond income. An alternative approach is the “traditional dividend theory” whereby dividends convey information to investors about the company’s performance – both dividend and capital gains taxes affect the cost of equity finance. For the international investor, the after-personal tax cost of equity finance is reduced by both accrual-equivalent capital gains taxes and the dividend tax. 9 Two additional complications are relevant to international arbitrage: incentives for foreign multinationals to finance investment in New Zealand with debt and incentive to shift profits out of New Zealand. personal taxes. Ass uming binding constraints limiting short selling of securities, other investors would only hold debt or equity depending on their tax rates. Suppose the marginal investor is not taxed on capital gains and dividends at the individual level but fully taxed on interest. This would imply that the marginal investor holding New Zealand stocks would have an investor tax rate on interest equal to 28 per cent (those with higher personal tax rates would only buy equity and those with lower tax rates would buy only bonds). 8 This approach is similar to A. Auerbach (https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\_papers/w0254/w0254.pdf) and R. Boadway, N. Bruce and J. Mintz, “Taxation, Inflation and the Effective Marginal Tax Rate on Capital in Canada”, Canadian Journal of Economics, 1984, 17 (1), 62-79. The OECD model is based on King and Fullerton (1984) that calculated METRs for each type of finance and then aggregated the METRs resulting in different discount rates for cash flows and tax depreciation allowances. No particular financial theory would support this latter approach. 9 If international investors equate the after-tax returns on equity and bonds, then i(1-m) = r(1 -t), with i = bond interest rate, r = cost of equity finance, m = tax rate on interest income and t= tax rate on equity income. For the average G-7 individual investor we estimate the interest tax rate is 28 percent and the weighted average dividend and accrual-equivalent capital gains tax on equity income to be 22 percent. That implies the net -of-risk cost of equity finance to be about four-fifths of the bond interest rate. 6 Companies prefer to finance their international operations with debt issued in countries with high company tax rates and weak currencies (currencies that depreciate due to risk or high inflation). With a weak currency, a bond’s expected value will fall leading to a capital loss. If the capital gains tax rate is below the regular tax rate, a firm issuing the bond in a country with a weak currency will benefit from this tax differential. Such exchange rate gains and losses could impact on the cost of finance for a subsidiary operating in New Zealand. Until recently, New Zealand has had a relatively low inflation rate at a strong credit rating (unlike the 1980s and early 1990s when Kiwi bonds issued by multinationals were popular). The primary incentive for multinationals to issue bonds in New Zealand is to take advantage of its relatively high company tax rate compared to many countries with company tax rates below 28 percent. As the paper notes, foreign companies might use more debt relative to assets, reducing the METR. However, New Zealand’s inflation rate has climbed to six percent. Although less than the United States, it is above some other countries like China and Japan that could result in further debt financing in New Zealand. Like other countries, New Zealand has developed transfer pricing and thin capitalization rules to limit base erosion. However, some of these ru les add additional complexity to modelling the METR. The thin capitalization rule is based on the ratio of New Zealand debt/asset ratio to the worldwide average. In the theoretical section of the paper (pp. 23 to 25), it does not appear that the theory for modelling investment takes into account the impact of capital investment and debt on the ability to deduct interest expense. Higher capital investment in New Zealand reduces the ratio of debt to assets (equity plus debt) enabling the company to issue more debt in New Zealand and lower the METR. 10 A further complication is related to tax planning that could impact the METR calculation. With transfer pricing, investment in New Zealand will generate income that is partly taxed in other countries to the extent that profits are shifted abroad. This results in a lower METR on capital for FDI. If companies are using tax structures that enable “double dipping” for interest, the cost of finance will be much lower as company is able to deduct interest expense in multiple jurisdictions. 11 Without data, it is difficult to determine how much the METR is affected by tax planning strategies that are partly curtailed by thin capitalization rules. However, these issues need further exploration. To that end, the global minimum company income tax will also affect the METR to the extent a company pays the top-up-tax either in the jurisdiction where the parent resides or in New Zealand should it impose a qualifying domestic minimum tax. While New Zealand company income tax rate is well above the minimum rate, it is possible some companies might pay 10 See R. Altshuler and J. Mintz, “U.S. Interest Allocation Rules: Effects and Policy”, International Tax and Public Finance, Vol. 2, No. 1, 1995, pp 7-36. analysis of the US water-edge interest limitation based on debt divided by domestic and net foreign assets. While these differ in impact compared to a world-wide ratio used by New Zealand, the point is that such rules can impact the METR calculation. See also Chen and Mintz 2009 at https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection\_2010/fin/F34-3- 13- 2009-eng.pdf. 11 See Jack Mintz and Alfons Weichenrieder, The Indirect Side of Direct Investment, (MIT Press), 2010. 7 minimum tax with relatively fast write offs for capital (which is circumscribed in New Zealand). Much of this new with effects not fully understood yet. Risk The New Zealand recognized that the analysis becomes significantly complex when risk is considered (Appendix p. 28). It could be criticized for ignoring risk, but this is not the case. If risk is associated with income or gross profits (revenues net of current costs) and companies can fully write off losses on marginal investment from inframarginal profits, the model used is quite consistent. Leaving aside investor personal taxation, investors hold equity so long as the expected return on equity net of risk is equal to the bond interest rate. With full loss deductions, the cost of risk is implicitly deducted from the company income tax base, thereby resulting in risk not affecting the effective tax rate measure. For example, suppose the expe cted return on equity is 10 percent and cost of risk is 6 percent, leaving a net-of-risk return on equity equal to 4 percent. If the safe bond interest rate is 4 percent, the investor is indifferent between equity and bonds. Should the government impose a profit tax equal to 50 percent, after tax expected return falls from 10 to 5 percent. The cost of risk falls from 6 to 3 percent (due to full sharing of losses), leaving a net of risk return on equity equal to 2 percent. If bond interest is subject to a 50 percent tax rate as well, then the after-tax return falls from 4 to 2 percent. The investor is still indifferent between equity and bonds. If the expected return on equity is increased by one point as well as the risk premium, the effective tax rate remains the same at 50 percent. As the paper acknowledges, these equivalencies with respect to risk break down in two ways. The first is related to “capital risk” 12 , which arises from unknown economic depreciation of assets. Since tax depreciation is based on historical prices, the government does not share such capital risk. The capital risk term is added to the economic depreciation term, which is not multiplied by one minus the company tax rate. Given net revenues streams generated by capital investment are taxed, the lack of capital risk sharing raises the METR. It is not known how to measure this risk although Bulow and Summers used the risk premium from stock markets as a proxy. 13 The New Zealand paper notes this but wisely does not provide any estimates of capital risk impacts given the lack of estimates. Income risk impacts the METR when loss offsetting is restricted. Even if losses are carried forward, they are not indexed at a nominal interest rate. The losses may also expire with a firm (although might be transferred to another company in a takeover). The New Zealand paper recognizes this issue but misses an important conclusion. Depending on its history, the lack of 12 As termed by J. I. Bulow and L. H. Summers, \[1984\]: "The Taxation of Risky Assets," Journal of Political Economy, 92, 20-39. 13 The METR should be calculated based on the cost of capital measured net of both depreciation and income or capital risk. V. Jog and J. Mintz, “Corporate Tax Reform and its Economic Impact: An Evalua tion of the June 18, 1987 Proposals”, in Economic Impacts of Tax Reform, ed. with J. Whalley, Canadian Tax Foundation, Toronto, 1989 . 1989 show the impact of capital risk on the METR for Canada compared to the METR when only income risk is present. The METR is exceptionally higher using stock market premia. 8 loss offset under income risk can lead to higher or lower METRs. For those with a history of profits but incurring losses for the first time or start-up companies, the lack of loss-offsetting increases the cost of capital and the METR. However, if a firm is carrying forward past tax losses, the cost capital and METR may be reduced since profits are sheltered from taxation. 14 Obviously, i t would be very difficult to assess the impact of risk on New Zealand companies without detailed history on the timing of profits and losses in each sector. It should be recognized that some sectors might be more impacted by risk resulting in potentially higher METRs by examining estimates of equity risk premia. Further, international studies could be used to compare New Zealand’s risk premia with other countries to understand the potential bias to enable some sensitivity calculations. Conclusion: What is the best company tax? As I final comment, I return to an overarching question that is quite relevant to company tax reform: what is the best company tax structure for productivity and competitiveness? Many companies will argue for competitiveness whereby a tax break might be needed given tax preferences available in other countries. This leads to a non-neutral domestic policy with some sectors more heavily taxed than others. An alternative view is not to compete on a case-by- case basis with other jurisdictions. Instead, one should pursue neutrality with equal tax burdens across business activities within New Zealand to improve productivity within New Zealand. The New Zealand paper makes a strong case for the latter (par. 2.28 in the main paper) in explaining the value of neutrality in this respect even if other trading countries choose a different approach favouring some jurisdictions. 14 See R. Altshuler and A. Auerbach, “The Significance of Tax Law Asymmetries: An Empirical Investigation” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 105, No. 1 (Feb., 1990), pp. 61-86. 9 Detailed Comments Below I provide a list of other comments beginning with the main document numbered by each paragraph rather than page. 1.18 One might want to use the word “reduce” rather than “cut” since the latter is harsher in sound. Figure 1.4: The switch in colours for countries compared to the earlier graphs makes it harder for the reader to follow. New Zealand should be red throughout. 1.27 The cost of capital formula could be adjusted for capital gains on holding assets as noted later. Economic depreciation is equal to d-q (d= physical wear and tear and q= real capital gains). One can modify equatio by imposing a tax rate on real capital gains for holding assets (the real capital gains can be obtained from deflators for assets assuming they are available). That would give NZ an advantage but empirically show how important it might be compared to other countries. 1.29 There are other small markets around the world (e.g. Ireland) that attract a lot of FDI. 1.32 Even if there are externalities, one cannot conclude what is the best form of intervention. Research support might be better given through a grant system rather than through the tax system as noted here. Further, if the global minimum tax goes through, NZ might want to switch tax credits into grants. 2.18 Do you have any estimates of “rents”. Once rents are adjusted for risk, how much is actually earned in NZ. If small, why worry about it? Further, are taxing rents accruing to foreigners appropriate or is it a form of tax exportation (as a fiscal externality)? Should rents be taxed on a source or consumption basis (note the VAT collects rents on a consumption basis for a country)? 3.3 As mentioned earlier, it would be helpful to make clear what assets, sectors and other key assumptions are used in the Hanappi OECD paper. Perhaps a box describing its methodology would be useful since the NZ paper relies so much on the OECD model comparisons. 3.9 Not sure I understand the statement here. A NZ multinational could be New Zealand controlled but still have a large portion (even majority) of its shares owned by non-residents. I know in Canada many large Canadian-controlled companies have significant non-resident ownership. 3.16 A point often forgotten is that a firm reinvesting profits causes its share value to increase (perhaps dollar for dollar). This results in capital gains that in many countries is taxable at least on a realization basis. Note NZ had top personal rate equal to the corporate income tax rate at one time – one could make a case for shares not be to be subject to capital gains taxes (as I 10 recall the top dividend tax rate net of the credit would also be zero if the company paid profit taxes at an effective rate equal to the top personal rate). With the drop in company income tax rates below the NZ top personal tax rates, capital gains taxation becomes more critical as noted in the paper. 4.4 Tax depreciation rates are provided throughout. It would be useful to readers to make clear that all reported rates are for declining balance (I understand that straightline can be used for real estate). 4.8 Some explanation is needed to explain why assets with faster depreciation rates have higher effective tax rates with inflation at 2 percent compared to no inflation. Inflation raises the cost of inventory and depreciable capital since cost deductions are based on historical prices. However, the deductibility of nominal interest is a benefit to the firm. The intuition is that assets that turnover more often than longer-lived assets, face a higher penalty (it is opposite of the argument made by Arnold Harberger that an investment tax credit favours investment in short-lived assets). I did differentiate the cost of capital with respect to the inflation rate using the assumption that a one-point increase in inflation causes the nominal interest rates to rise by one point. However, there is an alternative assumption: with personal taxation on nominal interest (and fixed after-tax return on bonds and equity), inflation would cause returns to rise by more than one point (a factor equal to 1 divided by the one minus the personal tax rate on equity or debt in this case). The appendix should be used to clarify these results. 4.8 It should be pointed out whether FIFO is used for inventory valuation as well as an assumption that inventories are held for less than one year. It is not immediately clear that the result is the same for the case of investment with 100% economic depreciation. 4.20 and 4.21 I am puzzled by the argument in this paragraph that a fully creditable withholding tax on interest causes the cost of borrowing to New Zealand to fall. It did not make sense to me in a typical small open economy setting. The effective tax rate might rise since both the company and fully creditable withholding tax are included as taxes (in the absence of the NRWT there would no NZ revenue but there would be foreign taxes payable that are not included in the METR). This does raise an issue about measuring the METR for NZ taxes, ignoring taxes paid by the parent. 5.4 The point that reductions in company income taxes removes the tax on profits earned on old capital is correct. However, this could be offset by a one-time wealth tax on the company to capture the benefit (this was suggested by the US Treasury report in 1984 when Reagan tax reform was proposed). 5.19 When discussing options for reform some mention should be made about the global minimum tax. Given NZ’s company income tax rate, modest reductions will not have an impact on minimum taxes. However, accelerated depreciation and tax credits could be clawed back. 11 5.19 I agree that indexation for inflation is complicated but perhaps worthy when inflation rates become high enough. Also, removing indexation is a signal of tougher monetary policy to curb inflation. Of OECD countries, Mexico corrects liabilities for inflation as well as depreciation, inventory costs and capital gains. Chile has a partial correction for the liability side. Other countries that index profits for inflation include Argentina and, on the asset side, the Dominican Rep ublic. As mentioned, some countries dropped indexation such as Israel and Brazil when inflation was controlled. However, even at 2 percent, inflation does create distortions. 5.19 The allowance for corporate equity will result in more companies in a tax loss position. If losses deductions are restricted, that creates a more unstable company tax over time (the move to lower rates and broaden bases in the mid-1980s was in part driven by the instability caused by growing loss pools). If losses are fully refundable, NZ could become a dumping ground for losses if other countries do not provide full loss refundability. 6.18 Does the global minimum tax put a floor on income from intangibles only. The carveout eventually equal to 5 percent of labour compensation and tangible assets may not be equal to income earned on tangible assets. 6.20 It is not clear as to why one cannot have a separate rent tax on location-specific rents over and above the company income tax. In fact, many countries do this for resource profits that are location specific . For example, the British Columbia, Alberta, UK and Norway have a general company tax applied to all sectors and then a specific company tax applied to rents earned by mining or oil and gas companies (in Alberta and British Columbia the additional tax is called a royalty or mining profit tax respectively, but it is essentially a rent tax for oil sands and mining respectively). If the company income tax is reduced, Norway raises the specific company tax rate as an offset. If rents are not related to location but instead innovation, what would be the implication for company tax policy in NZ? This should be made clear. 6.29 The problem of imposing a rent tax with full taxation of dividends and realized capital gains is that it becomes a double tax on rents. Companies will have an incentive to pay out rents in deductible payments like royalties, employment compensation or fees. The Mirrlees Report was consistent in that it recommended rent taxation at both the personal and company levels. 6.33 Even in 2019 and 2020, the weighted average company income tax rate among OECD countries has slightly fallen (not increased). However, some countries have been raising rates. It is true the simple and weighted average company income tax rates have fallen over time but a wide variation in statutory tax rates across countries remains. The race to the bottom is not leading to convergence to zero. I believe 137 countries have not signed the agreement for Pillar Two at this point although the final outcome still hinges on unanimity in Europe and US Congress passing legislation. If countries put in place the minimum tax, some might reduce the general company income tax rate to maintain productivity or competitiveness, as some experts predict. 12 7.3 It could be mentioned that the investment tax credit is equal to accelerated depreciation multiplied by the company income tax rate (under the global minimum tax accelerated depreciation will be preferable given the approach to timing differences and deferred tax liabilities that maintain some value – the ITC benefit can be entirely clawed back). 7.7 One could introduce an allowance for inventory costs as an offset for inflation that has been adopted by some countries in the past. 7.15 It is not at clear that only taxpaying firms with high METRs are of concern. Start-up companies could have an even higher METR by not being able to use cost deductions when in a loss position (the METR could be higher than the taxpaying firm METR). 7.17 One could have different acceleration depreciation rates for structures and machinery to provide a “neutral” tax preference for different economic depreciation rates. 8.16 If inflation provides a benefit to companies issuing debt but results in higher taxes on interest income for bond investors, is a correction for liabilities required if corporate and personal income tax rates are equal? 9.2 If there are specific liabilities associated with subsidiaries in a country, different from the corporate group, equity and debt financing may not be perfect substitutes. Further, managerial incentives for a subsidiary are affected by the choice of internal debt versus equity. 9.4 Given opportunities for tax planning, such as double-dip interest deductions, the high NZ company income tax rate makes such planning more attractive (tax relief is the sum of company tax rates faced by the parent and subsidiary). 9.5 As mentioned above, the METR is affected by the ratio of global debt to assets used to limit interest deductions. A company increasing its investment in New Zealand will find it can write off more interest expense, giving an extra incentive for investment. In other words, thin capitalization could actually reduce the cost of capital when this happens. This should be explicitly modelled. 10.5 It should be mentioned that the ACE recommended by the Mirrlees report would be compatible its suggested personal tax reform, which uses a tax free allowance for savings. This is much different than keeping capital income taxes at the personal level. 10.6 The ACE removes the tax on marginal inbound investments if we know how to measure the true normal rate of return that exempts profits. Using the government long term bond rate might not be sufficient to recognize risk when loss offsetting is imperfect, as the paper mentioned below. Further, marginal investments for multinational companies might have negative METRs if they can borrow abroad to finance investment in NZ, getting a second deduction for equity costs (a point recognized elsewhere) as found in Belgium. Further, 13 companies can lease capital abroad and still benefit from ACE. International tax planning will be easier. 10.9 If the global minimum tax is adopted by New Zealand would ACE be clawed back? Box on page 77. I suggest adding the word “taxable” in front of retained earnings. 10.14 How would the risk premium be assessed? If loss offsetting is imperfect or firms are credit constrained (eg. smaller companies), we really don’t know how to measure the appropriate interest rate. If the allowance is wrong, the METR will be higher or lower than zero. If one looks at carry forward rates for cash flow taxes in Australia, Canada, Norway and UK, they are all over the map. Further, the ACE will increase the incidence of non-taxpaying companies that in itself creates instability in the tax system as companies try to trade tax losses. 11.3 One could also mention investor or equity financing tax credit incentives. These often undermine productivity since it encourages companies with poor economic prospects to issue equity to investors who are focussed on tax benefits. 11.12 Would a patent box regime with benefits tied to R&D activities be a good idea? 11.4 It would be useful to understand how much location-specific rent is earned in NZ. 11.15 Not all countries are able to get away with 78 percent tax rates on rents (most countries provide a deduction of the rent tax from taxable company income). It helps that the Norwegian government has a controlling share of some of its oil and gas companies. Countries with low rents and political instability provide a greater share of rents to attract the top resource companies. Note the METR with a resource rent tax is not zero when the company income tax is based on shareholder profits (there are important interaction effects), a point that I have made in several papers. 11.18 In a principal-agent model with the government as owner of the resource serving as the principal and the agent being a company with unknown quality, the contract will result in rent sharing in order to attract the best agent to satisfy a participation constraint (see Laffont and Mortimont). The discussion regarding Norway is more theoretical than consistent with experience. 11.23 Perhaps more should be said about tax holidays that many countries use (happily not New Zealand). Such holidays can result in higher METRs than the regular system given the lack of interest deductibility and mandatory accelerated depreciation as a company with long-lived assets has little depreciation to be taken at the end of the holiday. They open opportunities for tax planning as well. 12.3 With regard to full relief for double taxation do you include both dividends and capital gains? Capital gains arising from after-tax reinvested profits have already been taxed once. 14 Footnote 41 Company income tax collections depend not only on company tax policy. Norway has significant company tax revenues due to resource profits (Canada collects now 4 percent of GDP in company tax revenues largely due to its resource-based industrial structure). It might be useful to show what company tax revenues come from which sectors in New Zealand early in the document. 12.8 A significant reason for Sweden adopting the dual income tax was to reduce the disparity in effective tax rates on housing versus other assets. With mortgage interest deductibility and an insufficient including of imputed rent in the tax base, many Swedes refinanced their homes with debt resulting in tax losses from home ownership that was used to reduce their taxes. The dual income reduced the incentive to finance housing with debt (I heard this in a seminar given by one of the key individuals involved with the reform). 12.11 In recent years with negative real rates, taxation of nominal interest drives the real rate even more negative. This provides additional incentive for investment by borrowers, making the distortion even worse. 12.27 The exempt return is problematical to estimate for reasons given above. With negative interest rates for government bonds in Europe, some countries have had to adjust their allowance policies. Comments on the appendix. 1.6 I would have introduced interest deductibility under the company tax in equation 1. It is done later so at least provide a forewarning since it is surprising not to see it here. It is provided clearly later in equation (4). While I would have started with a different cost of finance, I do find the presentation otherwise quite well done especially the clarity with equation (4). 1.8 Should depreciation be discounted by the nominal weighted average cost of finance (adjusted for company income taxes), not the real discount rate? The analysis later makes clear it is nominal finance costs that are used for discounting. Again, it would have been easier to have started with nominal and real costs and taxation in equation (1). 1.13 I am not clear how A is calculated until presented in 1.22. Some reference should be provided to the later discussion. 1.29 A reminder for a reader should be given why “m” is the appropriate tax rate given the imputation system for dividends. 2.13 As I mentioned above in discussion international financial arbitrage, it is not clear that the real return on equity should be equal to the real return on debt. Perhaps some justification should be provided here like equal personal tax rates for the marginal investor including zero. 15 2.16 It might be useful to different the cost of capital with respect to P show that the cost of capital rises by A(1-t) so that assets written off more quickly (higher A) results in a bigger inflationary impact. I derived this under the assumption that nominal interest rates rise point by point with inflation. 2.20 Are debt and assets based on market value, real values or book values? 2.28 It would be useful to be clear about inventory valuation under the company taxlaw. Is it FIFO, LIFO, averaging or optional? If averaging, then that affect the cost of capital by reducing the inflationary impact by a half. 2.54 It does not seem to me that actual interest rate limitation has been modelled to derive the METR. I should mention it can be complicated when the parent also faces an interest rate limitation rule in their own jurisdiction as well. No one has modelled both sides that I know of. 16 Comments on: “Draft Long-term Insights Briefing Paper: Tax, Foreign Investment and Productivity” These comments combine reflections on both elements of the Draft LTIB: the Main Report (MR) and the Technical Appendices (TA). A.OVERALL ASSESSMENT This is impressive work, and was a pleasure to read. I learnt a good deal, not only on New Zealand specifics, but also on the assessment of alternative corporate tax regimes more broadly. The coverage is comprehensive and appropriate. 1 The technical analysis is careful and clear—it is of the highest professional standards. The presentation of pros and cons of the reform options is very balanced. And the exposition strikes a good balance between comprehensibility and rigor. The Draft LTIB thus does an admirable job of reaching the objective set out in MR ¶12 “of “start\[ing\] a conversation on what people see as the most important objectives for reform and whether particular reforms are worth considering further. enabling an informed public discussion of these issues.” All this means that my comments are relatively minor, being mainly suggestions for clarification or elaboration. I hope they are helpful. B.GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 1.Framing the Problem Exaggerating somewhat, the report is rooted in two claims: (1) Conceptually, a higher EMTR than is found in other countries is a—implicitly, the—major potential tax impediment to inward investment, and (2) Empirically, there is reason to suppose that EMTRs in New Zealand are indeed high relative to those found elsewhere, because of the OECD work cited. Both elements—especially (1)—may merit some elaboration. In turn: What about the effective average rate of tax? One strand in the literature has highlighted the potential importance of the effective average tax rate (EATR), 2 rather than the EMTR, in driving cross-border location decisions. The classic example is of a case in which some lumpy investment must be located in either of two countries: if pre-tax profitability is the same, it will be located wherever total tax is the lowest; and that total tax will reflect not just the EMTR but also, independently, the statutory rate (because the latter influences the rate at which intra-marginal earnings (rent) are taxed). And of course EATRs and EMTRs, while linked, do not necessarily track each other, in the sense that a high (or low) EATR can go with a low (or high) EMTR. The authors are of course fully aware of this, and mention the EATR in MR ¶3.2. So it seems to be a conscious decision not to pursue the EATR aspect—it would be helpful to know the reason! Some working in this area do appear to see the arbitrariness of the assumptions needed to calculate 1 I have just one observation on this below. 2 Following in particular Devereux and Griffiths (2003). EXT-02 forward-looking EATRs as a major weakness (this not the first paper I have noted to be quietly reluctant to use EATRs)—but they are arguably not much more so than those needed to calculate EMTRs. Or perhaps the view is that a comparison of EMTRs and statutory rates is just as informative—though then perhaps the report might linger a little more on the statutory rate aspects and their significance not just for transfer pricing issues but also for location decisions. In any case, the reader may wonder if available EATR numbers tell much the same story as the OECD’s EMTRs. Table A below reports two such readily available sets of numbers for OECD members: one is from the Oxford University Center of Business Taxation (CBT), the other from one column (chosen more of less randomly) in Table 3 of Hannapi (cited in the report). These do show New Zealand as being on the high side in terms of the EATR, though not dramatically so: New Zealand has the 9 th or 13 th (respectively) highest EATR. In both sets of figures, moreover, this is not far off the mean: 3 less than one standard deviation in each case. What about other estimates of the EMTR? The OECD estimates of EMTRs naturally come with some stamp of authority. But they are not the only estimates, and one might wonder if others—not necessarily better, but also not necessarily worse—tell the same story. The last two columns of Table A report estimates from CBT and Bazel and Mintz (2021). These leave rather different impressions: New Zealand is 5 th in the CBT numbers, which us reassuringly similar to the OECD, but noticeably lower, at 13 th , in Barzel-Mintz. If one looks beyond the ranking, however, to the likely significance of New Zealand’s difference from others, even in the CBT case the EMTR is only a little more than one standard deviation from the mean. 4 So,,,, One takeaway from all this may be that New Zealand may not be quite such an outlier as the Table in MR Figure 3.1 Panel B may suggest, at least in terms of the EATR that arguably most matters for Inward investment. Perhaps more important, however, it may be worth highlighting earlies the health warnings around the use of METRs: that they provide “no more than a partial insight” (MR ¶3.2) and that “ Small changes in assumptions can lead to large differences in reported EMTRs. Moreover, as will be discussed in later chapters, they can affect conclusions.” (TA ¶2.72)—not least, it might be added, they can also change rankings; and rankings themselves can mislead if they reflect very small differences. Indeed one 3 The mean turns out to be much the same as the median. 4 What also stands out from the table is how different can be the estimated EMTRs, for the same country, under the different methodologies: for Japan, for instance, CBT has an EMTR of 19.2 while Bazel-Mintz has 28.7. (Strikingly, however, those for New Zealand are very similar: though not much can be read into that, given the apparent differences in methodologies, reflected in a very different means). This also implied that the ordering of countries—not just the position of New Zealand—can be very different: for instance, the 4 countries with the highest EMTRs are entirely different in the CBT and Bazel and Mintz (2021) numbers. The differences (beyond levels) between the estimates are much smaller for the EATR, though other columns in Hannapi might give a different conclusion. lesson of the report—implicit, but perhaps worth making explicitly—is that one needs to look much deeper than the kinds of rankings of “the” METR that so naturally attract attention. 2. What significance of the Inclusive Framework agreement? While there a few references to developments in the Inclusive Framework, this is such a major development in cross-border international taxation, that it might be useful to consider explicitly its implications for New Zealand and for thinking about the various reform options. These implications may be limited—and I imagine much work on this is underway!—but if so it would be helpful to understand if and why that is the view taken in the Report. Two aspects come to mind in relation to Pillar 2 (the minimum tax): a. It may very well be that the moderately high rate and broad base mean that few entities in New Zealand will currently have effective rates below 15 percent and so be subject to the top up. Is that a basic assumption of the analysis? Even if that is so, one could imagine that some of the incentives discussed in general terms in Chapter 11 might bring effective rates for affected entities below 15 percent, so that their effect would be to some degree (though not wholly) diluted—this may be worth noting as potentially limiting their effectiveness. (Perhaps too, as noted below, mention might be made of non-refundable tax credits as one way to get an entity’s total tax below the otherwise absolute minimum of 15 percent of excess profit). The Pillar 2 rules of course will only apply, however, for multinational groups large enough to be in-scope of the minimum: is the presumption that there are or will be no such multinationals large enough to be likely affected by any incentives that New Zealand might consider, or an implication that they would/ought to be designed not to apply to such entities? b. Even if New Zealand is not directly affected by the minimum, its application elsewhere will have indirect effects that might be significant: -Outward profit shifting will presumably be less of a concern, as, with global adoption, the lowest rate achievable elsewhere would be in the region of 15 percent. That may reduce pressures on the level of the statutory rate. (This is mentioned briefly in MR ¶6.13). -In relative terms, higher taxation elsewhere may make New Zealand a more attractive location even with unchanged policies there (because EA/MTRs rise elsewhere). -Less positively, a reduced ability to shift profits out of New Zealand makes investing there less attractive: in effect, it raises the EMTR. 5 The importance of this effect is likely to remain largely imponderable, but: to get a broad sense: Is there any readily available information on the likely extent of outward profit shifting from New Zealand? 5 This point goes back (I think) to Hines and Rice (1994). It may be worth noting in the Report that the calculated EMTRs do not include a profit shifting-induced reduction. Also: c. Any reflections to offer on Pillar 1? Perhaps this is more a matter of revenue than of incentives for inward investment? 3. Another option: Cash flow taxation? The selection of reform options for consideration in the LTIB is well done, and wholly appropriate. There is just one other alternative that it might be useful to mention (or indicate why it is not pursued): cash flow taxation. This has been so prominent in the debate on corporate tax reform— and with interest revived by elements of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US—that the absence of any mention is striking. If felt worthwhile, it may be that offering some remarks on this option would not seem to require additional simulation work, since, as with the ACE (and is indeed hinted in MR ¶10.), the key feature is that the EMTR would be zero. Much of the discussion of the ACE might apply here too: e.g. the implications for integration with personal taxation if the normal return is excluded from tax at corporate level. But perhaps the transition problems (MR 10.24) would be less with a cash flow tax? 3. Mix and match? It might be worth addressing in the MR the question of whether the various reform options considered could be combined. My sense is that a health warning may be appropriate on this: for example, I don’t think one would want to both provide more accelerated depreciation and loosen thin cap rules. 4. Scene-setting It might be helpful to set out at the start of—or in an Appendix to—the MR a short summary description of core aspects of the New Zealand tax system that will come into play in the discussion (corporate and personal tax rates, imputation, typical treatment of depreciation, NRWT, AIL—and the perhaps the quite striking numbers in MR footnote 9 and on the share of profits accruing to foreign companies.) Most readers will of course be more familiar with all this than I am—but I imagine that even for them, as well as for the wider international readership the LTIB will deserve, it may be useful to have all this set out clearly in one place. C. MORE SPECIFIC COMMENTS These are (more or less) in the order they arise in the MR and TA respectively, rather than by possible significance. Main report: 1. ¶2.3: Are there also property taxes in New Zealand that might be relevant? 2. Perhaps use the same color for NZ in Figures 1.1-1.4? 3. Perhaps, in the discussion following ¶2.7, spell out that the argument points to a low EMTR but a high EATR on location-specific rents? The text nearly does this, but not quite—and being explicit here might help the reader understand some of the later discussion 4. It might be helpful too if were possible to give some sense of the extent to which major inward investors into New Zealand may in fact be able to credit taxes paid there (e.g. under GILTI), nuancing the zero-tax argument. The implicit assumption here appears to be that generally they will not be able to—is there good reason to suppose that the be the case? 5. Five lines from end of ¶2.11: specify pre-tax interest rate? 6. In ¶2.20, does the 8.3 percent number reflect/assume no distribution of profits? 7. In ¶2:40, presumably the evidence cited includes effects through domestic investment, not just inward real FDI? 8. P.33, first bullet: I always find counter-intuitive the (perfectly correct, I think) 6 claim that, with historic cost depreciation, higher inflation favors longer-lived assets. My (bad) intuition is that with higher inflation you really value near-term allowances, so that favors short-lived assets. Is the (good, or at least correct) intuition rather that with longer-lived assets the allowances are so far away that in present value they are worth very little even with zero inflation, so further erosion by inflation makes little difference? In any case, a brief explanation would be helpful for the puzzled likes of me. 9. ¶4.7 Explain that b indicates the debt ratio? 10. Footnotes 18-19 dealing with inflation effects are a bit cryptic: a few words explaining how these equations are derived might be helpful (or perhaps that would be best done in the TA). 11. In ¶4.20: (a) I found the argument initially hard to follow: I take it that the key point here is the reference to “cost...to New Zealand” the point being that the actual borrower pays 3 but now the government also collects some tax? Perhaps state this more explicitly? (The point is made much more clearly in the TA than in the MR). (b) I’m not sure why it would be inappropriate to calculate the EMR using the rate actually paid by the borrower—the concept is after all related to private incentives. But I may misunderstand. 6 Perhaps wrongly, I think of this as coming, intuitively, from: The present value of depreciation allowances is 퐷 = 휕 2 퐷 훿/(푟 + 휋 + 훿); so < 0. But this may be wrong. 휕휋휕훿 12. In ¶4.23: (a) Is there a reason to support focusing on this case rather than the other? It seems from the TA that this is because they lead to much the same results, but as noted below my initial suspicion (hence maybe also that of other readers) when reading the MR was that the absence of a CGT would make them quite different. (b) Why 33 percent? (I now presume this is because that is the trust rate—but did not learn for several pages more—the summary suggested above would have helped me!) 13. I also struggled with intuiting the point in ¶4.25 that “There will be small positive EMTRs for very short-lived PME and inventories, but significantly negative EMTRs for...assets where capital expenditure can be expensed”: this is because I would think of expensing as the ultimate short- lived case. 14. In ¶5.19: (a) first bullet: and also reduce transfer pricing concerns? (b) (b) 5 th bullet; the ACE might though forego revenue on non-location specific rents (depending on the rate at which it is set—an EATR issue). 15. In ¶6.24: why now 39 percent?! (Only in the next para do I learn that it’s the top personal marginal rate). 16. The important point in ¶6.23 about the being signs of movement to higher CIT rates may risk being buried away here: perhaps mention at the start of the chapter, or perhaps around Figure 1? 17. In ¶7.5, I didn’t understand the: “An alternative might be to allow some level of partial expensing in lieu of depreciation loading for those for which \* 100%dd== .” Does that not also mean deducting more than 100%? I am missing something here! 18. In ¶7.13: Isn’t though another (reasonable) reason to give accelerated depreciation as rough compensation for inflation, which might, I think, sensibly also be done for ‘old’ investment? 19. In ¶7.15: very good point, but perhaps “no benefit” is a bit strong as presumably there will be an effect when losses carried forward are used? 20. In ¶7.17, I am struck by the unqualified: “assets that depreciate more slowly tend to face lower costs of capital and EMTRs” I thought that, at inflation of zero, historic cost depreciation ‘gets it right’ (as indeed some tables in the MR seem to neatly show). Or does this statement have in mind situations of non-zero inflation? 21. In ¶7.18: Might it be helpful to refer to the evidence on the impact of bonus deprecation in the US? I am not expert on this, but there seem to be some indications that it was at least good for employment; I have in mind e.g. Garrett et al. (2020). 22. Table 7.2: Explain “m” in the title? 23. Example 8.1: Might this usefully be extended to show the ‘right’ tax treatment of interest income? 24. Last bullet after Table 8.1, first sentence: since the table does show negative EMTRs for full expensing, is the point being made here an “even without full expensing” one? 25. In ¶8.18: Why not the actual change in the CPI, which is what the previous arguments would seem to suggest? Is this to counter the risk that indexation will reduce determination to bring inflation back down? Or is it the argument in the next para that is in mind? Or something else? 26. In ¶9.25 (and elsewhere), perhaps clarify that the remark about tax being paid elsewhere is not to inherently devalue tax paid to any country other than New Zealand (which is how it might read) but (I think) to indicate that from the perspective of the investor the effectiveness of the measure is to some degree undermined. 27. On the ACE: Perhaps worth noting one other issue often remarked upon: the likely loss of tax revenue, and the risk of driving non-location specific rents elsewhere, if an attempt is made to recover this by raising the statutory rate. (Though against this, the increased efficiency in the allocation of capital should in itself generate some additional revenue). 28. Around ¶11.3: Perhaps now one should add the possibility of refundable tax credits envisaged under Pillar 2? 29. In Chapter 11: is there any experience with sector-specific incentives in New Zealand to draw on? Foreigners like me may wonder e.g. if the film tax credit (which there is/was?) is seen as a success—or as dissipating some potential revenue from location-specific rents. And on the R&D tax credit? 30. In ¶12.2: What is ‘PIE’? 31. In ¶12.19, lines 3-4: It isn’t clear to me if the claim here is that the capital income part of the dual income tax (i) inherently taxes only the risk-free return (by a portfolio adjustment story) or (ii) less subtly, (as it may later appear, with the Norwegian example) can be designed to do so. If (i), that may need some (not easy!) explanation for the reader. 32. In 12.31, near the end: It is not clear to mean how the Norwegian approach alleviates the lock-in problem: it may be worth elaborating. Technical Appendices 33. In ¶2.9, in saying that no account is taken of inflation, does that mean inflation is taken to be zero? The reader may also wonder: Why the change of policy on accelerated deprecation in 2010? 34. Table A2,2: expositionally, might there a case for putting this before Table A2.1, so starting with the benchmark against which inflation effects can be assessed? 35. Footnote 11: This methodological difference is very interesting. Do we know if it is a general feature that the OECD approach will give a higher overall METR (some kind of convexity in calculating the METR) or is this just a chance feature of the particular example? 36. I puzzled over the distinction between immediate expensing and full depreciation over the first year (and similarly between full depreciation and expensing in MR ¶7.9) until I came upon footnote 12 in the TA ; it would be helpful to include this clarification where it first arises (MR ¶4.25?). 37. In ¶2.43, how it is that the AIL is (it seems) generally not creditable abroad when the NRWT is? 38. In ¶2.55, first bullet: I have lost the plot! Which of the cost of capital expressions derived earlier are being used (amended for the AIL) in Table A2.7 for “all companies” and “domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholder”? 39. In ¶2.64: This is a very interesting table. Could one not (at a bit of a stretch, admittedly) see some signs of clustering in that the 50-60% group has a higher number of groups than any other band? Of course fuller analysis would be required to tease out anything definite: I might be inclined to take a tone here of ‘further research would be needed, but it seems...’ rather than be quite so dismissive of the possibility. 40. In ¶2.75: (a) First bullet: I would find it helpful to have an explanation of why these EMTRs are so similar. Presumably part of it is that the assumed personal tax rate is not far off the CIT rate. But that still leaves me unclear why it is actually lower with full distribution (e.g. where does that come from in comparing (2’) and (2’’)?). (b) Penultimate bullet: I had trouble following the explanation of why there are no longer the high EMTRs: perhaps, for the likes of me, it would help to explicitly compare (2’) or (2’’) with (2)? 41. Table A2.11: I wasn’t immediately clear of the purpose of this; but it seems to relate to the last bullet of ¶2.75, so may be worth referring to it there. 42. In ¶3.3, it wasn’t clear to me how the point attributed to Bulow and Summers fits with what sounds like the quite different conclusion of Summers in ¶3.2.

In December 2021 Cabinet noted that the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Trade and Export Growth, is considering the merits of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) for New Zealand and how it might be implemented, starting with the cement sector. Ministers expect a paper to be submitted to Cabinet in February/March 2022, so that any decisions can be included in the emissions reduction plan \[CAB-21-MIN-0547.02 refers\]. 2. A CBAM is one of the tools available to address the risk of emissions leakage, which arises because of the uneven implementation of climate pricing between jurisdictions. This unevenness may incentivise firms facing an emissions price in one jurisdiction to shift their production to jurisdictions with no/weaker emissions prices, resulting in no overall reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions (emissions), a problem termed emissions leakage. At present, the risk of emissions leakage in New Zealand is addressed through a policy of industrial allocation (IA). However, current IA settings are inconsistent with the Government’s climate change objectives and thus an assessment of alternative policies is necessary. 3. This report and the attached draft Cabinet paper outline the problem of emissions leakage and the role that a CBAM might play in addressing it. A well-designed CBAM would ensure that certain imported products face the same greenhouse gas emissions (emissions) cost as those produced domestically. This would reduce the risk of emissions leakage by ensuring that offshore production that is subject to no or a low emissions cost does not gain a competitive advantage over domestic production that is subject to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). 4. 5. Officials seek joint Ministers’ views on the scope and nature of their work in response to CAB-21-MIN-0547.02. 6. Officials recommend that further analysis be undertaken to determine which emissions-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) sectors are at greatest risk of emissions leakage, and the best options available to respond to any identified risk. 7. 1 These sectors are suggested in the first instance because of their substantial emissions profiles and because they have been signalled as being at risk in other jurisdictions, in particular through the EU draft CBAM proposal. The sectors listed are subject to further consideration. s9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 2 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] provide better targeted advice but would risk discounting a more comprehensive policy. 8. Whichever option is chosen, there are potentially significant trade, diplomatic and legal risks to navigate, and these warrant a considered approach that is sensitive to New Zealand’s overarching trade and climate change strategies. 9. Officials also recommend that the emissions reduction plan note this work.

This report responds to the 20 December 2021 Cabinet Minute that notes the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Trade and Export Growth, is considering a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) for New Zealand \[CAB-21-MIN-0547.02 refers\]. It summarises the problem of emissions leakage and outlines options to address the problem, including the option of implementing a CBAM. 12. Given the timeframe, officials have not attempted to provide a comprehensive analysis in this report of the risk of emissions leakage by sector, or the options available to address emissions leakage. The possible solutions are complex, and time is required to ensure any policy is environmentally effective, legally robust, and sensitive to New Zealand’s long-term climate change and trade strategies. Instead, this report seeks to ascertain the scope of officials’ future work on addressing emissions leakage. 13. In particular, officials seek joint Ministers’ agreement to continue their analysis of the problem of emissions leakage and the wider set of options to address it in greater detail, with a view to potentially publishing an issues paper on the options for consultation in the latter part of 2022. 14. Ba ckground 15. In 2019 the Government legislated a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions (emissions) 3 by 2050 to guide New Zealand’s transition to a low-emissions, climate resilient economy. New Zealand’s transition was further signalled in 2020 when the Government declared a climate change emergency, and in 2021 the country increased its contribution to global emissions reductions over the period 2021- 2030. 4 Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C is at the heart of New Zealand’s climate change response. 16. A key tool relied upon by the Government to meet its emissions reduction target is the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The ETS requires participants 5 to purchase and surrender emissions units for every tonne of emissions they release. This ensures that consumers face the costs associated with their contribution to climate change, and in doing so, incentivises industry and consumers to reduce their emissions profiles. 17. The ETS is a domestic emissions pricing instrument; i t does not price emissions that are released outside of New Zealand. This may place some New Zealand EITE firms at an economic disadvantage compared to their offshore competitors t hat are not 2 3 Biogenic methane emissions must be reduced between 24 and 47 percent below 2017 levels by 2050, rather than achieving net zero. 4 New Zealand updated its Nationally Determined Contribution in October 2021 to reduce net emissions by 50 percent below gross 2005 levels by 2030. 5 The ETS covers all emissions that occur within New Zealand (except for agriculture). Typically, surrender obligations are placed as high up the supply chain as possible (for example with the fuel importer or coal miner). s9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 6 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] subject to a domestic emissions trading scheme or equivalent pricing mechanism. 6 As a result, these firms may be incentivised to shift their production offshore instead of finding ways to reduce emissions, undermining global emissions reduction. This problem is termed ‘emissions leakage’. 18. Currently, the risk of emissions leakage is addressed through a policy of industrial allocation (IA). This approach is effective in removing the risk of emissions leakage, however it compromises New Zealand’s domestic emissions reductions targets. IA began a legislated phase down in 2021 which will continue at increasing rates over the next three decades. The policy is also currently undergoing a review to ensure it is fit for purpose as New Zealand shifts to a low emissions economy. Emissions reduction plan 19. The Climate Change Commission (Commission) identified the problem of emissions leakage in their advice to the Government in May 2021. They recommended that the Government explore alternative policy instruments to IA that, over the longer term, could be used to address the risk of emissions leakage. 20. The Government is due to release their response to the Commission’s advice in May 2022 with the publication of its emissions reduction plan (ERP). The ERP will contain a coherent strategic package of mutually supporting policies to meet New Zealand’s first three emissions budgets towards its emissions reduction targets. 21. If Ministers agree to officials continuing their analysis of any or all of the options available to address emissions leakage, this can be noted in the ERP. Officials will work alongside other ERP projects to ensure that any policy proposals support and reinforce the broader policy package. Inclusion on the Government’s work programme 22. The Minister of Revenue previously requested that work on a CBAM be added to the Government’s tax policy work programme. A CBAM is just one possible solution to the problem of emissions leakage. Officials recommend that this item be expanded to encompass a wider body of cross-agency work identifying possible solutions to the problem of emissions leakage. This work is complex and the expertise required is not all in one place, necessitating the input of a wide range of agencies. Hence officials recommend that this work should be a cross-agency item led jointly by Inland Revenue and the Treasury, with significant input from the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade alongside others. In the event that non-tax or non-charging options are developed in more detail, other agencies would take the lead. 23. Officials note that including this work on the tax policy work programme will reduce the resources available to devote to other work and priorities at the next update of the work programme. International developments 24. Internationally, there has been interest in addressing emissions leakage, as governments seek to achieve extensive emissions reductions in order to meet their domestic and international climate targets. In July 2021, the European Union (EU) released a draft regulation that would establish a CBAM. Under the proposed regulation, the financial adjustment would be phased in over a 10-year period 6 Both in terms of their competitiveness on the domestic market (where they compete with imports) and on export markets. IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 7 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] beginning in 2026, with corresponding adjustments to IAs in the EU emissions trading scheme (further detail provided below) 7 . 25. Democrat Senators in the United States have proposed a similar mechanism, and Canada has expressed plans to consult with key trading partners on the use of CBAMs. The problem of emissions leakage 26. A price on emissions ensures that producers and consumers face the costs associated with their contribution to climate change. It also encourages more efficient production processes, including investment in alternative low carbon technologies, and consumption behaviour which helps to mitigate the impact of climate change. 27. Emissions leakage arises because of the uneven implementation of emissions pricing policies between jurisdictions. If jurisdiction A places a price on emissions and jurisdiction B doesn’t, A’s producers may shift production to B, and A’s consumers may import more products from B. 28. Emissions leakage can therefore compromise the climate objectives of governments that implement emissions pricing. This is because the emissions reductions achieved by a domestic emissions price may result in an increase in emissions released in other jurisdictions (for example, if consumers in the jurisdiction with emissions pricing opt instead for imports of emissions unpriced goods). 29. Emissions leakage can also result in economic harm to domestic industries in jurisdictions that have imposed an emissions price, both in relation to supplying the domestic market and exports. Evidence of the risk of emissions leakage in New Zealand and scope of officials’ analysis 30. Whether emissions leakage is in fact a problem for New Zealand EITE firms is not clear cut; competitiveness (and the associated leakage risk) is impacted by many factors including energy price, labour costs, transport costs, and plant efficiency. It is also not a given that displacement will result in emissions leakage; this would depend on a range of factors, including the energy efficiency of the offshore producer and whether their emissions are being released under a cap-and-trade scheme. 31. Further analysis is required to determine which sectors currently classified as EITE may be at risk of emissions leakage. 32. Officials seek joint Ministers’ agreement to continue their analysis of whether any of the sectors currently classified as EITE under the ETS are at risk of emissions leakage, and whether it would be appropriate to address this risk in an alternative manner to the current policy of IA. 33. 7 From paragraph 69. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 8 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Industrial allocation 34. The risk of emissions leakage in New Zealand is currently addressed through a policy of IA. Firms undertaking certain industrial activities that are considered EITE receive allocations of emissions units. They can use these units to meet their obligations under the ETS or sell them to generate revenue and offset the increased cost of energy supplies such as coal or electricity. 35. IA offsets a substantial portion of the emissions price EITE industry face, so they are not disadvantaged when compared to any offshore unpriced competitors. EITE firms are still incentivised to cut their emissions as the number of units they receive is linked to production output, not actual emissions. If they reduce emissions and maintain output by becoming more efficient, they receive the same number of emission units and can benefit from the increased difference between emission costs and the value of the units. However, IA compromises climate objectives, as the emissions price signal is not passed onto consumers, who are not incentivised to purchase low emissions products. It is also costly to the Government, which is effectively subsidising these firms to remain competitive. 36. Current IA policy settings are over-allocating emissions units to EITE firms. MfE has consulted on proposed reforms to address this over-allocation. The reforms would remove the windfall gain of units to EITE firms and make IA more cost-effective in preventing emissions leakage. 37. Legislation passed in 2020 has initiated a very gradual phase out of IAs at one percentage point each year until 2030, a rate that will increase in the following decades. Over time therefore, EITE firms that do not reduce their emissions may be at increased risk of leakage and the need for alternative solutions will become more pressing. 8 38. Officials consider that the insufficiencies of IA as an approach to addressing emissions leakage warrant an exploration of possible alternatives, as part of the ERP. Officials will ensure that their work on options to address emissions leakage aligns with IA reform and the broader suite of emissions pricing measures contained in the ERP. 8 There is however a process by which EITE firms can apply to have their phase out rate reduced if certain requirements, including increased risk of emissions leakage, are met. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 9 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(h) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 10 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] s9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 11 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] D esign considerations 55. Different design choices will entail trade-offs between the criteria listed earlier. Scope 56. To comprehensively address emissions leakage, all EITE products at risk of emissions leakage would need to be included in a CBAM. Further analysis is required to determine which industries this might include – it is not clear that all industries that are currently classified as EITE are at risk of emissions leakage, and proposed reforms will likely exclude some industries from their current EITE classification. s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 12 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 57. There is an option to phase in a CBAM slowly across EITE sectors, as has been proposed by the EU, or more specifically just on cement. This would provide Government time to get the settings right for a smaller subset and they could apply their learnings to sectors added at a later date. 58. Officials can do further analysis to determine which sectors it would be most appropriate to apply a CBAM to. In response to the Cabinet minute, officials have provided further information on the cement sector and its suitability for a CBAM in Appendix 1. Emissions coverage 59. A CBAM could cover direct emissions released in the production process and indirect emissions resulting from energy related inputs. Focussing on direct emissions is desirable from an administration and compliance perspective as these emissions are more easily traced. However, including indirect emissions would increase the accuracy of any emissions pricing and may be desirable for EITE sectors in which a large share of their emissions are indirect. Determination of embedded emissions 60. To fully incentivise firms to reduce their emissions, the emissions price could be directly tied to the number of emissions contained in the import. To do this, importers could be required to submit verified emissions data. However, this would impose great compliance costs on importers and may be impractical in some cases. 61. Another option is to create default emissions intensity assumptions for different sectors. These defaults could be based on the embedded emissions seen in equivalent domestic products. To retain an incentive to reduce emissions, importers could claim a reduction from the default if they can prove a lower carbon intensity, as per the EU proposal (which is discussed in a later section). Defaults could also be used as a transitional measure as importers develop methods to report their carbon intensity. Level of adjustment 62. Decisions would also have to be made about the cost imposed on imports at the border. It is essential that imports not be afforded less favourable treatment than domestic production. The level of adjustment would thus have to account for the following: • Emissions embedded in the product • Emissions pricing already applied to the product in its country of origin • IA, rebates or exemptions offered to domestic industry. 63. These factors reflect that, in effect, a CBAM should only be applied to an import if it is necessary to address the risk of emissions leakage. This risk will only arise if there is no equivalent emissions pricing between an EITE domestic product and an offshore alternative. For this reason, the introduction of a CBAM will need to be tied to a decrease in IAs available to EITE industries in New Zealand and this transition will need to be managed. 64. For equity reasons, the level of adjustment could depend on a country’s level of development. This would have to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with New Zealand’s international trade obligations (which do permit differential treatment for developing and least developed countries in some circumstances). IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 13 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Officials would need to consider whether this would warrant a more phased-in approach in some cases. Other considerations 65. Given a CBAM would be applied at the border, Customs is likely best placed to implement such a charge. Their capacity to do so (and timing) will need to be investigated by officials. 66. A CBAM or other measure could also generate revenue for the Government. Generally, officials consider that revenue should be returned as core Crown revenue for efficiency reasons. Arguments in favour of hypothecation of the revenue to specific purposes would need to be carefully considered. 67. Officials would also need to do further work to determine the distributional impacts of a CBAM or any of the other tools available to address emissions leakage. The economic impacts will also need to be explored further. For example, academic literature suggests that the introduction of a CBAM could result in an offsetting adjustment in the exchange rate. 68. Any future policy would also have to be assessed against other Government priorities. For example, adding to the cost of cement may work against housing affordability objectives. Further analysis will be carried out on the range of options if Ministers agree. EU carbon border adjustment mechanism 69. The EU has released draft regulation that would establish a CBAM for imports of steel, iron, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electricity where those products are not already facing an equivalent carbon price in their country of origin. Key elements of the proposed CBAM include: • Importers will surrender CBAM certificates corresponding to a default assumption of their embedded emissions. Importers can, however, claim a reduction in the default if they can prove a lower emissions intensity for their product, or that an emissions price has already been paid in the product’s country of origin. • The cost of CBAM certificates is linked to the price of units in the EU ETS market in the period directly preceding import. • The emissions are limited to direct emissions arising from the production process. • Importers will initially have reporting obligations only, with the adjustment becoming operational in 2026. • The adjustment will increase proportionally with the gradual phase out of free allocations for affected domestic sectors in the ETS, so that relevant foreign producers and domestic producers pay an equivalent emissions price. 70. There is scope to include indirect emissions and a wider range of products at a later date. However, the exact form any future EU CBAM takes is dependent on the outcomes of negotiation between the European Council and the European Parliament. Officials note that a recent report from the Parliament’s Environment Committee recommended extending the scope of products covered by the CBAM amongst other changes.

This involves the quarrying of limestone and cement rocks in New Zealand, grinding those rocks into smaller sized particles, clinkering (in which the material is heated to a high temperature) and finally milling the clinker into cement powder. The chemical reaction that occurs during the clinkering process releases carbon dioxide, and is the primary source of emissions arising from the cement production process Golden Bay Cement accounts for around 90% of New Zealand’s cement production. The remaining 10% is produced by HR cement, who manufactures cement from imported clinker. Golden Bay Cement and HR cement account for around 60% of New Zealand’s total cement needs. The remaining 40% is imported, through Holcim New Zealand. We note that Golden Bay Cement has indicated strong support for a CBAM as an alternative to free allocation, to address emissions leakage. Cement imports to New Zealand followed by Thailand and Viet Nam For more information, see Annex 1. Cement exports (including re-exports) New Zealand also exports a small amount of cement ($10-$15 million annually). Cement definition This appendix uses the same cement category (2523) as the European Union is proposing to use for its CBAM. It covers basic unrefined Portland cement and therefore does not include more refined cement-based products. It is possible that a New Zealand domestic cement producer may use this unrefined product to make more refined products, in which case a CBAM based on this categorisation would be a cost to them but there would not be an equivalent tax on direct importers of the more refined products. How “cement” is defined is, therefore, a crucial aspect that will need to be considered carefully. There may be benefits in using a comparable definition to other countries. Range of countries affected by a CBAM on cement Figure 1 demonstrates the range of countries that could potentially be affected by a CBAM applied to cement. Each country’s carbon pricing would need to be evaluated as ideally any CBAM introduced would not apply to those countries who do adequately price carbon, whether through an ETS type scheme or a carbon tax. 15 Around $300 million with transport costs. s9(2)(b)(ii) s9(2)(b)(ii) s9(2)(b)(ii) s9(2)(b)(ii) IR2022/036; T2022/197: Emissions reduction plan: addressing emissions leakage Page 18 of 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] As part of this work, the emissions generated by each country’s cement making process would likely need to be independently verified.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLAN: ADDRESSING EMISSIONS LEAKAGE Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to a cross-agency body of work, led by Inland Revenue and the Treasury, to determine the risk of emissions leakage from the cement sector in New Zealand, and the best policy response to address this risk. 2.We propose focusing on the cement sector initially, to provide a case study of an emissions-intensive and trade exposed (EITE) sector. The analysis could be expanded to other EITE sectors at a later date. Alternatively, if Cabinet prefers, officials could consider the risk of emissions leakage and possible solutions across all EITE sectors. 3.The paper also seeks Cabinet’s agreement for officials to note this work in the emissions reduction plan (ERP). 4.This work would proceed with a view to releasing an issues paper for consultation late 2022. Relation to Government Priorities 5.The Government declared a climate change emergency on 2 December 2020. Cabinet agreed that climate change “demands a sufficiently ambitious, urgent, and coordinated response across government to meet the scale and complexity of the challenge” \[CBC- 20-MIN-0 097 refers\]. 6.Enabling a just transition to a low-emissions, climate resilient future is a Government priority. Cabinet has declared its intention to “put the climate at the centre of government decision-making” \[CBC-20-MIN-0097 refers\]. Executive Summary 7.This Cabinet paper provides Ministers with background on the problem of emissions leakage and outlines potential options to address it including the option of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). It responds to the 20 December 2021 Cabinet minute that notes the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Minister of Finance 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and the Minister of Trade and Export Growth, is considering a CBAM for New Zealand, starting with the cement sector. 8. A CBAM is one of the tools available to address the problem of emissions leakage, which arises because of the uneven implementation of climate pricing between jurisdictions. This unevenness may incentivise firms facing an emissions price in one jurisdiction to shift their production to jurisdictions with no/weaker emissions prices. This problem, termed emissions leakage, results in economic harm to jurisdictions and undermines global greenhouse gas emissions (emissions) reduction. 9. If the risk of emissions leakage is not addressed in some way, New Zealand may lose key industries and the associated jobs, tax and economic activity. The movement of these industries offshore may also result in an increase in net global emissions if this offshore production is more emissions intensive or occurs outside of an emissions cap. 10. At present, New Zealand addresses the risk of emissions leakage through a policy of industrial allocation (IA) under the New Zealand emissions trading scheme (ETS) for EITE firms. 11. However, with a rising ETS unit price, recipients of IAs are still facing a sharply increased marginal cost on production, which imported goods from at least some of their international competitors do not. As the ETS unit price increases, the policy efficacy of the IA system diminishes. 12. Furthermore, current IA settings are inconsistent with the Government’s climate change objectives as they dull the price signal faced by polluting industries and consumers. An assessment of alternative policies is therefore necessary. 13. This paper provides a high-level outline of the range of policies available to address emissions leakage. The options include a CBAM, consumption charges, other multi- lateral approaches such as an international carbon price floor or a ‘climate club’, regulatory options such as product standards, and direct subsidies to at risk sectors. 14. The possible solutions are complex and there are potentially significant trade, diplomatic and legal risks to navigate. This warrants a considered approach that is sensitive to New Zealand’s overarching trade and climate change strategies. 15. Consequently, officials would start with a narrow exploration of the risk of emissions leakage as it relates to one sector – the cement sector – as a case study which can be used to inform further analysis of other EITE sectors if this is desirable at a later date. 16. The cement sector has been chosen due to its relatively high emissions intensity, its exposure to imported cement and its classification in recent analysis 1 as potentially at risk. 17. If Cabinet agrees, officials from Inland Revenue and Treasury (with involvement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), the Ministry for the Environment, 1 Resource Economics Potential for emissions leakage from selected industries in the ETS (January, 2021) prepared for the Ministry for the Environment. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and other relevant agencies) will undertake a more detailed analysis of the risk of emissions leakage in the cement sector. 18. Background 19. This paper is one of a set of papers containing proposals for inclusion in the ERP, which will be published in May 2022. The ERP sets out the policies and strategies necessary for achieving the emissions budgets towards the Government’s 2050 domestic emissions reduction target. It responds to the advice provided to Government by the Climate Change Commission in May 2021, which must be considered in the development of the ERP. 20. In their advice, the Commission recommended that the ETS be amended and continually improved to deliver the incentives needed to achieve emissions budgets (recommendation 11). As part of this work, they recommended that the Government explore alternative policy instruments to IA that could be used to address the risk of emissions leakage over the long term (recommendation 11(4)(b)). 21. This paper outlines the problem of emissions leakage and options to address it beyond the current IA approach. Given the limited timeframe that was available, this current analysis is necessarily high-level. 22. We seek Cabinet’s approval for officials to undertake more detailed analysis of the risk of emissions leakage in the cement sector and the alternative options available to address this risk. This case study may then inform future analysis of emissions leakage and appropriate solutions across other EITE sectors. If Cabinet prefers, officials could instead broaden their analysis to other EITE sectors straight away. 23. If Cabinet agrees to either of these options, this work will be noted in the ERP. Any associated emissions reductions will not be determined until final policy decisions are made and these may be counted towards a future emissions budget at that time. The Problem of Emissions Leakage The New Zealand emissions trading scheme does not price emissions released outside of New Zealand 24. The ETS is a key tool relied upon by the Government to meet its emissions reduction targets and budgets. Participants in the ETS must purchase and surrender emissions units for every tonne of emissions they release. This changes the cost of emissions intensive production and consumption relative to low emissions alternatives. The ETS ensures that consumers and producers face the costs associated with their contribution to climate change and incentivises producers and consumers to reduce their emissions profiles. s9(2)(f)(iv) 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 25. The ETS is a domestic pricing instrument; it does not price emissions that are released outside of New Zealand. This may place some New Zealand EITE firms at an economic disadvantage compared to some of their offshore competitors that are not subject to a domestic emissions trading scheme or equivalent pricing mechanism. 2 A failure to price the emissions contained in imported goods implicitly subsidises offshore emissions-intensive production. This can result in a problem termed emissions leakage. Emissions leakage arises because of the uneven implementation of emissions pricing policies between jurisdictions 26. If jurisdiction A places a price on emissions and jurisdiction B does not, A’s producers may shift production to B, and A’s consumers may import more products from B. Emissions leakage thus arises because of the competitive advantage that firms located in jurisdictions with lower climate ambition have over equivalent industries in countries with emissions pricing. 27. Emissions leakage can therefore compromise the climate objectives of governments that implement emissions pricing. This is because the emissions reductions achieved by a domestic emissions price can result in an increase in emissions released in other jurisdictions if this offshore production is more emissions intensive or if it occurs outside of an established emissions cap. 28. Emissions leakage can also result in economic harm to domestic industries in jurisdictions that have imposed an emissions price, both in relation to supplying the domestic market and exports. If domestic EITE industry face the full price of their emissions and offshore substitutes do not, there is a risk that New Zealand may lose some of these industries and the associated jobs, economic activity, and tax. If a commercial decision is taken to cease operations in New Zealand, it is likely to be very difficult to encourage these industries to return. We recommend that Cabinet agree to officials focusing their initial analysis on the risk of emissions leakage in the New Zealand cement sector 29. Whether emissions leakage is in fact a problem for all New Zealand EITE firms is not clear cut; competitiveness (and the associated leakage risk) is impacted by many factors including energy price, labour costs, transport costs, the cost of capital, and plant efficiency. It is also not a given that displacement will result in emissions leakage; this would depend on a range of factors, including the energy efficiency of the offshore producer and whether their emissions are being released under an emissions cap, as well as potential changes to domestic consumer preferences and the availability of domestic low emissions alternatives. 30. We seek Cabinet approval for officials to continue their analysis of the risk of emissions leakage in the cement sector, an industry with relatively high direct emissions that is exposed to offshore alternatives. This sector has been flagged as potentially at risk in some New Zealand specific analysis, 3 and has been identified as at risk in other 2 Both in terms of their competitiveness on the domestic market (where they compete with imports) and on export markets. 3 Resource Economics Potential for emissions leakage from selected industries in the ETS (January 2021) prepared for the Ministry for the Environment. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] jurisdictions. 4 The cement sector has also expressed support for officials to investigate alternatives to address emissions leakage. 5 31. We consider that a focus on one sector as a case study will allow officials to provide more timely analysis, and this analysis can be applied to the other EITE sectors at a late date. New Zealand currently addresses the risk of emissions leakage through a policy of industrial allocation 32. Under IA policy, firms undertaking certain industrial activities classified as EITE receive allocations of emissions units. They can use these units to meet their obligations under the ETS or sell them to generate revenue and offset the increased cost of energy supplies such as coal or electricity. 33. IA offsets a substantial portion of the emissions price EITE industry face, so they are not disadvantaged when compared to any offshore unpriced competitors. This comes at a compromise to New Zealand’s climate objectives, as the emissions price signal is muted, reducing the incentive on consumers to purchase low emissions products. IA therefore decreases the effectiveness of emissions pricing and makes it more difficult for New Zealand to meet its emissions reduction targets and budgets. 34. IA policy is also costly to the Government. Based on current ETS unit prices and 2020 allocations, IA is estimated to provide an implicit subsidy of around $550million to EITE firms annually. 35. To the extent that IAs do not fully cover emissions costs, the effectiveness of IA policy is weakened as ETS unit prices rise. In such circumstances, recipients of IAs face an increased marginal cost on production, while imported goods from at least some of their international competitors do not. 36. Current IA policy settings are also over-allocating emissions units to EITE industry. The Ministry for the Environment has consulted on proposed reforms to address this over-allocation. The reforms would remove the over-allocation of units to EITE firms and make IA more cost-effective in preventing emissions leakage. 37. IAs have been provided since 2010 when industrial activities first entered the ETS. They were initially intended to be a transitional support policy, however the provision for their phase out was delayed and subsequently removed. 38. In 2020, legislation initiated a gradual phase out of IAs which will continue at increasing rates over the next three decades. 6 Over time then, the need for alternative solutions to protect EITE sectors from the risk of emissions leakage will become more pressing. 7 4 The EU has identified their cement sector as at risk and their CBAM proposal (discussed further at paragraph 41 and 77) would include this sector. 5 For example, in their submissions to MfE on the ‘Reforming industrial allocation in the ETS’ consultation document, and in submissions to the Climate Change Commission and on the draft ERP. 6 The general phase out rate for IAs from 2021-2030 is one percentage point per year. 7 There is however a process by which EITE firms can apply to have their phase out rate reduced if certain requirements, including increased risk of emissions leakage, are met. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 39. The phase out also creates uncertainty for EITE sectors as to their long-term viability in the face of emissions unpriced substitutes. To encourage EITE sectors to invest in the infrastructure necessary for future emissions reductions, they need certainty that their efforts will be reflected in the cost of their product relative to emissions unpriced substitutes. 40. We consider that the insufficiencies of IA as an approach to addressing emissions leakage warrant an exploration of possible alternatives, as part of the ERP. This work will align with IA reform and the broader suite of emissions pricing measures contained in the ERP. Other jurisdictions are beginning to look at alternatives to industrial allocation 41. In July 2021, the European Union released draft regulation that would establish a CBAM for imports of steel, iron, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electricity where those products are not already facing an equivalent carbon price in their country of origin. Under the proposed regulation, the financial adjustment would be phased in over a 10-year period beginning in 2026, with corresponding adjustments to industrial allocations in the EU emissions trading scheme (further detail provided below). 8 42. Democrat Senators in the United States have proposed a similar mechanism, and Canada has expressed plans to consult with key trading partners on the use of CBAMs. 8 From paragraph 77. s 9(2)(f)(iv) 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 45. If Cabinet agrees, officials will undertake a detailed assessment of the suitability of the options for the cement sector with reference to the proposed criteria. Option one: carbon border adjustment mechanism 46. A CBAM adjusts the price of a product entering and/or exiting a country to account for the emissions embedded in the product. Broadly speaking, it can take the form of either: 46.1 an import charge; or 46.2 an obligation on importers to surrender emissions units (either through an extension of the ETS to imports, or a separate emissions trading scheme for imports and/or exports). 47. Both measures would reduce emissions leakage resulting from the increased importation of products that have not been subject to emissions pricing. They would both ‘level the playing field’ between domestic products that are subject to ETS obligations and those imports that are not subject to an emissions price in their country of origin. 48. An import charge would apply an emissions price to EITE imports equal to the emissions embedded in the imported good. In practice, it would operate very similarly to a customs duty or tariff applied on imports as they enter the country. 49. Similarly, requiring importers of EITE products to surrender a form of emissions unit to reflect the emissions embedded in their imports would introduce an emissions price comparable to domestic production. 50. Neither measure, taken alone, would be guaranteed to address emissions leakage resulting from New Zealand export manufacturing moving offshore to avoid emissions pricing. This is because New Zealand EITE firms that export to jurisdictions subject to weaker/no emissions pricing could still be incentivised to shift their production offshore. s 9(2)(f)(iv) 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] We note that the cement sector does not fall into this category, as cement produced domestically is not exported. 51. To address this, one option would be to provide rebates to affected exports. This would remove the risk of emissions leakage, however it comes at a compromise to climate objectives, as it lessens the incentive on those firms to reduce their emissions. 52. Export rebates and come at a fiscal cost to the Government. These issues emphasise the need for a multi- lateral approach. s9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(h) 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Design considerations 63. Different design choices will entail trade-offs between the criteria listed earlier. Scope 64. To comprehensively address emissions leakage, all EITE products at risk of emissions leakage would need to be included in a CBAM. Further analysis is required to determine which industries this might include – it is not clear that all industries that are currently classified as EITE are at risk of emissions leakage, and proposed reforms will likely exclude some industries from their current EITE classification. Emissions coverage 65. A CBAM could cover direct emissions released in the production process and indirect emissions resulting from energy related inputs. Focussing on direct emissions is desirable from an administration and compliance perspective as these emissions are more easily traced. 66. However, including indirect emissions would increase the accuracy of any emissions pricing and may be desirable for EITE sectors in which a large share of their emissions are indirect. Determination of embedded emissions 67. To fully incentivise firms to reduce their emissions, the emissions price could be directly tied to the number of emissions contained in the import. To do this, importers could be required to submit verified emissions data. However, this would impose great compliance costs on importers and may be impractical in some cases. 68. Another option is to create default emissions intensity assumptions for different sectors. These defaults could be based on the embedded emissions seen in equivalent domestic products. To retain an incentive to reduce emissions, importers could claim a reduction from the default if they can prove a lower carbon intensity, as per the EU proposal (which is discussed in a later section). Defaults could also be used as a transitional measure as importers develop methods to report their carbon intensity. 11 If the EU is able to implement a WTO consistent CBAM, this would provide reassurance to other countries (including New Zealand) who wish to follow suit and implement similarly structured measures. s 9(2)(h) 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Level of adjustment 69. Decisions would also have to be made about the cost imposed on imports at the border. It is essential that imports not be afforded less favourable treatment than domestic production. The level of adjustment would thus have to account for the following: 69.1 Emissions embedded in the product 69.2 Emissions pricing already applied to the product in its country of origin 69.3 Free industrial allocation, rebates or exemptions offered to domestic industry. 70. These factors reflect that, in effect, a CBAM should only be applied to an import if it is necessary to address the risk of emissions leakage. This risk will only arise if there isn’t equivalent emissions pricing between an EITE domestic product and an offshore alternative. 71. For this reason, the introduction of a CBAM will need to be tied to a decrease in IAs available to EITE industries in New Zealand and this transition will need to be managed. 72. For equity reasons, the level of adjustment could depend on a country’s level of development. This would have to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with New Zealand’s international trade obligations (which do permit differential treatment for developing and least developed countries in some circumstances). Other considerations 73. Given a CBAM would be applied at the border, Customs is likely best placed to implement such a charge. Their capacity to do so (and timing) will need to be investigated by officials. 74. 75. Officials would also need to do further work to determine the distributional impacts of a CBAM or any of the other tools available to address emissions leakage. The economic impacts will also need to be explored further. For example, academic literature suggests that the introduction of a CBAM could result in an offsetting adjustment in the exchange rate. 76. Any future policy would also have to be assessed against other Government priorities. For example, adding to the cost of cement may work against housing affordability objectives. Further analysis will be carried out on the range of options if Ministers agree. s9(2)(f)(iv) 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] EU carbon border adjustment mechanism 77. The EU has released draft regulation that would establish a CBAM for imports of steel, iron, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electricity where those products are not already facing an equivalent carbon price in their country of origin. Key elements of the proposed CBAM include: 77.1 Importers will surrender CBAM certificates corresponding to a default assumption of their embedded emissions. Importers can, however, claim a reduction in the default if they can prove a lower emissions intensity for their product, or that an emissions price has already been paid in the product’s country of origin. 77.2 The cost of CBAM certificates is linked to the price of units in the EU ETS market in the period directly preceding import. 77.3 The emissions are limited to direct emissions arising from the production process. 77.4 Importers will initially have reporting obligations only, with the adjustment becoming operational in 2026. 77.5 The adjustment will increase proportionally with the gradual phase out of free allocations for affected domestic sectors in the ETS, so that relevant foreign producers and domestic producers pay an equivalent emissions price. 78. There is scope to include indirect emissions and a wider range of products at a later date. However, the exact form any future EU CBAM takes is dependent on the outcomes of negotiation between the European Council and the European Parliament. A recent report from the Parliament’s Environment Committee recommended extending the scope of products covered by the CBAM, amongst other changes. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2 )(h) 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f) (iv) s 9(2)(j) 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Next Steps 95. If Cabinet agrees to officials continuing their analysis of the risk of emissions leakage in the cement sector and potential solutions, officials will work towards the publication of an issues paper late 2022. 96. Officials will consult with New Zealand cement producers on opportunities for emissions reduction that will be available to them if the emissions leakage settings are in the right place.

There are no financial implications associated with the recommendations proposed in this paper. Legislative Implications 98. There are no legislative implications arising from this paper. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 99. There are no regulatory proposals in this paper, and therefore Cabinet’s impact analysis requirements do not apply. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 100. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirement does not apply to this proposal as there are no direct emissions impacts at this stage. 101. Future proposals on addressing emissions leakage will likely have significant emissions implications. The Treasury and Inland Revenue will work with the CIPA team to disclose emissions impacts to Cabinet as proposals are advanced, as appropriate. Population Implications 102. The ERP will include information on the distributional impacts of policies and measures within the scope of the plan, including a response to the Commission’s recommendation to develop a comprehensive Equitable Transition Strategy. 103. The Equitable Transitions Strategy will help ensure emissions reduction policies consider distributional impacts, including whether particular groups (including lower- income households and whanau/families) can be supported or empowered to realise the opportunities presented by the transition. 104. The impacts of the transition to a low-emissions and climate resilient economy will fall differently across groups and regions, and the specific impact that any of the options canvassed in this paper will have will be noted in final policy advice to Cabinet. Te Tiriti o Waitangi   105. The Crown is working together with iwi and hapū to ensure our climate emergency response recognises Māori tino rangatiratanga, kaitiakitanga and the kāwanatanga of the Crown. More detailed analysis of Tiriti obligations in the context of the emissions reduction plan is outlined in the Cabinet paper ‘Emissions reduction plan: Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the role of Māori in the transition’ \[CAB-98\]. 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 106. In its final advice, the Commission identified that Māori, iwi and hapū are likely to be disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts from the transition to a low-emissions and climate resilient economy. 107. The specific implications that the options outlined in this paper might have for iwi and Māori will be considered in further analysis and reported back to Cabinet when final policy decisions are sought. For example, some of the options may benefit the Māori economy if they change the relative price of alternatives to cement such as wood. Human Rights 108. The options to address emissions leakage discussed in this paper are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation 109. The following agencies were consulted in the development of this paper: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Ministry for the Environment; the Ministry for Primary Industries; the Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment; New Zealand Customs Service. 110. Public consultation on the emissions reduction plan discussion document, Te hau mārohi ki anamata - Transitioning to a low-emissions and climate-resilient future, ran between 13 October and 24 November 2021 \[CAB-21-MIN-0335 refers\]. 111. Although the discussion document did not outline the options to address emissions leakage canvassed in this paper, a number of submissions were made on current IA policy and alternatives such as a CBAM. There was division amongst EITE industry submitters as to whether a CBAM would be preferable to IA, however some cement industry representatives expressed support for a New Zealand CBAM. 112. If Ministers agree to officials undertaking further analysis of the risk of emissions leakage in the cement sector and the range of options available to address it, officials will consult on this in late 2022 and return to Cabinet with relevant feedback. Communications 113. The Ministry for the Environment will communicate all decisions on policies and measures to be included in the ERP when the final plan is published in May 2022. Proactive Release 114. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper on the Ministry for the Environment’s website after final decisions on the emissions reduction plan have been made and the plan has been published. Recommendations The Ministers of Finance and the Minister of Revenue recommend that the Committee: 1. note that on 20 December 2021 Cabinet noted that the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Trade and Export Growth, 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] is considering the merits of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) for New Zealand and how it might be implemented, starting with the cement sector, and outlined an expectation that a paper be submitted to Cabinet in February/March 2022, so that any decisions can be included in the emissions reduction plan \[CAB-21-MIN- 0547.02 refers\]; 2. note the Commission’s recommendation that the Government explore alternative policy instruments to industrial allocation that, over the longer term, could be used to address the risk of emissions leakage; 3. note the importance of exploring the range of options available to address the risk of emissions leakage to ensure an effective and robust long-term solution; 4. agree that the problem to be explored is emissions leakage, as outlined in this paper; 5. 6. agree to officials noting in the emissions reduction plan that the Government is exploring the risk of emissions leakage (to the extent agreed to in recommendation 5) and options to address any identified risk.
