That is, in part, due to two things. The first is that while many people do not like paying tax, few want to do away with the services tax pays for: supporting the retired, health, education, infrastructure (including public transport), the protection of the environment, public order and much more. The second, which helps explain the breadth and complexity of this interim report, is that arguably no forms of tax are all bad, neither are they all good. Taxes live in the world of greys, not that of black and white (much as some politicians as well as some economists might assert otherwise). That reality underlies the fact this interim report does not arrive at firm or definitive conclusions on many issues. On some of the more controversial matters - such as the extension of the taxation of capital income - we have attempted to provide and explain various options. On others, such as environmental taxes, we have been specific in some cases, more general in others. We also point the way towards longer term possibilities for systemic tax reform that may assist the transformation of our economy, consistent with and contributing to the Government’s goal of zero net carbon emissions by 2050. On a few matters, for example alteration to the structure of GST, we have been very clear in not supporting any such changes but point to the need for other policy levers to be used to address underlying problems. The Tax Working Group recognises that there is a great deal more work to be done before we present our final report in February next year. This work will include, in particular, further consideration of the details of possible extensions to the taxation of capital income and the distributional consequences of various options for tax changes. My hope is that people will consider their responses carefully to this interim report. The Group has a wide variety of people on it, yet we have produced a report which we can all recommend for that careful consideration. Feedback is welcome and can be sent to: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Given the tight deadlines for the final report, feedback is appreciated as soon as possible.

A national conversation on the future of tax Over the past nine months, the Tax Working Group has engaged in a national conversation with New Zealanders about the future of the tax system. Thousands of New Zealanders – including iwi, businesses, unions, and other organisations – have had their say. It is clear to the Group that tax matters to everyone. There is good reason for this passion. The tax system underpins the living standards of New Zealanders in three important respects: as a source of revenue for public services; as a means of redistribution; and as a policy instrument in its own right. The Group has been alert to these multiple purposes in the course of its work. The Group also believes it is important to bring a broad conception of wellbeing and living standards to its work – including a consideration of Te Ao Māori perspectives on the tax system. This approach reflects the composition of the Group, which includes members with a diverse range of skills and experience, including from beyond the tax system. The Group is currently working with stakeholders to develop a framework to support the future evolution of the tax system that reflects principles from Te Ao Māori, alongside the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework and the principles of tax policy design. This includes exploring concepts of waiora (wellbeing), 5 Future of Tax Interim Report manaakitanga (care and respect), kaitiakitanga (stewardship), whanaungatanga (relationships and connectedness), and ōhanga (prosperity). Challenges, risks, and opportunities The Group’s Submissions Background Paper invited submitters to share their views on the challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system. The Group has received thousands of submissions since the release of the Submissions Background Paper, and would like to thank all submitters for taking the time to share their views and perspectives on the future of tax. Reading through the submissions, there appear to be five areas of common concern to New Zealanders: • climate change and environmental degradation • changes in business, technology, and the nature of work • demographic change, in particular the aging of the population • wealth inequality, and the progressivity, fairness, and integrity of the tax system • the treatment of capital, savings (especially retirement savings), and housing in the tax system. Submitters sometimes differed in their views about how these issues would affect the tax system, and how the tax system should respond to them. Nevertheless, there does appear to be a largely shared view about the challenges, risks, and opportunities ahead of us. The structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system One of the key tasks for the Group has been to assess the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. Although the tax system has many strengths, the Group has found that the tax system relies on a relatively narrow range of taxes, and is not particularly progressive. There are a number of reasons for these outcomes, but two issues stand out for the Group: • The inconsistent taxation of capital income. A significant element of capital income – gains from the sale of capital assets – is not taxed on a consistent basis. This treatment reduces the fairness of the tax system. It also regressive, because it benefits the wealthiest members of our society. Both effects risk undermining the social capital that sustains public acceptance of the tax system. • The treatment of natural capital. New Zealand makes relatively little use of environmental taxation. There are clear opportunities to increase environmental taxation, both to broaden the revenue base, and to help address the significant environmental challenges we face as a nation. Interim conclusions The taxation of capital income In light of its findings on the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system, the Group has devoted much time to the taxation of capital income. At present, the Group is examining the merits of extending the taxation of capital income. Extending the taxation of capital income will have a range of advantages and disadvantages. It will improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system, and level the playing field between different types of investments. It will provide an increasing source of revenue over time; depending on design, it will also enhance the sustainability of the tax system (particularly if the difference between the company rate and the top personal rate increases in the future). Yet extending the taxation of capital income will also increase administration and compliance costs, and could lead to some reduction in the overall level of saving and investment in the economy. It is difficult to form a judgement about the strength of these impacts in the abstract. This is because the nature of the impacts will be heavily dependent on the details of policy design. It is also important to ensure that policy design is as simple and effective as possible, reaping all potential benefits while minimising potential disadvantages. The Group has thus decided to work through, in substantial detail, the policy choices involved in the design of an extended taxation of capital income. 6 Future of Tax Interim Report The Group is currently considering two main options: an extension of the existing tax net (through the taxation of gains on assets that are not already taxed); and the taxation of deemed returns from certain assets (known as the risk-free rate of return method of taxation). The Group is not recommending a wealth tax or a land tax. The Group has made good progress in determining what income might be included from certain assets, and when this income might be taxed – but there is still much work to do. Retirement savings New Zealand currently offers few incentives for retirement saving. KiwiSaver is targeted at providing greater proportionate benefits to those on lower incomes, but those on the bottom two marginal tax rate do not benefit from the fact that the top PIE rate is 28%. The Group has identified opportunities to encourage saving among low- and middle-income earners, and make the tax treatment of retirement savings fairer. However, the treatment of retirement savings is interlinked with the treatment of capital income. The Group will need to give further consideration to the choices and trade-offs around retirement savings in the Final Report. Housing affordability It is also evident that New Zealanders are deeply concerned about the high cost of housing, and its impact on wealth inequality, social cohesion, and social capital. Consistent with these concerns, the Group has been directed to have special regard to housing affordability in its work. The cause of unaffordable housing is, in one sense, straightforward. New Zealand has been unable to build enough houses to satisfy demand at current rates of population growth. This shortfall reflects a number of interlinked problems in the supply of housing – including land use constraints, infrastructure constraints, and high building costs. The tax system is not responsible for constraints in the supply of housing, but it does influence demand for housing. Certain features of the tax system – such as the inconsistent treatment of capital income – have probably exacerbated the house price cycle in New Zealand, even if the tax system is not the primary cause of unaffordable housing. The Group’s work on housing affordability is closely linked to its work on the taxation of capital income. There is an open question as to whether an extension of capital income taxation would have a material effect on the housing market. A concern for the Group is to understand these impacts further. Environmental and ecological outcomes Another key task for the Group is to examine how the tax system can sustain and enhance New Zealand’s natural capital for positive environmental and ecological outcomes. The environmental challenges we face require profound change to the pattern of economic activity. It is necessary for policy-makers to think in terms of systems change – and to develop a set of goals and principles that can guide a transition, over many decades, to a more sustainable economy. Taxation is one tool – alongside regulation and spending measures – that can be used to support and guide this transition. As an initial step, the Group has developed a framework for deciding when to apply taxes to address negative environmental externalities. Box: Draft framework for taxing negative environmental externalities The suitability of taxation as a policy instrument (relative to other potential instruments) can be assessed through the following principles: measurability; behavioural responsiveness; risk tolerance; and scale. Taxation may be more useful as a policy response when there is a diversity of responses available to respond to the tax, and when there is significant revenue-raising potential. There are also five design principles that warrant particular attention: Māori rights and interests and distributional impacts must be addressed; the price of the tax should reflect the full cost of externalities; the price should vary locally where there is local variation in impacts; and international linkages should be considered. 7 Future of Tax Interim Report The Group believes there is significant scope for the tax system to play a greater role in sustaining and enhancing New Zealand’s natural capital. • In the short term, there may be benefits from expanding the coverage and rate of the Waste Disposal Levy, as well as strengthening the Emissions Trading Scheme, and advancing the use of congestion charging. • In the medium term, there could be benefits from the greater use of tax instruments to address water pollution and water abstraction challenges. Addressing Māori rights and interests in fresh water should be central to any changes. • In the long term, environmental taxes could help to address other challenges, such as biodiversity loss, and impacts on ecosystem services. Corrective taxes A tax on an environmental externality is a type of corrective tax – a tax that is primarily intended to change behaviour. Outside of the environmental sphere, New Zealand currently levies corrective taxes on the consumption of alcohol and tobacco. The Group also received many submissions calling for taxes on the consumption of sugar. The Group is reluctant to provide recommendations on the rates of alcohol and tobacco excise, since these require the input of public health expertise that the Group does not possess. Yet the Group does see a need to simplify the schedule of alcohol excise rates, and is concerned about the distributional impact of further increases in tobacco excise. The case for the introduction of a sugar tax must rest on a clear view of the Government’s objectives. If the Government wishes to reduce the consumption of sugar across the board, a sugar tax is likely to be an effective response. If the Government wishes to reduce the sugar content of particular products, regulation is likely to be more effective. In either case, there is a need to consider taxation alongside other potential policy responses. Goods and Services Tax (GST) GST is an important source of revenue for the Government. Yet the Group has received many submissions calling for a reduction in the GST rate – or for the introduction of new GST exceptions (for example, for food and drink) – to reduce the impact of GST on lower-income households. The Group acknowledges public concerns about the regressive nature of GST. Nevertheless, the Group has decided not to recommend a reduction in the GST rate, or the introduction of new exceptions. In doing so, the Group does not wish to deny public concerns, but rather to point out that there are more effective ways to increase progressivity than changes to GST. • The best mechanism to improve incomes for very low income households, for example, will be to increase welfare transfers. • If the intention is to improve incomes for certain groups of low-to-middle-income earners (such as full-time workers on the minimum wage), then changes to the personal income rates and/ or thresholds will be more effective. One other problematic aspect of GST is the treatment of financial services. Financial services are not subject to GST for reasons of administrative complexity. The Group has considered a number of options for taxing the consumption of financial services, but has not been able to identify a means of doing so that is both feasible and efficient. The Group does not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax at this point. Personal income and the future of work Personal income tax is the largest source of revenue for the Government. Alongside GST, it is the primary way in which most New Zealanders interact with the tax system. The fairness and integrity of income tax therefore bears directly on New Zealanders’ views of the fairness and integrity of the tax system as a whole. The Group has not yet finalised its views on the rates and thresholds for income tax, but notes that reductions to the lower rates and/or increases in the lower thresholds would be the most progressive 8 Future of Tax Interim Report means of assisting low- and middle-income earners through the tax system. The impact of inflation on income tax is best dealt with through periodic reviews of the thresholds. Most income tax is collected through the PAYE system. PAYE is a withholding system in which employers are responsible for deducting and paying income tax on their employees’ behalf. PAYE has served New Zealand extremely well, but its effectiveness will reduce if labour market changes increase the proportion of self-employed workers in the future. The Group supports Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, and recommends further expansion of the use of withholding tax (including to digital platform providers, such as ride-sharing companies). The Group has also discussed support for childcare costs to increase participation in the workforce, but believes this support is best delivered outside the tax system. The taxation of business Company tax is an important part of the revenue base. But the taxation of business also has a broader impact on wellbeing. It affects the accumulation of physical and financial capital across the economy; it affects social and human capital by changing the incentives for businesses to create employment and invest in the skills of their workers. The Group believes that the current approach to the taxation of business is largely sound. The Group does not see a case to reduce the company rate, or to move away from the imputation system. The tax rate for Māori authorities also remains appropriate (although the rate should be extended to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities). The Government asked the Group to consider the merits of a progressive company tax (with lower rates for small businesses). The Group recommends against the introduction of a progressive company tax on the basis that reductions in compliance costs are likely to be a more effective means of supporting small businesses. The Group is still forming its views on the best ways to reduce compliance costs and enhance business productivity. The main focus of many submissions, however, was on the treatment of multinationals and digital firms. In this regard, the Group notes that New Zealand is currently participating in discussions at the OECD on the future of the international tax framework. The Group supports this process, but recommends that the Government stand ready to implement an equalisation tax on digital services if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction. The integrity of the tax system Most New Zealanders recognise the importance of paying tax, and meet their tax obligations. Some, however, do not. Tax avoidance reduces the integrity of the tax system and erodes social capital. It is also fundamentally unfair, because it means that compliant taxpayers must pay more in order to make up for the lost revenue. A number of integrity risks have been addressed over the years. For example, the alignment of the trustee rate and the top personal income rate has greatly reduced the use of trusts to shelter income and avoid tax. At the moment, however, there does appear to be an issue with the use of closely-held companies. Some of the underlying problems here derive from the fact that the company and top personal tax rates are not aligned, but there is a clear need for Inland Revenue to strengthen enforcement around the use of current accounts in closely-held companies. The Group also recommends measures to reduce the extent of the hidden economy (i.e. undeclared and cash-in-hand transactions). These measures could include an increase in the reporting of labour income, and even the removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. Tax collection could be enhanced by increasing the penalties for non-compliance. The Group recommends options such as making directors personally liable for arrears on GST and PAYE obligations, and departure prohibition orders in cases of serious wrong-doing. The Group also recommends the establishment of a single Crown debt collection agency, to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. 9 Future of Tax Interim Report The Group also recommends that Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. The treatment of charities Charities and not-for-profits make important contributions to the wellbeing of New Zealand. The activities of these organisations enhance the social, human, and natural capital in New Zealand. In turn, the Government supports the work of charities by offering tax exemptions for charity income, and tax benefits for donations to charities. The Group has received many submissions regarding the treatment of business income for charities, and whether the tax exemption for charitable business income confers an unfair advantage on the trading operations of charities. The Group’s view is that the underlying issue is more about the extent to which charities are distributing or applying the surpluses from their activities (either active businesses or passive investments) for the benefit of the charitable purpose. If a charitable business regularly distributes its funds to its head charity, or provides services connected with its charitable purposes, it will not accumulate capital faster than a taxpaying business. The question, then, is whether the broader policy settings for charities are encouraging appropriate levels of distribution. The Group is concerned about the treatment of private charitable foundations and trusts. These foundations and trusts benefit from the donor tax concessions, but are not required to have arm’s- length governance boards or distribution policies. The rules around these foundations and trusts appear to be unusually loose. The Group believes that the charity deregistration tax rules could be amended to more effectively keep assets in the sector, and also questions whether the current GST concessions for non-profit bodies are appropriate. The Government has launched a review of the Charities Act 2005 to ensure it remains effective and fit-for-purpose. Some of the issues identified by the Group could potentially be addressed through this legislative review, or followed up through the Tax Policy Work Programme. The administration of the tax system Tax policy is given effect, day in and day out, through the administration of the tax system. The quality of administration is central to public perceptions of the legitimacy and fairness of tax policy; the effectiveness of administration will determine the Government’s ability to achieve its policy intent in levying taxation. Tax secrecy is a topical issue in tax administration at the moment.The Group believes there is a need for greater public access to data and information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publically available). Inland Revenue should review whether the information and data it currently collects offers the most useful insights, or whether other data sets would better respond to the needs and interests of the public. The Group also believes there is a need to improve the resolution of tax disputes. The Group recommends the establishment of a taxpayer advocate service to assist taxpayers in disputes with Inland Revenue, and also wishes to ensure the Office of the Ombudsman is adequately resourced to carry out its functions in relation to tax. The Group has discussed opportunities to improve the development of tax policy and legislation. In particular, the Group encourages Inland Revenue to engage in good faith consultation with a more diverse range of voices in the development of new policy. Next steps The Group has discussed many issues over the past six months – but also recognises that there is still much to do before the presentation of the Final Report in February 2019. This work will include further consideration of measures to extend the taxation of capital income, as well as analysis of the distributional impact of the various options for reform. The Group believes there are real opportunities to improve the fairness, balance, and structure of the tax system. Yet the Group’s views are by no means final, and feedback from all New Zealanders is very much welcome. Together, we can shape the future of tax. 10 Future of Tax Interim Report Part I Purposes and frameworks 11 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Over the past nine months, the Group has engaged in a national conversation with New Zealanders about the future of the tax system. Thousands of New Zealanders – including iwi, businesses, unions, and other organisations – have shared their thoughts and had their say on the future of tax. 2. The views and suggestions have differed from submission to submission. Yet the Group has been struck by the depth of interest and passion expressed by all submitters on the issues before us. It is clear that tax matters to everyone. 3. There is good reason for the passion we have seen. If the ultimate purpose of public policy is to improve wellbeing, then few areas of public policy contribute as much to the wellbeing of New Zealanders as the tax system. 4. There are three main ways in which the tax system supports the wellbeing of New Zealanders: • A fair and efficient source of revenue. Taxes provide revenue for the Government to fund the public goods and services that underpin our living standards. The tax system thus represents a way in which citizens come together to channel resources for the collective good of society. • A means of redistribution. Taxes fund the redistribution that allows all New Zealanders, regardless of their market income, to participate fully in society. While much of this redistribution occurs through the transfer system, the progressive nature of the income tax means that the tax system also plays a role in reducing inequality. • A policy instrument to influence behaviours. Taxes can also be used as an instrument to achieve specific policy goals by influencing behaviour. Taxes influence behaviour by changing the price of goods, services, or activities; taxes can discourage certain activities, and favour others. In this way, taxes can complement – or even replace – traditional policy tools such as regulation and spending, depending on which approach reflects the most effective way to achieve society’s goals. This may be particularly important in the environmental sphere. 5. In light of these perspectives, the Group has decided to take a rounded view on the purpose of the tax system. The tax system is essential as a source of revenue to the Government – but it is also an important tool that can be used positively to pursue distributional goals, shape behaviour, improve living standards, and develop sustainably. The Group has been alert to these multiple purposes in developing its recommendations. 1 The purposes of tax 12 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. The Group believes it is important to bring a broad conception of wellbeing and living standards to its work on the tax system. This approach reflects the composition of the Group, which includes members with a diverse range of skills and experience, including perspectives from beyond the tax system. 2. Many factors affect living standards, and many of these factors have value beyond their contribution to material comfort. Only a subset of those values can be captured in monetary terms, but non-monetary factors are key determinants of wellbeing and living standards. As an example, certain types of economic activity may increase material comfort, but reduce wellbeing overall, if the by-products of that activity degrade the natural environment. 3. To measure wellbeing comprehensively, income measures must therefore be supplemented with measures of other factors, such as health, connectedness, security, rights and capabilities, and sustainability. In the Submissions Background Paper, the Group referred to two perspectives for assessing the full range of impacts from tax policy: the Living Standards Framework, and the established principles of tax policy design. The Living Standards Framework 4. The Living Standards Framework identifies four capital stocks that are crucial to wellbeing: financial and physical capital; human capital; social capital; and natural capital. Wellbeing depends on the sustainable development and distribution of the four capitals, which together represent the comprehensive wealth of New Zealand. 5. The Living Standards Framework encourages policymakers to explore how policy change affects the four capitals. It widens the scope of analysis to include a more comprehensive range of factors, distributional perspectives, and dynamic considerations. In this way, the Living Standards Framework is consistent in intent with international wellbeing frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals (Treasury 2018). Te Ao Māori perspectives on wellbeing and living standards 6. The Government has identified a need to explore how Te Ao Māori perspectives can inform our understanding and application of the Living Standards Framework. Consistent with this work, the Submissions Background Paper invited submitters to reflect on how tikanga Māori could help to create a more future-focussed tax system. 7. The Group is currently working with stakeholders to develop a framework that draws on principles from Te Ao Māori, and encompasses the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework, as well as the principles of tax policy design, to arrive at a more holistic view of wellbeing. 8. The framework is centred on the concept of waiora. Waiora is commonly used in Te Ao Māori to express wellbeing; it comes from the word for water (wai) as the source of all life. 9. The framework then draws upon four tikanga principles: manaakitanga (care and respect); kaitiakitanga (stewardship); whanaungatanga (the relationships/connections between us); and ōhanga (prosperity). These principles support the preservation and sustainable development of the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework. 2 Frameworks for assessing tax policy 13 Future of Tax Interim Report Figure 2.1: Bringing together Te Ao Māori perspectives and the Living Standards Framework 10. The Group will conduct further engagement on the development and application of this framework in October, to ensure that the framework is meaningful, inclusive, and enhances tax policy development for Māori and all New Zealanders. This process will also inform the ongoing development of the Living Standards Framework. 11. While this framework is still under development, the Group has noted areas in subsequent analysis where tikanga concepts seem to have particular resonance – but this is very much a work in progress that will need to be fleshed out further in the Final Report, following further engagement with stakeholders. The established principles of tax policy design 12. Previous tax reviews, in New Zealand and elsewhere, have used a relatively consistent set of principles to assess the design of the tax system. These principles are efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. 13. Two further important principles in the tax system are predictability and certainty – meaning that taxpayers should be able to understand clearly what their obligations are before those obligations are due. 14. The Group believes these principles remain valid and useful in assessments of the tax system, particularly when considering the costs and benefits of options for reform. These principles complement the systems perspective offered by a broader living standards analysis. Submitter perspectives on assessment frameworks 15. Many public submitters commented on the Group’s choice of assessment framework. Most submitters supported the Group’s decision to apply both the established principles of tax policy design and a broader Living Standards lens. 16. These submitters felt that the established principles provided a proven method of evaluating tax policy, while the Living Standards Framework ensured that the analysis would incorporate a fuller range of perspectives. 17. Māori submitters also encouraged the Group to bring a Te Ao Māori perspective to the design of the tax system. 18. A broader message the Group has taken from submitters is that it is necessary to bring a wide range of perspectives to bear on its analysis. This will ensure stakeholders have a clear understanding of the wellbeing and living standards impacts of the options before us. 14 Future of Tax Interim Report Part II Issues and challenges 15 Future of Tax Interim Report 3 New Zealand’s current tax system 1. The Group’s Submissions Background Paper explored the features of the current tax system in some depth. This chapter will revisit the key features of the tax system, with a focus on those features that are particularly distinctive about New Zealand. The ‘broad-base, low rate’ tax policy framework 2. New Zealand’s current tax system is underpinned by a tax policy framework known as ‘broad-base, low rate.’ In a broad-based system, there should be few exceptions to the base on which the tax is levied. The benefit of a broad-based system is that it allows the Government to raise substantial amounts of revenue at relatively low rates of taxation. 3. The ‘broad-base, low rate’ framework is reflected in the tax system’s reliance on three main taxes: the personal income tax, the company income tax, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The Government raises about 90% of its tax revenue from these three taxes. This is a relatively narrow range of taxation, and means that New Zealand relies little on other potential sources of revenue, such as environmental taxation. Figure 3.1: Source of taxation revenue, 2015 (OECD countries) 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% France Japan Slovak Republic Czech Republic Poland Netherlands Spain Italy Slovenia Korea Germany Belgium Luxembourg Hungary Austria Greece Switzerland Turkey Estonia United States OECD - Average Latvia Finland United Kingdom Portugal Mexico Norway Israel Canada Sweden Ireland Iceland Australia Chile New Zealand Denmark Percent of taxation revenue IndividualsCorporatesGST (customs inclusive)Other Source: OECD 16 Future of Tax Interim Report 4. The taxes that New Zealand does levy have relatively broad bases. This allows the Government to raise significant amounts of revenue at rates lower than in most OECD countries. Compared with other OECD countries: • New Zealand raises roughly equivalent amounts of revenue. Total tax revenue, including local government rates, stands at 32% of GDP. This is only slightly below the OECD average of 34% of GDP. • New Zealand has a low GST rate, and one of the lowest top personal tax rates, but collects high proportions of income tax revenue and GST revenue to GDP. • New Zealand’s company rate is above average, and company tax revenue to GDP is high. After imputation, however, New Zealand’s tax rate on domestic shareholders is the sixth-lowest in the OECD. New Zealand is more reliant on company tax revenue than most other OECD countries. • New Zealand raises little revenue from environmental taxation 1 . Distinctive features 5. New Zealand’s tax system is quite distinctive in some respects. New Zealand makes little use of social security levies, environmental taxes, or corrective taxes (with the notable exceptions of alcohol and tobacco excise taxes, which are intended to discourage drinking and smoking). On the other hand, New Zealand’s GST regime has few exceptions compared to other countries, and is therefore very efficient at raising revenue. 6. New Zealand’s treatment of capital income also diverges from the approach taken by other countries. This is because New Zealand does not generally tax capital income in the form of gains. Thus, gains from the sale of shares and businesses, and some sales of land 2 , are not generally taxed – whereas gains from financial arrangements and some sales of land are taxed. 1 See Tax Working Group, Future of Tax – Submissions Background Paper (2018) for sources. 2 In this report, unless stated otherwise, “land” includes both the value of unimproved land as well as improvements to the land such as housing. 7. New Zealand offers few concessions for retirement saving: retirement saving contributions are taxed when they are made and as investment income is earned, rather than when the savings are drawn down in retirement. 8. The other distinctive feature of New Zealand’s tax system is the imputation regime, which prevents the double taxation of company income that is distributed as dividends. The imputation regime is discussed further in Chapter 14 on The taxation of business. 9. Outside the national tax system, rates are the primary source of revenue for local government. Rates are a narrow-based wealth tax on real estate. Local authorities in New Zealand, unlike their counterparts in most other jurisdictions, do not have the power to levy sales taxes, income taxes, or transaction taxes. Distributional outcomes 10. There are different ways of measuring the distributional outcomes of the tax system. In absolute terms, higher-income households play an important role in funding the Government. The share of income tax paid increases as household income increases. Households in the top income decile pay around 35% of all income tax (on 30% of total household gross income), whereas households in the lowest five income deciles collectively pay less than 20% of all income tax (on 23% of total household gross income). 11. In other respects, however, the tax system is not particularly progressive. As Figure 3.3 illustrates, for example, there is not a significant increase in average effective tax rates across income deciles, even though the amount of tax paid increases by income decile. 12. Instead, progressivity is largely delivered through transfers, such as Working for Families. Figure 3.3 shows that households in the lowest four deciles do not, on average, pay any net tax after transfers are subtracted from income tax, GST, and ACC levies. There are higher net taxes as income increases. 17 Future of Tax Interim Report Figure 3.2: Percentage of income tax and transfers by income decile, 2014/15 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% Decile 1Decile 2Decile 3Decile 4Decile 5Decile 6Decile 7Decile 8Decile 9Decile 10 Percentage of total for each decile Decile of equivalised disposable household income Government transfersIncome taxGross income Source: Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development, 2017 (data based on Household Economic Survey (HES) 2015).

The inequality-reducing power of the tax and transfer system has fallen over the last three decades (Perry 2017). This outcome reflects the fact that the tax system and the transfer system have both become less effective at reducing inequality. 14. It is difficult to make cross-country comparisons on this issue, because the outcome may be affected by choices about which taxes are included and which are excluded for the purposes of the analysis. Figure 3.4 is based on the OECD Income Distribution database; it includes personal income taxes, employees’ social security contributions, and cash transfers, but excludes payroll taxes and value-added taxes (including GST). Figure 3.4 illustrates that New Zealand’s tax and transfer system reduces income inequality, but by less than is the case in Australia, or on average across the OECD. 15. The progressivity of the tax system is also affected by the treatment of capital income. The incomplete taxation of capital income benefits 3 Statistics New Zealand 2018 (Labour Market Statistics). the wealthy, whereas the absence of large concessions for retirement saving is a more progressive feature of the system. Gender outcomes 16. As women’s personal income levels are less than men’s, they will pay less tax than men overall. Women also receive more in transfers than men. They therefore benefit less from tax reductions or tax concessions, and are more adversely affected by reductions in social welfare benefits. The average annual income of women is around $36,000, and the average income of men is around $54,000. The median annual income of women is around $26,000, and the median annual income of men is around $45,000. 3 Figure 3.5 shows the distribution of men and women by income decile. 17. The incomplete taxation of capital income is also likely to benefit men more than women, who have greater levels of personal wealth.

Summary 18. Two key points emerge from this discussion of the current tax system: • New Zealand relies on a relatively narrow range of taxes. The Government raises about 90% of its tax revenue from only three taxes: the personal income tax; the company income tax; and GST. New Zealand makes little use of other sources of taxation, such as social security levies, environmental taxes, or corrective taxes. Thus, while the taxes that are levied have broad bases, the overall range of taxation is relatively narrow. • The tax system is not particularly progressive. Instead, progressivity is largely delivered through transfers, such as Working for Families. Yet New Zealand’s tax and transfer system reduces income inequality by less than the OECD average. The progressivity of the tax system is also affected by the treatment of capital income. The inconsistent taxation of capital income from gains primarily benefits the wealthy. 19. In subsequent chapters, the Group will explore the issues and opportunities that arise from these key features of the tax system. 20 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Tax systems have always evolved alongside changing practices in business, technology, and society. Today, however, change is particularly relentless, and technology is having a radical impact on the way businesses operate – both within and across national borders. 2. In the Submissions Background Paper, the Group identified eight challenges, risks, and opportunities that the tax system will face over the coming decade and beyond: • Changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring. • Te Ao Māori and the role of the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand’s overall living standards. • The changing nature of work. • Technological change and the different business models that will bring. • Falling company tax rates around the world. • Environmental challenges, including climate change and loss of ecosystem services and species. • Growing concern about inequality. • The impacts of globalisation and changes in its patterns. 3. The Group asked submitters to share their views on how these challenges and opportunities might affect the tax system. The Group also asked submitters to tell us whether we had missed any important issues. Submitter perspectives 4. Submitters generally agreed with the issues that we identified. Reading through the submissions, there appear to five broad areas of common concern to New Zealanders. Climate change and environmental degradation 5. The Group received a large number of submissions about the twin challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. New Zealanders are concerned about the state of the environment, and their concerns cover effects at the local, national, and global levels. 6. Yet there was also much debate about the role of the tax system in responding to these challenges. Many submitters are clearly looking to the Group to recommend the introduction of specific environmental taxes. Others question whether tax is the right instrument to address environmental problems. 7. In either case, most submitters stressed that tax should not be considered in isolation when dealing with the environment; instead, the merits of tax as a policy instrument should be assessed together with the merits of other tools and approaches. 4 Issues and challenges raised by submitters 21 Future of Tax Interim Report Changes in business, technology, and the nature of work 8. Many submitters agreed with the Group that the tax system must respond to changes in business, technology, and the nature of work. Submitters highlighted four pressure points for our attention: • The erosion of the PAYE base as working arrangements change. • The growing importance of capital income relative to labour income. • The tax treatment of the digital economy. • International business activity. 9. Some submitters also signalled the importance of maintaining the international competitiveness of the New Zealand tax system, particularly in a context where corporate tax rates are falling in other countries. The Group has heard clearly from submitters that the tax system should support the productivity of the New Zealand economy. 10. Some submitters also suggested there is further scope to improve the administration of the tax system through investments in new technology. Demographic change 11. Submitters acknowledged the impact of the ageing population, which will result in slower revenue growth and higher Government expenses on the health system and on New Zealand Superannuation. 12. For the Group, this point reinforces the importance of maintaining a sustainable revenue base over time. A sustainable revenue base must be flexible enough to respond to increasing demands for public services, yet provide reasonable certainty to taxpayers by signposting the direction of tax policy and avoiding unexpected policy shocks. 4 The Government established the Welfare Expert Advisory Group in May 2018 to conduct a broad-ranging review of the welfare system. Among other things, the Welfare Expert Advisory Group has been tasked to develop recommendations for improving Working for Families, and to examine other areas where the interface with the welfare system is not functioning well. 13. Some submitters also highlighted the increasing diversity of the New Zealand population. There will be an increasing proportion of Māori, Pasifika, Asian, and other ethnicities in the working age population over the coming decades. Submitters pointed to the need to reduce disparities between population groups and enhance the potential of all rangatahi (young people). Progressivity, fairness, and integrity 14. Many submitters are worried that rising inequality will reduce wellbeing and social cohesion in New Zealand. Consequently, most submitters – but not all – expressed support for a more progressive tax system. 15. These concerns about the impact of inequality were often bound up with concerns about the fairness and integrity of the tax system. Many submitters argued that the inconsistent taxation of capital gains and the treatment of international business activity reduce the fairness and integrity of the tax system. 16. There were a number of submissions regarding the hidden economy and the effectiveness of tax collection. Submitters made the point that public buy-in to the tax system rests on the belief that all New Zealanders are paying their fair share of taxes. The Group agrees, and has prioritised the issue of the integrity of the tax system during the course of its work. 17. The Group also received submissions on the interface between the tax and transfer systems. The Terms of Reference exclude the Group from making specific recommendations on this subject, but the Group has been mindful of the tax/transfer interface in the course of its work, and is maintaining a dialogue with the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. 4 22 Future of Tax Interim Report Capital, savings, and housing 18. The issues of capital, savings, and housing recur throughout the submissions. It is clear to the Group that these issues lie at the heart of public concerns about the tax system. Indeed, the treatment of capital, saving, and housing is inextricably linked to judgements about the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system as a whole. 19. The submissions ranged widely. Many submitters are concerned about the extent to which the tax system affects saving and investment decisions. There were particularly strong views about the impact of the tax system on the housing market. Submitters also made vigorous arguments for and against tax reductions, especially on retirement savings. 20. Having read through these submissions, the Group has devoted considerable time to the taxation of capital, savings, and housing. Our task is to chart a way forward on these issues that is fair, durable, and efficient. 23 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. The Group has been asked to assess the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. These are subjective concepts, and there are different ways to work towards a judgement on them. The Group has borne the following questions in mind in the course of its work: • Does the tax system treat income consistently, no matter how it is earned and in which sectors it is earned? • Does the tax system minimise opportunities for tax avoidance? • Are the bases of the tax system likely to be sustainable over time? • Should taxation be used as a tool to influence behaviour? 2. This chapter will begin to form a judgement on these questions through two lenses: the treatment of financial and physical capital; and the treatment of natural capital stocks. Concepts of income 3. Underlying these judgements are some key assumptions about what constitutes ‘income.’ Income may be an easy word to say, but it has many different meanings. 4. There are accounting definitions of income, and economic definitions of income. ‘Haig-Simons income,’ for example, is defined as ‘consumption plus changes in net worth’ (JCT 2012). Then there are welfare definitions, which are used to assess whether an individual is eligible for income-tested benefits, and lay definitions, which might be as simple as ‘cash in hand.’ All of these forms of income can be represented in either nominal or inflation-adjusted terms. Natural capital can also generate ‘income’ in the form of ecological services. 5. A second set of definitions relates to the taxable unit. In the tax system, this may include individuals, households, and entities such as companies and trusts. Dominant cultural assumptions, for example regarding the definition of the family, underpin the use of these definitions within the tax system. 6. None of these concepts of income are right or wrong. They are all relevant in certain contexts. The challenge for policymakers is to think about what definition of income and taxable unit will be most appropriate in the context of each policy decision. 7. In this regard, the differences in income definitions between the tax and welfare systems appear to be particularly problematic, because they create confusion for individuals trying to understand their entitlements when they move in and out of the welfare system. The Group considers that this issue would be most appropriately considered by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. Labour income and capital income 8. A first way of judging the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system is to assess whether income appears to be treated in a consistent manner, no matter how it is earned. 9. Income in the tax system is divided into two broad categories: labour income and capital income. Labour income is income earned from performing services (such as a wage or salary), or from personal exertion. Capital income is income earned from an asset. 5 The structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system 24 Future of Tax Interim Report 10. Labour income is taxed through the income tax. Much capital income is taxed as well. Interest, rents, royalties, and receipts earned in the ordinary course of business are all subject to income tax. The tax rate depends on the type of entity earning the income. 5 Companies, for example, are taxed at a rate of 28%, whereas individuals are taxed on a progressive scale. 6 11. However, there is a significant element of capital income which is generally not taxed – receipts which often come from the sale of capital assets. This element of capital income is commonly known as ‘capital gains.’ While currently generally outside the tax system, realised capital gains provide a basis for consumption in the same way as labour or interest income. General principles 12. New Zealand’s income tax law is founded on a distinction between income (or ‘revenue’) gains and expenditure, which are taxed and deductible, and capital gains and expenditure, which are exempt and non-deductible. 7 13. In principle, gains derived in the ordinary course of carrying on a business are income and therefore taxable, and other gains are generally exempt. In practice, it is often difficult to draw this distinction, because it depends on judgements about a person’s intentions, the nature of their business, and the role of a particular asset, liability or payment within that business. 14. New Zealand already taxes some payments that used to be treated as capital payments. Examples of taxable capital gains include lease inducement and surrender payments, proceeds from the sales of patents, and gains from certain land sales. The rationale for doing so, in general, is that these payments are particularly substitutable for taxable income. 5 Subsequent chapters will explore further the taxation of savings and the treatment of taxable entities. 6 When a company pays a dividend then generally the income from the company will effectively be taxed at the personal level if the shareholder is a New Zealand resident. 7 Much capital expenditure, however, is deductible over time through depreciation. 15. Sometimes tax avoidance law applies to tax a capital gain. For example, some share sales are taxable on the basis that they include income that would otherwise have been received as dividends. In this case, the basis for taxation is a judgement that, in substance, the gain ‘should’ be taxed – even if the ordinary application of the law would place the gain on capital account. Gains from specific classes of physical and financial capital Land 16. Gains on the sale of land are taxable if the land was bought with a purpose or intention of resale, even if resale was not the only or dominant purpose or intention of the purchase. Capital losses are generally not deductible unless a gain on the sale of the property would be taxable. 17. The bright-line test for residential property sales aids the enforcement of this rule. It serves as a proxy for ‘purpose of disposal’ – which can otherwise be difficult to enforce – by taxing the sale of any residential property within five years of purchase, subject to some exceptions. The most important exception is that the family home is generally excluded from the test. 18. Capital gains on owner-occupied homes are not generally taxed. There are two main exceptions: the ‘main home’ exclusion from the bright-line test can only be used twice in a two-year period; and owner-occupiers with a regular pattern of buying and selling residential land cannot use the ‘main home’ exclusion for the land sale rules, including the bright-line rule. 19. Land affected by changes to zoning, consents, or other specified changes may be taxed on sale, if the sale is within ten years of acquisition. If at least 20% of the gain on disposal can be attributed to the change, the whole gain is taxable. However, the taxable amount is reduced by 10% for each year the taxpayer has owned the land. 25 Future of Tax Interim Report 20. Land disposals may be taxed if an undertaking or scheme involving more than minor development or division of the land was commenced within ten years of the land being acquired. Land disposals may also be taxed if there has been an undertaking or scheme of division or development of the land that involves significant expenditure on specified works, subject to a number of exclusions. 21. Most of the land sale rules represent attempts to codify or buttress common law principles that would have made land sales taxable in any event. Because the principles are factually dependent, however, the rules also tend to be factually dependent, and have given rise to much uncertainty and litigation. They are also difficult to enforce at a practical level. Shares in New Zealand companies 22. Gains on shares are only taxable if they have been acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal, or in the course of a person’s share dealing business. Shares are otherwise held on capital account, and gains on those shares are not taxable. 23. In practice, it can be difficult to determine the dominant purpose of acquisition, or whether a person is a share dealer who acquired the shares in the course of their business. Although most people acquire shares with a view to selling them at some later time for a profit, this fact is insufficient by itself to satisfy the ‘dominant purpose’ test. 24. Enforcement is difficult. Taxpayers tend to take the view that they have not acquired shares with a purpose of resale; the case law is extensive and contains many decisions that taxpayers can use to justify a revenue-unfavourable outcome. Yet the law also creates uncertainty for taxpayers, and it can be costly for taxpayers to defend if Inland Revenue decides to audit a transaction. 25. Several aspects of the regime for taxing companies and shares in companies are worth exploring in more detail: • Shares held by portfolio investment entities (PIEs). Gains on Australasian shares held by PIEs are not taxable. This treatment is a response to the fact that gains on shares held by individuals are in practice rarely taxable. Applying a different approach to PIEs would have created a bias against the use of managed funds for equity investment, so managed funds operating as PIEs are exempted from taxation on the sales of New Zealand and Australian shares. • Non-portfolio professional investors. There is uncertainty regarding the treatment of share sale gains and losses by angel, venture capital, and private equity investors. In practice, gains to these investors are rarely returned as taxable and losses are rarely claimed as deductible. Shares in foreign companies 26. The fair dividend rate (FDR) method is generally used to tax portfolio investment in foreign shares (other than in Australian listed companies). Shares are generally taxed on a 5% deemed return, based on the opening value of the shares in each year. Actual dividends and sale proceeds are not taxed. However, in any given year, individuals and family trusts can pay tax on the actual return from their foreign share portfolio (including accruing gains and losses) if it is lower than the deemed return. 27. FDR is intended to raise revenue, while reducing the bias against foreign equity investment through managed funds. For domestic shares, this bias was dealt with by exempting PIEs from tax on gains from sale. But this approach would be problematic in relation to foreign shares. Since the income of foreign companies is not taxed unless it is earned in New Zealand, and such companies often do not pay large dividends, a failure to tax the gain on sale would allow most of the return from the investment to escape the domestic tax system. The solution was to tax both individuals and funds on a reasonable – but approximate – deemed return. 26 Future of Tax Interim Report 28. The following approaches apply for direct investment where the shareholder owns more than 10% of the non-resident company: • Controlled foreign companies. The capital/ revenue distinction applies to controlled foreign companies, with the result that most gains on sale are not taxable and most losses are not deductible. However, income from holdings in passive investments is directly attributed to the shareholders. • Other types of direct investment. In other cases, the shareholder can generally choose between treating the investment as a portfolio investment (in which case it is taxed under the FDR method) or in a similar fashion to shares in a controlled foreign company (in which case there is attribution if the holding is passive). Capital losses and expenses 29. The capital/revenue test applied by the courts denies deductions for capital expenses, but deductions are allowed by statute for many types of expenditure that would otherwise sit on capital account. This includes deductions for depreciation. Depreciation deductions initially applied only to tangible property, but have been extended to apply to forms of depreciating intangible property, such as computer software, and even to the costs associated with unsuccessful attempts to acquire certain types of property. 30. No deductions are allowed for the cost of acquiring goodwill (since payments received for goodwill are not taxable). Building depreciation deductions were abolished in 2010. Assessment 31. There are inconsistencies in the current treatment of capital income. Much capital income is taxed, but income from the sale of capital assets is often not taxed. The most significant forms of capital income outside the tax net are gains from the sale of land (including housing), shares (other than portfolio investment in non-resident companies), businesses, and intellectual property, in cases where those assets have been acquired for a purpose other than sale. The treatment of sectors and industries 32. A second way of judging the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system is to assess whether the tax system deals with different sectors and industries in a broadly consistent way. An analysis of effective company tax rates can provide an insight into this issue. The lens of effective tax rate analysis 33. New Zealand’s statutory company tax rate is 28%. However, companies may pay a rate of tax on their accounting profit that is different to the statutory tax rate. This outcome may arise due to differences in how tax rules apply to companies, and differences between taxable income and accounting income. 34. The effective tax rate compares the amount of income tax paid by a company with their accounting profit before tax. It can be defined as follows: Effective tax rate = 28% × Total group taxable income (before losses brought forward) Accounting profit before tax 35. Effective tax rates can provide a high level indication of where there may be under-taxation of companies, in particular where companies are paying a low level of tax relative to their accounting profits. What this means is the actual tax rate paid by the company can vary from the statutory rate of 28%. For example, if half of a company’s profit were untaxed capital gains it might have an effective tax rate of 14% rather than the statutory tax rate of 28%. 36. Yet there are a number of limitations to effective tax rate analysis. Perhaps the most significant is that low effective tax rates can reflect the impact of deliberate policy choices such as the introduction of tax concessions in certain industries. 37. Additional caveats to effective tax rate analysis include: • Effective tax rates look at the income tax paid by companies, not by their shareholders or other entities. In some instances, under- taxation will be ‘corrected’ by the dividend or imputation rules. 27 Future of Tax Interim Report • The results are sensitive to the choice of time period. • New Zealand has thin markets, so the results of a small number of firms can significantly skew sector analysis. • Accounting may not be the most appropriate measure for considering income tax as it is more accrual-based than income tax is. • There are margins of error associated with data quality and technical issues. Effective tax rates by sector and industry 38. Inland Revenue and the Treasury have calculated the effective tax rates of significant enterprises in a number of industry groups (Inland Revenue & Treasury 2018). This analysis indicates that some industries appear to pay a low amount of tax relative to their accounting profit. 39. There may be valid reasons for tax treatment to differ from accounting treatment. Some companies may be earning foreign income that is not taxed in New Zealand, and there are areas where tax rules differ from accounting rules (for example, relating to the treatment of depreciation). 40. The most significant cause of low effective tax rates, however, appears to be untaxed income in the form of gains from capital assets. A more consistent approach to the taxation of this form of capital income would bring effective tax rates closer to statutory rates in many industries. Taxing gains on disposal would not, however, have much of an impact on industries that hold assets for the long term. It would also not impact industries where income is already subject to tax, but there are significant timing benefits for deductions. 41. The Group also notes that some industries benefit from deliberate tax concessions. Examples include accelerated deductions for certain types of farming, film, and forestry expenditure, as well as petroleum mining. The Government should keep these concessions under periodic review to ensure they remain consistent with its policy intent. Natural capital 42. This chapter has thus far assessed the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system from a traditional tax perspective. A broader Living Standards Framework perspective would consider the relationship between natural capital and the tax system, and acknowledge natural capital as a profound and non-substitutable basis for the economy. 43. Natural capital is not prominent in current conceptions of the tax system. As discussed in Chapter 3, New Zealand makes little use of environmental taxation. There is also little or no consideration of natural capital impacts in the development of new tax policy, and no reporting on the environmental impacts of current tax policy. 44. Yet taxation could serve as an important policy instrument to achieve our environmental objectives. Placing a price on polluting activities would help to ensure that polluters faced the full costs of their activities; there is also a choice to go even further and use environmental taxation to promote broader changes in the pattern of economic activity (alongside other policy instruments, such as spending and regulation). The additional revenue could also be used to support a transition to a more sustainable economy. 45. Given the non-substitutable nature of natural capital, the declining state of New Zealand’s environment, and the increasing fiscal costs of mitigation and adaptation, the Group sees a case to broaden the base of the tax system and make greater use of environmental taxation. These issues are developed further in Chapter 9 on Environmental and ecological outcomes. 28 Future of Tax Interim Report Overall judgements 46. This chapter has assessed the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system through two lenses: the treatment of income from physical and financial capital; and the treatment of natural capital. 47. There are inconsistencies in the treatment of some forms of capital income. These inconsistencies raise a number of concerns for the Group: • Fairness. The inconsistent treatment of capital income is unfair. This unfairness will only increase if the economy becomes more capital intensive through a greater use of technology replacing labour. • Distributional impact. It is the wealthiest members of society who benefit the most from the inconsistent taxation of capital income. There is a risk that this regressive outcome erodes the social capital that sustains public acceptance of the tax system. 8 Taxation in this context refers to economic instruments that can be potentially revenue raising for central or local government. • Revenue sustainability. As the population ages, a greater proportion of the population will live off capital income in retirement. The economy is likely to become increasingly capital intensive and capital income, when compared to labour income, is increasing. A tax base that is sustainable over time – and that is fair in an intergenerational sense – will need to draw more upon capital income as well as labour income. 48. There are many considerations involved in the extension of the taxation of capital income. Chapter 6 on Capital and wealth will explore these considerations in greater depth, and begin to outline a number of options for broadening the tax base further. 49. There are also clearly opportunities to increase the use of environmental taxation 8 . The Group has prioritised considerations of environmental taxation during the course of its work. Chapter 9 on Environmental and ecological outcomes introduces a framework developed by the Group for deciding when to apply environmental taxes, and shows how this framework could be applied to different stocks of natural capital. 29 Future of Tax Interim Report Part III Interim conclusions 30 Future of Tax Interim Report 6 Capital and wealth 1. The Group is considering the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system as it applies to wealth generally and capital income specifically. The Group has examined the merits of changing the tax system through extending the taxation of capital income to asset classes presently treated as giving rise to exempt capital gains. For the purposes of this chapter, capital is being used in its traditional sense of a factor in production rather than as a component of the living standards framework. 2. The Group is considering two main options for extending the taxation of capital income. These are taxing realised gains not already taxed from specific assets and taxing certain assets on a deemed return basis (a risk-free rate of return method, as an example). After consideration, the Group is not recommending either a general wealth tax or a land tax 9 for the reasons given at the end of this chapter. 3. Whether an extension of the taxation of capital income is assessed under either traditional tax principles or the living standards framework, its effectiveness will be dependent on its design. The Group has therefore sought to establish design principles or rules under which the taxes might be implemented, so that Government or affected taxpayers can consider all the consequences. Only once such an extension is designed can a meaningful comparison take place between the two options, or a combination of those options, and the status quo. 9 As discussed below, a land tax is a tax on the unimproved value of land. 4. The Group has made good progress in the past six months in determining what income might be included from certain assets and how and when the income might be taxed. The Group is not currently in a position to make specific recommendations, but is intending doing so in the Final Report. 5. This chapter: • Sets out the main policy considerations necessary for forming an overall judgement on extending the taxation of certain types of capital income. For the rest of this chapter it will be referred to as simply capital income. • Records a summary of the Group’s views on the design features for extending the tax on realised capital gains. • Comments on the risk-free return method, wealth and land taxes. 6. Greater detail on extending the tax on realised capital gains is contained in Appendix B on Design Features for Extending the Taxation of Capital Gains. 31 Future of Tax Interim Report Policy considerations 7. The 2017 OECD Economic Survey of New Zealand, as part of its analysis that New Zealand should adopt a broad-based capital gains tax, included a useful summary of the advantages and disadvantages (see Table 6.1 below). 8. The Group considers that this is a fair reflection of the key advantages and disadvantages expressed simply. However, in order to be able to recommend the implementation of such measures the Group will need to form the following overall judgement: In broad terms, will the fairness, integrity, revenue, and efficiency benefits from reform outweigh the administrative complexity, compliance costs, and efficiency costs that arise from the proposed additional capital income taxation? 10 This issue is discussed in detail in Appendix B. 9. The following sections outline the main considerations for and against reform. This is to give a sense of the main issues at stake as the Group forms its views over the following months. The long-term sustainability of the tax system 10. New Zealand, like other countries, faces growing fiscal pressures from an ageing population. Taxing capital income that is currently untaxed is likely to provide a significant and growing revenue base for the future. Such gains are the single largest source of income that other countries tax and that New Zealand largely does not. Table 6.1: AdvantagesDisadvantages Increase progressivity of the tax system. 1 Inefficient lock-in due to incentive to hold on to assets to avoid paying capital gains tax. Improve horizontal equity by taxing income whether it is earned on capital gains or otherwise. Taxes accrue on nominal as well as real gains. 2 Improve efficiency through reducing tax-driven incentive to make investments in assets that provide capital gains rather than income, in particular housing. In the absence of other tax changes, can discourage saving and investment through reducing post-tax returns, particularly if there are strict limits around relief for capital losses. Reduce incentive to shelter income from tax by transforming ordinary income into capital gain. Taxing gains on shares has potential for some double taxation of retained profits on which company tax has already been paid. 3 10 1. US and Australian evidence indicates that taxation of capital gains is highly progressive. This is likely to be the case for New Zealand too, as the distribution of wealth is more unequal than that of income: the top 20% of NZ households own almost 70% of net wealth and more than 75% of net wealth excluding owner-occupied dwellings (Statistics NZ, 2016). 2. This is a feature of nominal tax system more broadly and is more important for taxation of interest-bearing assets. Because capital gains taxed on realisation benefit from deferral of tax payments, real after-tax gains increase over time and thus capital gains are less affected by taxation of nominal gains than are interest-bearing assets (Burman, 2009). 3. Retained profits are not subject to full double taxation to the extent that there is a value placed on unused imputation credits that can be used for future dividends, as this value will be capitalised into the value of the company and thus increase capital gains (Burman and White, 2009) Source: OECD (2006), Taxation of Capital Gains of Individuals: Policy Considerations and Approaches, OECD Tax Policy Studies No. 14; OECD (2011), OECD Economic Surveys New Zealand, OECD Publishing; Tax Working Group (2010), A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future, Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group; Treasury and Inland Revenue (2009), “The Taxation of Capital Gains”, Background Paper for the Tax Working Group. 32 Future of Tax Interim Report 11. Taxing more capital income also taxes more income from land. Land has the advantage of being an immobile tax base, unlike financial capital and labour, which are increasingly mobile due to macro trends such as technology advances and globalisation. Broadening the tax base to include more income from land therefore helps to diversify and provide more flexibility in the system to respond to future changes. 12. Another important sustainability question, relates to the structure of the tax system. Despite the relatively small gap between our company tax rate and top personal tax rate, we already have integrity problems with people using company structures to lower their taxes. This is discussed further in Chapter 15. These pressures are only likely to grow if the company rate is lowered or the top personal rate is raised. Both of which are respectively high and low on average by international standards. A tax on realised gains on shares in effect forces retained earnings to be attributed to individual shareholders and in this way can, to some extent, reduce the scope for companies to be used to shelter personal income from higher rates of tax. Fairness 13. A sense of fairness is central to maintaining public trust and confidence in the tax system. This is because a system that distributes the costs of taxation in a way that is perceived to be unfair will generate resentment and undermine social capital. Perceptions of unfairness will erode public acceptance of the prevailing levels of taxation, as well as the spirit of voluntary compliance that underpins efficient tax collection. 14. The tax system is inconsistent in its treatment of capital income because it does not generally tax gains from the disposal of capital assets. This inconsistent treatment compromises commonly understood notions of fairness in two ways: • Horizontal equity. Individuals earning the same amount of income face different tax obligations, depending on whether they earn capital gains or other forms of income. • Vertical equity. Higher income individuals and households tend to derive a greater proportion of their income from increases in values of capital assets than lower income individuals and households. The Group has received estimates from Treasury that, in New Zealand, 82% of assets potentially affected by an extension of the taxation of capital income are held by the top 20% of households by wealth. The current approach can be regressive if it results in lower tax obligations on those with greater economic capacity to pay. 15. The lack of a general tax on realised capital gains is likely to be one of the biggest reasons for horizontal inequities in the tax system. People with the same amount of income are being taxed at different rates depending on the source of the income. 16. Untaxed realised gains are estimated to be approximately 20% of accounting profits for SMEs. 17. Evidence from overseas and data on wealth in New Zealand suggests that capital gains are concentrated amongst those with high incomes and wealth. Including more capital gains in the tax system is likely to be the most feasible way to make the tax system more progressive without increasing tax rates. 18. Reform could therefore reduce inconsistency in the treatment of individuals, increase the progressivity of the tax system and enhance or maintain social capital. Economic and efficiency impacts 19. The effects of an extension of the taxation of capital income from the perspective of economic efficiency are complex to assess due to a range of factors that can move in different directions. Regard will need to be had to the impacts any changes will have on encouraging and/or not inhibiting the flow of investments to underpin sustainable productivity growth. Specific impacts will ultimately depend on the detailed design and who actually bears the cost of the tax. 33 Future of Tax Interim Report 20. These impacts could include: • A reduction in domestic private saving and investment in the affected assets. The ultimate impact on investment in those assets would depend on the degree non-residents and the government made up any shortfalls. • Savings and investment decisions becoming more neutral, thereby encouraging investment to flow to areas of greatest productivity rather than tax advantage. This may involve unaffected investment such as bank deposits and non-property based businesses becoming more attractive to investors. • Assets held on to for longer than is economically efficient to avoid taxation based on realisation – known as lock in. The degree of this effect will depend on the scale and design of any rollover relief associated with the tax. • The ability to bring capital expenditure – such as black hole expenditure or building depreciation - into the tax base if the equivalent income became taxed. This would improve the neutrality of the tax system. 21. In some cases, taxing New Zealand owners of assets will have little or no impact on asset price. This is particularly when: • capital gains form a minimal part of the return; • foreign investors largely set the return from and price of particular assets, 11 such as many shares listed on the NZX. 22. In other cases, an extension of capital income taxation will be more likely to result in a fall in the price of the asset. For example, it may be difficult for farming and agriculture businesses to pass on additional taxes by charging more for their products if the products are sold on world markets and New Zealand is a price taker on these markets. 11 Practical concerns reflected in double tax agreements will preclude New Zealand from imposing taxation on realised gains of non-residents other than ones from land-based industries. This is discussed further in the chapter. 23. Experience here and overseas has demonstrated that savings can be especially sensitive to tax differences between different forms of saving and different savings vehicles. Over the past almost fifty years New Zealand has reduced the extent that savings are treated differently depending on the saving vehicle used – life insurance, direct share investments, investment funds etc. 24. The Group is therefore mindful of how any differences in the treatment of capital income might distort capital markets. For example, taxing individual share investments more harshly than the same investments through institutions could lower returns, undermine our equity markets and ultimately lead to New Zealand companies migrating offshore. We are considering these issues further. 25. An important concern of an extension of capital income taxation is the impact on the housing market. Many submitters have been concerned that tax-free gains on houses encourages New Zealanders to place a high proportion of savings in land and housing leaving lower New Zealand savings for other forms of investment. 26. The Group has discussed the impact on housing from a first principles basis, reviewed modelling work that attempts to disentangle various effects, and looked at what has happened when capital gains taxes have been introduced overseas. 27. The Group is of the view that the housing market impacts are unlikely to be large, but it may be expected that rents will rise over time, and house prices will be lower, relative to the status quo. However, the Group’s view is that tax has not played a large role in the current state of New Zealand’s housing market, and will be unlikely to play a large role in fixing it. The potential effects on housing affordability are commented on more fully in Chapter 8. 34 Future of Tax Interim Report 28. If the Government ultimately does seek to increase the taxation of the residential property sector in whatever form, rents should be monitored. The Group’s view is that the Government could consider using some of the revenue to mitigate the impact on renters (increased accommodation supplements for low income earners for example). Integrity, base protection, and the treatment of income 29. The current approach means that some types of income are tax-favoured over others. There are also opportunities for tax minimisation and avoidance. Some of the challenges include: • Incentives to classify on capital account. Current rules provide an incentive to argue that any gain of a person is on capital account and not taxable. For example, in business asset sales, some of the assets are on capital account (e.g. most land and goodwill), while others are on revenue account (e.g. trading stock). Since gains on capital account assets are not taxed, the vendor has an incentive to allocate more of the selling price to capital account assets. • Incentives for some forms of labour income to end up as tax-free capital gains. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some people spend considerable part of the time refurbishing rental houses that are then sold for a capital gain. In effect this is labour income that, when reflected in a higher sale price, becomes tax free. This will remain an issue for owner occupied houses, which are to be excluded from either a tax of realised capital gains or a risk-free return method tax. 30. A more consistent approach to the taxation of capital income could reduce opportunities for tax minimisation such as dividend avoidance or trust streaming - discussed in the Integrity chapter (chapter 15). It could also reduce or eliminate charging provisions that rely on the hard to establish intention or purpose of the taxpayer, and therefore enhance the integrity of both assessing and administering the law. This should in turn improve the perception of fairness of the tax system and improve social capital. 31. However, the extent to which it does so in practice will depend heavily on the details of policy design, including avoidance provisions. In general, design choices that reduce the distinction between capital gains and other forms of income should increase the integrity of the tax system. However, this could be at the cost of creating distortions elsewhere and so it is not always possible to arrive at this ideal position in the course of policy design. Legislative design, administration and compliance 32. The Group recognises that extending the taxation of capital income could result in the simplification of some aspects of the existing tax rules. For example, the following provisions might be able to be able to be repealed or reformed: • Land sales (and the bright-line rules). • Profit-making undertaking or schemes. • The grant, renewal or transfer of leasehold estates and licenses. • Sales of patent rights. • Some types of intellectual property. 33. However, in their place it will be necessary to have rules relating to the excluded family home, rules limiting deductions for expenses on second homes, and roll-over relief that might affect commercial, industrial and farmland sales. In the design of rules extending the taxation of capital income the Group is seeking to balance extra compliance and administrative costs and the benefits from such a widening of the tax base. 34. Overall, the Group acknowledges that the extension of capital income taxation will significantly increase compliance and administration costs. The Tax Review 2001 (known as the McLeod Review) noted that capital gains tax regimes tend to be one of the most complex areas of tax law in the jurisdictions that have capital gains taxes. Moreover, unlike most other complex areas of tax law, the capital gains rules must be interpreted and applied by ‘ordinary’ taxpayers. On the other hand, virtually every other country in the OECD has been able to successfully deal with extending their tax base in this way. 35 Future of Tax Interim Report 35. We have not yet undertaken a detailed estimate of the compliance costs of extending the income tax base. Such costs would be significant but dependent on the design details. 36. Similarly, we would expect the extension of the taxation of capital income to put additional demands on Inland Revenue in terms of tax assessment, advice, collection and enforcement. For any extension to be implemented successfully the government will need to resource Inland Revenue in all of those areas. Revenue effects – Comprehensive income taxation and the risk-free return method 37. There are two ways of taxing capital income that have similar economic effects. Those two ways are taxing the full economic income from an asset, including revenue flows but also accruing capital gains. The alternative is not to tax the revenue or any gain but to tax instead an imputed risk-free return. This alternative is the essence of the risk-free return method of taxation. However, we note that whereas taxing full economic income taxes economic rents, the risk-free return method does not. 38. Generally, risky assets will earn a premium to compensate for risk. Taxing a risk-free return instead of an actual risky return might collect less revenue on average, but the revenue it does collect will itself be less risky. 39. As an example, revenue from a risk-free return method will never be negative, either in aggregate or for any individual taxpayer. This is the case even when there are capital losses in a failing real estate or share market. If the government wanted the higher return associated with more risky assets, it is free to use the revenue from risk-free revenue to invest in such risky assets and obtain the higher return. 40. Conversely taxing realised capital gains is broadly symmetrical. For example, a sale price (that might produce a net taxable gain) for one taxpayer will be the cost of that asset for another taxpayer. Also in a falling real estate or share market, there could be capital losses which can have a significant impact on revenue collections. 41. As a consequence of the above, a simple comparison of the revenues from extending the taxation of capital income by using the risk- free return method or by including more capital gains in the income tax base can be misleading. While it will always be expected that including more capital gains will raise more revenue in a mathematical sense, taxing a risk-free return will provide revenue that is more certain for Government, and therefore just as valuable as revenue from risky returns, even if the amount appears on its face to be smaller. 42. Although the risk-free return tax appears to generate less revenue on average than taxing realised gains, the cost of the two streams to taxpayers, and the benefit to Government, will therefore be similar in risk-adjusted terms. Whether capital gains or losses will be realised over a future period is dependent on many factors: a shortage of land supply and low interest rates have produced increasing land values over recent years; economic shocks have also led to significant losses in share values in the past. Options for extending the taxation of capital income 43. Having regard to the policy considerations referred to above, the Group has considered the merits of two options for extending the taxation of capital income. As mentioned, these are extending the taxation of realised capital gains from specific assets not already taxed and taxing certain capital assets on a deemed return basis, referred to a risk-free return method. We first consider the design principles that might apply to extending the taxation of realised capital gains and then consider the risk-free return method. 44. The Group is aware that any recommendations it ultimately makes in respect of extending the taxation of capital income could have significant impacts for assets held by Māori in collective ownership - such as Māori freehold land and assets held by post settlement governance entities. This chapter does not discuss these impacts in detail. However, the Group intends to use the period between the interim and final reports to better understand this asset base and explore potential implications with Māori stakeholders. 36 Future of Tax Interim Report Extending the tax net – realised gains 45. The main choice with regard to taxing capital gains is how far to extend the existing tax net. There is a spectrum of options under two broad approaches: Targeted A pragmatic approach of identifying and targeting areas where the current treatment causes the most significant fairness, integrity or efficiency issues. Broad-based A more systematic approach that aims to expand the capital/ revenue boundary as far as practicable. 12 Owner occupied houses are excluded, as are some assets owned by non-residents as a result of practical concerns and our double tax agreements with other countries. 46. Under a targeted approach, gains on some assets would be brought into the tax net on the basis that they are relatively easy to tax, and that including these assets will go a substantial way towards addressing the challenges we currently face. Whilst some countries have had comprehensive capital gains tax regimes in place for over fifty years, to date New Zealand has adopted a targeted approach, taxing capital gains on only certain assets (some land sales, gains from financial arrangements, for example). 47. A targeted approach does have its downsides. The most significant problem is that the inconsistent treatment of those assets remaining untaxed will reduce horizontal equity compared with a broad approach, and distort investment choices. There will also be continuing integrity challenges as taxpayers seek to categorise gains as tax free capital gains. (Examples of these under our current rules are allocating more of a business’s sale proceeds to intellectual property and/or goodwill and less to trading stock and other revenue account assets.) 48. A broad-based approach, on the other hand, seeks to expand the capital/revenue boundary as far as practicable, including a wide scope of gains. A broad-based approach greatly improves the integrity and horizontal equity of the tax system, but also greatly increases the complexity of compliance and administration. 49. It is difficult to make this choice in the abstract. This is because the extent to which the costs and benefits of taxing capital gains are realised will depend not only on what is already taxed in New Zealand but also the detailed design choices adopted to tax the untaxed assets. It is therefore critical to develop concrete, worked-up proposals that can then can be assessed against each other. 50. The Group has adopted a targeted approach in developing design features to extend the taxation of capital gains in the sense that we have identified asset classes that are not presently fully taxed. However, when the extent of these changes is considered, together with the existing regimes taxing capital gains, the outcome will be a broad-based taxing of nearly all capital gains. 12 51. The main design choices relate to what to tax, when to tax, and how to tax. A host of more detailed design issues then flow from these choices, and particularly from a decision to introduce a realisation-based tax and not a tax based on accrued gains. These concepts are explained below. 52. This section summarises the Group’s initial thinking on the key design features of the proposed taxation of realised capital gains (again, further detail is in Appendix B). The Group will assess the impacts of these features over the coming months as it works towards its recommendations in the Final Report. 37 Future of Tax Interim Report What to tax 53. Broadly, taxation would extend to include income from realisation of any of the following assets (generally those that give rise to gains that are not already subject to tax under existing taxing provisions): • interests in land (other than the family home). This includes all other residential property, commercial, agricultural, industrial and leasehold interests not currently taxed; • intangible property, including goodwill. The Group is still considering how widely this should be defined; • all other assets held by a business or for income producing purposes that are not already taxed on sale (such as plant and equipment); • shares in companies and other equity interests. 54. Taxpayers would be entitled to deduct their acquisition and improvement costs (to the extent that those costs have not already been depreciated) from the sale proceeds received on disposal, so only the net gain (or loss) would be taxable. 55. Taxation would not extend to gains realised from the disposal of certain assets, such as: • the family home and the land under it (referred to as an excluded home); • certain personal assets including cars, boats and other household durables, because these generally decline in value and represent private consumption; higher value personal assets such as jewellery, fine art and other collectibles (rare coins, vintage cars etc.) on the basis that whilst if they are investments they might appreciate in value, losses might equally represent private consumption. 56. Taxation would extend to some non-residents holding New Zealand land (or shares in land- rich companies) or business assets through a New Zealand branch. Taxation would not otherwise extend to non-residents. This is because it is not practical to, for example, tax a non-resident selling shares in a New Zealand company to another non-resident. This issue arises because New Zealand’s double tax agreements with other countries limit New Zealand’s ability to tax gains from the sale of other assets owned by non-residents who do not have a place of business in New Zealand. 57. Taxation would extend to assets realised after a specified ‘effective date.’ Assets already owned on the ‘effective date’ would need to be valued. Any appreciation in value accruing before the effective date would not be taxed while increases in value arising after the effective date would be taxable. When to tax 58. The main options for taxing capital gains are to tax gains as they accrue (as their value appreciates, even if they aren’t sold), or when they are realised. Accrual-based tax 59. An accrual-based tax taxes the gain in an asset’s value over a defined period (usually a year), with the tax payable at the end of each period. The tax liability will arise even if the asset is not disposed of during that period. Declines in asset value during that period are equally treated as a deductible loss, and offset against other income or carried forward. 60. There are some disadvantages associated with an accrual-based tax: • Valuation challenges. An accrual-based tax requires a valuation at the end of each period to identify the gain or loss. Valuations are readily available for widely-traded assets, but it is difficult to impartially value some types of assets (such as closely-held businesses). These valuation challenges will impose much higher compliance costs on the owners of certain types of assets. There are also timing risks associated with valuation. If valuation occurs on a specific date at the end of the taxable period, the owners of seldom-traded shares may be able to manipulate the value of their shares in order to reduce their tax liabilities. 38 Future of Tax Interim Report • Cash flow pressures. An accrual-based tax can create cash flow pressures for the owners of assets that do not produce regular streams of cash income. Some owners may even have to dispose of their assets to meet the tax liabilities. The risk of forced disposal could discourage investment in assets with upfront expenses but longer-term returns. • Perceptions of unfairness. An accrual- based tax taxes unrealised gains, which do not necessarily correspond with every person’s understanding of income. 61. The practical challenges to the implementation of an accrual-based tax are substantial. Consequently, there has been little use of accrual- based taxes in practise by other countries and we do not support adopting one. The risk-free return method of taxing capital gains can be viewed as an accrual-based tax and the Group has considered it in respect only of certain asset classes (considered further below). Realisation-based tax 62. Under this approach, the gain on assets is taxed only when the assets are sold. Conversely, any losses on the sale of the asset may be offset against other income or carried forward. 63. The primary concern with a realisation-based tax from an efficiency perspective is the issue of ‘lock-in’. ‘Lock-in’ occurs when asset owners retain assets instead of selling them, in order to postpone or avoid realising gains and crystallising the tax liability. To remedy this concern and for important fairness concerns, jurisdictions overseas often provide ‘rollover relief’ to ensure that tax is deferred on what would otherwise be a realisation event. 64. As an example, if rollover relief is given for a ‘similar asset’ swap, a business that sells its existing premises and purchases a new premises does not pay tax on any gain in the value of its existing premises. Instead, the new premises takes the cost base of the initial premises so that if the new premises are later sold, the whole gain, including the gain from the initial premises, is taxed. The gain is said to have “rolled over” from the initial sale. 65. Rollover relief removes the disincentive to sell that can be created by a realisation-based tax. While that may have the attractive feature of reducing lock-in in some cases, there are balancing concerns with extensive rollover relief that suggest caution. 66. Roll-over will reduce the revenue raised and can increase lock-in when assets have been held for a long time. This is because the cost base will be far lower, and the potential tax liability far higher, than if tax had been paid every time there was a sale. 67. Moreover, because some rollover reliefs are optional, taxpayers are likely to use them when assets have appreciated, but not when assets have depreciated. This asymmetry creates its own revenue integrity and efficiency concerns. Therefore, the more extensive the rollover relief, the greater the case for only allowing capital losses to be deductible against capital gains (known as ‘loss ring-fencing’). 68. As a general rule it is proposed that capital losses would be able to be utilised against ordinary income. However, for base integrity reasons, in some cases capital losses would be ring fenced (only able to be carried forward against future capital gains from similar asset classes). 69. Loss ring-fencing, however, reduces the risk- sharing and risk neutrality benefits of the tax by taxing gains but restricting deductions for losses. Currently, when assets held on revenue account are sold, if there is a gain the government collects a portion of that gain as tax. If there is a loss, it can be offset against other income meaning that the government gives back a portion of that loss as a tax reduction on other income. This means that the Government shares in the risk of the investment. 70. Taxing capital gains and allowing a deduction for losses would extend this to assets held on capital account. Ring-fencing, however, will remove some of these benefits of risk sharing with the government. It will also increase compliance and administration costs, as losses must be ring-fenced to the extent they are ‘capital’ losses instead of ‘revenue’ losses. 39 Future of Tax Interim Report 71. This suggests a direct trade-off between the amount of rollover relief provided, and the distortions and compliance costs introduced from loss ring-fencing. In Appendix B, the Group has commented on the impact of the range of roll-over relief circumstances from a reasonably restrictive approach to a broad approach, and the follow-on consequences from each approach. How to tax 72. As this approach does not impose a new type of tax but significantly expands the capital/revenue boundary, taxation would generally be calculated and collected in the same way as currently applies for disposals of revenue account property — i.e. taxation would apply at ordinary income tax rates to nominal gains and losses. Costs would generally be deducted at the time of sale so as to arrive at the net capital gain. 73. The Group is also considering some practical modifications, such as withholding taxes, which could improve collections but might not necessarily reduce compliance costs. The workability of withholding taxes is yet to be tested but we recognise that extending the taxation of capital gains will materially increase compliance costs even though we are trying to minimise this in our design of the rules. We have no doubt that altering the existing rules in the manner canvassed in Appendix B will increase the complexity of tax compliance for all taxpayers affected by it. Interaction with other regimes 74. Appendix B outlines how the Group envisages the extension of tax would interact with the existing tax rules for companies (including controlled foreign companies (CFCs) and corporate groups), partnerships and look- through companies, trusts, Māori entities and with social assistance programmes. 75. Consequential changes to KiwiSaver and other portfolio investment entities (PIEs), and foreign investment fund (FIF) regimes will also need to be considered. In addition changes to the taxation of farming livestock adopted by farmers will need to be considered. 76. All of these issues are complex and will require industry and stakeholder consultation. Risk-free rate of return (RFRM) method 77. As mentioned, another approach for taxing capital gains is the risk-free return method taxation of some asset classes. The risk-free return method is an ex ante method of taxing economic income. Under the risk-free return method, the total income generated by an asset is calculated by applying a risk-free rate to the equity held by the owner in the asset (being the value of the asset net of any borrowings used to buy the asset); the result is then taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal rate. As is discussed in the McLeod Review, the aim is to levy a tax which has a similar cost to taxpayers and benefit to the government to taxing full economic income. If the risk-free return rate is set accurately, the tax should not result in taxpayers either overinvesting or underinvesting in the type of asset. 78. The McLeod Review suggested using a real risk-free rate. A real risk free rate would be calculated by taking the rate applying to a “risk free” government bond rate and reducing that rate for the return on the bond that represented compensation for inflation. (For example, suppose the yield on a 2-year government bond is 1.8% and deducted from that would be the rate of inflation. If inflation is 1%, the real risk free rate is 0.8%.) The Group’s view is that, in the current low-inflationary environment, and as inflationary gains are taxed on other forms of income it might be more appropriate to use a risk-free nominal rate for estimating a comparable return. In the above example the nominal rate is 1.8%. 79. The risk-free return method would replace the existing taxation of income for the assets subject to the risk-free return method. In other words, the income that is actually earned from the asset, and the expenses associated with earning that income, will both be ignored for tax purposes. Thus, in relation to residential property investments, for example, rental revenue would not be taxable income – but interest, repairs, and maintenance would not be tax deductible either. The risk-free return rate would be multiplied against a market value of the net equity in the 40 Future of Tax Interim Report property each income year and that amount would be included in the taxpayer’s taxable income for that year (and would be taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal rate). 80. The risk-free return method can potentially be applied to any asset for which a verifiable and independent estimate of the net equity held in the asset is available each year. The main advantages of the risk-free return method are that: • the tax is not due on realisation, so there is no ‘lock-in’; • the tax is not as sensitive to the need for an accurate valuation as it is for an accrued capital gains tax; • it is a simple tax to apply (i.e. it meets the simplicity objective of an effective tax system); and • it provides more certain cash flows for Government. 81. The difficulties to be considered under a risk-free return method regime include the following: • establishing market values for the asset class in off-market situations and to a lesser extent establishing riskless rates; • integrating the risk-free return method with a tax system that gives interest deductions generally, as is the case under our present tax system; • integrating the risk-free return method with dividend imputation; • integrating the risk-free return method with foreign tax credits; • imposing the risk-free return method on unrealised gains with consequential cash flow difficulties. 82. The risk-free return method applies most cleanly to simple portfolio investments. Since the idea of a risk-free return method tax was first proposed by the McLeod Review 2001, there has been considerable progress in addressing inconsistent tax treatments originally highlighted by that review. Interests in listed foreign entities are now taxed by the FDR method and domestic saving vehicles are taxed by the PIE regime. These changes have reduced the previous disparities in how domestic shares were taxed to individuals and funds. The FDR rate of 5% was set taking into account the nominal risk free rate at that time but also a dividend rate reasonably obtainable on foreign shares at that time. The PIE regime is a transparent regime subject to a single and final tax rate. 83. That leaves real property. Real property can be considered in two broad categories: residential property (other than the family home) and other ‘active’ business premises, such as commercial, industrial, or farm property. 84. With commercial and industrial property, some commentators consider that risk-free return method tax will face the problems that arise from the bundling of the owner’s labour income and the existence of economic rents. Other commentators consider that these are both factored into the market value of the asset and are accordingly captured into the tax net (RFRM is applied to market values each year). 85. In any event one significant difficulty with all land types is measuring net equity (identifying debt that relates to the property as distinct from the business in which they might be employed). Another difficulty (also significant) is determining market values each year. It is likely preferable to tax commercial, industrial and farm land (and connected business activity) on their income instead, in which case it would be unnecessarily complex to apply an RFRM tax on those classes of land. If gains on commercial, industrial, and farm property are seen as a gap in the tax system, a more neutral way of taxing these gains is likely to be through a tax on realised capital gains. 86. The Group will consider the potential for a risk- free return method tax on residential property other than a principal residence, such as second homes and baches. However, similar disadvantages to those described above would also apply (annual market values and measuring net equity, albeit to a lesser extent). Further, residential property not producing any income (second homes, baches) would not generate cash flow to meet the annual tax liability. 41 Future of Tax Interim Report 87. A key issue with taxing on a risk-free basis relates to its public acceptability. A risk-free return method taxes a risk-free return, rather than the actual income generated by an asset. This may not correspond closely with public perceptions of what constitutes income. As mentioned, the tax will also create cash flow pressure for the owners of assets that do not generate regular streams of cash income. Some owners may have to dispose of assets to meet their tax liabilities. Revenue Revenue from taxing gains on realisation 88. The Government currently relies on a relatively narrow base of tax types. Revenue is predominantly collected from the following three tax types: personal income tax, corporate income tax and GST. 89. Looking out to the future there are potential threats to these taxes due to macro trends such as the rise of the contractor, robotic and AI technologies, globalisation and the digital economy. It is difficult to predict what these trends could mean for future tax revenues if the status quo is maintained. An extension of capital income taxation will broaden the base of the tax system and help safeguard the Government’s future revenue collection ability. The additional revenue could be used to increase the Government’s flexibility for dealing with future challenges, or pay for other revenue-reducing reforms. 13 In this context, and in the tables, “land” refers to land and improvements, such as buildings. 14 Further details of the assumptions and risks for these projections are set out in Appendix A. 90. The revenue impact of capital gains taxation will depend on the design of the tax, as well as behavioural responses and movements in asset prices. The Group asked officials to model revenue from a tax that applies to gains on all types of land (excluding the family home) and domestic shares on realisation. 13 Assuming annual appreciation of 3% across all types of assets, the tax is modelled to raise almost $6 billion. 14 91. The revenue from taxing capital gains on realisation will be volatile, complicating fiscal management. Tax revenue will increase as asset prices rise, and reduce as asset prices fall. 92. Ignoring volatility, the following table estimates the revenue from taxing capital gains on realisation. Again, it is stressed that these results are heavily design and detail dependent. The more exemptions are introduced (including roll over relief) the lower the likely revenue. In addition, if some expenses become deductible that have not previously been deductible (seismic strengthening costs, weathertightness remedial costs, building depreciation) then revenue may be materially reduced in the short term. None of the above are factored into these estimates (see Table 6.2).

There is also the question of what to do with the treatment of foreign (non-New Zealand and non- Australian) shares. Currently, these are taxed on a deemed return of 5% of the opening value of the shares, regardless of the actual return in dividends and realised capital gains 15 . It is similar to the risk-free return method in taxing on a deemed return basis, but the rate used is high compared to the risk-free rate that is considered to be efficient and neutral as a deemed rate for tax purposes. It is also calculated on the gross asset value and interest is allowable as a deduction. 94. Table 6.3 estimates the additional revenue from replacing FDR with a system of taxing capital gains. For the purposes of the costing, foreign shares are assumed to appreciate at 5% per year and have a 2.4% annual dividend yield (the 20-year average for the Morgan-Stanley Capital Index). The costings are dependent on assumptions of future equity yields and estimated average holding period of shares. This revenue is in addition to the revenue above. 95. Again, it should be noted that the mere fact that revenue is expected to be larger under a tax on dividends plus capital gains does not necessarily mean that the revenue should be seen as more valuable by the government. The additional revenue stream would also be more risky. 16 15 The full regime has further complications, including a de minimis and some special rules for individuals, but those are not relevant for current purposes. 16 While there are methods of discounting risky cashflows to be able to compare directly with risk-less cashflows, selecting the appropriate risky rate to use is difficult when contemplating taxpayers (including individuals, public, and private companies) as a whole. 17 In this section, land refers solely to surface land and does not refer to buildings and improvements. 18 A land tax that excludes owner-occupied homes will be less efficient than a broad-based land tax. Land taxes 17 96. A land tax is a form of wealth tax that imposes an annual tax liability on the unimproved value of land. It represents a uniform increase in taxation on landowners based on the unimproved value of their land, rather than an increase based on expected capital gains. A land tax is a new tax base. It is not a substitute for an income tax, but could apply in addition to the income tax if it had merit. Is there a case to introduce a land tax? 97. Broad-based land taxes are generally considered to be an efficient means to raise revenue: the supply of land is fixed and therefore unaffected by economic incentives such as taxation. 18 Land taxes are simple to administer and difficult to avoid. 98. A land tax will provide the Government with a less volatile revenue stream than, say, a capital gains tax on real property. Tax will still be collected in years when asset values fall and actual economic income is negative. From a long-term revenue perspective, land is also a desirable base because it is immobile. 99. Yet there are some major disadvantages associated with land taxes: • Land taxes can be criticised on horizontal equity grounds because they apply to only one type of asset. A land tax will have a disproportionate impact on certain groups and industries that hold a greater share of their wealth in land.

Some of these owners will be wealthy, but others will not be; a land tax does not distinguish between levels of wealth. A land tax could potentially mean that property owners that are heavily geared end up with negative equity in their property. • A land tax will create cash flow pressures for the owners of assets that do not generate regular streams of cash income. Some owners may even have to dispose of assets to meet their tax liabilities. 100. Moreover, a general tax on land has been ruled out by the terms of reference. If land associated with a principal residence is exempt, the tax would not have the economic efficiency benefits of a general tax on land. 101. The Group also acknowledges the strong opposition expressed by Māori stakeholders towards land taxes. Māori submitters argued that Māori would be disproportionately affected by a land tax, and raised concerns about the potential for a land tax to destroy Māori wealth and alienate Māori from their land. 102. A land tax will have complex impacts on the housing market. For a land tax that excludes owner-occupied housing, land prices will fall, but by less than would be the case for a perfectly broad land tax. Some of the tax will also be paid through higher rents for non- owner occupied uses of land. Overall assessment 103. The Group acknowledges that a land tax is a conceptually efficient tax. Nevertheless, the Group is concerned about the social acceptability of a land tax in a New Zealand context – particularly since any land tax will apply in addition to local government rates which are substantially a tax on land. The Group has decided not to recommend a land tax. Wealth taxes 104. Wealth taxes are not strictly taxes on capital income, but they are another means of approaching the issue of capital taxation. Wealth taxes are levied on the value of a taxpayer’s assets, and assessed periodically (usually on an annual basis). 105. New Zealand historically had wealth taxes – in the form of a land tax, an estate duty, and gift duties. All of these taxes have since been repealed. There has also been an international trend toward the declining use of net wealth taxes. 106. Many submitters have argued for the introduction of a wealth tax in order to reduce wealth inequality in New Zealand. A wealth tax would reduce the assets of wealthier households, and provide revenue for redistribution to poorer households. There are, however, a number of disadvantages associated with wealth taxes: • In order to operate efficiently a wealth tax should apply to all forms of wealth, and should be based on accurate valuations. In practice, wealth taxes tend to have significant exemptions and simplified valuation rules, which can create major distortions to saving and investment decisions (OECD 2018). • Wealth taxes tend to suffer from high levels of evasion and avoidance. Taxpayers are likely to bias their savings towards untaxed assets, and may even emigrate in order to avoid the tax. As a result, wealth taxes often do not produced the intended redistributive effects (OECD 2018). • Wealth taxes are difficult to apply. Certain types of assets are hard to value and may even lack a market price. They therefore suffer from many of the same drawbacks as taxing capital gains on accrual. Wealth taxes tend to be costly to administer relative to the amount of revenue they raise (OECD 2018). 44 Future of Tax Interim Report 107. Wealth taxes are usually applied in addition to an income tax on capital income, in which case they do not reduce any existing distortions caused by the income tax, but rather generate an additional set of distortions. 108. The Group acknowledges that there are real issues in the tax system relating to the taxation of capital income (and, in particular, the taxation of capital gains). A wealth tax, however, is a complex form of taxation that is likely to reduce the integrity of the tax system. Next steps 6.1 The Group is still forming its views on the best approach towards extending the taxation of capital income. Only once such an extension is designed can a meaningful comparison take place between the options and the status quo. Appendix B sets out the Group’s initial thinking on further design features of broad- based taxation of capital income. The Group will work toward its ultimate recommendations in the Final Report. 45 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Individuals save for a variety of reasons. They might be saving up for a big purchase, or setting aside money to deal with emergencies; they might want to build a nest egg for their retirement, or they may be saving for their children. In each case, these individuals are sacrificing a certain amount of comfort in the present to secure higher living standards in the future – whether that be for them or their descendants. 2. The effects of saving are not limited to individuals. The saving and investment choices of firms, individuals, and the Government – aggregated across the economy – shape the accumulation of financial and physical capital in New Zealand. Rates of private saving therefore have broader impacts on the performance of the New Zealand economy. 3. While there are many reasons for individuals to save, one of the primary motivations is the need to ensure an adequate standard of living in retirement. Previous chapters have dealt with the taxation of capital and wealth more broadly; this chapter focuses on the tax treatment of retirement savings in particular. Box 7.1: A note on saving and investment Saving is the difference between income and consumption. Individuals, households, and firms save (private saving), and governments save also (public saving); the sum of private and public saving is national saving. Saving results in an accumulation of wealth, which may be invested. Investment is the purchase or creation of a capital asset that is used to generate a return. New Zealanders can invest in assets in New Zealand and overseas, and the total return on investments owned by New Zealanders is part of national income. Non-residents also make investments in New Zealand. Non-resident investment in New Zealand is significant, and makes up for the shortfall in national saving. Still, a higher level of national saving would probably result in additional investment in New Zealand, because local investors are more likely to be aware of local investment needs or opportunities than non- residents, and because local investors may better understand the risks of investing in New Zealand. Income from non-resident investment flows to the non-resident investors. However, non-resident investment is still valuable to New Zealanders because it provides opportunities for local employment, which increases national income and enhances human and social capital. 7 Retirement savings 46 Future of Tax Interim Report Goals and interests Retirement income policy objectives 4. The overall objective of retirement income policy is to minimise economic insecurity in old age. New Zealand achieves this objective through three main tools: • New Zealand Superannuation alleviates the risk of old age poverty by providing a universal benefit to all New Zealand citizens and residents 65 and over (subject to some residency restrictions). • The KiwiSaver scheme supports private saving to maintain a standard of living in retirement over and above the level guaranteed by New Zealand Superannuation. • Private decision-making on retirement saving is supported by measures to improve the financial literacy of New Zealanders. 5. There is some evidence to suggest that most New Zealanders are saving enough to provide an ‘adequate’ income in retirement. However, this judgement is conditional on the assumption that future generations remain eligible for New Zealand Superannuation under existing policy settings. This condition may not hold if long-term fiscal pressures require change to the scheme. Falling rates of homeownership will also affect the adequacy of savings for retirement. Broader policy objectives 6. Retirement savings can also be conceived as a tool to pursue a broader set of policy goals: • Macroeconomic stability. Higher national saving will reduce New Zealand’s external indebtedness and current account deficits, and bolster New Zealand’s resilience to economic shocks. • Investment, productivity and growth. Higher saving rates could, in principle, reduce the cost of capital and increase incentives to invest. Higher national saving could also support export growth by reducing pressure on interest rates and exchange rates. Savings policy may also affect the allocation of investment, for example by reducing distortions in the treatment of different asset classes. • Capital markets development. A greater pool of domestic savings could deepen domestic capital markets and enhance the ability of local firms to secure capital to grow. 7. One of the challenges for policymakers is to balance these multiple objectives against the core goal of ensuring retirement income adequacy. Current tax treatment 8. There are three main features of New Zealand’s taxation of retirement savings: The TTE system for taxing capital income 9. New Zealand generally taxes capital income, including retirement savings, on a ‘Taxed – Taxed – Exempt’ (or ‘TTE’) basis. Investments are made from taxed income; the income earned from the investment is taxed; but amounts withdrawn from the investment are not taxed. Since capital gains are not generally taxed, investments earning significant capital gains are taxed on a ‘Taxed – Partially Taxed – Exempt’ (or ‘TtE’) basis. 10. This approach is to taxing retirement savings is highly unusual among OECD countries. Most OECD countries tax some retirement savings on an ‘Exempt – Exempt – Taxed’ (or EET)’ basis (Yoo and de Serres 2005). Other capital income is usually taxed on a ‘TTE’ basis. Owner-occupied housing 11. Imputed income from owner-occupied housing is not taxed. Retirement savings in the form of owner-occupied housing are therefore taxed on a ‘Taxed – Exempt – Exempt’ (or ‘TEE’) basis. The Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime 12. The PIE regime began in 2007 and aims to remove tax barriers to investing in managed funds, such as KiwiSaver funds. Gains on shares held by PIEs are not taxable. This treatment is a response to the fact that gains on shares held by individuals are, in practice, rarely taxable – whereas gains on shares held by managed funds were almost always taxable as business profits. 47 Future of Tax Interim Report 13. Taxing PIEs on share gains would have continued a bias against the use of managed funds for equity investment, so managed funds operating as PIEs are exempt from taxation on the sale of New Zealand and Australian shares. Gains on the sale of other foreign shares are also generally not taxed, and instead are taxed on a deemed return basis (the Fair Dividend Rate, or FDR method). Other capital gains (such as on land) are subject to the general provisions of the Income Tax Act. In addition, traditional managed funds and unit trusts (taxed as multi rate PIEs) are required to attribute all income to investors (often on a daily basis) and then apply each investor’s tax rates to that income. Removing the tax on share gains made this simpler. 14. The PIE regime has more generous rates than the income tax regime. The maximum PIE rate is 28%, and there are generous rules for investors on lower rates as well. The rules allow investors to choose a rate that is equivalent to their personal marginal tax rate based on their taxable income alone (i.e. excluding amounts earned in PIEs). A separate threshold, based on taxable plus PIE income, limits the extent to which individuals can benefit from the lower PIE rates. 15. The full schedule of PIE rates is outlined in Table 7.1 below. 16. For most investors, it is the lower rate schedule – rather than the treatment of shares – that is the main benefit of PIE taxation. The KiwiSaver scheme 17. KiwiSaver is a voluntary saving scheme that aims to encourage retirement saving by individuals. KiwiSaver funds are locked into the scheme until the individual reaches the age of 65, although early withdrawals may be made for first home purchases and cases of hardship. Individuals are automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver when they start a new job, and must choose actively to opt out of the scheme. 18. KiwiSaver accounts are taxed under the PIE regime. KiwiSaver also provides other Government incentives, although the generosity of the incentives has reduced over time. KiwiSaver members benefit from an annual member tax credit of up to $521.43, paid at a rate of 50 cents for every dollar of member contribution. Employers are required to make a matching contribution of 3% of the individual’s salary. The treatment of inflation 19. Ideally, the marginal effective tax rates on different investments should be as equal as possible, so that the tax system does not bias taxpayers towards otherwise unproductive investments. In this regard, inflation is a source of distortion, because tax is calculated on nominal income, and inflation has different effects on various asset classes. Table 7.1: Schedule of PIE rates Marginal tax rate Individual tax rates – for the current yearPIE Tax Rates – For either of the two prior years: Taxable IncomeTaxable IncomeTaxable + PIE Income 10.5%<=$14,000<=$14,000 AND<=$48,000 17.5%$14,001 - $48,000<=$48,000 AND<=$70,000 28%NA>$48,000 OR>$70,000 30%$48,001 - $70,000NANA 33%>$70,000NANA 48 Future of Tax Interim Report 20. In particular, inflation raises the real effective tax rate on debt investments. Higher effective tax rates reduce the rate of accumulation of savings. As an example, for a statutory tax rate of 33%, if the real interest rate is 3%, and inflation is 2%, then the real effective tax rate is 55%. Effective tax rates, using the PIE rates, are shown in Table 7.2 below. 21. Although inflation is currently low, nominal interest rates are also low; this has made inflation a larger component of the nominal interest rate and therefore increased the real effective tax rate on debt. 22. These concerns about inflation and investment biases are, in principle, a reason for considering the comprehensive indexation of the tax base (rather than just in the context of retirement saving). 23. Taxing interest income on a nominal basis can have a significant impact on the accumulation of retirement savings. However, for many savers, this impact is offset by the other benefits of investing in KiwiSaver. 24. Take the example of a KiwiSaver investor earning $48,000 per annum. The investor saves at an annual contribution rate of 3% (plus the 3% employer contribution). The investor’s KiwiSaver account consists only of debt investments; the account earns a nominal return of 5% and a real return of 3%. If real interest income were taxed instead of nominal interest income, the 19 This assumes that a KiwiSaver member contributes 3% of their salary, and the employer pays a 3% match, and the KiwiSaver account earns a 5% annual return. 20 Ibid. investor would accumulate 6% more savings after 30 years. However, the member tax credit already provides the investor with the benefit of having 19% more in accumulated savings after 30 years. 25. The member tax credit will offset the impact of taxing nominal interest income for KiwiSaver members earning up to approximately $100,000 per annum 19 . Beyond annual income of $100,000, the member tax credit will only partially offset the impact of taxing nominal interest income. International comparisons 26. OECD countries tend to offer generous incentives for retirement saving. Most OECD countries also apply an ‘Exempt – Exempt – Taxed’ (or ‘EET’) approach (Yoo and de Serres 2005). This means that retirement savings contributions are made out of income that is not taxed, and the investment income is not taxed as it is earned. Instead, the capital and accumulated earnings are taxed at the point of withdrawal. 27. New Zealand, in contrast, offers limited concessions for retirement saving. In fact, among OECD countries, New Zealand has the lowest tax subsidy for retirement savings relative to its general system for taxing investment income (Yoo and de Serres 2005). However, for members earning up to approximately $48,000 per year, the annual member tax credit provides more benefit than EET would, although higher income savers would benefit more from EET. 20 Table 7.2: The future value of $1,000 invested today after 30 years No tax Tax real incomeTax nominal income 17.5%28%17.5%28% Future value of $1000 in 30 years$4,322$3,719$3,396$3,362$2,889 Effective tax rate on nominal incomeN/A10.5%16.8%17.5%28% Effective tax rate on real income (after taking account of inflation) N/A17.5%28%29.2%46.7% Note: This table assumes a nominal interest rate of 5% p.a. and inflation of 2% p.a. 49 Future of Tax Interim Report Policy considerations 28. In light of this context, the Group has considered whether there is a case to introduce additional concessions for retirement saving. There are two important considerations in making this judgement: National saving impacts 29. When considering measures to increase retirement saving, it is important to distinguish between national saving, public saving, and private saving. Private saving benefits individuals, but there can be offsets between public and private saving. The macroeconomic benefits of saving will only be realised if there is an overall increase in national saving. 30. This means policymakers need to think carefully about the impacts of tax reform on both public and private saving. International evidence suggests that tax incentives may not generate additional saving if individuals simply reallocate their existing savings into the tax-favoured vehicle (Gravelle, 1994; OECD, 2007). 31. At the same time, tax concessions can have significant fiscal costs – which, all else equal, will reduce public saving. The offset between public and private saving means that a poorly-designed regime, which only slightly increases private saving and significantly reduces public saving, might actually have a net negative impact on national saving. 32. A key question in assessing tax concessions is therefore the extent to which the increase in private saving arising from the concession will outweigh any consequent reduction in public saving. Distributional impacts 33. There is a strong life-cycle pattern to retirement saving. Individuals save during their working lives and spend down their savings in retirement; saving rates also generally increase later in an individual’s working life. 21 The Group notes, however, that women also tend to receive New Zealand Superannuation for a longer period than men because of average life expectancy for women is higher. 34. Higher-income households save more than lower- income households, even when considering only households where the highest income earner is between 30 and 60 years old (Figure 7.1). Saving patterns also differ by gender. Women’s adult lives often involve periods outside the paid workforce or in part time employment, which can result in lower government contributions to KiwiSaver and lower KiwiSaver balances than would otherwise be the case. 21 35. Low-income earners may have access to greater household savings if they are part of high- income households. Low-income households, on the other hand, tend to have very low or negative levels of savings. 36. Given the skewed distribution of saving, untargeted tax concessions for retirement saving tend to be regressive. Implications for policy design 37. The major risks with saving concessions are that they can be expensive and regressive. The most common approach to managing these fiscal and distributional impacts is to impose tight restrictions on the amount of contributions into tax-favoured accounts. The trade-off this presents is that tight limits may reduce the amount of additional private saving generated by the concessions. 38. KiwiSaver has a greater proportionate benefit for lower-income savers. The main benefit is the member tax credit; all members saving more than $1,042 per year will receive the credit, but it has a proportionately greater impact on lower- income savers. 50 Future of Tax Interim Report Figure 7.1: Savings rate quartiles by income decile (for households with the highest income earner aged between 30 and 60 years old), 2012/13 22 -50% -40% -30% -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% Less than $31,000 $31,000 to $41,000 $41,000 to $52,000 $52,000 to $60,000 $60,000 to $70,000 $70,000 to $81,000 $81,000 to $93,000 $93,000 to $112,000 $112,000 to $139,000 More than $139,000 Saving rate (percent) Decile of disposable household income (unequivalised) MedianUpper QuartileLower Quartile Source: The Treasury 22 The distributions presented in Figure 7.1 only include households from the Household Economic Survey (HES) sample where the highest income earner in the household is between 30 and 60 years old, and where their data has not been excluded on the grounds of a number of outlier checks. Given these restrictions to a sub-sample of HES, results depicted will not be comparable to a similar analysis based on the entire HES sample. Options 39. The Group has considered a range of options for encouraging greater saving through the KiwiSaver scheme: • Member tax credit – an increase in the member tax credit from $0.50 per dollar to $1.00 per dollar. • Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) – the removal of ESCT from all employer matching contributions, or the removal of ESCT from contributions for employees earning up to $48,000 per annum. • KiwiSaver PIE rates – reductions of five percentage points for each of the lower PIE rates (leaving the top PIE rate unchanged). • Changes to the structure of KiwiSaver taxation – through the introduction of ‘TEE’ or ‘EET’ taxation for savings in KiwiSaver schemes. 40. The options have quite different impacts in terms of private savings and fiscal cost (see Table 7.3). 41. As is evident from the table, some of the options are both expensive and regressive, whereas other options are cheaper and have a greater impact on saving by low- and middle-income earners. Furthermore, saving by these groups of people is more likely to be ‘new’ saving than a reallocation of existing saving. Assessment 42. The Group believes there is a case to consider additional concessions for retirement saving. Concessional treatment will make some allowance for the impact of inflation on long-term savings. Additional saving will improve the living standards of individuals in retirement. There are also likely to be broader economic benefits if there is an increase in the rate of national saving. 51 Future of Tax Interim Report Table 7.3: Options impact analysis Option % change in accumulated net savings after 30 years by annual salary Annual fiscal cost for 2021/22 income year $48,000$100,000$200,000 Increase member tax credit from $0.50 per dollar to dollar per dollar +16%+9%+5%$960 million Remove ESCT for employees earning up to $48,000 per year +8%0%0%$180 million Remove ESCT for all employer matching contributions+8%+18%+19%$740 million Reduce all of the lower PIE rates by five percentage points.+5%0%0%$35 million TEE for KiwiSaver (strict restrictions on maximum contributions) +17%+28%+28%$210 million EET for KiwiSaver (strict restrictions on maximum contributions) +17%+28%+28%$2,500 million per year in the early years These estimates are preliminary and presented for indicative purposes only. Note: These estimates do not account for any behavioural changes arising from the options. 43. Yet the Group is mindful of the fiscal and distributional impacts of poorly-designed concessions for retirement saving. This has led the Group to focus on options that are targeted towards low- and middle-income earners – which, in turn, will disproportionately benefit women (who are more likely than men to be on lower incomes, due to part-time work or time out of the paid workforce for caring responsibilities). 44. The Group sees little value in providing incentives to high income-earners, who are likely to be saving adequately in any case. The Group has also calibrated its recommendations to ensure that any changes are in areas that are more likely to have a net positive impact on national saving. 45. In light of these considerations, the Group recommends a package of modest incentives for retirement saving that is targeted towards low- and middle-income people. Because women on average have lower income than men, this should help to reduce gender gaps in saving. This package comprises: • The removal of ESCT for employees earning up to $48,000 per annum. • A five percentage point reduction for each of the lower PIE rates, applying to savings in KiwiSaver accounts. (The Government could also take the opportunity to simplify the PIE rate schedule, which is somewhat complex.) 46. In making these recommendations, the Group recognises that the tax system is limited in the extent to which it can encourage additional retirement saving by low- and middle-income earners. This is because low- and middle-income earners face income constraints in their ability to take advantage of tax concessions for saving. Further measures to boost retirement savings among these groups (such as direct Government contributions) will rely on spending decisions that are beyond the scope of the Group’s Terms of Reference. 47. The Group also notes that it has considered the tax system in light of current retirement policy settings. The Group has not assessed the impact of alternative approaches, such as the introduction of a compulsory saving scheme (which could involve significant tax reform, and will require additional measures to support the transition and ease the burden of contributions on low-income earners). The Government will need to continue monitoring the role of the tax system as retirement policy settings evolve. 52 Future of Tax Interim Report Issues with taxing gains on New Zealand and Australian shares 48. Extending the taxation of capital income by taxing capital gains would have implications for KiwiSaver and other savings vehicles, such as PIEs. This means gains from holding shares in New Zealand and Australian companies would be taxed. (The possible mechanics for doing this are set out in more detail in Appendix B). 49. This would impose tax of approximately $15 million per annum across KiwiSaver members with annual income of less than $48,000, and approximately $45 million per annum across higher income KiwiSaver members. 23 50. The proposed changes the Group is recommending would reduce tax by about $215 million per year for members earning less than $48,000 per year, which would more than compensate this group for the increased tax on domestic shares. 51. If there is a concern that higher income members should also have some offset for the additional tax on investment in domestic shares, consideration could be given to increasing the member tax credit from $0.50 per dollar to $0.60 per dollar, which would generate a benefit of about $190 million per year spread across all members (although lower income members would have a larger proportionate benefit). 23 This is based on the level of domestic equities owned by KiwiSaver funds as of March 2018, and the split of income earned by lower-income and higher-income members in 2016 (based on their reported PIE rate). Domestic shares are assumed to increase in value by 3% per year and share amounts grow by 20% per year. Australian shares are not included in the costing due to data limitations, but they are not expected to be large compared to ownership of domestic shares due to the benefit of imputation. This does not take into account a change in investment levels or patterns made by KiwiSaver funds as a result of tax changes. These estimates are preliminary and presented for indicative purposes only. 52. This would maintain the focus of KiwiSaver incentives on lower-income savers, retain the investment neutrality benefits of extending the taxation of capital income, and avoid risks that tax reductions linked to the nature of the investment itself could turn KiwiSaver into a vehicle for high income savers to generate large tax reductions for savings while contributing little to national savings levels. 53. The Group will give further consideration to the taxation of savings in the Final Report, in light of its broader conclusions on the tax system. Summary The Group recommends that the Government: 7.1 Remove ESCT on the employer’s matching contribution of 3% of salary to KiwiSaver for members earning up to $48,000 per year. 7.2 Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points each. 7.3 Consider ways to simplify the determination of the PIE rates (which would apply to KiwiSaver). The Group will give further consideration to the taxation of savings in the Final Report, in light of its broader conclusions on the tax system. 53 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Housing affordability is one of the key issues for consideration by the Group. The Terms of Reference direct the Group to have special regard to housing affordability, as well as to consider whether housing tax measures would improve the tax system. 2. The Group has also received a large number of submissions about the challenge of housing affordability. New Zealanders are concerned about the high cost of housing – for renters and homebuyers – and its impact on wealth inequality and social cohesion. 3. Yet it is also evident that New Zealanders disagree about the causes of the housing affordability challenge. Some New Zealanders believe the tax system is the cause of high house prices; others think it has little impact at all. 4. There are many influences on the housing market, of which tax is only one. This chapter begins by explaining the multiple causes of housing affordability, before exploring how the tax system deals with, and impacts on, the housing market. The causes of unaffordable housing 5. The cause of unaffordable housing is, in one sense, straightforward. New Zealand is simply unable to build enough houses to satisfy demand at current rates of population growth – particularly in Auckland, where growth is the highest in absolute terms. 6. Estimates of the size of the housing shortfall vary, depending on assumptions about household composition and lag times between building consents and building completions. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) estimates that the accumulated housing shortfall in Auckland had reached approximately 45,000 dwellings by 2017 (MBIE 2017). 7. This shortfall is the result of a number of interlinked problems in the supply of housing: • A combination of land use constraints and infrastructure constraints has limited the supply of land for housing, both within and beyond existing urban areas. • Building costs are high in New Zealand. Some of these costs reflect New Zealand’s particular circumstances, such as its small market size, and the need to manage natural hazard risks through building standards. Yet productivity growth in the building and construction sector has been low, and the sector faces significant productivity constraints. • Many developers are currently finding it difficult to access finance, particularly in Auckland. 8. At the same time, there is high demand for housing – reflecting high rates of population growth in recent years. High demand is not, by itself, a problem. The challenge relates rather to the interaction between supply and demand. If the supply of housing were more responsive (or, in other words, the elasticity of supply were higher), the additional demand could be met with less impact on house prices or rents. 8 Housing affordability 54 Future of Tax Interim Report The tax treatment of housing 9. The tax system is another influence on demand for housing. There are currently three main taxes that affect housing: income tax; GST; and local government rates. This section explains how each of these taxes treats housing. 24 Income tax 10. The income tax system does not formally favour investment in housing. However, the way in which the general principles of the tax system interact with housing can give it a relatively attractive tax treatment in practice. 11. There are two key principles with relevance to housing: • ‘Imputed income’ is not taxed. (Imputed income is a term that economists use to describe the benefit a taxpayer derives from using their own capital or labour. Thus, the imputed income from housing is the benefit a homeowner derives from living in their own home rent-free.) • Capital gains are not generally taxed, unless they arise in the context of ‘trading’ or a ‘trade- like’ activity, or other provisions, such as the “bright-line” rule. 12. The impact of these principles can be traced across the housing market. Developers, ‘dealers,’ and other land-related businesses 13. Income from land sales is taxed in the hands of builders, developers, ‘land dealers,’ and people in the business of dividing land. Sales within ten years of purchase or building are taxed, regardless as to whether the land was purchased for the business. 14. There are, however, two exceptions to this approach – regarding the person’s own home, and the premises of the business. Imputed labour income is also not taxed in the case of people who develop and build their own home. 24 In order to provide a complete picture, it includes a discussion of the treatment of owner-occupied homes. However, the Terms of Reference rule out consideration of any reforms that would apply to the family home or the land under it. Landholders 15. Gains on the sale of residential land are taxable if the land was bought with the firm intention of resale, even if resale was not the only or dominant intention of purchase. However, this is difficult to enforce. 16. The bright-line test aids with the enforcement of the ‘intention’ rule. The test serves as a proxy for intention of sale – which can otherwise be difficult to enforce – by taxing the sale of any residential property within five years of purchase, subject to some exceptions. 17. Land affected by changes to zoning, consents, or other specified changes may be taxed on sale, if the sale is within 10 years of acquisition. If at least 20% of the gain on disposal can be attributed to the change, the whole gain is taxable. However, the taxable amount is effectively reduced by a deduction equal to 10% of the gain multiplied by each year the taxpayer has owned the land. 18. Land disposals may be taxed if an undertaking or scheme involving more than minor development or division was commenced within 10 years of the land being acquired. Land disposals may also be taxed if there has been a scheme of division or development that involves significant expenditure on specified works, subject to a number of exclusions. Owner-occupiers 19. Owner-occupiers do not pay tax on the imputed income generated by their homes. The expenses associated with home ownership, such as maintenance and mortgage expenses, are not deductible. 20. Capital gains on owner-occupied homes are not generally taxed. There are some exceptions: the ‘main home’ exclusion from the bright-line test can only be used twice in a two-year period; and owner-occupiers with a regular pattern of buying and selling residential land cannot use the ‘main home’ exclusion for the land sale rules, including the bright-line rule. 55 Future of Tax Interim Report Landlords and tenants 21. The rents paid to landlords represent taxable income, and so the expenses associated with the ownership of a residential property investment (including interest) are generally deductible. Allowances for the depreciation of rental housing were eliminated in 2010. 22. Under present rules, losses from residential property investments can be aggregated with income from other sources. (This treatment is not unique to housing: the tax system generally aggregates all the income and deductions of a taxpayer, and applies tax on the net amount.) The Government intends to ring-fence losses on residential property investments, so investors will not be able to offset tax losses from those properties against other income. 23. Capital gains on residential property investments are taxable if the owner acquired the property with the intention of selling it. The bright-line test aids with the enforcement of this rule. However, since most property investors cannot be shown to have acquired property with the intention of selling it, capital gains from residential property investments are not generally taxed in practice. Capital losses are generally not deductible unless the property was bought with the intention of resale. GST 24. Some supplies of housing are subject to GST, but other supplies are not. The way in which GST is applied means that GST can have an impact on housing even if it is not visible to all participants in the housing market. Housing developers and sales of new homes 25. Developers are liable for GST when they sell a new residential property, and can claim credits for the GST content of the inputs they use. GST therefore forms part of the price of new homes, just like any other good or service. 26. The GST on the purchase price of a new home can be seen as an up-front payment of the tax on the accommodation services provided by the home over its economic life. Each successive owner then effectively bears part of the GST 25 When these services are provided by GST registered sellers. during their tenure as owner. Expenses related to home ownership, such as maintenance, are also subject to GST for these successive owners. 25 27. Any subsequent sales of housing by owners who are not housing developers (such as owner- occupiers or residential landlords) are generally not subject to GST. Landlords and tenants 28. Rent payments by tenants to landlords for housing are exempt from GST. However, GST applies to most of the inputs necessary to provide rental accommodation. This includes the initial cost of GST on the sale of a house by a developer, subsequent improvements by builders, and the costs of some repairs and maintenance. This means that although rental payments are exempt from GST, they do not escape GST. Instead it is the personal labour that is provided by a landlord which is the primary aspect of accommodation services that is not subject to GST. Local government rates 29. Private residential properties are subject to regional and local government rates. Local authorities determine rates annually, mostly on the basis of the assessed value of the property. Rates vary greatly across local authorities. 30. The Productivity Commission has assessed the average impact of rates relative to other forms of taxation. In 2012, rates averaged about 0.6% of the total capital value of residential property. The Productivity Commission calculated that a rate set at 0.6% of the capital value of a property would be equivalent to a tax of between 12% and 20% on the income generated by that property, depending on several key assumptions about the level of income, and whether that income is being measured in nominal or real terms (NZPC 2012). Inland Revenue estimates indicate that rates currently represent an average of approximately 0.3% of market value. 31. Rates apply to all land uses, not just owner- occupied property, so owner-occupied property still has a significant tax advantage relative to other land uses. 56 Future of Tax Interim Report The tax system and the housing market Savings and investment across the economy 32. The tax system has a range of impacts on the economy. These impacts do not always work in the same direction. An assessment of the cumulative impact of the tax system therefore relies on implicit assumptions about the relative strength of these various impacts. 33. In general, the non-taxation of some streams of housing income is likely to result in higher investment in housing, and less investment in assets that generate taxable returns, than would otherwise be the case. In a context where the supply of housing is constrained, additional residential investment will have a greater impact on the price of existing homes than on the construction of new homes. 34. This raises an important distinction regarding the balance between the productive and the speculative economy. There are valid concerns about speculative activity in the housing market. Yet there is also a need for productive investment to increase the supply of housing and alleviate the housing shortfall. This speaks to the importance of broader reforms to the housing system – beyond tax – that reduce constraints on the construction of new homes. The impact of individual aspects of the tax system Portfolio effects 35. The composition of household portfolios is affected by an incentive to ‘save’ through mortgage repayments on owner-occupied homes. Homeowners have an incentive to pay off their mortgages ahead of other forms of saving because each dollar repaid on the mortgage is ‘saved’ at the pre-tax interest rate. Saving through mortgage repayments on owner-occupied homes is therefore more lightly taxed than other types of saving, creating a bias in household portfolios towards the repayment of mortgages. Non-taxation of imputed income 36. The non-taxation of imputed income encourages more investment in owner-occupied housing by those who can wholly fund the purchase with their own wealth. However, an owner-occupied home that is partly or entirely debt-financed, does not provide the same level of tax benefit as an owner-occupied home that is fully financed by equity. This is because mortgage interest is not deductible. The inconsistent taxation of capital gains 37. The inconsistent taxation of capital gains biases savings and investment decisions towards assets that are expected to generate untaxed capital gains, rather than assets that generate more regular taxable income streams, such as term deposits. This results in more investment in housing than would otherwise be the case. 38. The non-taxation of capital gains could be resulting in a reduction of rents – benefiting people on lower incomes who are more likely to rent – if greater investment in housing resulted in a greater supply of rental accommodation. Whether this holds in current market conditions in New Zealand is uncertain, so assumptions about the elasticity of supply are critical to an assessment of the distributional impacts of tax changes in the housing market. 39. One rule that may be directly affecting the supply of land is the ‘ten year rule’, which creates an incentive for landholders on city fringes to withhold land from development until ten years have passed from a change in land use regulation. GST 40. The tax bias towards owner-occupation mostly arises as a result of our income tax settings. Consequently, the introduction of GST, and subsequent increases to the rate of GST, have reduced the bias in favour of equity-financed, owner-occupied housing to the extent that they have enabled complementary reductions in rates of income tax. 57 Future of Tax Interim Report Local government rates 41. Local authorities have the ability to choose the basis on which they levy general rates. There are three methodologies for levying general rates: unimproved land value; capital value; or annual value (a measure of what a property would fetch if rented on the open market). Most councils use capital value for their rating systems. 42. The choice of rating system will have some impact on housing supply. Capital value rating is a tax on improving land. It discourages development and lowers the rates liability of those that hold vacant land, relative to using unimproved land value, which encourages (or at least does not discourage) the development of bare land. The overall impact of the tax system 43. It is difficult to quantify the impact of the New Zealand tax system on house prices and rents. The housing market is subject to many different influences. Disentangling these influences is no easy task, so there is little definitive empirical evidence regarding the tax impact on house prices and rents in New Zealand. 44. As one example, Coleman (2017) argues there is a strong theoretical case that changes to the taxation of retirement savings in the late 1980s increased house prices. But Coleman also finds that the empirical evidence for this result is inconclusive, partly because so many other macroeconomic changes occurred at the same time that it is difficult to link changes in housing market indicators to the tax changes themselves. 45. Most observers do not identify tax policy as the primary cause of high house prices. The OECD, for example, conducted a detailed survey of New Zealand’s housing sector in 2011, and concluded that tax settings ‘exaggerated’ rather than caused the rise in prices in the mid-2000s (OECD 2011). 46. It is likely that tax policy has exacerbated the house price cycle in New Zealand over the past two decades. But the existence of substantial constraints on the supply of housing means that tax policy is unlikely to be the dominant driver of high house prices. Assessment Reforms to increase the supply of housing 47. Although tax reform is unlikely to be the dominant driver of the housing markets, the Group has identified a number of options that could release some additional supply. Depreciation on multi-unit residential buildings 48. The restoration of depreciation on multi-unit residential buildings would increase the supply of housing and support greater intensification in urban areas. The treatment of depreciation is discussed further in Chapter 14 on The taxation of business. Vacant land and empty home taxes 49. The introduction of a tax on vacant residential land, or on empty homes in residential areas, would intensify the use of existing urban areas. There are already examples from Australia that could inform the development of similar taxes in New Zealand: • Australia introduced a measure in its most recent budget that denies deductions associated with holding vacant land. While this measure is not a tax on vacant land, it does provide a tax incentive to utilise vacant land for either residential or commercial purposes. • Australia also introduced a measure in 2017 that imposes a flat fee of $A5,000 on foreign- owned properties that are not occupied or are not genuinely available for rent for more than 6 months. 50. The main risk with these taxes is that they encourage the token (rather than substantive) use of land or houses. Nevertheless, the Group believes there is merit in the consideration of taxes on vacant land and empty homes (over and above existing local government rates) to encourage housing development. Any new housing development spurred by these taxes would need to occur on a planned and environmentally sustainable basis. 58 Future of Tax Interim Report The removal of the ‘ten year rule’ 51. The removal of the ‘ten year rule’ related to changes to zoning, consents, or other specified changes would reduce the incentive to engage in land-banking behaviour on city fringes. The effects would probably be minor, but the rule will need to be reconsidered in any case if capital income taxation is extended further. Local government rating systems 52. Some submitters have suggested that the Group consider the balance between central and local government taxation. The Group has decided not to explore this issue, in light of the Government’s decision to commission a Productivity Commission Inquiry into Local Government Funding and Financing. Nevertheless, the Group believes strongly that central government should steer the overall framework of central and local government taxation. 53. The Group does note, however, that a shift from capital to unimproved land valuation will increase the incentive for owner-occupiers to increase the capital investment in their properties. This will increase the supply of housing to some degree. In making this observation, the Group acknowledges that a broad range of considerations – beyond housing affordability – will need to affect the choice of rating methodology. 26 The housing market impacts of capital income taxation 54. Chapter 6 introduced a number of options for extending the taxation of capital income. These measures will affect the housing market, and may affect house prices and rents in different ways. 26 The Group also acknowledges that the valuation system and practices are outside the scope of the Productivity Commission’s Inquiry into Local Government Funding and Financing. Distributional considerations 55. Patterns of housing tenure and housing stress differ greatly by income, ethnicity, and region. The following statistics give a sense of the range of housing outcomes across different groups of New Zealanders: • Income. In 2017, 54% of households in the lowest income decile lived in a home that was owned by them or their family trust, compared to 78% of households in the highest income decile. • Ethnicity. In 2013, the percentage of people in households that owned their own home ranged from 33% for Pacific Peoples and 43% for Māori to 70% for Europeans. In December 2017, 44% of the people on the Social Housing Register, and 57% of the people who received emergency housing grants, were Māori. • Region. In 2013, the percentage of dwellings rented ranged from 27% in Tasman to 41% in Auckland and 43% in Gisborne. Johnson et al. (2018), MSD (2017), (SNZ 2017). 56. A social capital lens requires a consideration of the distributional impact of policy reform. Rents can serve as a proxy for assessing these distributional impacts, since measures that affect rents will have a disproportionate impact (whether positive or negative) on groups and individuals who are already relatively disadvantaged. Potential impacts on house prices and rents 57. The extension of capital income taxation (for example, through the introduction of a tax on capital gains from residential property investments) could be expected to have a number of impacts on housing markets, including some upward pressure on the ratio of rents to prices. 59 Future of Tax Interim Report 58. The Group has explored the impact of similar tax changes on housing markets in other countries (including Canada, Australia, and South Africa). The Group has not observed significant increases (and, to the contrary, rent to price ratios have fallen rather than increased in these countries). But it is difficult to know what other influences were affecting housing markets in those countries at the time of the changes. 59. The Group has also reviewed the results of two theoretical models. These models have both estimated an increase in the ratio of rents to prices and rents. However, they have inconsistent estimates for the effects on house prices. 60. There are some important caveats to the modelling. Models used in New Zealand either ignored the impact of risk and uncertainty or provided a very simplified treatment. The models reviewed by the Group assume that current tax parameters, interest rates, inflation, and future returns on housing are all known, and are perfectly certain to continue into the indefinite future. 61. International studies warn, however, that these types of ‘certainty models’ can overstate the effects of tax changes on housing decisions. These studies also observe that taxing gains and allowing losses on housing can reduce risks to investors, and have some offsetting benefits, which are not captured in certainty models. 27 27 See, for example, Rosen, Rosen and Holtz-Eakin (1984) and Berkovec and Fullerton (1992). 28 Data supplied by MSD for June 2018. 29 A benefit recipient may be eligible for an increase in their income support from Temporary Additional Support (TAS). 62. If housing investors think there is a chance that their investment will fall in value, an extension of capital income taxation with symmetric treatment of gains and losses will mitigate the ‘cost’ of the tax, because the design of the tax will provide protection on the downside, as well as taxation on the upside. Interactions with the Accommodation Supplement 63. Under current rules, some tenants receiving the Accommodation Supplement will receive an increase in their entitlement if rents increase. 64. Some recipients, however, will not receive any increase however. Around 23% of those receiving the Accommodation Supplement are already receiving the maximum payment. 28 This group of people are unlikely see an increase in their Accommodation Supplement entitlement if their rents increased. 29 Summary 8.1 The Group’s work on housing affordability is closely linked with its work on the taxation of capital income. The Group will have particular regard to housing market impacts as it finalises its recommendations regarding capital income. 60 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Natural capital is one of the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework, and one focus for the Group has been to explore how Te Ao Māori perspectives can inform our understanding and application of the Living Standards Framework with regard to natural capital. 2. Waiora – which is commonly used in Te Ao Māori to express wellbeing – centres our conception of wellbeing in wai (water) as the source of all life. As human beings, we are largely comprised of water, and we draw our sustenance from the natural environment. Our wellbeing is inextricably linked to the wellbeing of our natural capital. Our success in managing ourselves in relation to these natural systems and resources will determine the sustainability and wellbeing of our people over time. 3. Due to the symbiotic relationship of all things in the natural world, there is mutual benefit in responsible management of ourselves in relation to natural resources. From a tikanga perspective, kaitiakitanga (stewardship) encapsulates our obligations to undertake responsible resource management of our natural capital, as a basis for the sustainable development of our human, social, and physical and financial capitals. Extending the principles of kaitiaki to the way we manage these four capitals collectively can support our approach to achieving wellbeing for our environment and our people. 4. It is also important to acknowledge that the natural environment has intrinsic value that goes beyond utility, because our sense of who we are as people is deeply embedded in our connection to it. Through manaakitanga (care and respect), we are incentivised to practice kaitiakitanga, and our whanaungatanga (relationships to each other) are enhanced. 5. These values are not exclusive to Te Ao Māori. It is evident from public submissions that many New Zealanders are deeply concerned about the state of the environment. Their concerns cover effects at the local, national, and global levels including pollution in our waterways, declining biodiversity, threats to our coastal zones, and the impacts of climate change. 6. The Group has been tasked to respond to these concerns by examining the role the tax system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. System goals and principles 7. The environmental challenges ahead of us – including de-carbonising the economy, improving the quality of our freshwater, and enhancing coastal habitats – require profound change to the structure of economic activity. It is therefore necessary for policymakers to think in terms of systems change – and to develop a set of goals and principles that can guide a transition, over many decades, to more sustainable patterns of economic activity. 8. Under traditional economic approaches, environmental challenges are costly and a transition will be expensive, unless benefits and pathways to possible solutions are mapped. 9 Environmental and ecological outcomes 61 Future of Tax Interim Report 9. Our framework, grounded in tikanga Māori, can support and enrich the transition towards greater systems thinking, as mātauranga Māori already contains knowledge systems and frameworks that reflect a holistic and interconnected view of the natural world and its resources. 10. The circular economy envisages a system in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from those resources while in use, and then recover and regenerate materials at the end of their service life. 30 Tikanga, such as kaitiaki and manaaki, and mātauranga Māori more broadly, can help facilitate transitions that move towards more sustainable management practices like the circular economy. Observations of sustainable resource management have formed the basis of these knowledge systems which are preserved in mātauranga Māori and tikanga values. Synergising the knowledge systems of Aotearoa/ New Zealand will improve on what we currently have, and accelerate our potential to achieve our collective resource management, sustainability, and development goals. 11. These connections between healthy ecosystems and human well-being are also reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals are signed by all 193 UN member states, including New Zealand, and provide a set of timebound goals across all domains of wellbeing. In the environmental sphere, the goals set targets for clean water (SDG6), climate action (SDG13), life below water (SDG14), and life on land (SDG15). The Sustainable Development Goals provide one blueprint for defining and measuring a just transition over time. 12. The Group notes that many of these goals and concepts are already beginning to inform the public debate on the future of the economy, including through the Living Standards Framework. The Group encourages further efforts to develop a shared vision about the goals and pathways towards an ‘Aotearoa Economy’ that can be sustained within a safe ecological operating space. 30 Other alternative economic approaches include ecological economics, transitioning economics, regenerative economics, sharing economics, and doughnut economics. The role of taxation 13. As outlined in Chapter 1, taxation is not simply a means of raising revenue. Taxation can also be used as an instrument to achieve specific policy goals by influencing behaviour. 14. As an initial step, the Group has considered taxation in the context of negative environmental externalities. In economics, an externality is a cost or benefit that falls upon an unrelated third party. One example of a negative environmental externality is air pollution from an industrial plant that reduces air quality in a neighbouring district: the residents in that district may have no connection to the industrial plant, but nevertheless suffer the effects of the downwind air pollution. 15. On the other hand, behaviour changes can also produce positive externalities. For example, changes in farm practice may lead to downstream improvements in water quality that increase the production of ecosystem services. 16. The Group has also taken a broad view of potential tax instruments. The Group’s working definition of taxation in this context is economic instruments that can be potentially revenue- raising for central or local government and improve environmental outcomes. Environmental outcomes could be improved by encouraging behaviour change, and/or by funding environmental improvements, mitigation works, or assisting people through change. The definition encompasses nationally-uniform taxes or levies, locally-variable taxes or levies, and tradeable emissions permits for national and local markets where the permits are sold by the Government. 17. Taxation is not necessarily the best tool to change behaviour. Sometimes, it may be more effective or efficient for the Government to consider regulation or spending; in other cases, taxation may be complementary. As has been stressed by public submitters, tax should not be considered in isolation when dealing with the environment; instead, the merits of tax as a policy instrument should be assessed together with the merits of other tools and approaches. 62 Future of Tax Interim Report Environmental taxes in New Zealand 18. Statistics New Zealand estimates that in 2016, the Government raised $4.9 billion in environmental taxes, as defined by the System of Environment Economic Accounting (SEAA). This was equivalent to 6.2% of tax revenue, up from 4.8% in 1999 (Stats NZ 2018). 19. Most of New Zealand’s environmental tax revenue is from taxes that are levied for non- environmental purposes. 47% of environmental tax revenues are classified as transport taxes, such as road user charges and vehicle registration fees (Stats NZ 2018). A further 51% is classified as energy taxes, which is primarily made up of transport fuel taxes, such as petrol excise duty. These transport-related taxes are largely hypothecated back to transport (especially roads) through the National Land Transport Fund. 20. The balance of environmental taxes is made up of pollution taxes (1%) such as the Waste Disposal Levy, and resource taxes (1%) such as energy resource levies. There are plans for the Government to begin auctioning units under the Emissions Trading Scheme which could also constitute environmental tax revenue. 21. The OECD finds New Zealand to be a relatively low user of environmental taxes. New Zealand is ranked 30th out of 33 OECD countries for environmental tax revenue as a share of total tax revenue in 2013 (OECD, 2018). When to apply environmental taxes 22. Over the past months, the Group has developed a framework for deciding when to apply taxes to address negative environmental externalities. The draft framework, which is presented in box 9.1, sets out the circumstances in which taxation is likely to be an effective tool, and the characteristics of a well-designed externality tax. 23. The Group has also considered taxation of natural resource use (or resource rents). A draft set of principles, based on those previously used for assessing New Zealand’s petroleum and minerals royalty regimes (MBIE 2012) are presented in box 9.2. Opportunities for environmental taxation 24. The Group has considered potential changes to the tax system to support better environmental and ecological outcomes over the short, medium and longer terms, using these frameworks. 25. The Group wishes to highlight five specific areas for further attention in the short-to-medium term: greenhouse gas emissions; water pollution; water abstraction; solid waste; and road transport. 26. The following discussion focuses on criteria in the negative externality framework which are only partially met, and on design principles of particular relevance to each resource. Greenhouse gas emissions Evaluation against the framework 27. Greenhouse gases generally meet the criteria of our framework, suggesting they are well suited to the use of tax instruments (where tax instruments include auctioned tradeable emission permits). Of particular note is the wide range of abatement opportunities. This means abatement of emissions is likely to be achieved at a lower cost by using taxation than by mandating particular actions through regulation. There is also evidence that putting a price on greenhouse gas externalities drives innovation in abatement (Dechezlepretre, Martin & Bassi 2016). Greenhouse gases could be a significant source of revenue over the medium term. 28. Our framework also highlights potential challenges with applying tax instruments to greenhouse gases which are briefly explored below – namely concerns with measurement, international linkages, and pricing. 29. New Zealand already has an environmental tax tool for pricing greenhouse gases in the form of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). 63 Future of Tax Interim Report Box 9.1: Draft framework for taxing negative environmental externalities Taxation can be used as a tool to enhance natural capital when unpriced externalities lead to the over- exploitation of resource stocks and degrade the integrity of ecosystems. The suitability of taxation as a policy instrument – relative to other instruments such as regulation and spending – can be assessed through the following principles: • Measurability: The damaging activity, or a reasonable proxy of it, can be measured. • Behavioural responsiveness: The level of damaging activity is relatively responsive to feasible price signals (i.e. it is relatively price elastic). If the damaging activity is relatively price inelastic, a tax might still be desirable for the objective of raising revenue. • Risk tolerance: There is sufficient time for a tax instrument to be developed and refined. • Sufficient scale: The environmental problem is sufficiently large-scale and persistent to justify administration and compliance costs in comparison to regulation. The benefits of using taxation as an instrument may be greater when the following criteria are met: • Diversity of responses: There is a range of abatement responses with differing costs, including investment in innovation, such that regulating a particular response could impose high costs. • Revenue raising potential: Large revenues could be raised from the tax, allowing for the reduction of more distortionary taxes and/or spending on other government priorities. Principles for designing externality taxes The general principles of tax policy design can also apply to environmental taxes. Building off these, there are five design principles which warrant particular attention: • Māori rights and interests must be acknowledged and addressed. • Distributional impacts should be assessed and mitigated. • The price of the tax should reflect the full cost of externalities. 1 • The price should preferably vary locally where there is local variation in impacts. • International linkages should be considered. 1 External costs can be difficult to estimate. A tax that is 50 percent above or below the true cost will still likely perform well in terms of welfare gains (Parry, Norregaard, & Heine, 2012). In situations where certain externalities cannot be costed, the price of the tax may need to be set higher than the costed externalities to allow for un-costed externalities. 64 Future of Tax Interim Report Box 9.2: Draft principles for taxing natural resource use Taxes on natural resource use can be used to compensate resource owners and as a means to efficiently raise revenue. The following principles have previously been used for evaluating New Zealand’s royalty regimes: • Ensuring a “fair” return to the resource owner. The tax should seek to recover the resource rent, while ensuring adequate incentives for investors to develop resources. • Economic efficiency: Deadweight losses should be minimised. In theory, a tax levied on pure rent will be non-distorting. In practice, it is difficult to tax pure rent and resource tax instruments will introduce distortions and deadweight losses. • Administrative complexity: Tax instruments should aim to be simple and transparent. There is often a trade-off between the theoretical efficiency of a resource tax, and its administrative complexities and costs. • Risk sharing between the Crown and industry: Risk should be allocated to the party best able to manage or tolerate it. Different tax instruments split risk differently between the Crown and industry, especially commercial risk and price risk. Measurement 30. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are more difficult to accurately estimate than point source emissions from fossil fuels. This has been an important issue in expanding the ETS to include agriculture. There are different approaches to measuring agricultural emissions: • At the more precise end of the spectrum are modelling tools which attempt to account for farm-specific characteristics. These tools can be expensive to administer, but account for some differences in farm management practices. One example of these tools is OVERSEER, which is a nutrient budgeting and management tool. OVERSEER has been criticised with regard to its accuracy as a measuring tool. The Group supports further work on its development and improvement. • At the less precise end of the spectrum are approaches such as processor-level charges. These approaches are simpler to administer and encourage some mitigation, but do not reflect differences in farming management practices. 31. There is still much work to do on this issue, but the Group notes that even imprecise approaches could provide a useful price signal that accounts for land use and intensity decisions. International linkages 32. If New Zealand imposes the full cost of carbon, but other countries do not, there is a risk of ‘emissions leakage’ – in which production contracts here, and expands in countries with weaker climate action, with no net global reduction in emissions (Levinson & Taylor 2008). 33. At a minimum this points to the importance of supporting globally coordinated action. There are also policy options for mitigating leakage risks. These options include free allocation to impacted industries, targeted revenue recycling, and regulation to level the carbon playing field between domestic producers and importers. 34. There are potential benefits from taking faster action on climate change. It could encourage innovation and reduce the cost to meeting international commitments. 65 Future of Tax Interim Report The Emissions Trading Scheme and pricing 35. As noted above, New Zealand already has a tool for pricing carbon in the form of the ETS. A carbon tax is another economic instrument that could be used to price emissions. 36. A major criticism of the ETS is that it has significantly under-priced carbon. 31 The Productivity Commission reports that New Zealand’s emissions price (currently at $NZ21/t-CO 2 e) will need to rise to at least $75/t-CO 2 e and possibly over $200/t-CO 2 e over the next few decades to achieve New Zealand’s international commitments (New Zealand Productivity Commission, 2018). 37. There is scope to address the weaknesses of the ETS without needing to introduce a carbon tax. Some reforms have already taken place – for example, removal of the one-for- two policy. 32 The Group also notes a range of reforms recommended by the Productivity Commission, including an emissions price that covers all land use (including agriculture), introducing mechanisms that provide guidance about the path of future emissions prices, and auctioning emission units (NZUs) to achieve this (NZPC 2018). The ETS could also raise the same amount of revenue as a carbon tax if free allocation were reduced. 31 Stiglitz-Stern estimate the Paris Agreement objectives require a pricing corridor of $US40-80/t-CO 2 e in 2020 and $US50- 100/t-CO 2 e in 2030 (Stern & Stiglitz, 2017). This is roughly equivalent to $NZ58-116/t-CO 2 e in 2020 and $NZ73-145/t-CO 2 e in 2030. Biological emissions – almost half of New Zealand’s total emissions – are also excluded from the ETS. 32 The one-for-two transitional measure allows non-forestry businesses to pay one emissions unit for every two tonnes of CO 2 e emissions. 38. Retaining the ETS also supports policy stability and durability. It is sensible to take advantage of the existing infrastructure around the ETS. It is also important to give stability about the long-term direction of policy, so that businesses and individuals have the confidence to invest in emissions abatement. Revenue potential 39. The Government does not currently auction emission units, but could realise significant fiscal benefits by doing so. 40. The fiscal potential of greenhouse gas emissions depends on policy choices about the treatment of biological emissions and limits to free allocation. The Group has modelled different revenue scenarios based on carbon budget forecasts from the Ministry for the Environment. 41. Under current settings, and assuming the NZU price rises to $50/t-CO2e in 2030, the auction of NZUs is forecast to raise approximately $130 million per annum over the coming decade. 42. If agriculture faces a charge for 5% of its emissions, and free allocation is reduced linearly by 1%-point each year, revenue will roughly double to $240 million per annum, assuming no change in emission volumes. Table 9.1: Fiscal potential from auctioning emission units Share of biological emissions charged for Change in free allocation, relative to current rates Average annual forecast revenues, 2021-30 Status quo0%0%$130 million Scenario 15%Reduction of 1%-point p.a.$240 million Scenario 25% in 2021, increasing 3%-points p.a.Reduction of 3%-points p.a.$530 million Note: The modelling is based on current MfE carbon budget projections. It assumes no change in emission volumes as a result of changes in free allocation or biological emission charging, and also assumes a linear increase in the emissions price from $20/t-CO2e in 2021 to $50/t-CO2e in 2030. Source: Ministry for the Environment and Tax Working Group Secretariat. 66 Future of Tax Interim Report 43. If free allocation reductions increase to 3%-points each year (the upper end of broad- based reduction rates being considered by other countries), and this same reduction rate is also applied to agriculture, revenue will double again to $530 million per annum. 44. The total revenue that could be raised by removing all free allocation is estimated to be $2.1 billion per annum, assuming no change in emission volumes. This is equivalent to replacing the ETS with a comprehensive carbon tax, assuming prices are the same. 45. Revenue will be sensitive to the emissions price. If the price rises to $80/t-CO2e in 2030 (the highest rate in scenarios used by the Productivity Commission), revenue will increase by approximately 40% above the estimates in the table. At $30/t-CO2e (the lowest rate in Productivity Commission scenarios), revenue will decrease by approximately 27%. 46. In the longer term, greenhouse gas emissions may not be a reliable tax base if New Zealand substantially reduces its net emissions. In the short-to-medium term, however, even modest changes to the ETS settings could raise reasonable amounts of revenue. Assessment 47. Greenhouse gases are well suited to the use of tax instruments. However, there are significant shortcomings in the current pricing and coverage of emissions in New Zealand. 48. The Group believes a reformed ETS should remain the centrepiece of New Zealand’s emissions reduction efforts, but it should also be made more ‘tax-like’ – specifically, by providing greater guidance on price, and becoming revenue raising by auctioning of NZUs, as recommended in the Productivity Commission’s report. The Group is not well- placed to take a view on specific settings, such as the appropriate settings of a price band to drive the desired behaviour change. The work of the Interim Climate Change Committee and future Climate Commission will be important for ensuring the ETS establishes credible and enduring price signals that incentivises the de- carbonisation of the New Zealand economy. 49. The Group recommends periodic review of the ETS to ensure it is fit for purpose. Water pollution Evaluation against the framework 50. Pollution of fresh waterways is a significant environmental problem in New Zealand. There are a range of water pollutants impacting water quality including nitrogen, phosphorous, sediment, and pathogens such as E. coli. Water pollutants come from both rural and urban sources (MfE 2017). 51. Applying our framework to water pollution, a number of criteria are only partially met. Output measurement of diffuse pollutants is challenging and modelling of some water pollutants is more difficult than others. Opportunities for abatement will vary by catchment, as will the environmental benefits. Risk tolerance may have been exhausted in some catchments, and banning of discharges might be required to restore them to a healthy state. In designing potential tax instruments, consideration of Māori rights and interests will be critical, as will pricing and equity issues. Measurement and pricing issues are further explored below. Measurement 52. There are significant measurement challenges for water pollutants: estimates of emissions can be imprecise, and the coverage of pollutants is incomplete. For example, our capacity to model sediment, pathogens and phosphorous run-off is significantly less advanced than nitrogen using tools like OVERSEER. 53. The better the measurement, the clearer the price signal is to reduce harmful emissions. Nonetheless, tax instruments based on relatively coarse estimates (e.g. input-based approaches such as fertilizer use) may be better than the status quo for some pollutants, such as nitrogen. They can provide a price signal that is sensitive to land use and intensity decisions, and incentives to abate below consent levels. 54. The Group is aware that the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment is currently reviewing OVERSEER, although not specifically for its use as a tax instrument. 67 Future of Tax Interim Report Localisation of pricing 55. Water pollution costs vary significantly by location. The marginal cost of emissions differs significantly across catchments, based on a range of geophysical variables and the level of current emissions. Pricing and taxation should also allow for local variation. 56. Locally-variable pricing tools could take various forms. For example, catchment-level nitrogen discharge trading schemes have already been used in the Lake Taupo catchment, and are planned for the Rotorua Lakes; an alternative might be a national tax levied on estimated emissions with catchment-level variation in rates. 57. Locally-variable pricing tools could involve significant administrative and compliance complexity. An alternative approach is nationally uniform charging – for example, a fertilizer tax. 58. Setting the price may require making challenging value judgements about the desired level of water quality. This is a key function of the National Policy Statement on Freshwater Management. Swimmability, drinkability, ecosystem health and aesthetic amenity considerations point to a range of possible standards. There may also be challenges in valuing and accounting for lost fauna, flora and ecosystems. 59. As with other environmental resources, it may not be possible to reflect the full cost of water pollution in the price, but this shouldn’t preclude the use of tax instruments in pursuit of positive environmental and ecological outcomes. 33 Revenue potential 60. The Group has not found comprehensive estimates of the revenue that could be generated from water pollutant taxes in New Zealand. To give a sense of the potential magnitude, the Group estimates that a $2/kg charge on leached nitrates could raise approximately $270 million per annum at current leaching rates and assuming 100% coverage. 33 Costing externalities is important for the design of both tax instruments and regulation – both require policy makers to balance costs and benefits. Assessment 61. If Māori rights and interests can be addressed, there could be a role for making greater use of tax instruments to address water quality with current tools, especially for nitrogen, and especially for regions struggling with excessive discharges. Even tax instruments using simple estimation approaches are likely to be preferable to having no tax or pricing instruments. 62. Water pollutant tax rates should preferably be sensitive to local catchment conditions (e.g. through local trading markets, or locally differentiated rates). Pricing / charging frameworks and systems should be developed, potentially at a national level for local application, to reflect this. 63. Further development of tools to estimate (and ultimately directly measure) diffuse water pollution should be encouraged to enable more accurate and effective water pollutant tax instruments. Capabilities and capacities should be strengthened for development and application of modelling tools, as well as verification of compliance. 64. Tax instruments are not well suited to addressing all water pollution issues. Regulation, education and support will therefore likely need to continue to play an important role in complementing potential tax instruments. 68 Future of Tax Interim Report Water abstraction Objectives of a water abstraction tax 65. Water abstraction taxes have a broader set of potential objectives than some of the other environmental tax opportunities. They include: a) Rationing the total water take (i.e. pricing externalities) b) Improving the efficiency of water use within allowable water takes (i.e. ensuring that those who use the water are those that get the most benefit from it) c) Taxing natural resource use (i.e. capturing resource rents) 66. The Government has taken a regulatory approach to the first objective – minimum flows and maximum takes are set following processes outlined in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management. Water tax instruments can play a complementary role, supporting the second and third objectives. Evaluation against the framework 67. Fresh water abstraction generally meets the criteria in our framework. Measurement of major water takes is generally feasible, price signals can incentivise significant changes in behaviour, and unlike many other environmental taxes, there is potential for significant long term revenue. 68. There are, however, significant design considerations that would need to be addressed before advancing potential water tax instruments, including addressing Māori rights and interests, pricing localisation concerns, and equity issues. Māori rights and interests 69. Any potential water taxes will need to take account of Māori rights and interests in water. There are well established concerns about not only questions of ownership, but also of access. Māori have less access to water than other land owners. Analysis from MPI suggests that in drier regions of New Zealand, only 3% of good quality 34 The value of water will also be sensitive to the prices of the products produced using the water e.g. milk and electricity. Māori-owned land is irrigated, compared to 27% of all good quality land. There is ongoing work to better address Māori rights and interest in water, including through the Waitangi Tribunal, and discussions between the Crown and iwi/Māori. Localisation of pricing 70. Water allocation pressures vary significantly by both time of year and catchment. 34 Tax instruments should therefore preferably be sensitive to both time and place to reflect differences in the scarcity and value of water. 71. Better pricing of water has the potential to not only incentivise a broad range of efficiency measures by water users, but also increased investment in water storage and transport infrastructure. 72. There are risks to having tradeable water rights in highly localised water markets – there may be a small number of participants making it difficult to ensure competitive processes. The administrative costs of tradeable water schemes will also need to be considered. Equity and distributional impacts 73. Equity and efficiency considerations suggest environmental and resource taxes should, by default, have broad coverage. Applying this to water abstraction, this means all exclusionary users of water should be in scope for potential water taxes, including agriculture, hydroelectric generators, and urban users. Special consideration may be warranted for non-consumptive users of water, such as hydroelectric generation. Water may still have value after non-consumptive use, although its ecological and economic value may have been depleted. 74. There are equity challenges in any potential allocation of water rights. Some of the value of existing water consents is likely capitalised in land prices and hydroelectric generator share prices. These equity concerns will need to be balanced against the interests of those who currently do not have (and cannot currently get) water consents, as well as the expectations of 69 Future of Tax Interim Report a fair return to the public, Crown or Māori. The Group also acknowledges that water bodies may themselves have rights and interests, as recognised in the granting of legal personhood to the Whanganui River. 75. The distributional impacts on households of a water tax will also need to be considered, both from the direct cost of water charges, and the incidence of any water charges imposed on firms (e.g. agriculture and electricity providers). People cannot live without water, and it will be important to ensure that households have affordable access to water. Policies such as free allocation allowances could be considered to mitigate these concerns. Assessment 76. The Group acknowledges that water abstraction is a particularly challenging policy area in New Zealand, owing to a range of different interest in the resource. Water is an essential resource for life, for recreation and for commerce. Water policy also impacts on Māori rights and interests. 77. If Māori rights and interests can be addressed, water tax instruments (including auctioned tradeable permits) could be useful tools for improving the efficiency of water use. They could also be significant and sustainable source of revenue over the long term. Solid waste Evaluation against the framework 78. Solid waste meets the criteria in our framework for the application of an externality tax. Solid waste streams are generally measurable. There is a diverse range of waste reduction opportunities including greater resource recovery and recycling, and investment in product designs and circular systems. Overseas experience has shown landfilling to be responsive to price signals. Waste taxes also have the potential to raise significant revenue in the short-to-medium term. 79. New Zealand already taxes waste through the Waste Disposal Levy. The levy is set at a rate of $10 per tonne, and applies only at landfills that accept household waste. The limited scope means the levy is only applied to 11% of landfills, covering approximately 30% of waste disposed to landfills. The levy currently raises about $30 million per annum (MfE 2017). Pricing 80. Well-run landfill sites internalise many of the environmental costs in the disposal fees they charge. However, even well-run landfills generate externalities, which may include leachates, air emissions (other than greenhouse gases covered by the ETS), and reduced amenity. 81. It is unclear whether the levy fully prices the externalities associated with waste and landfill disposal. Robust estimates of these externalities are challenging, and depend on the site and waste product. However, a review in 2012 estimated the costs of the environmental externalities – over and above the disposal costs of the landfill – range from $1-$19 per tonne (Covec 2012). These estimates take a relatively narrow view of the externalities from waste, so it may be appropriate to look at a wider set of externalities, which may justify a higher rate. Higher rates might also be needed to achieve behaviour change. Behavioural responsiveness 82. A significant increase in the levy rate will likely change behaviour. Waste is price elastic, and overseas experience suggests that higher landfill taxes reduce waste production and increase recycling (Covec 2012). In the United Kingdom, for example, higher landfill taxes have driven extraordinary reductions in landfill volumes. 83. Increased efforts will be necessary, however, to mitigate the risk that individuals resort to illegal dumping to avoid the levy. This could include reuse and recycling programmes, stronger illegal dumping penalties, and education programmes. 70 Future of Tax Interim Report Figure 9.1 Landfill tax rates and waste volumes in the UK £0 £10 £20 £30 £40 £50 £60 £70 £80 £90 £100 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 19961998200020022004200620082010201220142016 Level of standard tax rate (£ per tonne) Tonnes of waste landfilled at standard rate ('000 tonnes) Waste landfilled at standard rateTax rate Source: HMRC, 2017 35 Approximately half of the funds raised goes to local councils and half is hypothecated to waste reduction projects through the Waste Minimisation Fund. Fiscal potential 84. The Waste Disposal Levy currently raises approximately $30 million per annum. 35 A recent study by Eunomia, commissioned by the New Zealand Waste Levy Action Group, modelled revenue changes from increases in the levy to up to $140/t for standard waste with a lower rate for inert waste (Eunomia 2017). The modelling exercise found up to $200 million in additional annual revenue from rate increases. The Group has not fully assessed modelling assumptions or approaches used in this analysis. 85. In the long run, the price elasticity of waste means that waste taxes may not be a sustainable tax base. Assessment 86. The Ministry for the Environment is currently undertaking policy analysis to expand the scope and rate of the Waste Disposal Levy. The Group supports this work programme. There is a case for expanding the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy beyond the 30% of waste currently covered, potentially with split rates to account for different external costs associated with different types of waste. 87. The Group recommends a reassessment of negative externalities associated with waste and landfill disposal in New Zealand to test for externalities beyond the scope of studies to date, and to ascertain if higher rates are warranted and what rate would be appropriate. If higher rates are introduced, they may benefit from being implemented after the expansion of coverage to prevent leakage to unlevied landfills, and may require accompanying incineration levies if the intention is to drive a reduction in waste generation. 88. The Group also supports revisiting the current approach to hypothecation of the Waste Disposal Levy, especially if there are significant increases in funds raised, to ensure they are being used in the most effective way to move towards a more circular economy. 71 Future of Tax Interim Report Road transport Evaluation against the framework 89. Road transport generates a number of different negative externalities. These include road damage, congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, noise, surface pollution, and injuries and death. Some of these externalities better meet the criteria for negative externality taxes than others, but there is generally a good fit. 90. There are already a number of tax instruments which address some road transport externalities. For example, the ETS prices greenhouse gas emissions, and petrol and registration levies fund costs relating to injuries and death. Some other externalities have historically been more difficult to price because of measurement and pricing challenges. Measurement and pricing 91. Congestion is likely to be the largest unpriced externality in road transport. Local air pollution, surface pollution and noise are also unpriced. These externalities are highly specific to time, place, and type of vehicle. This has historically created measurement and pricing challenges. 92. There are now a range of technical solutions to make measuring and charging for these externalities feasible. For example, an enhanced road user charging system that captures information on location, time, type of vehicle and load could allow for more refined pricing of a broad range of externalities. Equity 93. Several submitters raised equity concerns with transport pricing, especially with regards to the impact of fuel taxes on low income households. It is difficult to generalise about the impact of transport taxes. It will be important to assess the distributional impacts of specific proposals, and equity constraints could mean that pricing is used to signal some types of externalities, rather than accurately price them. 36 Estimated revenues in FY2017-18 from petroleum, minerals, coal and ironsands royalties, as well as energy resource levies on coal and gas - https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/ise/budget-2018-data-estimates-appropriations-2018-19. The Government collects additional revenue from mining operations from corporate income tax. Assessment 94. The Government and Auckland Council are currently working on the Congestion Question project (formerly known as the Auckland Smarter Transport Pricing Project) to investigate whether or not to introduce congestion pricing in Auckland. The Government’s Urban Growth Agenda is also scoped to review the future of the transport revenue system. The Group supports these reviews as an opportunity to better align road transport charges with externalities. Petroleum and minerals 95. New Zealand has royalty regimes for taxing minerals and petroleum mining. These royalty regimes were reviewed in 2012 against the principles outlined in Box 9.2, with various changes being implemented as a result of those reviews (MBIE 2012). 96. The fiscal impact of any further changes to the petroleum and minerals royalty regimes could be relatively small. Royalties from petroleum and minerals mining were approximately $200 million in 2017-18, or 0.2% of core Crown revenue. 36 The Group was informed that in the absence of any new discoveries, revenues are forecast to decline in the coming years, reflecting declining petroleum production volumes, and the decision not to grant further exploration permits for offshore petroleum mining. 97. The Group is not considering further changes to these royalty regimes. Distributional impacts and equity considerations 98. Environmental taxes can increase the cost of essential goods, such as energy, food and transport. Low income households tend to spend a larger a share of their income on these goods than higher income households, and environmental taxes are therefore often assumed to be regressive (Kosonen 2012). 72 Future of Tax Interim Report 99. The actual incidence of environmental taxes will be highly dependent on a number of factors, including the consumption patterns of the taxed item, the availability of substitutes, and the extent to which additional costs can be passed on to the final consumer. If the revenue is recycled to assist affected parties transition to more sustainable practices, the impact is even less clear. 100. Insofar as taxes are successful in remediating environmental issues, the environmental impacts might also be progressive – lower income people can be disproportionately impacted by the degradation of the environment and ecosystem services. 101. The Group has not made detailed evaluations of these distributional issues for the pollutants and resources discussed above. However, the Group does not consider that potentially regressive impacts of environmental taxes is a sufficient reason in itself not to proceed with the approaches discussed in this chapter. Rather, the Government should be alert to potentially regressive impacts and seek to mitigate them as appropriate. Chapter 13 on Personal income outlines a number of options for increasing the progressivity of the income tax, which could also be used to offset any regressive impacts arising from the introduction of environmental taxes. 102. The Group is also mindful of the particular impacts that environmental taxes can have on Māori, and has included addressing Māori rights and interests as a key design principle for environmental tax instruments. Submissions to the Group by Māori organisations highlighted a range of viewpoints and concerns. Summary of options for the short-to- medium term 103. Table 9.2 below summarises the performance of the five resources and pollutants the Group wishes to highlight against the negative externality framework.

Priority issue 73 Future of Tax Interim Report Longer-term possibilities: an environmental footprint tax 104. There are significant environmental challenges in New Zealand that our frameworks suggests are currently less well suited to environmental taxes. These tend to be environmental problems where activities driving environmental change are more challenging to measure, and therefore less well suited to the use of tax instruments. For example, biodiversity loss, and impacts on ecosystem services. 105. The Group received several submissions highlighting new approaches that could be developed to address some of these challenges. For example, an environmental footprint tax is a form of land tax, set according to the intensity of land use and consequent impact on the environment. 106. Discussions with submitters highlighted that significant further work is likely needed to better validate approaches like this, calibrate prices with externalities, and work through integration of other environmental taxes. Nonetheless, the environmental footprint tax is one example of the potential for new environmental tax instruments in the longer term. Tax concessions Care of the land 107. Several submitters suggested that costs associated with the care of land subject to a QEII covenant should be treated as deductible expenses. The submitters argued that deductibility would support the purpose of the QEII covenant regime, as well as reduce compliance and administration costs. The Group agrees with this suggestion. The Group also recommends that privately incurred costs associated with the care of Ngā Whenua Rāhui should also be tax deductible. Agricultural concessions 108. The Group is aware of a number of existing tax concessions for agriculture in the Income Tax Act. Where a tax concession is shown to be degrading natural capital, there may be grounds for its removal. In these instances, there may be a case for Government support to manage the transition. There may also be a case to consider incentives for activities that generate environmental benefits. 109. The Group will explore these issues further in the Final Report. Car parking and public transport 110. The Group has also considered the treatment of car parks and public transport. At the moment, the provision of free car parking to employees is not subject to fringe benefit tax. Yet any contributions made to an employee’s public transport costs are taxed. This treatment has the perverse impact of discouraging the use of public transport. 111. The Group acknowledges the practical difficulties involved in applying fringe benefit tax to employee car parks. In recognition of this constraint, the Group suggests that the Government examine the possibility of allowing employers to subsidise public transport use by employees without incurring fringe benefit tax. Revenue recycling 112. The Group considers there is a strong case to recycle some or all of the revenue from environmental taxation into measures that support the transition to a more sustainable economy. The Group is considering whether support should extend to those impacted by changes to existing tax settings where current settings are found to be negatively impacting on natural capital. 74 Future of Tax Interim Report 113. Recycling environmental tax revenue has several benefits. It can reinforce the purpose of the tax by funding complementary activities, as is done with the Waste Disposal Levy which is used to fund waste minimization projects. It can address equity concerns arising from the uneven incidence of the tax. It can also support fiscal transparency, demonstrating that the tax is being introduced for environmental reasons, and not to raise money for general government expenditure. Summary 9.1 There is scope for tax instruments to play a greater role in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes in New Zealand. Environmental tax instruments can be a powerful tool for ensuring people and companies better understand and account for the impact of their actions on the ecosystems on which they depend. 9.2 Taxes are not well suited to all environmental problems and regulation will still be a better approach for dealing with some issues. Our draft framework identifies a range of criteria and design principles for environmental taxes to be effective. Environmental taxation and regulation should be considered together for positive outcomes. 9.3 In the short term, there may be benefits in expanding the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy, and for reassessing waste and landfill disposal externalities to see if higher rates are warranted. There could also be benefits from strengthening the ETS and advancing congestion charging. Over the medium term, there could be benefits from greater use of tax instruments to address challenges in both water pollution and water abstraction. Addressing Māori rights and interests in fresh water should be central to any changes. In the longer term, new tools could allow for an expanded role for environmental taxes to address other challenges such as biodiversity loss and impacts on ecosystem services. 75 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Corrective taxes are taxes that are primarily intended to change behaviour that is judged to be undesirable and/or to ensure individuals take into account the costs of their behaviour. They can therefore be contrasted with revenue taxes which are primarily intended to raise revenue with the least impact on taxpayer behaviour (and accordingly minimise deadweight costs or the economic cost of raising the tax). 2. If policymakers wish to stop undesirable behaviour, then a ban on the behaviour is likely to achieve their objectives faster, and with greater certainty, than a tax. This is because individuals may be willing to pay a corrective tax in order to continue to behave in the same undesirable way, or switch to a different type of behaviour that is just as undesirable. However, a ban may be impractical to enforce, in which case a tax, or another instrument, might provide a second-best policy solution. 3. Suitable policy responses to limit undesirable behaviour or to ensure that individuals face the full costs of their behaviour might be to regulate directly (for example to ban smoking where third parties are affected), impose tax, or provide better information. The relative effectiveness of each option will depend on: • how individuals respond to each option; • whether policymakers have information on how individuals respond; and • whether policymakers can tailor each option to individuals’ responses. 37 The Government also applies the Health Promotion Agency levy on alcohol. This levy raised $12 million in 2017. Revenue from the levy is hypothecated to fund the Health Promotion Agency. 4. Chapter 9 focused on corrective taxes as a means to address negative environmental externalities. This chapter deals with non- environmental corrective taxes. It focuses on alcohol, tobacco and sugar taxes – which are the most widely applied types of corrective taxes, and were also the subject of most public submissions on corrective taxes. Alcohol 5. The main tax on alcohol in New Zealand is alcohol excise. 37 Alcohol excise is levied on alcohol that is manufactured in or imported into New Zealand; it raised $1 billion in 2017. The rates of alcohol excise vary by product type and alcohol volume. Some rates are applied on a per litre basis, while other rates are applied on a per litre of alcohol basis. Table 10.1 shows the rates for beer and certain wines and spirits. 6. The complex rates structure means there is considerable variation in the effective rate of excise per litre of alcohol. Figure 10.1 illustrates the effective rates for beer and certain wines and spirits at different alcohol volumes. 7. The duty-free concession represents one notable exemption from alcohol excise. The concession allows travellers to bring up to 4.5 litres of wine and beer and three bottles of spirits into New Zealand free of excise, provided they are for personal use or gifts. 10 Corrective taxes 76 Future of Tax Interim Report Assessment 8. The appropriate rates of alcohol excise will depend on an assessment of the health effects of alcohol consumption, and of the externalities associated with alcohol abuse. Accordingly, the Group believes the rates would be best decided with appropriate input from the public health community. 9. It is evident, though, that the current rate structure is unnecessarily complex. It is difficult to understand why the rates of excise per litre of alcohol should vary so much across different products. A case could be made for applying a consistent rate per litre of alcohol across all products – which would increase rates for some products and decrease them for others – but little can be said in favour of the current approach. The Group recommends that the Government review the rate structure with the intention of rationalising and simplifying it.

Tobacco excise is levied on tobacco manufactured in or imported into New Zealand. Tobacco excise rates have increased by 10% above inflation each year since 2010, and are scheduled to increase by 10% above inflation each year until 2020. The excise raised almost $1.7 billion in 2017 – an increase of over 50% since 2010. 11. The duty-free concession allows travellers to bring up to 50 cigarettes or 50 grams of cigars or tobacco products into New Zealand free of excise, provided they are for personal use or gifts. 38 Assessment 12. As with alcohol excise, the appropriate rates of tobacco excise will depend on an assessment of the health effects of tobacco consumption, and of the externalities associated with tobacco use. A full assessment of these issues is beyond the expertise of the Group. 13. Nevertheless, the Group is concerned about further large increases to the excise rates. There are three main reasons for sounding this caution: • Tobacco excise is regressive. There is a substantially higher prevalence of smoking in the poorest areas of our country (New Zealand Health Survey 2016/17). Although increases in the rates of excise may encourage some individuals to cease smoking, the heaviest burden of the excise increases will be borne by low income earners who continue to smoke. 38 The duty-free concession was sharply reduced from 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 250 grams of tobacco products in 2014. 39 See, for example, comments by the New Zealand Association of Convenience Stores at https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/ new-zealand/dairy-industry-head-says-tobacco-tax-increases-making-smokes-more-and-sought-after-thieves 40 Other countries have also introduced taxes on fatty foods. For example, Denmark introduced a tax on food high in saturated fat in 2011, but this was repealed in 2012 due to concerns over complexity and avoidance (Berridge and Marriott, 2017). • The effectiveness of excise increases appears to be reducing. Regulatory impact analysis prepared by the Treasury in 2016 indicates that reductions in smoking prevalence are expected to be quite small relative to the size of the increases in the excise rates (Treasury 2016). • High taxes on tobacco appear to be a factor in an increasing number of robberies and criminal activity. 39 14. The Group believes the Government should therefore prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking (such as educational campaigns and regulatory measures) before considering further large increases in tobacco excise rates. Some of the revenue from tobacco excise could also be directed towards smoking cessation programmes. Sugar taxes 15. Several countries tax sugared products. In recent years, taxes on sugary drinks have become increasingly common. Table 10.2 below lists some examples. 16. Some countries also tax sugary foods. For example, in 2011, Hungary introduced a tax on certain foods deemed to be unhealthy, including sweets, biscuits, and bakery items (Berridge and Marriott, 2017). 40 Table 10.2: Sugary drinks taxes in selected countries and cities FranceSugar-sweetened beverage tax introduced in 2013. Rate of €7.53 per hectolitre. IrelandSugar-sweetened drinks tax introduced in 2018. Rates of €16.26 per hectolitre for lower sugar drinks and €24.39 per hectolitre for higher sugar drinks.

Rate of 1 cent per ounce. 78 Future of Tax Interim Report 17. The Group has received many submissions calling for the introduction of sugar taxes in New Zealand. Assessment 18. The case for the introduction of a sugar tax (or a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages) must rest on a clear view of the goals the Government is seeking to achieve, and the effectiveness of taxation as a means to achieve those goals. 19. A report by NZIER has identified the five steps that must be achieved in order for a sugar tax to be effective: 1. Imposing a tax must increase the price of the targeted item. 2. The increase in price must lead to a reduction in consumption of the item. 3. Reducing consumption of the item must lead to a reduction in sugar and/or energy intake. 4. Lower energy intake must result in lower physiological risk factors. 5. Lower physiological risk factors must improve health outcomes. (Wilson and Hogan 2017) 20. When considering these five steps, the Group felt that a major risk with a sugar tax is that it will encourage consumers to switch to cheaper or untaxed products that are similarly unhealthy. So, while a sugar tax will reduce the consumption of some sugar products, the extent to which it generates any improvement in health outcomes will depend on what individuals decide to consume instead. 21. The Group feels this is an area that would benefit from a clear articulation of the Government’s goals: • If the Government wishes to reduce the consumption of sugar across the board, then a sugar tax is more likely to be an effective response. • If the Government wishes to reduce the sugar content of particular products, on the other hand, then regulation is more likely to be more effective. 22. Once these goals have been clearly articulated, the Government should also consider whether there is a role for other policy responses, such as education. Gambling taxes 23. A number of taxes currently apply to gambling, including totalisator duty, lottery duty, gaming machine duty, casino duty and the problem gambling levy. The Group is not aware of these taxes having been reviewed recently, and has not seen a statement of their purpose. The Group feels this is another area that could benefit from a clearer statement of the Government’s goals, and a clearer view of the role of taxation relative to other measures such as regulation and education. Summary The Group: 10.1 Recommends that the Government review the rate structure of alcohol excise with the intention of rationalising and simplifying it. 10.2 Recommends that the Government prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate. 10.3 Recommends that the Government develop a clearer articulation of its goals with regard to sugar consumption and gambling activity. 79 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. The Group has received many submissions about international taxation, and the tax practices of multinational companies and digital firms. It is clear from the submissions that many people feel a deep sense of unfairness about the way in which the tax system deals with these firms. This is a worrying phenomenon: perceptions of unfairness have the potential to erode public support for the tax system as a whole. 2. Many submitters commented on the international tax reforms related to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) agenda. The Group acknowledges these submissions, but notes that the Terms of Reference rule out detailed consideration of matters relating to the BEPS agenda, which is currently on the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme. 3. The Group’s discussions have focussed instead on issues related to the taxation of cross border revenues from digital services, where some of the sharpest concerns about the taxation of multinational companies have arisen. It is currently an area of significant international attention – and significant international dispute. 4. The value of cross-border digital services provided into New Zealand is estimated to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2018, and this market is expected to continue growing. 41 41 MBIE (2017) estimates that the New Zealand market for cross-border digital services had a value of $0.5 billion in 2015. Shopify (2018) estimates the global business-to-business online market to be 234% of the business to consumer market. Applying the Shopify assumption to the MBIE estimate gives a total market size for cross-border digital services provided into New Zealand of $1.67 billion in 2015 (and $15.7 billion for all online goods and services). MBIE (2017) also assumes that the market for cross-border services is increasing by 18% per annum. Assuming this growth over the three years to 2018, the market size for cross-border digital services is estimated to be $2.74 billion in 2018. The current approach to international income taxation 5. New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents on their New Zealand sales income is determined by our domestic tax rules, in conjunction with the double tax agreements that we sign with other countries. 6. Double tax agreements override domestic rules, and New Zealand cannot change its double tax agreements without the consent of the other countries that are party to those agreements. 7. Double tax agreements allow New Zealand to tax non-residents on their business income from New Zealand under two conditions: if a non- resident has a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand; and to the extent that their business income is attributable to that presence. 8. A taxable presence will arise if a non-resident carries on their business through a ‘permanent establishment’ in New Zealand. The definition of a permanent establishment requires the non-resident to be either physically present in New Zealand, or to have certain relationships with agents who are carrying on important parts of their business here. 11 International income tax 80 Future of Tax Interim Report 9. It is also necessary to determine how much business income can be attributed to the permanent establishment in New Zealand. This requires an assessment of the value contributed in New Zealand to the non-resident’s total income, compared to the value contributed overseas. The attribution of income ensures the taxing rights over a company’s income are shared fairly between all of the countries in which the company operates. 10. Double tax agreements ensure that New Zealand businesses that make sales outside New Zealand are not exposed to double taxation. They also provide mechanisms, such as the exchange of information, that allow for the better enforcement of tax laws on inter- jurisdictional transactions. 11. New Zealand businesses and Inland Revenue benefit from operating within this international rules-based framework. Although the rules constrain our policy choices to some extent, New Zealand benefits overall from having and operating within this framework, as long as we can ensure the constraints are acceptable. Challenges to the current approach 12. While they have worked quite well for trade in physical goods and services, they may not give a fair or sustainable tax outcome when applied to modern digital services that are supplied across borders. 13. The main issue is that the current rules largely allocate income on the basis of labour and capital employed in a jurisdiction. If a firm generates significant income from a jurisdiction but has little physical presence in that jurisdiction, it will have little or no labour or capital – and little or no income – allocated to that jurisdiction. With the increasing importance of intellectual property, the rules may be seen as increasingly not reflecting the economic reality of where income is actually generated. 42 The challenges associated with intangible assets are a broader issue, and not just limited to digital companies. 14. Within this context, there are three main challenges to the existing framework: • ‘Scale without mass’. Digital companies can transact with customers over the internet without having the physical presence required by double tax agreements for income tax to be charged in the country. This allows digital companies to derive significant income from a country without paying local income tax, and provides them with an advantage over their domestic competitors. It also threatens the sustainability of the tax base, and reduces public perceptions of the fairness of the tax system. • User value creation. Even if a non-resident digital company does have a permanent establishment in a country, the profit attribution rules do not recognise the new kinds of value that are generated by digital companies in the countries in which they operate. These companies derive significant value from the active participation of their users, from data generated by the users, and from network effects. None of this value is recognised by the current profit attribution rules. • Intangible assets. Much of the value of digital companies can be attributed to intangible assets. These intangibles are hard to value. They are also mobile, meaning the income attributable to them can be easily moved to low tax jurisdictions. 42 15. These three issues affect the provision of both goods and services. However, they are most pressing with regard to the provision of digital services with significant user value creation in New Zealand, since New Zealand is a net importer of these types of services. New Zealand is an exporter of other types of goods and services, so New Zealand exporters benefit from the current international framework. For this reason the Group has focused solely on the treatment of digital services involving user value creation. However we recognise that the problem is wider and recommend that New Zealand authorities should continue to seek ways to resolve both the digital and the broader issues. 81 Future of Tax Interim Report 16. It is also important to recognise that these tax issues relate to income tax, rather than GST. GST has been applied to all ‘remote’ services since 2016 – including digital services involving user value creation – and the Government is currently finalising its preferred approach for collecting GST on low-value imported goods. Potential responses 17. There are two broad ways to address the income tax challenges associated with digital services involving user value creation. One option is to change the current international income tax framework, for example by expanding the definition of a permanent establishment and amending the profit attribution rules. The other option is to apply a separate tax to certain digital supplies. 18. The OECD is providing a forum for international discussion of the issues through its Inclusive Framework process. A common multilateral approach, involving the amendment of the international income tax framework, would be best for a small country such as New Zealand. At the time of writing, however, there is disagreement between countries about the best way forward. Countries have committed to reaching a consensus on solutions by 2020, but achieving consensus will be challenging. 19. In the meantime, the European Commission and the UK have announced their support for an ‘equalisation tax’ as an interim measure. The EU Commission is proposing to levy a new 3% tax on gross revenues from certain digital services where local users play a major role in value creation. These services are the hardest to capture with current tax rules. The equalisation tax is arguably a very rough proxy for income tax on the presumed net profit margin derived by the supplier from the cross-border digital service. The tax would not apply to the supply of goods or services more generally, and would be removed if agreement on a more principled multilateral solution was reached at the OECD. 20. An equalisation tax would be a way to collect some tax from some digital companies that have been paying little tax in New Zealand or overseas. It would also help to signal the increasing urgency of the problem, and New Zealand’s determination to find a solution. However, there are risks associated with the introduction of an equalisation tax. New Zealand would need to assess whether such a tax was consistent with our international trade obligations. In the current global political environment, we would also need to assess the risk of retaliation by other countries (resulting in additional foreign taxes being imposed on New Zealand’s export sector), and whether those risks could be mitigated. 21. To mitigate the trade risks, and be consistent with other countries, an equalisation tax in New Zealand would need to be narrowly focussed on digital services that involve active user contribution and value creation in New Zealand. It would not apply to goods and services more broadly, as these would remain subject to the current international tax framework. 22. The other matter to consider is whether an equalisation tax will actually be paid out of the profits made from New Zealand by the digital suppliers, or whether the additional cost will be passed on to New Zealand consumers through higher prices for the digital services. The sense of unfairness from New Zealanders around the taxation of cross border digital revenues will not be addressed if the result of the equalisation tax is, in effect, the collection of more tax from New Zealand consumers. 23. The issues with taxing digital services also apply to sharing platforms, such as Uber and Airbnb. New Zealanders benefit from these platforms and, like the digital economy, they represent an opportunity for New Zealand (including the opportunity to develop new technologies that enhance natural capital). This chapter has focussed on the issues associated with taxing the sharing platforms themselves; Chapter 15 discusses the issues associated with taxing the New Zealand tax residents who use sharing platforms. 82 Future of Tax Interim Report Assessment 24. New Zealand is very well-represented at the OECD, and the Group agrees strongly that New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD’s Inclusive Framework process. 25. Nevertheless, while international agreement is desirable, New Zealand should also be ready to act in its own best interests. Alongside participation in the Inclusive Framework process, the Government should ensure it is also ready to implement an equalisation tax, if the case for such a tax arises. 26. The introduction of an equalisation tax should depend on three key conditions: • A critical mass of other countries also adopting an equalisation tax. (The actions of Australia will be particularly important for New Zealand.) • New Zealand companies not being unduly affected by the tax. • The tax not simply being passed on to New Zealand consumers. 27. The desirability of moving in this direction will depend on international developments in the next six to twelve months. New Zealand will need to actively monitor these developments to determine the best way forward. 28. New Zealand should also ensure – to the extent possible – that our double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict our taxation options in these matters, and that future agreements are free of any existing restrictions on the use of effective options. Summary The Group: 11.1 Supports New Zealand’s continued participation in OECD discussions on the future of the international tax framework. 11.2 Recommends that the Government be ready to implement an equalisation tax if a critical mass of other countries (including Australia) move in that direction. 11.3 Recommends that the Government ensure, to the extent possible, that our double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict our taxation options in these matters. 83 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. GST is a broad-based tax on consumption in New Zealand. GST is imposed at a single rate of 15% across a broad base of goods and services, with few exceptions. 43 The design of GST aims to raise revenue efficiently by taxing all goods and services equally, so that it does not affect consumer decisions regarding which goods and services to purchase. 2. GST was introduced in 1986 as part of wide- ranging tax reform. Tax revenue at the time relied heavily on income tax, which featured rates of up to 66%, as well as many rebates and reductions. The introduction of GST formed part of a series of measures to broaden the tax base. GST allowed for the removal of inefficient sales taxes, and for reductions in income tax rates; it reduced the tax system’s reliance on revenue from income taxes. The role of GST in the tax system 3. GST has proved to be a stable and efficient tax base. There have been no significant fluctuations in GST revenue since introduction, and the rules themselves have remained consistent (although there have been two increases to the rate of GST). 43 The main exceptions are residential accommodation and financial services. 44 GST appears less regressive when compared against lifetime income. Income generally rises as a person ages (up to a point), so GST will represent a greater share of a person’s income when they are younger (and earning less), but a lower share of their income when they are older (and earning more). Retired people generally consume more than their income, and thus will pay more GST as a share of their income. From a lifetime perspective, the most recent research describe the impact of GST as ‘either proportional or at worst slightly regressive’ (Thomas 2015). 45 GST also applies to non-residents who consume goods and services while visiting New Zealand. As a result it applies a tax to non-residents who may otherwise not pay any New Zealand taxes. 4. There are two main reasons why GST is such an efficient source of revenue: • As a consumption tax, GST is a way of raising significant amounts of revenue without the saving and investment biases that arise from income taxation. • GST has a broad base. In fact, New Zealand has one of the broadest GST bases among OECD countries. This allows New Zealand to raise large amounts of revenue from GST, even though the rate of the tax is not particularly high relative to other countries. The broad base of New Zealand’s GST is one of its greatest strengths. 5. GST appears regressive when compared against current income. Lower-income households generally have lower saving rates than higher-income households. This means lower-income households will consume a greater proportion of their current income and, therefore, face a greater cost from GST. Higher- income households have higher saving rates, and consume less in the current period as a proportion of their income. 44 45 12 GST and financial transaction taxes 84 Future of Tax Interim Report Figure 12.1: Valued added taxes as a percentage of GDP, 2015 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 New Zealand Hungary Denmark Sweden Finland Portugal Iceland N or way Austria Greece Czech Republic Poland Germany France United Kingdom Slovak Republic OECD - Average Belgium Netherlands Luxembourg Spai n Italy Turkey Ireland Canada Japan Mexico Korea Australia Switzerland Percent VAT revenue as a percentage of GDPVAT rates Source: OECD 46 These estimates are preliminary and presented for indicative purposes only. The appropriate rate of GST 6. The Terms of Reference exclude consideration of an increase in the GST rate, but the Group has received many public submissions arguing for a reduction of the GST rate. Most submitters have argued that GST places a heavy burden on low-income earners, and that a reduction in the GST rate would increase the progressivity of the tax system. Policy considerations 7. For the purposes of policy analysis, the Group has considered the implications of a reduction in the GST rate from 15% to 13.5%. This would reduce revenue by approximately $2 billion per annum. 8. Given the substantial loss in revenue, a key judgement is therefore whether a GST reduction represents the most effective way to address distributional concerns, relative to other potential uses of the revenue. Distributional impacts 9. By any measure, a reduction in the rate of GST will deliver a greater dollar benefit for higher- income households. Figure 12.2 shows that the greatest benefits in dollar terms, by far, will accrue to households in the highest income decile. 10. Figures 12.3 and 12.4 compare the benefits of decreasing the GST rate to 13.5% against two illustrative changes to the personal tax scale that have the same fiscal cost of $2 billion per year and are targeted towards lower income households: • The introduction of a tax-free threshold of $7,000. (Tax currently applies to the first dollar of income.) • A reduction of the first marginal tax rate from 10.5% to 5.25%. 46 11. Figure 12.3 shows the benefits in dollar terms, and Figure 12.4 shows the benefit in terms of percentages of gross income. 85 Future of Tax Interim Report Figure 12.2: Average annual benefit for households of decreasing the GST rate to 13.5% $550 $500 $600 $750 $850 $950$950 $1,100 $1,200 $2,050 $0 $500 $1,000 $1,500 $2,000 $2,500 Decile 1Decile 2Decile 3Decile 4Decile 5Decile 6Decile 7Decile 8Decile 9Decile 10 Average annual benefit Decile of equivalised disposable household income Source: Statistics NZ (HES 2015/16) with subsequent TWG Secretariat calculations.

Estimated using Treasury’s micro-simulation model of the tax and welfare system. 47 The greater impact on decile 1 households arises from the fact that these households have high consumption relative to reported income (perhaps because they are receiving income that is not captured in survey data, such as help from their families or because they are borrowing to pay for their living costs). For this reason, outcomes for decile 2 households are likely to give a better indication of the impacts for very low income households (Perry 2017). 12. As a percentage of income, when compared with these income tax changes, reducing the GST rate to 13.5% will provide: • Greater benefits to households in the lowest income decile. 47 • Less benefits for households in deciles 2-9. • Significantly greater benefits to households in the highest income decile. 13. The distributional benefits of reducing the GST rate are not particularly compelling, compared to the redistribution that is possible at a similar cost by reducing the lowest income tax rate, or by introducing an income tax free threshold. GST and wealth inequality 14. A GST rate reduction is also a poorly-targeted measure if there are policy concerns about wealth inequality. This is because a reduction in the GST rate will provide a windfall gain in real value to those with existing wealth on the day the rate is reduced. Interactions with the transfer system 15. All else equal, a reduction in the rate of GST will produce a one-off decrease in the inflation rate. Some welfare benefits are indexed to inflation, and so those benefits will increase less than would otherwise be the case following the change to GST. Assessment 16. The Group does not recommend a reduction in the GST rate. However, the Group does recognise there is considerable public concern regarding the regressive nature of GST. In recommending against a reduction in GST, the Group’s purpose is not to deny these concerns, but rather to point out there are more effective ways to address the issue. A GST rate reduction would have a high fiscal cost and is poorly targeted towards low and middle income households. • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low income households, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers. 87 Future of Tax Interim Report • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low to middle income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, then changes to make personal income taxes more progressive may be a better option. 17. The personal income tax system is explored further in Chapter 13 on Personal income and the future of work. Exceptions to GST 18. The Group has received a large number of submissions arguing for various exceptions to the GST base. Some submitters have argued for exceptions in order to promote certain outcomes (such as encouraging the purchase of healthier food and drink). Other submitters are concerned about the distributional impact of GST, and have argued for exceptions on certain household items that are more likely to be purchased by low-income households. Policy considerations 19. As a practical way of understanding the trade- offs involved in GST exceptions, the Group has assessed the implications of removing GST from food and drink (excluding alcoholic beverages). 48 This estimate is based on static impacts. It does not account for any behavioural change arising from the removal of GST on food and drink. The estimate also assumes that all of the benefits pass through to consumers. This outcome may not arise in practice. 20. Expenditure patterns differ across income bands. Expenditure on food and drink represents approximately 19% of the average weekly household expenditure of a household in decile 2, versus only 14% of the average weekly household expenditure of a household in the highest income decile. As Figure 12.5 illustrates, removing GST from food and drink will have a proportionally greater impact on lower income households. 21. Yet higher income households will derive a greater dollar benefit from the removal of GST on food and drink. (Higher income households spend more money on food and drink overall, even though this expenditure represents a smaller proportion of their total income.) The Group estimates that the removal of GST on food and drink will benefit a household in the highest income decile by $53.03 per week, whereas a household in the second lowest income decile will benefit by $14.35 per week. 48 22. The key judgement, then, is whether GST exceptions represent the most efficient means to achieve society’s distributional goals, relative to other measures such as income tax progressivity or direct welfare transfers. Box 12.1: Windfall wealth gains from GST reductions Take a person who has $1,150 in savings. If the average price of a good is $11.50 (including $1.50 of GST), then this person’s savings can buy 100 average goods. If GST is reduced from 15% to 10%, and the GST exclusive price of the good remains the same, the average price of a good will be $11 (including GST), and the person will be able to acquire 104 of these goods with their $1,150 of savings. The reduction in GST provides the person with a windfall gain through an increase in the purchasing power of their existing savings. 88 Future of Tax Interim Report Figure 12.5: Expenditure on food and drink by households, 2015/16 49 20% 19% 18% 18% 19% 18% 18% 17% 17% 14% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% Decile 1Decile 2Decile 3Decile 4Decile 5Decile 6Decile 7Decile 8Decile 9Decile 10 Percent Decile of household income (unequivalised) Source: Statistics NZ (HES 2015/16) with subsequent TWG Secretariat calculations.

There are good reasons to believe that GST exceptions are an inefficient means to achieve distributional goals: • The revenue foregone from GST exceptions could be used instead to fund more targeted support for low income households. For example, the Group estimates that an exception for food and drink will reduce GST revenue by $2.6 billion. If the Government had the same amount of money to spend on redistribution, it could fund a cash transfer to each household of $28.85 per week – doubling the cash benefit to households in the second lowest income decile. A more targeted transfer would provide even greater benefits to low income households at the same fiscal cost. 50 • Providing exceptions through the GST system generally leads to complex and arbitrary boundaries. Boundaries create compliance costs, as businesses must identify and then separate out the products on which GST has been removed. • If GST has been removed from one good or service, it becomes difficult to argue against further exceptions on similar grounds. Increasing numbers of exceptions will erode the GST base and require tax increases elsewhere to make up the lost revenue. Assessment 24. The Group’s judgement is that GST exceptions are a poorly-targeted mechanism to achieve distributional goals. GST exceptions are also complex and generate large compliance and administration costs. Other measures, such as welfare transfers, are likely to have greater benefits for the same fiscal cost. 25. Chapter 10 on Corrective Taxes also explores further the merits of using the tax system to incentivise behavioural change. 50 Studies that concur with this general finding include Ball et. al. (2014), Mirrlees et al. (2011) and OECD (2014). 51 Financial services to consumers are exempt from GST (i.e. they are input taxed). Financial institutions cannot claim GST back on inputs attributable to services to consumers (such as rent, advertising, computers or contractors). Financial services to businesses are zero-rated (i.e. they are GST-free). Zero-rating ensures that GST does not become a cost to business. Input taxing financial services to businesses could otherwise result in tax cascades, where GST is applied multiple times during the production process. 52 An interest rate margin is the difference between the interest rate charged to a borrower and the interest rate paid to a depositor. The GST treatment of financial services 26. Financial services are exempt from GST. 51 In principle, GST should apply to financial services, because they are services consumed in New Zealand. The reason for the exemption is a practical one: it is difficult to value these services, given that most financial institutions charge through interest rate margins, rather than fees. 52 Policy considerations 27. The exemption of financial services is problematic. Financial services are under-taxed relative to other services, which is both unfair and subsidises the consumption of financial services. The boundary between exempt and non-exempt services is complex to administer and comply with. 28. The exemption also reduces revenue. The Australian Treasury estimates that Australia’s GST exemption for financial services resulted in a loss of revenue of $3.2 billion for the 2016/17 financial year. This represented approximately 5.1% of Australia’s total GST revenue in that year (The Australian Government, The Treasury 2018). 29. In terms of distributional impacts, the existing exemption benefits households that consume financial services, but the incidence of the benefits is unclear. Financial assets and liabilities are mostly held by high-income households, but financial institutions may earn higher margins on financial services to lower income households. Consequently, it is difficult to ascertain whether the exemption primarily benefits higher- or lower- income households. 90 Future of Tax Interim Report 30. The arguments in favour of applying GST to financial services are clear. The main challenge is whether there is a feasible means of doing so. The Group has considered a number options for addressing the issue: • The cash flow method – which would require GST-registered businesses (including financial institutions) to charge GST on all cash they received for financial services, and claim input credits for all cash they paid out for financial services. These cash flows would include the interest payments as well as principal and repayments of principal. • The margin method – which would require GST-registered businesses (including financial institutions) to calculate the financial margin for every financial transaction, and then apply GST to this margin. • A financial activities tax – which would tax financial institutions on the sum of their cash flow profit and wages. (This is a proxy for the application of GST). • An apportioned financial activities tax – which would tax financial institutions on the sum of their cash flow profit and wages, with the sum apportioned so that only the profit and wages attributable to consumer services was taxed. (This option is another proxy for the application of GST.) 31. All of these methods involve trade-offs. A financial activities tax is relatively simple to implement, but will impose significant efficiency and productivity costs. This is because it creates ‘tax cascades’ in which additional tax is imposed at each stage of the production process. 32. The other three options avoid tax cascades, but will be difficult to implement, administer and comply with. The Group is not aware of any other country that has successfully introduced these options. Even if these taxes were successfully implemented, there is a risk that some financial activity would simply relocate offshore in order to avoid the tax. 53 53 However, this risk can be over-stated. There have for a long time been incentives to move consumer financial activities offshore, for example to take advantage of international interest rate differentials much larger than those likely to be created by a financial services GST. 33. An alternative approach would be to apply GST to the explicit fees charged for financial services. (GST on fees could also serve as an interim measure allowing time to develop a more comprehensive approach to the GST treatment of financial services.) This policy has been adopted in other countries, such as South Africa. 34. There are, however, some significant problems with this approach. The main problem is the ease with which financial service providers could switch from applying explicit fees to implicit fees (for example, by reducing or eliminating explicit fees and instead charging or offering a slightly different interest rate to consumers). 35. The Group also notes the possible distributional impacts of imposing GST only on explicit fees. Financial service providers appear to be more likely to charge explicit fees when the service they are providing cannot be effectively compensated for using implicit fees. For example, a bank may charge set fees for specific services, while providing a rebate from those fees if the balance of an account is large enough. Applying GST only to explicit fees could mean that individuals with low bank balances will be the ones most likely to pay the tax. Assessment 36. The Group believes there is a strong in-principle case to apply GST to financial services, but there are no obviously feasible options for doing so. The Government should monitor international developments in this area. Financial transaction taxes 37. A financial transaction tax is a tax on the purchase, sale, or transfer of financial instruments. A financial transactions tax could be considered a tax on the consumption of financial services. 38. Many submitters have recommended the introduction of a financial transactions tax, on the basis that it would discourage speculative trading, improve financial stability, and generate revenue from the financial sector. 91 Future of Tax Interim Report Policy considerations 39. While some economic theory suggests that these taxes can improve market stability, most empirical evidence suggests that imposing additional transaction costs on financial markets either increases (or at least has no impact on) price volatility. In practice, financial transaction taxes appear to deter too much productive short- term trading to successfully achieve an outcome of reduced market volatility. 54 40. These taxes have been able to raise a reasonable amount of revenue in other countries. Yet the revenue potential of a financial transactions tax in New Zealand is likely to be limited, due to the ease with which the tax could be avoided by relocating activity to Australian financial markets. 55 Any relocation will also reduce the size of New Zealand’s capital markets. 41. There will be various distributional impacts from a financial transactions tax. Groups and sectors that regularly trade financial assets will pay a high share of the tax. Part of the cost will be borne by the owners, managers and employees of financial institutions, and part by the consumers of financial services. Savers will pay a particularly high share of the tax. Some of the cost may also be borne by New Zealand workers if the tax increases the cost of capital. Nevertheless, international research indicates that a financial transactions tax is likely to be progressive (Burman et al. 2016). Assessment 42. A financial transactions tax is an inefficient tax that is unlikely to raise significant revenue for New Zealand. The Group recognises that there is active international debate on such taxes, which should be monitored, but does not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax at this point. 54 Studies of the impact of financial transactions taxes include Baltagi et al. (2006), Colliard & Hoffmann (2017), Gomber et al. (2016), Pomeranets et al. (2013), Roll (1989), Umlauf (1993), and Liu & Zhu (2009). 55 The successful relocation of financial transactions could reduce the efficiency costs of the tax by allowing mutually beneficial trades to proceed – albeit in a different jurisdiction. Low-value imported goods 43. The Group was asked to consider options for the application of GST to low-value imported goods. 44. The Group agrees that, in principle, GST should be collected on low-value imported goods. The non-collection of GST results in competitive disadvantage and unfairness for domestic retailers, and results in an increasing amount of lost revenue for the Government. 45. The Group wrote to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue in February 2018 with the following recommendations for the treatment of low-value imported goods: • The Government should implement an offshore supplier registration model to collect GST on imported goods from suppliers who exceed the GST registration threshold. • The de minimis for collection of GST by Customs should be changed to a $400 threshold based on the good’s value but should not be increased beyond that point. • The Government should consult on the proposed offshore supplier registration model to ensure it is effective. • Options for collecting GST between the point of sale and delivery and for payment of GST after delivery should continue to be reviewed to see if the practical issues with them can be overcome and become an effective means of collecting GST on low-value goods, in particular from unregistered suppliers. 92 Future of Tax Interim Report 46. In May 2018, the Government began public consultation on the following approach to the treatment of low-value imported goods: • Offshore suppliers would be required to register, collect, and return New Zealand GST on goods valued at or below $400 supplied to New Zealand consumers. • The rules would apply when the good is outside New Zealand at the time of supply and is delivered to a New Zealand address. • Offshore suppliers would be required to register when their total supplies of goods and services to New Zealand exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. In certain circumstances, marketplaces and re-deliverers may also be required to register. • Tariffs and border cost recovery charges would be removed from goods valued at or below $400. • The current processes for collecting GST and other duty at the border by Customs will continue to apply for goods valued over $400. • The current border processes for managing risks in relation to imported goods, including biosecurity assessment, will remain in place. 47. Consultation closed in June 2018 and final policy consideration is currently underway. The Group understands that the Government intends to implement the new regime from 1 October 2019. Summary The Group: 12.1 Recognises the significant public concern regarding GST, but does not recommend a reduction in the rate of GST. This is because lowering the GST rate would not be as effective at targeting low- and middle-income families as either: • welfare transfers (for low income households); or • personal income tax changes (for low and middle income earners). 12.2 Does not recommend the removal of GST from certain products, such as food an drink, on the basis that the GST exceptions are complex, poorly targeted for achieving distributional goals, and generate large compliance costs. 12.3 Believes there is a strong in-principle case to apply GST to financial services, but there are significant impediments to a workable system. The Government should monitor international developments in this area. 12.4 Does not recommend the application of GST to explicit fees charged for financial services. 12.5 Recognises that there is active international debate on financial transaction taxes, which should be monitored, but does not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax at this point. The Group has already reported to Ministers on the issue of GST on low-value imported goods, and the Government is advancing that work. 93 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Personal income tax is the largest source of revenue for the Government. It is also – alongside GST – the primary way in which most New Zealanders interact with the tax system. The fairness and integrity of the income tax regime therefore bears directly on New Zealanders’ views of the fairness and integrity of the tax system as a whole. 2. Previous chapters on Capital and wealth, Retirement savings, and Housing affordability have dealt with specific aspects of the income tax regime. This chapter addresses the underlying structure of the income tax – its rates and thresholds – and explores how New Zealand’s approach to personal income taxation may need to adjust to changes in the world of work. The current approach to personal income taxation 3. Personal income tax applies to individuals. It is the ultimate tax paid by individuals after income has worked its way through the various taxable entities and structures, taking the form of wages, salaries, self-employed income, dividends, interest and other income. 4. Unlike the other tax bases, personal income tax has a progressive rate structure. The current rates and thresholds are as follows: 56 Some employees, however, are subject to an ‘end-of-year square up’ for other items, such as social policy entitlements. Table 13.1: Income tax rates and thresholds Taxable incomeTax rate Up to $14,00010.5% Over $14,000 and up to $48,00017.5% Over $48,000 and up to $70,00030% Remaining income over $70,00033% 5. Most personal income tax is collected from employees. Employees do not receive any deductions for work-related expenses. (Nor are they required to register for GST.) Income tax on employee salaries and wages is withheld at source, so most employees do not need to file a tax return. 56 6. Non-employees – whether operating as a business or as a contractor – receive the opposite treatment. They receive deductions for work-related expenses, and generally need to register for GST. There are, however, various levels of withholding tax on some contractors. 7. Common law tests determine the employment status of an individual for tax purposes. Consequently, the taxable status of an individual may differ from their contractual status. The rates and thresholds of income tax 8. The Group has received a large number of submissions on the rates and thresholds of income tax. The Group is still weighing its options in this area, but the Terms of Reference do rule out consideration of any increase in income tax rates. 13 Personal income and the future of work 94 Future of Tax Interim Report 9. The Group’s objective in considering change is to enhance the living standards of New Zealanders, particularly for those on low incomes. The Group’s deliberations over the coming months will thus be informed by several key metrics: • The distributional impact of options for change – including judgements on how options for change affect the progressivity of the tax system, and whether taxes or transfers are the best option for improving the living standards of lower income households. • Impacts on incentives to save, work, and invest. • The extent to which options increase or reduce the integrity of the tax system. • The revenue impacts of options for change. 10. Nevertheless, as noted in Chapter 12 on GST, the Group can say at this point that reductions to the lower tax rates and/or thresholds would be the most progressive means of assisting low and middle income earners through the tax system. If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low income households, on the other hand, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers. 11. The Group also believes that income tax reductions should benefit all low income households – including households on benefits. At the moment, some benefits are set to ensure that beneficiaries receive a given level of income after tax. Any tax reductions will need to be paired with equivalent increases in benefit levels to ensure a fair treatment of all income earners. 12. The Group is not considering a reduction in the top marginal tax rate of 33% because the rate is already low by international standards and the Group does not wish to reduce the progressivity of the tax system on vertical equity grounds. Bracket creep 13. The Group has received some submissions expressing concern about ‘bracket creep’ in the tax system. Bracket creep occurs when inflation increases people’s incomes, moving them into higher tax brackets. It causes individuals to pay more in tax, even though their real earnings (measured in purchasing power) have not increased. 14. Annual changes to rates and thresholds impose compliance costs on individuals and businesses. The Group believes that bracket creep is best dealt with through the periodic review of the rates and thresholds of income tax to ensure they remain appropriate rather than some form of indexation. Assessment 15. The Group will provide recommendations regarding the rates and thresholds of income tax in the Final Report in February 2019. The future of work 16. The preceding sections of this chapter have dealt with personal income taxation as it currently stands. But we all know that change is coming to the way we work – if it is not already here. 17. The world is living through a period of intense innovation: digital technology is transforming established business models and altering traditional relationships between business and workers. As with other sectors of the economy, technology has the potential to disrupt existing paradigms in taxation too. Combined with globalisation, generational demographics and climate change, there may be significant challenges for our workforce in the future. 18. It is impossible to predict how these changes will affect the future labour force in New Zealand. It is possible there will be an increase in the number of jobs in New Zealand, but it is equally possible that we see a decrease in the number of workers required in the future. This may be especially so in the market for low skilled workers. 95 Future of Tax Interim Report 19. Some submitters asked the Group to consider a universal basic income in response to the possibility of falling employment. However, the Group considers that this falls outside its terms of reference and is more appropriately considered by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. 20. Some commentators have proposed what has been described as a ‘robot tax’ to replace lost taxes on wages, to address the problem of the automating firms transferring the costs of employment loss onto society, and to counter resulting increased inequality (Delaney 2018). The Group considers that there are likely to be better ways for the tax and transfer system to address these problems if automation becomes more widespread in New Zealand. 21. It is important that the tax system remains sustainable and flexible for the changes that could occur before they occur to ensure that the tax base is protected. This may include a higher reliance on other taxes rather than personal income tax. The ‘gig economy’ and the rise of the contractor 22. In the Submissions Background Paper, the Group discussed the role of the gig economy in the changing nature of the work. The gig economy is a labour market characterised by a prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent employment. Workers in the gig economy have less regularity in their sources of income, working hours and conditions, and often operate as contractors. 23. There are a number of reasons why the gig economy could be expected to grow in the future: • Business drivers. Businesses face a range of costs and obligations when they hire permanent employees. Faced with these costs, businesses may prefer to rely on a flexible workforce that can be hired on an as-needed basis. Businesses may also prefer greater flexibility when they require specialist skills for specific projects. • Personal drivers. Some (but not all) workers may prefer to work as contractors on the basis that self-employment provides them with a greater sense of freedom and flexibility. For many, the reason is simply to earn extra income. Past regulatory reforms have made it easier for individuals to establish companies and set themselves up in self-employment. • Technological drivers. The development of online technology ‘platforms’ – such as Freelancer, Uber and MyCare – has made it much simpler for individual contractors to connect with potential employers. 24. Uber may be a household word, but, at least so far, the statistics appear to be lagging behind our lived experience. According to Stats NZ, the proportion of self-employed workers has remained relatively steady over the ten years to 2016 (SNZ 2016). 25. These outcomes could change quickly, although the evidence is at times contradictory. In the UK, for example, the share of the workforce that is self-employed has grown by a quarter since 2001 (Sidhu 2018), but it has fallen in most other OECD countries (OECD 2018). It has also been predicted that the majority of the workforce in the United States will be freelance by 2027, with 47% of millennials in the United States freelancing now, though others have challenged this (Upwork 2017, EPI 2015). 26. The timing and impact of these trends are uncertain. The challenge for New Zealand is thus to future-proof the tax system, so it can cope with rapid change in the nature of work, as and when it arises. PAYE and the sustainability of the income tax base 27. The current approach to income tax collection is an artefact of the 1950s. Most income tax from labour is collected through the PAYE system, which was introduced in 1958. PAYE – or ‘pay- as-you-earn’ – is a withholding system in which employers are responsible for deducting and paying income tax on their employees’ behalf. 96 Future of Tax Interim Report 28. PAYE may be long in the tooth, but it is an extremely efficient means of collecting tax. PAYE results in high levels of compliance among employees, and while imposing some compliance and administration costs on employers, it results in lower compliance and administration costs to the system overall and so is the most efficient means of collecting the tax. 29. Yet its effectiveness as a revenue collection tool depends on the predominance of formal employee/employer relationships in the workforce. As the proportion of self-employed workers rises, the effectiveness of PAYE as a revenue-raising tool reduces. 30. This is because the rise of the contractor poses a number of risks to the income tax base: • Integrity. The self-employed are generally less compliant than workers in an employee/ employer relationship because they have a greater ability to under-report income or inflate expenses (Cabral and Gemmell 2018). There is also a group of vulnerable self-employed workers who may not comply with their tax obligations because they lack the necessary skills or knowledge to do so. • Administration costs. It is more efficient for Inland Revenue to deal with larger employers than with individual contractors. All else equal, administration costs will rise as the number of contractors rises (although new platforms and technology may partially offset the increase in costs). • Compliance costs. The costs of compliance must be shouldered entirely by individuals, rather than by their ‘employers.’ 31. There are also issues of equity and fairness. Employees generally do not file tax returns, and their employer is responsible for KiwiSaver and ACC obligations, along with some social obligations such as student loan or child support payments. A self-employed person, on the other hand, must account for their own taxes, as well 57 These measures include: the addition of labour hire firms to the schedular payment rules; the removal of the company exemption from withholding tax for companies working through labour hire firms; the ability for contractors to choose a rate of withholding tax (with certain limitations); and the ability for contractors to have voluntary withholding tax deducted from payments (with the agreement of the payer). as KiwiSaver, ACC, and their social obligations. They may also be required to register and account for GST. 32. This can result in a situation where two people sitting across from each other – essentially doing the same role – can end up with very different tax obligations. Options for responding to this challenge 33. The Group has considered how best the tax system can respond to the rise of the contractor. As a starting point, the Group acknowledges that the Government has already introduced a number of measures to increase compliance by the self-employed, which have had the effect of increasing the scope of the withholding regime. 57 34. The Group also understands that Inland Revenue is exploring a range of further measures to increase compliance by the self- employed: • Increased information reporting to Inland Revenue by both payers and platforms (such as ride-sharing companies). International evidence suggests that compliance increases when taxpayers know the revenue authority is receiving information on payments received (IRS 2007). • The potential extension of withholding taxes by payers and platforms. Inland Revenue is currently considering the most effective approach for applying withholding to areas of high non-compliance. • Making better use of technology platforms, for example by allowing those platforms to deal with individual contractor’s tax obligations by deducting tax from payments received and paying this through to Inland Revenue (e.g. the use of smart accounts that directly account for tax as income is deposited). 97 Future of Tax Interim Report 35. It is important that Inland Revenue supports these measures with continued use of data analytics and matching information to specific taxpayers to identify underreporting of income. 36. This work overlaps with some of the proposals outlined in Chapter 15 for improving the integrity of the tax system. Assessment 37. The Group supports Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed. The Group particularly supports an expansion in the use of withholding taxes as a means to reduce individuals’ compliance costs and increase compliance, and recommends that withholding be extended as far as practicable, including to platform service providers. The Group also supports changes to facilitate platforms to assist the self-employed meeting their tax requirements through the use of smart accounts or other technology based solutions. 38. The Group also recommends two further actions. Firstly, the Group recommends a review of the existing GST treatment of contractors. The current approach of applying GST to contractors who are essentially supplying the same services as an employee which are not subject to GST appears to impose compliance costs for little benefit. 39. Secondly, it has also become apparent to the Group that there is a risk of quite different definitions of employment status, including particularly ‘employee’ and ‘dependent contractor’, being used across Government. The Group recommends that the Government seek, where possible, to align these definitions for tax and employment purposes. The treatment of childcare costs 40. Childcare can be a significant cost of earning income for the parents of young children, and the responsibility for childcare tends to fall disproportionately on women. The labour force participation of mothers – and particularly of low income mothers – is therefore sensitive to changes in childcare costs (Knox 2012). 41. In light of these challenges, some submitters have argued that the tax system should assist with childcare costs in order to increase labour force participation among mothers Policy considerations 42. Some countries allow childcare costs to be fully or partly deductible; New Zealand does not. New Zealand’s approach reflects a longstanding principle of tax law that expenditure of a private or domestic nature is not tax deductible. 43. The Group believes there is a valid case for the Government to provide additional support for childcare costs. The issue considered by the Group is whether this support is best delivered through the tax system, or through other policy vehicles. 44. There are, in fact, a number of disadvantages associated with the deductibility of childcare expenses. Because of the progressive tax scale, childcare deductions will provide a greater benefit to individuals in higher-income brackets than individuals in lower-income brackets. There is some evidence that the labour force participation of higher-income mothers is also less sensitive to changes in childcare costs than lower-income mothers (Knox 2012). If so, childcare deductions may not be the most cost-effective way to increase labour force participation. 45. One option for targeting support to low- and middle-income families could be a specific tax credit, similar to the donations tax credit. However, introducing a new type of credit would add to compliance costs for individuals and to administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Assessment 46. The Group agrees with submitters that additional support for childcare costs is desirable, but believes this support is best provided outside of the tax system. The Group would support instead the extension of direct Government support for childcare. 98 Future of Tax Interim Report Summary The Group: 13.1 Will provide recommendations regarding the rates and thresholds of income tax in the Final Report in February 2019. 13.2 Supports Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, particularly an expansion of the use of withholding tax as far as practicable, including to platform providers such as ride sharing companies. 13.3 Supports the facilitation of technology platforms to assist the self-employed meet their tax obligations through the use of smart accounts or other technology based solutions. 13.4 Recommends that Inland Revenue continues to use data analytics and matching information to specific taxpayers to identify underreporting of income. 13.5 Recommends that there be a review of the current GST requirements for contractors who are akin to employees. 13.6 Recommends that the Government seek to align the definition of employee and dependent contractor for tax and employment purposes. 13.7 Recommends additional Government support for childcare costs, but believes this support is best provided outside the tax system. 99 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Company tax is an important part of our revenue base. But the taxation of business also has a broader impact on wellbeing. It directly affects the accumulation of physical and financial capital, because it changes the incentives on firms and individuals to save and invest. From a human capital perspective, business tax can affect the incentives for firms to create employment and invest in the skills of their workers. Through all of these channels, business tax can ultimately influence the productivity of the economy. 2. There is an important link between social capital and the taxation of business. Business taxation helps to sustain public trust and confidence in the tax system; it buttresses the personal income tax by reducing opportunities for wealthier individuals to reduce their tax obligations. Ineffective and unfair business taxation, on the other hand, will erode public acceptance of the prevailing levels of taxation, as well as the spirit of voluntary compliance by taxpayers that underpins efficient tax collection. 3. There are also links between business and natural capital. Business activities can affect stocks of natural capital; business can also have a positive role in preserving and enhancing the natural environment. 4. This chapter explores some of the key features of the taxation of business, with a particular focus on company tax. 58 Chapter 15 on Integrity provides a number of recommendations to increase consistency in the treatment of these different structures. The current approach to the taxation of business Taxable entities 5. Businesses are taxed depending on the entity they choose to operate through. There are many types of taxable entities – including sole traders, partnerships, look through companies, and Māori authorities, among others. All of these entities, however, are variations on three basic structures: • Individual/partnership treatment – where income is attributed directly to the individual owners, for example in the case of look- through companies and limited partnership rules. • Standard company tax treatment – where income is taxed initially at the company level, but ultimately at the individual owners’ tax rate on distribution. • Trusts – where income is taxed as either trustee income or beneficiary income. 6. The tax system generally tries to ensure that consistent amounts of tax are paid on income earned through each of these different structures, unless there are good policy reasons to depart from consistency. The objective is to ensure, as much as possible, that taxpayers choose the structure that is best for business purposes, rather than for tax purposes. 58 14 The taxation of business 100 Future of Tax Interim Report The company tax regime 7. The most common form of business structure is the company. Companies pay company income tax on the income they generate: they claim expenses against their gross income to arrive at their net income, and then pay tax on the net income. Tax credits are also deducted as part of the tax payable calculation. The company tax rate is currently 28%. 8. Company dividends are subject to the imputation regime. The purpose of imputation is to prevent the double taxation of company income that is distributed as dividends. Imputation works in the following way: • Income earned in a company is taxed to the company at the company tax rate. • Dividends paid to shareholders are taxed to the shareholders as personal income. • An ‘imputation credit’ is deducted from the personal income tax paid on the dividend. The imputation credit is equal to the amount of company tax that has been paid on the dividend. • The net personal tax paid is the difference between the personal and company rates applied to the underlying income. 9. Imputation means that company tax is treated as a withholding tax for New Zealand shareholders when profits are distributed as dividends. Any income that is not taxed at the company level is taxed when it is received by the New Zealand shareholder. These effects are deferred until the income is paid out as a dividend. 10. For non-residents, final tax is paid at either the company rate (to the extent that company income tax has been paid), or at the applicable non-resident withholding tax rate (up to 15%), if company income tax has not been paid. 59 This reflect a European Court of Justice ruling that imputation systems that only provide tax credits to domestic investors are discriminatory. The merits of imputation 11. Many countries provide relief on the taxation of dividends to mitigate the risk of double taxation, but there has been a shift away from full imputation, particularly in European Union countries. 59 In light of these developments, the Group has considered whether the imputation system remains fit-for-purpose in New Zealand. Policy considerations 12. A practical alternative to imputation is the ‘classical system.’ In a classical system, income earned through companies is taxed twice: income accruing to companies is taxed first at the company level, and then the profits distributed to shareholders are taxed at the personal level. One of the main benefits of a classical system is that it generates much lower compliance and administration costs than imputation. 13. There could also be an increase in capital investment overall if the introduction of the classical system involves a net reduction in company taxation. Greater capital investment could boost labour productivity and increase wages, although the extent of the impact is uncertain. The effects will likely be larger for non-resident shareholders, for whom company tax is the only tax they pay. However, a classical system creates a number of distortions, including disincentives to use equity finance and to distribute profits. 14. A classical system is also unlikely to increase progressivity in a consistent manner. It will increase progressivity with respect to the recipients of dividends (dividends are received across the income scale, but higher income- earners are more likely to receive dividends than lower income-earners). Yet there will be many ways to avoid the double layer of taxation – for example, through the use of shareholder salaries and bonuses, or through a greater reliance on debt financing. 101 Future of Tax Interim Report 15. Some of these disadvantages can be mitigated by exempting the dividends received by shareholders. While this mitigates the double taxation of a classical system, it limits the taxation of corporate profits to the corporate income tax rate, which creates an incentive for the use of corporate structures. Assessment 16. The Group does not see a compelling case to change the imputation system in light of the disadvantages associated with alternative approaches. However, the Government will need to revisit the merits of imputation if Australia moves away from its own imputation system. The appropriate rate of company tax 17. The Group has received many submissions on the subject of the company rate, and has accordingly considered whether the current rate remains appropriate. Policy considerations Competition for foreign investment 18. New Zealand funds some of its capital stock from inbound investment, and will have a lower capital stock if tax represents an undue impediment on inbound investment. This could result in higher prices and lower wages, because workers are generally more productive when using more capital – although the effect depends on the form and nature of the investment. 19. Table 14.1 sets out the corporate tax rates in a range of comparator countries. New Zealand’s current company tax rate is higher than average when compared with other OECD countries. After accounting for imputation, however, the total tax to a domestic shareholder is relatively low on a cross-country basis. 60 The table includes an average of subnational corporate rates where applicable, for example in the case of the United States.

Yet the risks associated with tax competition for foreign capital can be overstated. In general, an investment that is economic at a 28% rate will not become uneconomic simply because another country drops its own company tax rate. The Group acknowledges that there are differing views about the impact of a corporate income tax rate change on foreign direct investment. But the available evidence suggests that a modest reduction in corporate income tax rates does not necessarily lead to a meaningful increase in foreign direct investment. 21. The two most recent reductions in the company rate in New Zealand – in 2008 and 2011 – were not associated with an increase in foreign investment. In fact, the stock of foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP trended down slightly in the following years. There was also no increase in the level of foreign investment relative to Australia, whose company rate was unchanged during that period. 61 22. Many other drivers were affecting investment decisions during this period, including the effects of the Global Financial Crisis. Still, this experience raises questions about the extent to which minor reductions in the company rate will have meaningful impacts on the level of foreign investment in New Zealand. 61 New Zealand International Investment Position and Gross Domestic Product, Statistics New Zealand. OECD data on FDI stocks for Australia. Competition for tax bases and headquarters 23. Some New Zealand firms could also decide to relocate their headquarters to jurisdictions with lower corporate rates. This risk is mitigated by the fact that it is advantageous for New Zealand companies with substantial New Zealand shareholder bases to remain headquartered in New Zealand. Tax paid in New Zealand can be passed on as a credit to New Zealand shareholders; this is not possible for tax paid in foreign jurisdictions. 24. Yet a lower company rate – that is more aligned with the global average – would decrease the incentive for firms to shift profits into lower tax jurisdictions, and would require less reliance on New Zealand’s transfer pricing and anti-avoidance rules (which are designed to mitigate this risk). 25. Overall, however, competition for the tax base and location of companies is likely to be more important in countries that are close alternatives to one another for the location of business activity. In Europe, for example, a business can supply many markets from any one of a number of countries. Business in Europe may therefore be highly sensitive to tax rates in their choice of location. Modelling the impact of company tax rate cuts The Tax Working Group Secretariat modelled the impacts of a reduction in the company rate at the request of the Group. The modelling suggests that a five percentage point cut in the company rate, funded by an increase in labour taxation, would have minimal impact on New Zealand’s national income. These results are broadly consistent with modelling for Australia published by the Australian Treasury (Kouparitsas et al. 2016). Some of the assumptions used by the Secretariat are open to criticism, and the Group acknowledges that the use of these assumptions may lead the model to overstate the national income benefits of a company rate cut. The model has been subject to external independent review. While the reviewer made some criticisms of the model, and recommended some changes, they agreed that the case for a reduction in the rate appears to be weak, based on simple (but probably reasonable) modelling of foreign investment responses to company tax rates. Further information on the results of the Secretariat model, and the external independent review of the model, are available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz. 103 Future of Tax Interim Report 26. In this context, it will be important to monitor Australia’s corporate income tax rate. If Australia adjusts its corporate rate, the Government will need to review whether New Zealand’s company rate remains appropriate. Incentives on domestic investors 27. New Zealand is a net importer of foreign capital, but access to domestic capital is critical for the growth of most local firms. In the Group’s view, a reduction in the company tax rate is unlikely to have much of an impact on domestic investors. This is because the imputation system (with taxation at the shareholder level and a credit for company tax paid) will claw back the benefit of any company tax reductions for domestic investors sitting on the top personal rate. Location-specific economic rents 28. A reduction in the company rate will reduce the taxation of location-specific economic rents. ‘Rents’ are returns over and above those required for investment in New Zealand to take place. They may arise from various factors, such as natural resources, or access to particular markets. There is an open question about the size of location-specific economic rents in New Zealand. 29. Economic rents are an efficient source of taxation, because they can be taxed without discouraging investment. Economic rents are particularly valuable when they are earned by non-residents, because New Zealanders will derive the benefit of the tax revenue, but will not affect decisions of non-residents of whether to invest or not. The integrity and coherence of the tax system 30. A reduction in the company rate will reduce the integrity of the tax system, if it is not paired by a corresponding decrease in personal tax rates. High income earners will be more likely to shelter income in companies to avoid the top personal rate. The five percentage point differential between the company rate and the personal rates already encourages tax- sheltering; the rewards of doing so will only increase if the differential grows further. If a lower corporate income tax rate were introduced, specific anti-avoidance rules would need to be considered to mitigate this issue. Assessment 31. There are countervailing arguments for and against a reduction in the company tax rate. A lower rate will reduce the incentive for companies to shift profits offshore, and may encourage greater foreign investment (although the extent of the increase in investment and national income as a result of a modest rate cut is highly uncertain). Yet a lower rate will reduce the taxation of economic rents (to the extent they are available), and further reduce the coherence and integrity of the tax system (unless the top personal rate is also reduced, which is the Group is not considering). Alternative productivity- enhancing options may be more attractive than a company rate cut. 32. As a result, the Group overall judges that the costs to the coherence, integrity and revenue potential of the tax system are likely to outweigh the uncertain benefits of additional investment, growth, and welfare. However, the Government should continue to monitor developments in company tax rates around the world, particularly in Australia. 104 Future of Tax Interim Report A progressive company tax Is there a case to introduce a progressive company tax? 33. Besides considering the appropriate rate of company tax, the Terms of Reference direct the Group to examine specifically whether a progressive company tax – with a lower rate for small companies – would improve the tax system and the business environment. 34. A progressive rate could be applied in a number of ways. For example, it could apply to business income below a certain threshold, or for a set number of years after a company has commenced business. 35. Australia introduced a progressive company tax in 2015. For 2018/19, companies with an aggregated turnover of less than $50 million will pay a rate of 27.5%. Companies above that threshold will pay a rate of 30%. 36. The Australian system was originally conceived as a temporary measure. The Australian Government intended to progressively extend the lower company tax rate to all corporate entities, by gradually increasing the turnover threshold each year. Policy considerations 37. There are two main arguments for a progressive company tax: firstly, that small businesses will have more funds available to invest and grow; and secondly, that the progressive rate will compensate small businesses for the fact that fixed compliance costs impose a relatively higher burden on them. 38. There are, however, significant costs arising from a progressive company tax. One of the primary costs is a reduction in efficiency: the tax will favour firms on the basis of their size rather than their productivity. The tax will also reduce the incentive for firms to grow beyond the point at which the higher rate kicks in. 39. An increase in the differential between the company rate and the top personal income rate will also encourage tax minimisation and avoidance. The progressive rate will increase the incentive (which already exists) for individuals to access lower tax rates through small business vehicles; additional rules will be necessary to ensure that business owners cannot multiply their access to the low tax rate by breaking up their firms. 40. In any case, it is already possible for closely- held businesses to access progressive taxation through the look-though company structure, in which income is attributed to shareholders directly and taxed according to the progressive income tax scale. 41. The Group acknowledges submitter concerns about the impact of compliance costs, particularly on small businesses. It would seem more efficient, however, to focus on measures that directly reduce these costs, rather than provide indirect support for a subset of businesses through the tax system. Compliance cost reductions will benefit all firms – but they will benefit small businesses in particular. Assessment 42. The Group notes that progressive taxation is already possible through the use of look-through company structures. Beyond this, the Group judges that the costs of a progressive company tax are likely to outweigh any benefits in terms of faster small business growth. A better approach for supporting small businesses would be to focus on reducing compliance costs. 105 Future of Tax Interim Report 43. The Group has identified several areas where the Government could take immediate action to reduce compliance costs. Some of the thresholds in the Income Tax Act have not been reviewed in some time. Depending on the fiscal position, the Government could consider measures such as: • Increasing the $2,500 threshold for paying provisional tax to $5,000-$10,000. • Increasing the $10,000 year-end closing stock adjustment to $20,000-$30,000. • Increasing the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees, and potentially expanding the automatic deduction to other types of expenditure. 44. The Group does not consider altering thresholds around fixed assets (such as the low value write off threshold) should be considered as they can have large fiscal costs relative to the practical compliance cost reductions. 45. The Group also considered using an alternative basis of taxation for smaller businesses, such as a cashflow or turnover basis. The Group has not pursued these options due to the administrative and threshold issues they present. 46. The Group would like to explore further options for simplification and reducing compliance costs for small businesses, for inclusion in the Final Report. The appropriate rate for Māori authorities 47. A Māori authority is a company or trust that elects to be treated as a Māori authority for tax purposes. Entities must meet certain criteria in order to be eligible for Māori authority status. 48. The Group received a large number of submissions on Māori authorities. Some submitters opposed the Māori authority regime; others supported the regime, but offered suggestions for improving the way in which it operates. Policy considerations 49. In light of the debate around the Māori authority regime, it is worth revisiting what the regime does and how it works. 50. The current Māori authority rules (which have been in effect from the 2004-05 income year) were designed to address statutory or other legal restrictions on the ability to develop or trade assets held in collective ownership. These constraints are not faced by other trusts or companies with similar investments. 51. The Māori authority rules operate in a similar manner to the company imputation model. Māori authorities pay tax at a rate of 17.5%. The tax paid then forms a credit in its Māori Authority Credit Account. These credits can be attached to distributions to members, and the members can in turn use the credits to offset their individual tax liabilities. 52. The aim of the 17.5% rate is to reduce compliance costs for Māori authorities and their members. The rate is set at a level that is intended to reflect the most common marginal tax rate of the economic owners of Māori authorities; tax paid at the entity level is essentially a withholding mechanism for the final tax paid by Māori authority members. The current rate 53. The Group has considered whether the current rate for Māori authorities remains appropriate. In 2010, when the rate was last reviewed, about 80% of Māori authority members had a marginal tax rate of 17.5% or lower, meaning they would have no additional tax to pay (or they could claim a refund). 54. The median annual income of Māori individuals is around $32,000 in 2018. This indicates that the majority of Māori authority members probably still have incomes below the $48,000 threshold, and indicates that the factors resulting in the 17.5% rate for Māori authorities remain relevant. 106 Future of Tax Interim Report The treatment of subsidiaries 55. The wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities cannot elect to be treated as Māori authorities. This means the 17.5% rate applies only to the Māori authority itself, and not to its subsidiaries. The 17.5% rate can, however, be effectively accessed if the subsidiary distributes to the parent Māori Authority. 62 56. Given the constraints created by the taxation rules, some Māori authorities have begun to use transparent structures, such as limited partnerships, to access the 17.5% rate for subsidiary businesses. The use of transparent structures is an appropriate structural choice as they focus on income being taxed at the ultimate member’s tax rate. 57. Yet it is inefficient for entities to structure themselves to achieve a desired tax result, rather than because it makes the most commercial sense to adopt that structure. The current approach seems to run counter to the aims of the Māori authority regime. Assessment 58. The Group recommends the retention of the 17.5% rate for Māori authorities. The Group also notes that the current treatment of subsidiaries is resulting in inefficient outcomes, and recommends that wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities be eligible for the 17.5% rate, perhaps by being treated as Māori authorities in their own right. 59. Submitters have also suggested a number of technical refinements to the Māori authority rules. The main suggestion is to apply a default 17.5% resident withholding tax rate for distributions from Māori Authorities. 63 The Group recommends that the Government investigate this and the other suggestions through the Tax Policy Work Programme. 62 The imputation credit at 28% meets the parent’s tax liability at 17.5%, with the remainder converted into a tax loss. This outcome is arguably inefficient because Māori authorities incur a timing disadvantage that would not arise if the subsidiary was taxed at 17.5% in the first instance. 63 The default resident withholding tax rate is currently 33%, so Māori authority members on the 17.5% rate will be subject to additional taxation of 15.5% if they do not provide their IRD numbers and file a tax return. Since few members do so, this income is effectively overtaxed. 64 Alternatively, the losses can be used to offset the taxable income of other ‘commonly-owned’ companies (i.e. companies in which at least 66% of shareholders are the same as in another company). Options for enhancing business productivity 60. The Group is currently considering a number of options that could enhance business productivity. These options include: Loss continuity rules 61. Losses and income are treated asymmetrically under New Zealand’s company tax system. Companies pay tax when their income is positive, but the Government does not provide a refund when income is negative. Instead, losses can be carried forward to offset any tax obligations associated with the future income of the company. 64 62. The loss continuity rules determine whether losses from a previous year can be used in a future year. Generally, losses may be used to offset future income, unless more than 51% of the company’s shares have changed hands since the losses were incurred. 63. The loss continuity rules require a balance between efficiency and integrity objectives. Strict rules can reduce efficiency by discouraging risk- taking, but loose rules may allow companies to reduce their taxable income by trading in losses. 64. The Group believes the existing loss continuity rules are appropriate for most companies, but may not be working well for small start-up firms. These firms require equity capital to grow, but are often inherently loss-making. The existing loss continuity rules may be constraining their ability to grow through additional equity capital. Any relaxation of the rules would need to be carefully calibrated to ensure that the change does not facilitate trading in losses among larger firms. 107 Future of Tax Interim Report Black hole expenditure 65. Black hole expenditure is business expenditure that is expected to result in an economic cost to a taxpayer, but is not deductible (either immediately or over time). 66. An example of black hole expenditure arises when a business incurs costs to investigate the feasibility of a capital project, but ultimately decides not to proceed with the project. In that case, the costs associated with investigating the feasibility of the project will not be deductible, and so the expenditure is said to have fallen into a ‘black hole.’ 67. The treatment of black hole expenditure is linked to the treatment of gains and losses on capital assets. The Group will develop firm recommendations on black hole expenditure in the course of its work on the extension of capital income taxation. Building depreciation deductions 68. New Zealand abolished depreciation deductions for buildings in 2010, with effect from 2012. The Group is considering whether there is a case to reinstate depreciation deductions for certain types of buildings. 69. As noted in Chapter 8 on Housing affordability, the restoration of depreciation on multi- unit residential buildings could support the Government’s housing affordability goals by increasing the supply of housing and supporting greater intensification in urban areas. 70. There may also be a case to reinstate depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings, which depreciate faster than other types of residential buildings. The treatment of depreciation is closely linked to decisions on extending the taxation of capital income. This is because a reinstatement of building depreciation will reduce the likelihood (and size) of a capital loss on the disposal of a building. 71. Any changes to the treatment of building depreciation might need to be phased in over time to make the fiscal costs manageable, given their substantial cost, see Table 14.2. 72. The above costing is based on a system of 3% diminishing value tax depreciation. If buildings do not depreciate at that rate, the cost will be smaller over time, as depreciation deductions are clawed back as depreciation recovery income on sale. Assessment 73. The Group will provide recommendations on these options in the Final Report in February 2019. Table 14.2: Revenue impacts of reinstating building depreciation deductions Building type $m increase/(decrease) 2020/212021/222022/232023/242024/25 Industrial(240)(250)(260)(270)(280) Commercial(510)(525)(545)(565)(590) Multi-unit residential(90)(95)(100)(105)(110) Subtotal (Industrial, Commercial, Multi-unit Residential)(840)(870)(905)(940)(980) All other residential (430)(450)(475)(500)(530) All(1,270)(1,320)(1,380)(1,440)(1,510) These estimates are preliminary and presented for indicative purposes only. 108 Future of Tax Interim Report Box 14.1: The treatment of seismic strengthening In the course of discussions on building depreciation deductions, the Group has noted that no deductions are allowed for expenditure on seismic strengthening. The current approach results in a counter- intuitive outcome: deductions may be claimed if a building collapses in an earthquake, but no deductions may be claimed on expenditure that will prevent the building from collapsing. The Group is still considering its position on this issue, but it does seem to be an area where tax policy is working counter to the Government’s disaster risk management agenda. Summary The Group recommends that the Government: 14.1 Retain the imputation system. 14.2 Not reduce the company tax rate at the present time. 14.3 Not introduce a progressive company tax. 14.4 Not introduce an alternative basis of taxation for smaller businesses, such as cashflow or turnover taxes. 14.5 Consider other measures to reduce compliance costs. Depending on the fiscal position, these measures could include: • increasing the $2,500 threshold for paying provisional tax to $5,000-$10,000; • increasing the $10,000 year-end closing stock adjustment to $20,000-$30,000; • increasing the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees, and potentially expanding the automatic deduction to other types of expenditure. 14.6 Not change the thresholds around fixed assets. 14.7 Retain the 17.5% rate for Māori authorities. 14.8 Extend the 17.5% rate to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities. 14.9 Consider technical refinements to the Māori authority rules, as suggested by submitters, in the Tax Policy Work Programme. 109 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Most New Zealanders recognise the importance of paying tax, and meet their tax obligations. Some, however, do not. Others, while meeting their obligations, do so in a way that means they pay less tax on their income than others in similar circumstances. Both have the effect of reducing the integrity of the tax system and ultimately eroding social capital if not addressed by government. It also means that compliant taxpayers must pay more to achieve a given level of revenue. 2. Four broad principles should buttress the integrity of the tax system: • Income should be treated the same, regardless of the structure. People who earn the same amount of revenue should pay the same amount of tax, regardless of the structure through which the income is earned. 65 • All revenue should be reported. Taxpayers should not be able to under-report or hide their income in the ‘hidden economy.’ Tax should be easy to pay and hard to evade. • Inland Revenue has the capability to find and address integrity issues. Integrity issues tend to be first identified by Inland Revenue’s investigation arm. Inland Revenue must continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff to ensure future integrity issues can be identified and addressed in a timely manner. 65 This is all subject to the policy intent of the particular provision. For example the top rate for KiwiSaver and similar schemes is intentionally below the top tax rate for an individual. • Tax must be collected. Taxpayers should not be able to escape their tax obligations through sheltering or structuring. 3. This chapter develops recommendations or options in support of all four of these principles. The first two sections – on trusts and closely- held companies – deal with integrity issues associated with particular types of structures. The following sections then explore measures to shed light on the hidden economy, improve tax collection and ensure Inland Revenue has the capability to find and address integrity issues. Trusts 4. The Group has received a number of submissions on the taxation of trusts. Many submitters believe that trusts are being exploited to shelter income and avoid tax. Accordingly, the Group has looked carefully at the evidence to assess the impact of trusts on the integrity of the tax system. The taxation of trusts 5. A trust is a legal relationship between people. It is not a legal entity in its own right. When a trust is established, one person (the ‘settlor’) gives property to another person (the ‘trustee’) to look after and use for the benefit of someone else (the ‘beneficiary’). The relationship places legally enforceable obligations on the trustee to manage the property for the benefit of the beneficiary. A settlor may be a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust, but they cannot be the sole trustee and beneficiary. 15 The integrity of the tax system 110 Future of Tax Interim Report 6. The income generated by a trust falls into two broad categories. They are the income retained by the trust which is defined as ‘trustee income,’ and the income distributed to beneficiaries as ‘beneficiary income.’ In most discretionary trusts, the trustee decides how much of the trust’s income is to be retained or distributed (although income must be distributed within a certain time period in order to be classed as beneficiary income). 7. Different tax treatments apply to these categories of income: • Trustee income is taxed at a final rate of 33%. • Beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiaries’ respective marginal tax rates. • Income distributed to children under the age of sixteen is subject to the ‘minor beneficiary’ rule and taxed at the trustee rate of 33%. 66 8. Trust losses can be carried forward to offset the trust’s future tax obligations, but cannot be used to offset the beneficiaries’ individual tax obligations. They also cannot be used to offset income of other trusts with the same settlor or trustee. Policy considerations Past issues 9. Trusts became increasing popular during the 2000s, particularly in the small business sector. The use of trusts was a reaction to the structure of income tax at that time. Before reforms in 2009 and 2010, the top personal rate stood at 39%, whereas the trustee rate was 33%. 10. Since the trustee rate is a final rate, company owners were able to avoid the top personal rate by inserting a trust between themselves and the company. There was a substantial rise in the amount of trustee income between 2001 and 2011 as taxpayers arranged their affairs to take advantage of this benefit. 66 The minor beneficiary rule prevents trustees from reducing the tax obligations of adult beneficiaries by diverting some of the trust’s income to dependent children on lower marginal rates. 11. Subsequent tax reforms reduced the benefit of earning income through a trust structure. In 2010, the Government aligned the trustee rate with the top personal rate. Trustee income has fallen significantly since then. 12. There has also been a process in recent years to review the legislative framework for trusts. In 2010, the Law Commission launched a review of the law of trusts. Among other things, the Commission observed there was a perception that some trusts were used to thwart legal obligations. 13. The Law Commission concluded that it was necessary to update the guiding legislation to reinforce the principles underlying trusts and clarify the duties of trustees (LC 2013). Legislation to modernise trust law is currently before Parliament. Current issues 14. Most trusts today are ‘passive’ – they hold the family home and have few other investments. The Group sees no major tax issues associated with passive trusts, particularly given the current alignment between the trustee rate and the top personal rate. The main issues with trusts arise, instead, in business or personal contexts such as access to residential care subsidies. For tax, three main areas of potential concern have been identified. Trust losses 15. As with companies, trust losses are ring-fenced within the trust and cannot be distributed. Unlike companies, however, there are no restrictions on the use of trust losses by other parties. 16. We are advised that it is increasingly common for property development to occur through trading trusts. The underlying projects may be profitable, but they may generate substantial tax losses in the interim because of timing differences between the recognition of expenses and income. Inland Revenue is seeing structures which attempt to sell trust losses from one party to another. 111 Future of Tax Interim Report 17. It will not be straightforward to resolve this issue. Trading in trust losses cannot be resolved with the type of ‘continuity of ownership’ test that applies to companies. This is because the beneficiaries of trusts do not have the same fixed entitlements as shareholders in a company. 18. In the Group’s view, such trading should generally fall foul of the general anti-avoidance provision, because it is contrary to the intent of the Income Tax Act for losses to be used by taxpayers who did not bear the economic burden of those losses. 19. In the event there are found to be deficiencies in such an approach, the Group recommends that the Government review the treatment of trust losses, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss continuity rules for companies. Income streaming 20. Trusts can be used to ‘stream’ different types of income from a business or investment to different beneficiaries of the trust. There can be good reasons for streaming to occur. Take the example of a family trust that holds a family farm and some fixed income investments: the trust might stream the regular bond income to the surviving spouse of the settlor, while the children in the family receive income from the farm on which they work. 21. Yet streaming can also be exploited for tax purposes. For example, trusts can be used to stream taxable income to beneficiaries on low marginal tax rates, while untaxed capital gains are streamed to beneficiaries on high marginal rates. Discretionary trusts are an effective vehicle for this type of streaming because distributions can be discretionary and (unlike companies) not based on shareholdings. 22. The underlying problem, however, is not the streaming itself. Instead, it is the fact that some types of income are not taxed – the most important of which are capital gains. 23. In the Group’s view, an extension of capital income taxation would largely address the issue of income streaming. If capital gains remain untaxed, however, it may be necessary to develop specific rules to restrict abusive uses of streaming. Income splitting 24. Trusts can also be used to ‘split’ income. Income splitting is used to lower the overall tax obligations facing a group of related people; it involves the distribution of the trust’s income to those beneficiaries within the group who earn less and therefore sit on lower marginal rates. Income splitting often involves the partner or children of a high income-earner. 25. There does not appear to be a significant problem with income splitting at the present time. There is no evidence from Inland Revenue to suggest that trusts are being used for large- scale income splitting. This probably reflects the impact of current rules, such as the minor beneficiary rule, which prevent the most abusive forms of income splitting. Assessment 26. The trust tax rules are basically sound. Income is taxed in the hands of beneficiaries where that is possible, but is otherwise taxed at the trustee level, with alignment of the trustee rate and the top personal rate. The integrity challenges associated with trusts have reduced significantly since the 2000s, due to the alignment between the trustee rate and the top personal rate. Many of the remaining challenges associated with trusts relate to deeper issues in the tax system, such as the inconsistent taxation of capital income, and should be considered within that context. 27. The one discrete issue that may need attention relates to trading in trust losses. The Group recommends that the Government consider this issue if the general anti-avoidance rule is insufficient, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss continuity rules for companies. Closely-held companies 28. Another major area of concern regarding structures relates to the role of closely-held companies. Again, in response to this concern, the Group has taken a close look at the tax treatment of these types of companies. 112 Future of Tax Interim Report The taxation of closely-held companies 29. Closely-held companies are companies with few shareholders. Many of these companies use the general company tax rules to govern their interface with their shareholders. The other major structure is the look-through company, which flows its income and expenditure through to its shareholders. 67 30. There are a number of challenges associated with the taxation of closely-held companies. The first set of challenges arises from the inconsistent taxation of capital income: • Capital gains are not generally taxed if they are earned directly by an individual, but will be taxed if they are earned in a company and distributed to shareholders as an unimputed dividend. 68 This creates a strong incentive for shareholders to find ways to access the capital gain without paying a taxable dividend. • An additional complication arises from the fact that capital gains are not taxed when a company is wound up. This creates an incentive for companies to wind up rather than pay out capital gains as a taxable dividend. 31. The second set of challenges arises from the misalignment between the company rate and the top personal rates: 69 • Taxpayers can reduce their tax obligations by earning income in a company and delaying its distribution. In principle, when the income is eventually distributed, it will be taxed at the shareholders’ personal rate through the imputation system. However, when incomes are large and the period of deferral is lengthy, the reduction in taxes can be significant. • Since a dividend will often be subject to the top personal rate, there is an incentive for a taxpayer who is a shareholder-employee of a closely-held company to pay themselves a 67 Qualifying companies’ are an earlier form of the look-through company. No new qualifying companies can be formed, but qualifying companies established before their income year starting on or after 1 April 2011 may retain their status. 68 The taxation of unimputed dividends reflects a deliberate policy decision to strengthen the company tax regime: any income (including capital gains) that is not taxed at the company level is taxed when distributed as a dividend. 69 The optimal response is to align the individual and company tax rate. However raising the company tax rate is outside the Group’s terms of reference and the Group does not recommend a reduction in the top rate for individuals as that would make the tax system less progressive. relatively low salary or wage to fall below the top marginal tax rate. The taxpayer may then borrow from a third party or from the company to meet their lifestyle needs, if those needs cannot be met by their salary or wages. In either case, the interest will be non-deductible to the taxpayer if used to meet their lifestyle needs. Commercially, a loan from a third party will require a market rate of interest to be paid. To the extent that the interest rate on a loan from a company to a shareholder is below market interest rates, the shortfall is taxed as a dividend. This gives the same result as borrowing from the third party. There is then an incentive to repay the loan. If the loan is forgiven or repaid by way of a dividend, that gives rise to taxable income. 32. Putting these challenges together, there is a range of incentives for the owners of closely-held companies to both defer and avoid the payment of tax on dividends. Dividend avoidance 33. Dividend avoidance is an arrangement in which a company’s profits or assets are paid out to shareholders without the tax that would have applied if the payment had taken the form of a dividend. 34. Many dividend avoidance arrangements take advantage of the tax exempt status of capital gains to unlock the value of existing realised capital gains and unrealised capital gains (such as goodwill) in their companies. These arrangements generally involve a sale of shares to a related party that does not result in a true disposal of the underlying property or business. 113 Future of Tax Interim Report 35. The simplest forms of dividend avoidance, known as ‘dividend stripping,’ are prevented by specific anti-avoidance rules. Inland Revenue has also identified a number of other arrangements, with potentially significant revenue exposure; in March 2018, it issued a Revenue Alert (RA 18/01) on these arrangements. Current accounts 36. Another issue arises from the use of current accounts. Shareholders in closely-held companies can withdraw funds from the company and then use those funds for personal expenditure. This withdrawal arises through a current account which also records funds, other than capital, lent to the company by the shareholder. 37. A traditional use of a current account is for a shareholder to take drawings from the company during the year, which are then offset by shareholder salaries or dividends declared at the end of the tax year. The withdrawal is treated as a loan from the company’s current account. These loans may have low-interest or no-interest terms, in which case the interest-free benefit will be taxable. 38. A current account can become increasingly overdrawn if amounts are regularly paid to a shareholder. This may occur in cases where a shareholder is using drawings from the current account to fund a higher standard of living than would otherwise be possible for them. 39. There is no obligation for a shareholder to clear their overdrawn current account at any particular time. However, current rules in effect require interest to be charged (and that interest is taxable to the company and non-deductible to the shareholder if used for personal expenses), and should in theory be sufficient. However, at times, this requires direct enforcement for Inland Revenue to ensure it occurs. 40. There may be two caveats to this. 41. Inland Revenue observes that some taxpayers have been using dividend avoidance arrangements to clear these balances and potentially create a balance that can be drawn against in the new company. 42. The amount of funds withdrawn from current accounts has increased sharply since 2010 when the trust and top rate were aligned, but misalignment continued between companies and shareholders. This would not be a problem if shareholders were complying with the rules, and loans were being repaid in full from sources other than dividend avoidance schemes. However, Inland Revenue considers that this is not always what happens in practice. 43. Secondly, some companies have run up large debts that they owe to Inland Revenue and at the same time, the company is owed large debts by the shareholders via current accounts. The reality in some of those cases is that the current accounts are never intended to be repaid. The shareholders assets are often in trusts, and the shareholder rarely, if ever, gives any security for the current account. When such companies are placed into liquidation, whether as a result of Inland Revenue action or otherwise, it is very difficult for such current account debts to be collected from the shareholders. This, in turn, leads to large write-offs of tax debts by Inland Revenue when these companies are struck off the companies register. Under current rules, this may give rise to debt remission income and the shareholder has to pay tax on such income. However, such tax is difficult to collect from the shareholder for the same reasons that the current account is difficult to collect. Assessment 44. The challenges associated with the taxation of closely-held companies are complex and interlinked. 45. As with trusts, many of the challenges arise from the inconsistent taxation of capital income. An extension of capital income taxation – to include gains on the sale of shares – would deal with many of the problems. This may be undercut by rollover relief and that will be considered when the Group designs rules in that area. 114 Future of Tax Interim Report 46. While the company and personal rates remain unaligned, this will continue to raise integrity issues. The fundamentals of the current account rules are correct, although we consider the potential for a company to lend funds to shareholders that are never going to be repaid to be an issue that requires some remedial action, and we note that officials are considering this issue as part of the tax policy work programme. 47. To address the issues outlined in paragraph 43 above, the Group recommends providing the Commissioner with the ability to require a shareholder to provide security to the Commissioner if: (i) their company owes a debt to Inland Revenue; (ii) the company is owed a debt by the shareholder; and (iii) there is doubt as to the ability and/or intention of the shareholder to repay the current account. The hidden economy 48. There are many ways to describe the hidden economy: it has been called the cash economy, the informal economy, the shadow economy, and the underground economy. The hidden economy arises because some taxpayers decide to hide some or all of their income. These actions – which can often seem innocuous to the participants – directly affect the integrity of the tax system. Policy considerations 49. There are three major types of hidden economy activities. The first is the under-reporting of income, for example by reducing the reported value of a transaction (often known as ‘skimming’). Then there are cash-in-hand transactions, which involve collusion by both the payer and the payee to ensure the payment is not officially recorded or declared at all. The final is the use of offshore technology platforms, which may provide opportunities to conceal income earned in New Zealand. Money laundering is also an essential part of the hidden economy, because it is the means to convert illegal gains into seemingly legitimate wealth. 70 Although it should be noted that New Zealand is part of a very wide network of countries, which have tax treaties in place to facilitate the sharing of information about taxpayers to prevent tax evasion and assist in the verification of tax compliance. 71 The degree of under-reporting in New Zealand is broadly comparable to estimates for the United Kingdom and Canada; other countries, such as Greece and the United States, experience much higher rates of under-reporting (Cabral and Gemmell 2018). 50. Taxpayers participate in the hidden economy for many reasons. They are heavily influenced by the experience of other taxpayers and the visibility of the tax authority’s enforcement activities – they are more likely to engage in non-compliance if they think there is a low risk of being caught. High compliance costs or regulatory uncertainty also tend to encourage participation in the hidden economy. 51. The opportunity to evade tax is also a feature. In some cases this means the ability to receive cash for a transaction, or to route it through an offshore technology platform or bank account in another country (where Inland Revenue may not have as much access to information). 70 52. The other major cause of hidden economy activity stems from social mores and beliefs. Some people see aspects of the hidden economy – such as cash jobs or use of an offshore platform – as a victimless crime; others may not even realise they are doing anything wrong. Sometimes, business owners argue that they need to circumvent the tax system to keep up with their non-compliant competitors. In each case, these actions reflect a belief that no real wrong-doing is involved, or that everyone else is doing it anyway. 53. The hidden economy has a corrosive effect on the tax system. It undermines the sense of fairness that is necessary to sustain high levels of voluntary self-compliance. It also means that compliant taxpayers must pay more to make up for the lost revenue. 54. By its very nature, the hidden economy is difficult to identify and measure. Nevertheless, the loss of revenue from hidden economy activities is likely to be substantial. As one example, recent research from Victoria University has estimated that self-employed individuals under-reported an average of 20% of their gross income (Cabral and Gemmell 2018). 71 This alone may result in an annual loss of $850 million of revenue. 115 Future of Tax Interim Report 55. Since 2010, Inland Revenue has received additional funding for intelligence, marketing, and tax audit activity; Budget 2018 also provided funding to enhance the withholding rules for labour income and the use of third-party reporting systems. Assessment 56. The Group welcomes the positive impact of Inland Revenue’s education and marketing campaigns, and is also pleased to see that there is now greater information sharing between Inland Revenue and other Government agencies. 57. Yet the Group believes further action is necessary. The Group strongly supports an increase in the reporting of labour income, through the use of additional withholding taxes and third party reporting systems or platforms. In some cases, this will require access to data sets held by third parties, such as digital platform providers. It will also require greater access to anti-money- laundering information. The Group’s view on this is subject to measures not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business. Any increase in withholding or reporting obligations need to fit in with existing business capabilities. 58. The Group also welcomes further efforts to prevent the use of offshore platforms to conceal income, whether those measures are increased reporting or additional withholding taxes. The Government should ensure that tax law is complied with when income and activity is in New Zealand - even if it occurs using an offshore technology platform with a country we do not exchange information with. 59. The Group notes that New Zealand is changing and so Inland Revenue must continue to tailor its products to the changing demographics to ensure that all taxpayers are aware of their obligations. 60. The Group supports the measures outlined in the recent Australian review of the hidden economy. The Government should review those measures with a view to applying them to New Zealand. 61. The Group also supports firm action to discourage undeclared cash-in-hand transactions. The Group recommends removing tax deductibility in circumstances where a payer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. The Group notes the Australian Government has recently announced their intention to adopt a similar compliance measure. Inland Revenue tax technical capability 62. The Group wholeheartedly endorses the increase in data analytics capability that will be possible following Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation process, and its ability to screen and filter cases for investigations. 63. The Group also notes that the integrity issues identified in this report, and ones identified in the past, have come from the work of technically skilled investigators. No matter how good the tax policy and tax administration systems are, tax investigation is a complicated task, and so Inland Revenue must continue to invest in deep and significant technical capability across its investigation staff. Collection 64. The Government’s objectives for the revenue system spell out the importance of collection (Government of New Zealand 2018). Collecting taxes is important because it underpins public perceptions of the fairness and integrity of the tax system. All the tax rules and obligations are irrelevant if the revenue is not ultimately collected. More effective collection also has the benefit of increasing revenue without the need for any change to existing tax assessment settings. The current approach to collection 65. Most people pay their tax through the PAYE and GST system. Such taxpayers rarely have to interact with Inland Revenue, yet are very compliant with the tax obligations. On the other hand, sole traders, companies and trusts have considerable scope to run up tax debt. 116 Future of Tax Interim Report 66. Inland Revenue’s ability to collect tax debt is subject to four main constraints: • Taxpayers are entitled to several safeguards under the Inland Revenue Acts, including the ability to dispute a tax assessment, and the right to request debt relief. • The general law governing companies and trusts means that there are additional constraints on collection that don’t arise with collecting from individuals. • Inland Revenue deals with a large number of tax debtors, so it must prioritise its resources to maximise recovery and maintain public confidence in the tax system. • Inland Revenue does not get to choose who it deals with. All New Zealanders must pay tax, so Inland Revenue must take a long-term view on building compliance across the population. 67. Inland Revenue’s Compliance Model is built around a behavioural approach as to whether a taxpayer is ‘disorganised,’ ‘can’t pay,’ or simply ‘won’t pay.’ The Compliance Model places a strong emphasis on understanding the taxpayer’s perspective of the tax system and proactively influencing behaviour before non- compliance occurs. This also continues after the tax debt is incurred. 68. One of the significant challenges in the collection of tax is that the inherent collectability of a tax debt differs depending on what type of entity is the taxpayer – is it a person, a company, a trust, etc. The pursuit of a tax debt against a person can result in that person’s bankruptcy. The pursuit of a tax debt against a company can result in a liquidation order against the company, but the individuals behind the company are unaffected, free to start another company that might repeat the cycle of non-payment of tax. Policy considerations 69. While Inland Revenue’s overall approach follows best practice, the Group has identified a number of challenges and opportunities for improving fairness in collection between different vehicles used. Company debt and the corporate veil 70. In particular, the Group has identified a major gap in the current collections model: the use of company structures to incur significant tax debt to Inland Revenue, without any real hope or expectation of repayment. These issues do not arise when debt is incurred by an individual, because of the risk of bankruptcy. 71. This gap arises as a result of two important concepts in company law: • The corporate veil – which treats the company as a separate legal person from its shareholders. • Limited liability – which means the financial liability of a shareholder for their company’s debts is limited to the capital commitment of their shares. 72. The corporate veil and limited liability protection support entrepreneurial risk-taking, because they allow shareholders to operate a business without risking their personal assets. At the same time, though, they allow delinquent directors and shareholders to incur significant PAYE debt and other tax arrears, secure in the knowledge that the debt will stay ring-fenced in the company, with little risk to their personal assets. 73. Other OECD jurisdictions take a more balanced approach to these issues. Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom all have the power of direct recourse against directors who default on their employee tax deductions. In Australia, for example, directors are personally liable for arrears on employee deduction payments under the Director Penalty Notice regime. 117 Future of Tax Interim Report 74. There are important trade-offs associated with the introduction of a similar regime in New Zealand. A stringent liability regime may discourage entrepreneurship and deter people from seeking directorships. Yet, in the Group’s view, there will be significant integrity and revenue benefits from lowering the corporate veil in certain circumstances. However, a warning system must be in place before this occurs as is the case in Australia. This is to protect directors from exposure to liabilities from defaults that they could not reasonably be expected to be aware of. Departure prohibition orders 75. The Group has also discussed the merits of the Australian Departure Prohibition Order, which can prohibit a taxpayer from leaving Australia until their tax liability is resolved. 76. Inland Revenue can already apply to the courts for arrest warrants (which have the effect of preventing taxpayers from leaving New Zealand), but there may be a role for departure prohibition orders in cases that are not sufficiently serious to justify a warrant. Criminal penalties 77. During the course of its discussion, the Group has noted that the threshold for proving knowledge-based PAYE and GST offences differ: • For PAYE, culpability arises when an employer makes a PAYE deduction and is aware that the funds should have been paid to Inland Revenue, but instead applies the funds to another purpose (such as paying other creditors). • For GST, it is not sufficient to demonstrate that the funds were collected and not paid by the business; Inland Revenue must go further and demonstrate that the taxpayer had the intention to evade the tax. 78. Given that both PAYE and GST are meant to be collected and promptly paid over by a business, there appears to be no good reason for the different standards of proof required. Collection agency 79. At the moment, all agencies (including Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development) are responsible for collecting unpaid debts arising from their specific legislation. This means each agency must maintain specialist debt collection capacity, which is entirely different to the general skill sets required to carry out the agency’s core responsibilities. Also, while these agencies will at times be interacting with the same individual, they all have different powers to collect, and different abilities to write off debt. 80. The Group has received a submission proposing the creation of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency. The submitter argued that a centralised agency would realise greater economies of scale and achieve more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. A single agency would support the review and standardisation of the Crown’s approach to debt collection, as well as enhance the specialisation and professionalism of the staff engaged in this work. The Group agrees with these arguments and recommends the creation of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency. Assessment 81. The Group supports Inland Revenue’s general approach to collection, but believes more can be done to increase collection and encourage compliance. 82. In particular, the Group recommends that the Government explore measures to allow for company PAYE and GST debts to be imposed on directors personally through a Director Penalty Notice regime. The Group also recommends the establishment of a single centralised Crown debt collections agency. 83. Other options for improving compliance include an alignment of standards of proof for PAYE and GST offences, and the use of departure prohibition orders. The Group seeks to advance these proposals for the final report. 118 Future of Tax Interim Report Summary The Group recommends: 15.1 A review of loss-trading, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss continuity rules for companies. 15.2 That Inland Revenue have the ability to require a shareholder to provide security to Inland Revenue if: (i) the company owes a debt to Inland Revenue; (ii) the company is owed a debt by the shareholder; and (iii) there is doubt as to the ability/and or the intention of the shareholder to repay the debt. 15.3 Further action in relation to the hidden economy, including: – an increase in the reporting of labour income (subject to not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business); – a review of the measures recently adopted by Australia in relation to the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand; and – the removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. 15.4 That Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. 15.5 Further measures to improve collection and encourage compliance, including: • making directors personally liable for arrears on GST and PAYE obligations (as long as there is an appropriate warning system); • departure prohibition orders; • an alignment of the standard of proof for PAYE and GST offences. 15.6 The establishment of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. 119 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Charities and not-for-profits make important contributions to the wellbeing of New Zealand. The not-for-profit sector supports efforts to bolster our social, human, and natural capital, and is a direct expression of manaakitanga, kaitiakitanga, and whanaungatanga. The economic activities of charities and not-for- profits – as the recipients of donations and the owners of business enterprises – also affect the accumulation of physical and financial capital in the New Zealand economy. 2. In Te Ao Māori, koha (giving) is an expression of manaakitanga which is practiced in conjunction with utu (reciprocity). Utu sets a code of conduct which ensures that the behaviour of participants is fair, respectful, and transparent. Ensuring the fairness of the charitable sector gives effect to manaakitanga, and encourages communities to continue to look after each other. 3. The Government supports the work of charities through various means. The primary means of support for charities in the tax system is an exemption on passive income and business income. 72 Charities and certain not-for-profit organisations can also be treated as ‘donee organisations,’ which allows taxpayers to receive tax benefits for monetary donations to those organisations. 73 Charitable organisations also benefit from a fringe benefit tax exemption and concessional treatment under the GST Act. 72 Not-for-profit entities that fail to meet the requirements for the exemption are taxable on their income, but can access a concessionary income tax deduction of up to $1000. 73 An individual who donates to a donee organisation receive a donation tax credit of 33⅓% of the value of the donation, while a company or a Māori authority will receive a tax deduction. 74 This is either through the donations tax credit for individuals or a deduction for companies and Māori Authorities. 75 The source of this information is the “Non-profit institutions satellite account, 2013”, published by Statistics New Zealand in June 2016. Statistics New Zealand plans to publish the next release in March 2020 (for the 2018 financial year). 4. The effect of the tax treatment is that no tax revenue is received by Government in respect of donations to charities 74 or the activities carried on by the charity. In this respect, the charitable sector essentially replaces Government decision-making and policy on how best to bolster our social, human and natural capital. 5. The Group believes that how the charitable sector is using what would otherwise be tax revenue available to Government should be subject to review from time to time in order to verify that the social outcomes are being achieved. The Group supports the inclusion of the tax treatment of the charitable sector on Inland Revenue’s work programme, as announced in May 2018. 6. Contributions to the charitable sector have increased over time. According to Statistics New Zealand, the number of not-for-profits rose from 97,000 in 2004 to 114,110 in 2013. Donations, non-government grants and membership fees to not-for-profits rose 40 percent, from $1.9 billion in 2004 to $2.7 billion in 2013. In 2013 the sector contributed 4.4% to GDP. 75 16 Charities 120 Future of Tax Interim Report 7. The not-for-profit sector includes 27,000 charities registered with the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) under the Charities Act 2005. For the 2016-17 income year, DIA’s register shows that charities earned gross income of $18 billion and managed total assets of $59 billion. 8. Inland Revenue data shows that an increasing amount of business income is moving from the tax base into the tax exempt charity sector; significant taxable businesses are owned and operated by charitable operators. DIA Charities Services data shows that the number of charities with income from goods and services activities has not substantially grown over recent years however the size of the charities currently undertaking these activities appear to be growing. Additionally, DIA has observed an increase in start-up businesses registering as charities and seeking wider donations to support their business activity. 9. While many charities are standalone organisations, a number of entities – such as corporates, local authorities, and Māori authorities – have charities as part of their group structures (to varying degrees). 10. The not-for-profit sector includes many small entities – such as clubs and societies – that are not eligible to be registered charities under the Charities Act, as they do not operate for the public benefit, or choose not to register because the costs of registration outweigh the benefits. Additionally, tax concessions for the purposes of fringe benefit tax and GST are not based on whether the relevant entity is a registered charity. The entities accessing those concessions are a larger category than registered charities. 11. The Group acknowledges that the Government has launched a review of the Charities Act 2005, in order to ensure that the Act remains effective and fit-for-purpose. Following the conclusion of that review, the Group suggests that the Government consider whether the issues identified in this chapter have been fully addressed, or whether further action on tax matters is required. Business income 12. Income derived from the business activity of a charity, and of entities owned by charities, is exempt from income tax. Charities may use businesses for a variety of reasons; to maximise returns to further charitable purposes or, provide goods and services at less than commercial margins to meet identified community needs. The Group has received many submissions arguing that this treatment confers an unfair advantage on the trading operations of charities. 13. The most recent review of the Australian tax system – the Henry Review – considered this issue and concluded that income tax concessions for not-for-profit organisations should be retained. Then Henry Review argued that the tax concessions do not confer a competitive advantage because: • A trading operation owned by a charity has a profit maximising objective in order to grow the funds used to support the charitable purpose. This means the trading operation faces the same incentives as a commercial entity when it comes to setting its prices and its tax-exempt status will not lead to it undercutting its rivals. • As a charity can earn tax-free income from an alternative passive investment (for example, a bank deposit), the tax concession for trading income would not distort the charity’s behaviour compared with a taxpaying entity. (Henry 2009) 14. The principle of competitive neutrality provides a rationale for taxing each taxpayer’s active and passive income at the same rate. This, in turn, suggests a case to provide a charitable exemption for business income if the passive income of a charity is exempt. On the other hand, a charitable business that does not distribute its income will be able to accumulate capital faster than an equivalent taxpaying business. 121 Future of Tax Interim Report Accumulation and distribution 15. This suggests the underlying issue is more about the extent to which charitable entities are distributing or applying surpluses from their activities (active or passive) for the benefit of the charitable purpose qualifying them for the tax exemption. If a charitable business is regularly distributing funds to its head charity, or providing services connected with its charitable purposes, it will not accumulate capital any faster than a taxpaying business. 16. The Group takes the view that the accumulated assets and income of all charitable business and charitable organisations should be used for charitable purposes in order to qualify for the tax exemption. 76 17. However, the Group is aware that some charities may have good reasons to accumulate funds (for example, to save for the acquisition or construction of capital assets, to prepare for large crises in the future, or to take an intergenerational view towards the management of assets), so changes to the current exemption should only be made if these charities could be adequately protected. 18. The Government’s review of the Charities Act 2005 includes consideration of the obligations of registered charities. This aspect of the review could shed further light on the issues of accumulation and distribution. The Group would be comfortable, as a matter of process, for the Government to consider the tax aspects of the treatment of charities after this legislative review has concluded. Private foundations 19. Under current New Zealand law, individuals may establish private charitable foundations and charitable trusts, and receive the same donation tax credit and gift deductions as if they had donated to an arm’s-length donee organisation. The size of these donor tax concessions 76 This could be by way of a proportionate distribution requirement (for example a ‘safe harbour’ distribution) of a proportion of annual income akin to a public company return to shareholders. Another option is to tax the income of charities in the first instance, but tax paid would be able to be refunded if the income met certain requirements of having been applied or distributed. has increased significantly since caps on the donation tax credit were lifted in 2009. In many cases, these tax-preferred donations form the capital base of the foundation, which then receives a charitable tax exemption on income earned from the capital. 20. These private foundations and charitable trusts are not required to have arm’s-length governance boards. This means the donor and their associates may decide the focus and distribution policy of the foundation or charitable trust. These foundations and charitable trusts may also invest into businesses controlled by the settlors or by associates of the settlors – sometimes on non-market terms. 20. There may also be minimal use of foundation or charitable trust funds for charitable purposes, with no particular distributions policy and no rationale for accumulation except a desire for the fund to be self-sustaining in the future, or for foundation and charitable trust distributions to occur years after donation tax relief has been obtained. 21. New Zealand’s approach to these organisations is unusual. Private foundations are subject to specific rules in other jurisdictions. In Australia, for example, ‘private ancillary funds’ play a key role in private philanthropy. They offer tax deductions for donations and benefit from income tax exemptions. Yet they are also subject to certain requirements: for example, they must make a minimum annual distribution of 5 percent of assets to charitable organisations, and they must invest prudently in accordance with a written investment policy. 22. The Government should consider whether New Zealand should apply a similar distinction between privately-controlled foundations and other charitable organisations. 122 Future of Tax Interim Report Deregistration 23. Special tax rules apply to charities that are deregistered under the Charities Act 2005. The rules require the assets of a deregistered charity to be disposed or transferred within twelve months. If there is no disposal or transfer, the deregistered charity will be subject to income tax on the value of its net assets at its normal income tax rate. 24. The purpose of the rules is to protect the integrity of the revenue base. If an entity has claimed charitable tax exemptions and accumulated assets, these assets should always be destined for a charitable purpose, even if the entity is deregistered. 25. The income tax due date is typically at least 24 months after the date the charity is deregistered. This means there could be a considerable time value of money benefit between when income tax would have been due (if the entity were not a charity), and when it is finally paid as a tax on deregistration. This may not be an issue if the amounts involved are minor; nevertheless, the Group does want to ensure that the benefits of this delay are not used inappropriately by some entities. 25. New Zealand’s approach to deregistration is similar to other jurisdictions, but less robust. Canada, for example, keeps charitable assets in the sector by applying a tax equal to the entire net value of the assets of a revoked charity, which they can only reduce by transferring their assets to an eligible donee. 26. The Government should consider whether the New Zealand deregistration tax rules could be amended to more effectively keep assets in the sector, or ensure that there is no deferral benefit through the use – and then deregistration – of charitable structures. Charities and GST 27. Under the GST Act, non-profit bodies can access a tax concession which allows input tax deductions for all GST incurred other than in making exempt supplies. Other businesses, in contrast, need to establish the extent to which goods and services are applied in making taxable supplies for input tax to be deductible. 28. The concession allows non-profit bodies to claim far more input tax deductions, which will often exceed output tax payable. This concession can make it easier for non-profit bodies than for other entities to achieve the desired rate of return needed for investment. 29. New Zealand’s approach is distinctive. Jurisdictions with comparable VAT or GST systems have more restrictive tests that apply to the deduction of input tax, with the effect that some not-for-profit bodies are treated as final consumers and bear the cost of GST on their activities. Including only non-profit body commercial activities in the GST base could be more consistent with GST’s broad base framework as it would still tax private (or end- user) consumption. 30. The Group recommends that the Government review whether it is appropriate to treat some not-for-profit organisations as if they were final consumers, or, alternatively, whether it is appropriate to limit the GST concessions to a smaller group of non-profit bodies, such as registered charities. 123 Future of Tax Interim Report Summary The Group: 16.1 Believes the Government should periodically review the charitable sector’s use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that intended social outcomes are being achieved. 16.2 Supports the Government’s inclusion of a review of the tax treatment of the charitable sector on its tax policy work programme, as announced in May 2018. 16.3 Notes the income tax exemption for charitable entities’ trading operations was perceived by some submitters to provide an unfair advantage over commercial entities’ trading operations. 16.4 Notes, however, the underlying issue is the extent to which charitable entities are accumulating surpluses rather than distributing or applying those surpluses for the benefit of their charitable activities. 16.5 Recommends the Government consider whether to apply a distinction between privately-controlled foundations and other charitable organisations. 16.6 Recommends the Government consider whether to amend the deregistration tax rules to more effectively keep assets in the sector, or to ensure there is no deferral benefit through the application of these rules. 16.7 Recommends the Government review whether it is appropriate to treat some not- for-profit organisations as if they were final consumers, or, alternatively, to limit GST concessions to a smaller group of non-profit bodies such as registered charities. 16.8 Recommends the Government consider whether the issues identified in this chapter have been fully addressed or whether further action is required, following the conclusion of the review of the Charities Act 2005. 124 Future of Tax Interim Report 1. Tax policy is given effect, day in and day out, through the administration of the tax system. The quality of administration is central to public perceptions of the legitimacy and fairness of tax policy; the effectiveness of administration will determine the Government’s ability to achieve its policy intent in levying taxation. 2. At its heart, the tax system relies on an implicit social contract between citizens and the Government, because the Government’s ability to tax ultimately depends on the consent and acceptance of its citizens. A well-administered system will raise revenue fairly and efficiently and provide a predictable outcome for taxpayers – but a poorly-administered system will undermine the public trust that sustains prevailing levels of taxation, as well as the spirit of voluntary self-compliance by taxpayers that underpins efficient tax collection. 3. The long-term sustainability of tax policy settings also depends on public understanding and acceptance of the major policy settings. The government thus has a kaitiaki (stewardship) role in ensuring there is broad buy-in to the legitimacy of the tax system. Inland Revenue has built strong relationships with tax practitioners, but wider groups of stakeholders also need to see their views reflected in the design and administration of tax policy, or the consensus underpinning the system will begin to fray. 4. Tax administration must be consistent with the principle of manaakitanga (care for others). This means the system should welcome all groups into the design and administration of tax policy; it also means the system should be simple to use and easy to navigate, especially for those who find it difficult to engage with Government agencies and processes. 5. There are many facets of tax administration that could potentially be explored. In this chapter, however, the Group will focus on four key issues that affect public perceptions of the tax system: the approach to tax secrecy; the resolution of tax disputes; the process for the development of tax policy; and the way in which participants in the system perceive the purpose of the legislation. Tax secrecy and tax transparency 6. Tax secrecy is a topical issue at the moment. Internationally, the lack of transparency around the tax affairs of some wealthy individuals and some multinational companies may be undermining public confidence in the fairness and integrity of tax systems around the globe. 7. New Zealand, like other countries, must find the right balance between protecting the privacy of individual taxpayers and protecting personal and commercially sensitive information held by Inland Revenue and providing sufficient information about the way the system operates, without compromising Inland Revenue’s ability to perform its functions, so that taxpayers can have confidence in its fairness and impartiality. 17 The administration of the tax system 125 Future of Tax Interim Report Policy considerations 8. There are good reasons for some degree of confidentiality in the tax system. Confidentiality rules act as a balance to Inland Revenue’s broad information gathering powers and encourage taxpayers to provide information with the assurance that their information will be used and protected appropriately; they protect information that is commercially sensitive, and information about sensitive personal relationships. 9. New Zealand’s current tax secrecy rules, however, are very broad. The Tax Administration Act 1994 requires Inland Revenue to maintain the secrecy of all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts. Information cannot be disclosed except for the purposes of ‘carrying into effect’ the Inland Revenue Acts, or if disclosure is necessary for the purpose of performing a duty of Inland Revenue. The broad scope of the secrecy rule means that much information cannot be released – even if release will not breach the confidentiality of individual taxpayers, and even if there will be public benefit from access to the information. 10. Other countries take a very different approach to tax secrecy and tax transparency. In Sweden, for example, tax decisions are normally public (Nergelius 2017). Similarly, tax return information is publically available for most individuals and entities in Norway (Devos and Zackrisson 2015). Closer to home, Australia has also taken a number of measures to increase tax transparency, including the development of a voluntary tax transparency code for medium and large businesses. 11. Public submitters have suggested that New Zealand should emulate the approaches taken in other countries, and adopt greater transparency in the tax system. Some submitters argued that tax transparency could be used as a means to reduce tax avoidance by multinational companies, while others were more focused on the potential to use statistical information from Inland Revenue for research purposes. 77 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced into Parliament in June 2018. 12. The Government recently introduced a Bill to narrow the scope of the current tax secrecy rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 77 The Bill will focus the secrecy rules on the protection of information that relates to individual taxpayers and that could identify them (or is otherwise private or commercially sensitive). This approach is more closely aligned with the approach taken in jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada. 13. The lack of good statistical information has hampered empirical research about the New Zealand tax system. One major benefit of the Government’s Bill is that it will become far simpler for Inland Revenue to release statistical information, which in turn will enrich research and debate about the tax system. 14. The Group considers that: • Inland Revenue should have the ability to publish aggregated data and information that does not reveal information about individuals nor information about individual corporates that would not otherwise be publicly available (for example, in annual financial reports). • Inland Revenue should be encouraged to publish or make available a broader range of statistics, in consultation with potential users, either directly or (preferably) through Statistics New Zealand. • As our economy shifts onto a more environmentally sustainable base, the Group has discussed whether the tax system can help collect data to inform and support this transition. At a minimum, Inland Revenue should collect information on income and expenditure associated with environmental outcomes that are part of the tax calculation. 126 Future of Tax Interim Report 15. Underlying these recommendations is a broader point: Inland Revenue should review whether the information and data that it currently collects offer the most useful insights, or whether other sets of information and data would better inform policy development and research, respond to public interest, and build public understanding about the tax system. The Group will take a further look at the information and data collected by Inland Revenue in the Final Report. Assessment 16. The Group strongly encourages the Government to release more statistical and aggregated information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publicly available). Tax disputes 17. Even in the most well-designed tax system, disputes will inevitably arise between some taxpayers and the tax administration. In order to maintain public confidence in the administration of the tax system, it is crucial that these disputes are handled in a way that is perceived by all stakeholders to be fair and impartial. 18. The Group is aware that some stakeholders are concerned about current dispute resolution processes in the tax system. The Group has heard that the resolution of even simple cases can require substantial efforts in terms of time, effort, and cost. This, in turn, creates a risk that some taxpayers with legitimate cases are ‘burnt off’ by the process because they cannot afford the time or money necessary to continue proceedings. 19. The Group also acknowledges that the effect of many of its recommendations will be to increase the powers held by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. As an appropriate check and balance, the Group has therefore considered whether to bolster the rights of taxpayers in the process of dispute resolution. The role of the Ombudsman 20. Taxpayers already have the right to complain to the Ombudsman if they have not resolved a dispute through Inland Revenue’s complaints management service. 21. As a means of strengthening the Ombudsman’s role, the Group has discussed a proposal to establish a Deputy Ombudsman position with sole responsibility for complaints involving Inland Revenue. The new Deputy Ombudsman position would supplement the existing tax expertise in the Office of the Ombudsman. 22. The Group is not convinced that a new Deputy Ombudsman position is necessary. However, the Group believes the Office of the Ombudsman should have sufficient knowledge of the tax system to deal with complaints that Inland Revenue has been unable to resolve, and notes there is existing capacity and knowledge within the Office to handle complaints about Inland Revenue. The Office should also deal with complaints arising from the operation of the new Crown debt collection agency that the Group is proposing, and may need additional support in the event of an unsustainable increase in the volume of complaints relating to that. 23. The Group is of the view that the scope for accessing the Ombudsman should be similar to that for Judicial Review. Outside of that scope, the individual agency should be seeking to resolve the complaint. 24. The Group suggests that any further expansion of the resources available to the Ombudsman should include consideration of provision for additional tax expertise within the Office, and possibly support to manage any increase in the volume of complaints relating to the new combined debt agency proposed by the Group. 127 Future of Tax Interim Report Taxpayer advocate service 25. The Group has also considered a proposal to establish a taxpayer advocate service that would assist certain taxpayers – such as low income earners, small businesses, and individuals with English as a second language – in disputes with Inland Revenue. The advocate could play multiple roles, including the provision of advice, and facilitation and mediation services. 26. The Group believes that a taxpayer advocate service could play a valuable role in the fair resolution of tax disputes. The service would need to be functionally independent from Inland Revenue in order to serve as a credible advocate for the taxpayer in dispute, but it might be able to draw on back-office support from Inland Revenue. The Group suggests that the structure of Departmental Agency would be most appropriate. It would be contained within Inland Revenue and report directly to the Minister of Revenue, rather than the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 27. The Group recommends that the Government establish a taxpayer advocate service to assist with the resolution of tax disputes. The Group is also currently considering the merits of a truncated dispute resolution process for small disputes. The development of tax policy 28. Since 1994, tax policy has been developed using the Generic Tax Policy Process. The Generic Tax Policy Process sets out a number of phases for tax policy development, with the aim of ensuring there is early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs, as well as opportunities for substantial external input into policy formulation. 29. The five phases of tax policy development are as follows: • The strategic phase involves the development of the Government’s economic strategy, fiscal strategy and three-year revenue strategy. Broad policy proposals may be publicised through channels such as Budget documentation. • The tactical phase involves the development of a three-year work programme and annual resource plan to implement the revenue strategy. This process allows for the initial scoping and development of policy options, and may involve public consultation. • The operational phase consists of detailed policy design, with public consultation on the design details. This phase culminates in Ministerial and/or Cabinet approval of tax policy initiatives. • The legislative phase involves the translation of policy decisions into legislation. External consultation takes place through public submissions to the select committee considering the bill. • The implementation and review phase includes the post-implementation review of new legislation and the identification of any remedial issues. Assessment 30. The Group received a number of submissions setting out concerns with how the Generic Tax Policy Process is currently operating. The Group acknowledges those concerns. Inland Revenue is currently exploring options to improve the Generic Tax Policy Process. The Group supports these efforts, in particular to ensure that a wider range of voices is heard in the policy development process. 31. In the course of developing refinements to the Generic Tax Policy Process, the Group recommends that the following principles should be applied to public engagement: • Good faith engagement by all participants. • Engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, particularly including greater engagement with Māori (guided by the Government’s emerging engagement model for Crown/Māori Relations). • Earlier and more frequent engagement. • The use of a greater variety of engagement methods. • Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government. 128 Future of Tax Interim Report 32. The Group notes that it is essential for the Treasury to play a strong role in the development of tax policy. The Group welcomes the recent strengthening of the Treasury’s tax capability, and recommends that the Treasury maintains high levels of resourcing in the area. 33. The Group also wishes to stress the importance of maintaining deep, senior tax technical expertise within Inland Revenue’s policy function. There is nothing to indicate that tax policy in the future will become less complex or technically demanding, so it is vital that Inland Revenue continues to invest in its technical policy capability. At the same time, it is vital to complement this technical capability with strategic policy expertise. Legislative frameworks 34. The primary task of the Group has been to focus on tax policy, rather than on the legislation through which tax policy is given effect. Nevertheless, the Group has discussed the use of purpose clauses in tax legislation to give clearer statements of the purpose of the legislation. Policy considerations 35. There are currently three main Acts relating to taxation: the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the Income Tax Act 2007. 36. The Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007 have short and rather technical purpose clauses that do not explain Parliament’s overriding intent in levying taxation; the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has no purpose clause at all. Purpose clauses are now used if appropriate when new taxing regimes are introduced, however these are regime specific. 37. An overriding purpose clause would spell out the ultimate reason for levying taxation – to raise the revenue that is necessary to support the Government in its endeavours to enhance the wellbeing of New Zealanders. 38. The Tax Administration Act 1994 is the only Act that encompasses all tax legislation. 39. An overriding purpose clause to be introduced in the Tax Administration Act 1994 could explain that the legislation specifies: • The rules for effective and efficient administration and collection of tax revenues, so the Government can improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders. • The rights and obligations of taxpayers. • The rights and obligations of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 40. Another possible addition could be a reference, for each of these, to the parliamentary intent of the legislation. The suggested change could buttress the Parliamentary Contemplation test in the general anti-avoidance rule, and focus taxpayers and the courts on the original intent of the legislation, in addition to the specific language of the legislation. Assessment 41. The Group encourages the continuing use of purpose clauses where appropriate and recommends the inclusion of an overriding purpose clause in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify Parliament’s purpose in levying taxation. 129 Future of Tax Interim Report Summary The Group: 17.1 The Group strongly encourages the Government to release more statistical and aggregated information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publicly available).The Government could consider further measures to increase transparency as public attitudes change over time. 17.2 Encourages Inland Revenue to publish or make available a broader range of statistics, in consultation with potential users, either directly or (preferably) through Statistics New Zealand. 17.3 Encourages Inland Revenue to collect information on income and expenditure associated with environmental outcomes that are part of the tax calculation. 17.4 Recommends that any further expansion of the resources available to the Ombudsman include consideration of provision for additional tax expertise within the Office, and possibly support to manage any increase in the volume of complaints relating to the new Crown debt collection agency proposed by the Group. 17.5 Recommends the establishment of a taxpayer advocate service to assist with the resolution of tax disputes. 17.6 Recommends the use of the following principles in public engagement on tax policy: • Good faith engagement by all participants. • Engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, particularly including greater engagement with Māori (guided by the Government’s emerging engagement model for Crown/Māori Relations). • Earlier and more frequent engagement. • The use of a greater variety of engagement methods. • Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government. 17.7 Notes the need for the Treasury to play a strong role in tax policy development, and the importance of Inland Revenue maintaining deep technical expertise and strategic policy capability. 17.8 Encourages the continuing use of purpose clauses where appropriate and recommends the inclusion of an overriding purpose clause in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify Parliament’s purpose in levying taxation. 130 Future of Tax Interim Report Part IV Summary 131 Future of Tax Interim Report 18 Summary of recommendations The Group has discussed many issues over the past six months. Yet there is also much to do before the presentation of the Final Report in February 2019. Already, however, the Group has identified a range of opportunities to improve the fairness, balance, and structure of the tax system. This chapter summarises the decisions and recommendations emerging from the Group’s work to date. It also notes area where further analysis is contemplated. The Group’s views on these issues are by no means final, and feedback is welcome. Together, we can shape the future of tax. Capital & Wealth 6.1 The Group is still forming its views on the best approach towards extending the taxation of capital income. Only once such an extension is designed can a meaningful comparison take place between different options and the status quo. Appendix B sets out the Group’s initial thinking on further design features of broad- based taxation of capital income. The Group will work toward its ultimate recommendations in the Final Report. Retirement Savings The Group recommends that the Government: 7.1 Remove ESCT on the employer’s matching contribution of 3% of salary to KiwiSaver for members earning up to $48,000 per year. 7.2 Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points each. 7.3 Consider ways to simplify the determination of the PIE rates (which would apply to KiwiSaver). The Group will give further consideration to the taxation of savings in the Final Report, in light of its broader conclusions on the tax system. Housing Affordability 8.1 The Group’s work on housing affordability is closely linked with its work on the taxation of capital income. The Group will have particular regard to housing market impacts as it finalises its recommendations regarding capital income. Environmental & Ecological Outcomes 9.1 There is significant scope for the tax instruments to play a greater role in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes in New Zealand. Environmental tax instruments can be a powerful tool for ensuring people and companies better understand and account for the impact of their actions on the ecosystems on which they depend. 9.2 Taxes are not well suited to all environmental problems and regulation will still be a better approach for dealing with some issues. The Group has prepared a draft framework identifies a range of criteria and design principles for environmental taxes to be effective. Environmental taxation and regulation should be considered together for positive outcomes. 9.3 In the short term, there may be benefits in expanding the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy, and for reassessing waste and landfill disposal externalities to see if higher rates are warranted. There could also be benefits from strengthening the ETS and advancing congestion charging. Over the medium term, there could be benefits from greater use of tax instruments to address challenges in both water pollution and water abstraction. Addressing 132 Future of Tax Interim Report Māori rights and interests in fresh water should be central to any changes. In the longer term, new tools could allow for an expanded role for environmental taxes to address other challenges such as biodiversity loss and impacts on ecosystem services. Corrective Taxes The Group: 10.1 Recommends that the Government review the rate structure of alcohol excise with the intention of rationalising and simplifying it. 10.2 Recommends that the Government prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate. 10.3 Recommends that the Government develop a clearer articulation of its goals with regard to sugar consumption and gambling activity. International Income Tax The Group: 11.1 Supports New Zealand’s continued participation in OECD discussions on the future of the international tax framework. 11.2 Recommends that the Government be ready to implement an equalisation tax if a critical mass of other countries (including Australia) move in that direction. 11.3 Recommends that the Government ensure, to the extent possible, that our double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict our taxation options in these matters. GST The Group: 12.1 Recognises the significant public concern regarding GST, but does not recommend a reduction in the rate of GST. This is because lowering the GST rate would not be as effective at targeting low- and middle-income families as either: • Welfare transfers (for low income households); or • Personal income tax changes (for low and middle income earners). 12.2 Does not recommend the removal of GST from certain products, such as food and drink, on the basis that the GST exceptions are complex, poorly targeted for achieving distributional goals, and generate large compliance costs. 12.3 Believes there is a strong in-principle case to apply GST to financial services, but there are significant impediments to a workable system. The Government should monitor international developments in this area. 12.4 Does not recommend the application of GST to explicit fees charged for financial services. 12.5 Recognises that there is active international debate on financial transaction taxes, which should be monitored, but does not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax at this point. The Group has already reported to Ministers on the issue of GST on low-value imported goods, and the Government is advancing that work. Personal Income & The Future of Work The Group: 13.1 Will provide recommendations regarding the rates and thresholds of income tax in the Final Report in February 2019. 13.2 Supports Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, particularly an expansion of the use of withholding tax as far as practicable, including to platform providers such as ride sharing companies. 13.3 Supports the facilitation of technology platforms to assist the self-employed meet their tax obligations through the use of smart accounts or other technology based solutions. 13.4 Recommends that Inland Revenue continues to use data analytics and matching information to specific taxpayers to identify underreporting of income. 13.5 Recommends that there be a review of the current GST requirements for contractors who are akin to employees. 133 Future of Tax Interim Report 13.6 Recommends that the Government seek to align the definition of employee and dependent contractor for tax and employment purposes. 13.7 Recommends additional Government support for childcare costs, but believes this support is best provided outside the tax system. The Taxation of Business The Group recommends that the Government: 14.1 Retain the imputation system. 14.2 Not reduce the company tax rate at the present time. 14.3 Not introduce a progressive company tax. 14.4 Not introduce an alternative basis of taxation for smaller businesses, such as cashflow or turnover taxes. 14.5 Consider other measures to reduce compliance costs. Depending on the fiscal position, these measures could include: • Increasing the $2,500 threshold for paying provisional tax to $5,000-$10,000. • Increasing the $10,000 year-end closing stock adjustment to $20,000-$30,000. • Increasing the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees, and potentially expanding the automatic deduction to other types of expenditure. 14.6 Not change the thresholds around fixed assets. 14.7 Retain the 17.5% rate for Māori authorities. 14.8 Extend the 17.5% rate to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities. 14.9 Consider technical refinements to the Māori authority rules, as suggested by submitters, in the Tax Policy Work Programme. The Integrity of the Tax System The Group recommends: 15.1 A review of loss-trading, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss continuity rules for companies. 15.2 That Inland Revenue have the ability to require a shareholder to provide security to Inland Revenue if: (i) the company owes a debt to Inland Revenue; (ii) the company is owed a debt by the shareholder; and (iii) there is doubt as to the ability/and or the intention of the shareholder to repay the debt. 15.3 Further action in relation to the hidden economy, including: • An increase in the reporting of labour income (subject to not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business). • A review of the measures recently adopted by Australia in relation to the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand. • The removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. 15.4 That Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. 15.5 Further measures to improve collection and encourage compliance, including: • Making directors personally liable for arrears on employee GST and PAYE obligations (as long as there is an appropriate warning system). • Departure prohibition orders. • An alignment of the standard of proof for PAYE and GST offences. 15.6 The establishment of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. Charities The Group: 16.1 Believes the Government should periodically review the charitable sector’s use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that intended social outcomes are being achieved. 16.2 Supports the Government’s inclusion of a review of the tax treatment of the charitable sector on its tax policy work programme, as announced in May 2018. 134 Future of Tax Interim Report 16.3 Notes the income tax exemption for charitable entities’ trading operations was perceived by some submitters to provide an unfair advantage over commercial entities’ trading operations. 16.4 Notes, however, the underlying issue is the extent to which charitable entities are accumulating surpluses rather than distributing or applying those surpluses for the benefit of their charitable activities. 16.5 Recommends the Government consider whether to apply a distinction between privately-controlled foundations and other charitable organisations. 16.6 Recommends the Government consider whether to amend the deregistration tax rules to more effectively keep assets in the sector, or to ensure there is no deferral benefit through the application of these rules. 16.7 Recommends the Government review whether it is appropriate to treat some not- for-profit organisations as if they were final consumers, or, alternatively, to limit GST concessions to a smaller group of non-profit bodies such as registered charities. 16.8 Recommends the Government consider whether the issues identified in Chapter 16 have been fully addressed or whether further action is required, following the conclusion of the review of the Charities Act 2005. The Administration of the Tax System The Group: 17.1 Strongly encourages the Government to release more statistical and aggregated information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publicly available).The Government could consider further measures to increase transparency as public attitudes change over time. 17.2 Encourages Inland Revenue to publish or make available a broader range of statistics, in consultation with potential users, either directly or (preferably) through Statistics New Zealand. 17.3 Encourages Inland Revenue to collect information on income and expenditure associated with environmental outcomes that are part of the tax calculation. 17.4 Recommends that any further expansion of the resources available to the Ombudsman include consideration of provision for additional tax expertise within the Office, and possibly support to manage any increase in the volume of complaints relating to the new Crown debt collection agency proposed by the Group. 17.5 Recommends the establishment of a taxpayer advocate service to assist with the resolution of tax disputes. 17.6 Recommends the use of the following principles in public engagement on tax policy: • Good faith engagement by all participants. • Engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, particularly including greater engagement with Māori (guided by the Government’s emerging engagement model for Crown/Māori Relations). • Earlier and more frequent engagement. • The use of a greater variety of engagement methods. • Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government. 17.7 Notes the need for the Treasury to play a strong role in tax policy development, and the importance of Inland Revenue maintaining deep technical expertise and strategic policy capability. 17.8 Encourages the continuing use of purpose clauses where appropriate and recommends the inclusion of an overriding purpose clause in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify Parliament’s purpose in levying taxation. 135 Future of Tax Interim Report Appendices 136 Future of Tax Interim Report Appendix A: Methodology for calculating revenue forecasts Extending the taxation of capital income Assumption: Growth rate 1. Residential investment property prices are assumed to appreciate at a 3% nominal annual rate (2% inflation plus 1% real growth rate) similar to what is projected in the 2018 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update. 78 That rate is also used for other categories of real property. 2. New Zealand listed share prices are assumed to appreciate at 3% per year. 79 Assumption: Size of base 3. The table below shows how initial values (from 1 April 2021) were derived from the most recently available data. From the most recent data available, prices are assumed to increase at a rate of 3% per year until 1 April 2021. In addition, the base for residential investment property and commercial and industrial property are assumed to increase by an additional 2.8% to reflect additional building investment.

Assumption: Turnover rate 4. The costing incorporates a realisation basis. For real property categories, average holding periods are taken from Core Logic data as of the first quarter 2018. These are: • Residential investment property – 6.40 years; • Commercial and industrial property – 7.12 years; • Agricultural property – 6.90 years. 5. New Zealand shares are assumed to have an average holding period of two years. 137 Future of Tax Interim Report Risks: Risks that the forecast revenue could be understated 6. Unknown parts of the base – The forecast base uses elements of the base that are known through published statistics – values of real property and New Zealand shares. Some elements of the base are not known and so are not costed. These include – residential property that is not owner-occupied housing or residential investment property (e.g. second homes), shares in Australian listed companies, and shares in private companies and intangible property such as goodwill, brands, trademarks and intellectual property. Risks: Risks that the forecast revenue could be overstated 7. Overlap with current revenue account property – Some property is already subject to tax on gain when sold (revenue account property). The most significant of these are real property sold by developers and dealers. This is not adjusted for due to lack of information. This also includes property subject to the brightline rule and taxable under the intention test. 8. Tax motivated behavioural change – It is possible that taxpayers could change their behaviour to improve tax outcomes from a realisation based tax, such as accelerating realisation of losses and deferring realisation of gains. This is not incorporated due to lack of information to make an accurate assumption. Risks that could either overstate or understate the forecast 9. Variation from assumptions – actual conditions may vary from what is assumed. In particular, the actual appreciation rate is likely to vary over time and be both above and below the assumed growth rate at times. Other factors, such as size of the base and turnover rates, could also vary from the assumptions. 10. The revenue forecast was calculated using a Treasury model that has been reviewed by NZIER. 138 Future of Tax Interim Report I Introduction 1. In its terms of reference, the Group was asked to consider whether a system of taxing capital gains, excluding the family home or land under it, and excluding any inheritance tax, would improve the tax system. The Group’s high- level views on extending the taxation of capital income generally are contained in Chapter 6. This Appendix is intended to describe possible design features that might be necessary to tax capital gains that are not already taxed. These design features are needed in order to decide whether extending the taxation of capital gains in the manner set out is desirable, or whether another option, including the status quo, is preferable. 2. The Government has requested the Group report on changes that would make the tax system more fair, balanced and efficient. The Government’s objective is to have a tax system that: • is fair, efficient, and simple and where tax is collected; • promotes the long term sustainability and productivity of the economy; • supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30% of GDP; • treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner; • is progressive; and • is simple and coherent. 3. Whether these objectives can be met in relation to the proposals set out below is obviously dependent on the design features. Accordingly, the Group has not yet reached a view on whether introducing the changes required will meet the Government’s objectives. This Appendix is not a final report as it contains the Group’s preliminary conclusions or sets out the issues the Group thinks need to be considered further in reaching a decision. Many of the issues are complex and will require industry and stakeholder consultation. 4. The Group intends to consider many of the issues in this Appendix further and to make recommendations in its Report in February. II What income should be included General 5. Many other countries have had comprehensive capital gains tax regimes for over 50 years. New Zealand already taxes capital gains from certain asset classes because it has introduced specific taxing rules, on an as needed basis, over this period (for example, the financial arrangements rules tax capital gains from debt instruments). Accordingly, the Group has identified a list of asset classes that are not already subject to tax. Capital gains from these assets would be included in the tax base and would be subject to the rules proposed below. Such assets would be: • interests in land (other than the family home); this includes all other residential land, commercial, agricultural, industrial and leasehold interests not currently taxed; Appendix B: Design Features for extending the taxation of capital gains 139 Future of Tax Interim Report • intangible property, including goodwill; the Group is still considering how widely this should be defined; • all other assets held by a business or for income producing purposes that are not already taxed on sale (for example, depreciable assets); • shares in companies and other equity interests; and • certain choses in action (for example trade tie agreements). We refer to the assets whose gains would be brought into the tax base as “included assets”. 6. Using a defined list of included assets is intended to avoid any difficulties that might arise if the extension applied simply to ‘capital gains from all assets not otherwise taxed.’ The latter approach has been adopted in some other countries and has caused difficulties when unintended gains or losses have been brought into the tax base. Gains or losses from assets not included in the initial list of included assets can be brought into the base separately and intentionally if desirable. 7. Bringing these included assets into the tax base is in effect an extension of the definition of ‘revenue account property’ – that is, property where the proceeds of sale are subject to income tax. The cost of that property is deducted at the time of sale, with the result that the net gain is taxable. 8. Although we propose a list of included assets, our approach is deliberately comprehensive in its coverage of gains from capital, rather than limited. This is consistent with the design principles. The list is not deliberately intended to exclude any assets, other than the family home and some personal assets. These exclusions are discussed below. Family home exclusion 9. The terms of reference require that any proposed taxation of capital gains does not apply to the family home or the land under it. We have referred to this as an ‘excluded home.’ Under present tax 80 One for purposes of the brightline (section CB 16A), the other for purposes of the other land taxing provisions (section CB 16). rules gains from sales of family homes are not generally taxed unless the owner has a regular pattern of buying and selling family homes. Principles for defining the family home 10. How the excluded home is defined is important as it potentially affects all homeowners. 80 The Income Tax Act (the Act) already contains two definitions of a family home however the Group considers that these will need to be modified. The proposed principles to determine an excluded home could include the following: • The home has been occupied mainly as a residence by the person and their family as their home which is their ‘centre of vital interests’; this is intended to be a ‘use’ test and not a purpose or intention test. • It should not be sufficient that the person has used the house as a family home for most of the time they owned it, if it is not so used over the 12 months before sale, unless that non-use relates to a period where the home is held for sale (considered below). • If a person owns more than one home then only one home can be an excluded home. Which home is excluded would be determined by considering the location of the person’s centre of vital interests. This test is used under New Zealand’s double tax agreements and it can be modified appropriately. It would consider where a person’s family lived, how frequently the person returned to the home, the reasons for being in one home and not the other etc. The circumstances of the arrangements must be examined as a whole, but the personal acts of the individual receive special attention in this assessment. • It is possible that two people who are married, in a civil union or a de facto relationship, and who are genuinely living apart, can each have a family home, although this will be uncommon. 140 Future of Tax Interim Report • A person who is not tax resident in New Zealand would not benefit from the excluded home concession; this would also mean that a person who might be tax resident in New Zealand but is treated as being resident in another country under a double tax agreement will not be able to meet the excluded home tests and will be taxable on the sale of their New Zealand home. • Generally, a personal residence will not be an excluded home unless it is the family home of an owner of the residence. However, provision needs to be made for the ownership of family homes by trusts and companies. • The family home exclusion could apply to a home owned by a trust that will, in substance, belong to a beneficiary who occupies the house as a family home. For instance, if a parent settles the home they occupy on a discretionary family trust, the home should be able to be an excluded home while the parent is living in it. However, suppose the parent settles a different home onto a trust and one of their family members lives in the home (an adult child). Two examples illustrate how the rules might work under different factual assumptions. Under the first example, assume there is no intention on the part of the parent to make an irrevocable gift on the child. The parent is a trustee of the trust. In that case the second house should not be an excluded home. In substance the home is still owned and controlled by the parent, who is not living in it as they are living in another home. Under this example, the exemption would apply to a home owned by a trustee only if a beneficiary is both living in the house and becomes irrevocably entitled to the proceeds of any sale of the house, or to the house itself. Under the second example, the parent could make a gift to the family member who would themselves settle a family trust and live in the house. In this case the home would qualify for the excluded home exemption. • A home owned by a flat owning company can be an excluded home of the person who holds the relevant shares; the shares would benefit from the exemption, since the right of ownership and occupation is transferred by way of a transfer of the shares not the home. • The excluded home exemption could apply to a home owned by an ordinary company (including a “look through company”), if the company shares are all owned by a person or persons who occupy the home as a family home. This should be the case even if the home is rented to the occupiers by the company. • A family home could continue to retain its status as an excluded home for up to 4 years in certain circumstances where the taxpayers were not actually living in it. These might include expatriates working overseas before returning to New Zealand, parents moving cities within New Zealand for work reasons, or moving within a city for schooling. • Where a person also uses their home for other purposes, e.g. as a homestay, the exemption could be reduced accordingly. An apportionment could be made based on floor area. Requiring an apportionment in this way might discourage property owners from making a portion of their home available for rental accommodation. An alternative to requiring apportionment based on use or space, might be to allow the excluded home status to still apply if the residence was “mainly used” as a residence by the taxpayer, or to consider a de minimis rule. • The exemption would apply to the land on which the house sits, up to the greater of 4,500 m 2 , or the amount required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house (this is based on the existing family home exclusion in the land taxing provisions. It is not the exclusion used in the bright line test, which allows a larger area of land used in lifestyle blocks to be exempt from those rules). 141 Future of Tax Interim Report Change of use – moving in and out of the base 11. Change of use rules will also need to be developed for circumstances where the owner of an excluded home moves out of the home, or the owner of a rental property or second home moves into the property so that it becomes an excluded home. In these cases, there would be a deemed sale for market value, as follows: • Where the residence becomes an excluded home, this will trigger a deemed sale for market value, giving rise to a taxable gain or loss. • Where the residence ceases to be an excluded home there will be no taxable gain event, but the sale will establish a cost price for calculating the gain or loss on a later sale. 12. The value of the home at the transition point would be market value at that time. Use of ratings values would reduce tax planning opportunities however they might not reflect the true value in many circumstances. 13. An alternative for dealing with change of use situations could be to apportion any gain on sale of the house over the time when it is rented and the time when it is occupied as a family home. This approach has been adopted by other countries. Very expensive homes 14. Excluding gains realised on the family home encourages people to invest more capital in their family home, where it can generate untaxed income (both in the form of the benefit of living in the home, and in the form of the gain on sale). This is sometimes referred to as the “mansion effect” where people move to larger and larger homes and devote considerable resources to improving their homes, maximising resale values. 15. There may be merit in limiting the excluded home exemption in some way for higher value homes. For example, to the extent the amount invested exceeds, say, $5 million, the gain on sale could be taxable. So, in the case of a house which, together with capital improvements, cost the owner $7.5 million, one third of the gain on sale would be subject to tax. For the vast majority of people, imposing tax at this level would have no impact on the taxation of the sale of their family home. 16. However, where the threshold level might be set would inevitably be somewhat arbitrary and could motivate unusual behaviour such as buying property for just under the threshold and selling other assets for more than their market value. The Group notes our terms of reference indicating that the family home and the land under it is not to be subject to the proposed rules extending the taxation of capital gains and that taxing some part of higher value family homes would be contrary to those terms. Personal use assets Personal property 17. Cars, boats and other household durables generally decline in value and when they are sold the loss represents the cost of having private non-taxed consumption benefits. It is not proposed to include these assets in the rules. 18. Higher value jewellery, fine art and other collectibles (rare coins, vintage cars etc.) might be able to be distinguished on the basis that they are purchased as investments and are expected to appreciate in value. It is not proposed to include these assets in the rules. Excluding them from the new rules may incentivise investment in such assets as opposed to more productive assets and there might also be an argument to tax them, over certain thresholds. Nevertheless, the Group proposes to exclude these assets for reasons of simplicity and compliance cost reduction. The Group acknowledges that such a concession could be revisited in the future. Existing tax rules can tax certain gains on sale, if the assets were acquired for resale; these rules will continue to apply to such assets. Real property 19. The inclusion of residential land as a taxable asset (other than the excluded home, discussed above) means that owners of holiday homes, baches, cribs and other second homes will be taxable on gains accruing after the effective date of the introduction of the tax. 142 Future of Tax Interim Report 20. The inclusion of these private assets raises an issue regarding deductibility of costs relating to land held for private purposes. Because the land is used for private purposes, not all costs relating to it should be deductible. It is proposed that costs of a revenue nature, such as rates, interest (including foreign exchange losses on foreign currency borrowing), insurance and repairs and maintenance, should not be deductible, either when incurred or when the property is sold. It is proposed that costs of a capital nature (improvements) incurred after purchase should be added to the cost base of the asset and deductible from the proceeds of sale. Existing case law and rules can assist in determining what is on revenue account and what is on capital account. Foreign real property 21. For New Zealand residents, homes located outside New Zealand would be taxable. However, there is an argument for exempting homes owned outside New Zealand if it was likely that no New Zealand tax on the foreign home would be collected. This could be the case if the other country also taxed any capital gain on the property. If that same gain was taxable in New Zealand, a credit for that foreign tax would be allowed against the New Zealand tax payable. Any New Zealand tax on sale would accordingly be relatively small, such that the compliance costs might not be justified. 22. An alternative to a full exclusion for foreign homes would be to apply a ‘grey list’ where only homes subject to tax in countries imposing similar capital gains taxes (and not receiving any main home exemption) would be excluded from the rules. In any event, any arguments for exclusion need to be balanced against perceptions of fairness if some overseas homes are out of the base. The Group is still considering this. III When to tax: accrual versus realisation 23. The Group proposes that tax should be imposed on realisation rather than accrual in most cases. However, the Group proposes retaining the current fair dividend rate (FDR) regime that applies to shares in foreign companies (other than certain Australian listed shares). This is levied on five percent of the annual opening values of the shares. 24. Realisation is the basis on which both trading stock and revenue account assets (such as timber and land which is subject to tax) are generally taxed. Current rules therefore provide a useful set of default rules for determining when gains from assets which are proposed to be brought into the base should be taxed. Actual realisation 25. At its core, realisation involves the sale of an asset for market value. The purpose of imposing tax on realisation rather than accrual is that it ensures the tax is imposed at a time when the person subject to the tax has the funds to pay it, and when the amount of the gain has been finally determined. However, it is well established that there is a realisation even when the consideration for a sale is in kind rather than cash, and when payment of the consideration is deferred, for a shorter or longer period. This can perhaps be explained on the basis that the seller has a choice as to whether to sell, and if it is concerned about its ability to pay the tax, can either require some immediate cash component or not sell at all. The Group proposes that this core concept also applies to included assets. 26. Current law also provides for assets to be treated as realised where they are destroyed or scrapped. In these cases, the event will generally give rise to a loss, except where there are insurance proceeds or other compensation which exceed the asset’s cost. In these cases, tax is imposed, though some exceptions have been made in the context of losses in the course of natural disasters. 143 Future of Tax Interim Report Deemed realisation 27. The Group is also considering whether a person who incurs significant expenditure remediating damage to property might be treated as having partially disposed of that property, so that the person could claim a deduction for the cost of the remediation at the time it is incurred, rather than having to wait for a deduction on sale or by way of depreciation. Examples would be buildings with high seismic strengthening costs or weathertightness issues. Such costs would be included in the cost base for calculating any taxable gain or deductible loss. In many cases the magnitude of the costs is likely to lead to an overall deductible loss if the building is sold. It may be seen as problematic to require such buildings to be sold merely to access that loss. 28. Current law also provides for deemed realisation of revenue account assets (i.e. for imposition of tax on accrued gains or losses) in several situations where there is no cash or other consideration at all, nor any third-party valuation. Most significantly, these are: • when an asset leaves the tax base in certain situations. An example is when a New Zealand resident migrates to another country holding an appreciated financial arrangement which is not subject to tax when sold by a non-resident owner. In this case tax is imposed to ensure that the gain that has accrued while the financial arrangement is in the New Zealand base is taxed; • when assets are transferred for no consideration, for example: – on death; – on gift, including a settlement on a trust; – on distribution by a trust or a company to a beneficiary or a shareholder; – in a settlement of relationship property. 29. In some of these cases, particularly transfer on death and settlements of relationship property, there are provisions which allow the tax on any gain accrued up to the date of transfer to be deferred, so that it does not arise until the transferee realises the asset. For example, roll-over relief applies to most property left to a spouse, and to standing timber left to a close relative. This means there is no tax at the time of death, but when the spouse or relative sells the property, the taxable gain will include the gain that accrued while the deceased owned the property, as well as while the spouse or relative owned it. 30. In relation to the first situation (asset leaving the base), the Group considers that whenever an asset that is in the tax base leaves it, tax should be imposed on the owner’s accrued gain up to that point. Gifts to a charity or other donee organisation are an exception, discussed below. 31. In relation to the second situation (transfers for no consideration), the existing law suggests that roll-over relief is appropriate in some cases but not all. However, the existing provisions appear to be somewhat ad hoc, and have not been drafted in the context of a generally applicable capital gains tax. Because of the importance of this subject, roll-over relief is considered in some detail in the following section of this Appendix. 32. The Group notes that under the terms of reference, whatever treatment of assets held on death is adopted, the family home and the land under it is to be an excluded asset. Whether the home is sold by the executor/administrator or left to the owner’s children, relatives or some other beneficiary, the increase in value up to the time of the person’s death (and to the time of sale or distribution by the executor/administrator) should be permanently exempt. It will be possible for the house to then become an excluded home of the person inheriting it if the recipient also resides in the house. Consideration is being given to providing a time period in which the house can be held in trust or rented, pending sale or other disposal in the process of administering estate assets. 144 Future of Tax Interim Report IV When to tax: roll-over relief What roll-over relief is 33. Roll-over relief is the mechanism that allows a realisation-based tax to accommodate deferral of taxation on transactions or events that are realisations. Realisations would otherwise trigger a requirement to calculate taxable gain or loss. There are a number of situations that may justify roll-over relief, and these are considered in more detail below. 34. Roll-over relief does not mean that the gain or loss is never taxed. It means that taxation of the gain or loss is deferred until there is a later realisation event which is not itself subject to roll-over relief. For example, suppose A buys a holiday home for $500,000. When A dies, she leaves the holiday home, worth $700,000, to her children. The children sell it five years later for $950,000. 35. If the transfer of the holiday home to A’s children is treated as a realisation event not eligible for roll-over relief: • A will have $200,000 of taxable income at the time of her death, which will be returned by her executor/administrator. • A’s children will have taxable income of $250,000 when they sell the holiday home. 36. If the transfer is eligible for roll over relief: • A will be treated as having no taxable income from the holiday home on her death; • A’s children will have taxable income of $450,000, at the time of sale. 37. Roll-over relief is considered appropriate where there has been a technical legal change in ownership – in principle giving rise to a realisation of taxable gain – but for fairness and/ or efficiency reasons it is not considered that this technical change in legal ownership justifies taxing the gain at that time. 38. Conversely, extensive roll-over relief creates adverse equity and lock-in effects. For example, if an asset is owned by a person for a lengthy period, then left to an heir who similarly owns it for a lengthy period, the tax payable on sale by the heir can be a significant portion of the asset’s value. This may make it very difficult for the heir to justify a sale of the asset (since it will diminish their wealth by the amount of the tax). Roll-over relief in such cases may defer the tax, potentially indefinitely, undermining the fairness objectives of taxing this form of income. Despite these drawbacks, most countries that tax capital gains across a broad base still allow roll-over relief in various circumstances. Principles of rollover relief 39. The Group believes it is important to establish principles or tests for when roll-over should apply. Without such principles, ad hoc roll-overs will be adopted, reflecting political responses to lobbying, rather than sensible tax policy. 40. The Group is still developing these principles but our current thinking is that roll-over relief should be provided where there has been a legal change in ownership of the asset giving rise to a technical realisation of the gain or loss but this change in legal ownership is not in reality a realisation of the gain or loss as most people would understand it. This seems to arise in two cases: • There has been no change in ownership in substance. The clearest example of this is a transfer of relationship property where the change in legal ownership merely reflects the fact that recipient partner always had an ownership interest in the property. This can then be extended further to transfers to any close relation, applying a wider concept of family ownership. However, the concept of close relation tends to be cultural and changing over time. For Māori it may extend to whānau in a wide sense, hapu or iwi. Under tikanga concepts property can be often seen as being held for others, including future generations, and these interests should be accommodated by the tax rules. On death it can be reasonably argued that any bequest is by its nature provided because of a close relationship with the recipient. These comments refer to relationships between individuals. Similar concepts apply to transfer of property between entities owned by the 145 Future of Tax Interim Report same individuals or between the individual and the entities. That is, here is also no change in ownership in substance where assets are legally transferred from a person to an entity owned by that person – such as a company – or between different entities owned by the same person. • There has been a legal change in ownership (and a change in substance) but the nature of the transaction is such that it has not given rise to a gain that can be said to have “come home” to the vendor. The clearest example of this is where land is compulsorily acquired for public works and the landowner has used the proceeds to acquire other land as a replacement. Current law (in some respects) and common sense would not treat this as a realisation event giving rise to a taxable gain because the landowner is, in reality, in no different position to a person who continued to own land. This can be contrasted with a market value sale to an unrelated party, crystallising certain gains available to the vendor to use at their discretion (including on consumption); a clear gain has “come home”. 41. How narrow or broadly these principles are applied is a matter the Group is still considering. A broad application of the second principle could allow roll-over relief to farmers selling a small farm and buying a larger one, a person selling one business in return for another business. It would also recognise the seemingly reasonable argument of iwi organisations that they should be able to sell less desirable settlement assets to buy more desirable assets without a tax impost from doing so. On the other hand, allowing multiple circumstances for roll-over relief whenever a gain is realised but reinvested would defer taxation of gains for many years - negating some of the revenue and other benefits of taxing these gains, and potentially giving rise to horizontal inequities. 42. The Group is therefore considering how far roll-over relief should be extended and whether any broader application of such relief should be restricted to illiquid assets – assets not easily realised within an ongoing business or social operation. 43. To illustrate these points we describe below how roll-over relief might apply to: • gifts on death • inter vivos gifts • settlements on trusts and distributions by trusts • involuntary dispositions of assets where the proceeds are reinvested • dispositions of business assets where proceeds are reinvested • dispositions of business assets where there is no change in economic ownership. Roll-over on death 44. Taxing gains accrued up to the time of death has significant advantages over not doing so. If gains are not taxed on death, a person is encouraged to retain all their assets instead of giving them away or selling them. For example, they might raise mortgages on their assets to avoid the tax otherwise payable on the sale of the asset, at a time when additional debt might not make economic sense. Accordingly, taxing gains on death reduces the incentive to retain assets during a person’s life time. Taxing gains accrued to the date of death also ensures that capital gains cannot be deferred for longer than a person’s life time. This has benefits in terms of the equity and revenue raising objectives of the tax. By re-setting the cost base of the assets, it also reduces lock-in effects for future transactions, which reduces the economic inefficiency of a realisation-based tax. The Group believes that the arguments for roll- over relief on death are stronger in the following situations: • Where property is left to a spouse, civil law or de facto partner. In this case the basis for the relief is that the deceased and the surviving partner are in substance a single economic unit in terms of their ownership and enjoyment of their assets and the income from those assets. However, this relief would not apply if the partner is not New Zealand resident, so that the effect of the transfer is 146 Future of Tax Interim Report that the property leaves the tax base. This limited relief recognises the property interests the recipient might have already had in the deceased’s estate (under relationship property laws for example). However applying a wider family unit concept of ownership could extend the relief to other all family members or indeed anyone whose relationship with the deceased is such that they are the recipient of a bequest. • Where the property is illiquid. In this case the imposition of the tax might require the property to be sold to fund the tax liability. In such cases, the asset may not be ready for sale and as such the owner may lose value in a “forced sale”. Illiquid assets would include shares in family companies and unincorporated businesses, including farms. It might also include shares in other unlisted companies. It would not include listed shares which can be easily traded. It probably would not include land which is rented, or land held outside the context of a business, unless the legal nature of the land means it is very difficult to sell or use as security for a loan (Māori land, for example). Land valuations are common and relatively reliable. The market for most land is more liquid than for most businesses, and it is more easily able to be borrowed against. The arguments in favour of this roll-over apply regardless of the identity of the transferee under the will of the testator. Generally, the transferee will be a relative. But limiting the relief to relatives would create undesirable boundary and definitional issues. Again, the relief would not apply if the beneficiary is not New Zealand resident. 45. There is also an argument that death should not be treated as a realisation event at all, or should be entitled to complete roll-over relief (which is the same thing), on the basis that: • it does not involve the receipt of any consideration by the deceased. It therefore fails the core definition of a realisation event, and there is no other good basis for treating it as a realisation; • there is in most cases no change in the economic ownership of the assets if the assets are treated as owned not just by the deceased but also by their wider family, to whom in most cases the assets are left. 46. One way to allow more limited deferral would be to provide that roll-over could not apply to consecutive transactions. For instance, if a rental property acquired by a testator on market were left to the testator’s only daughter, roll-over might apply to that transfer. However, if the daughter then left the same rental property in her will, roll- over relief would not be available a second time. However, this kind of limitation might be complex to draft and difficult to monitor. 47. The Group also considered the treatment of appreciated assets left to charities and other donee organisations. Currently there is no tax on a testamentary gift of an appreciated revenue account asset to a charity. But a testamentary gift to a charity or donee organisation also does not give rise to a charitable or other public benefit donation credit. This is both because it is not in cash and because there is an exclusion for testamentary gifts from the credit. There does not seem to be any reason to change this treatment for included assets. 48. The Group has not considered the tax treatment of changes in value occurring while an asset is held by an executor/administrator. Current law may provide guidance for this. As a general proposition the Group comments that there may be merit in treating such changes in value for some reasonable period after death in the same way as changes in value arising before death. 49. If roll-over relief on death was given on a reasonably narrow basis, it would: • apply to all transfers to a surviving spouse or other partner; • apply to transfers of illiquid assets, such as private businesses (including farms) or companies; and • not apply to transfers of liquid assets (such as bank accounts and listed shares) or to transfers to family trusts for the reasons outlined below. 147 Future of Tax Interim Report 50. A broader basis is to allow roll-over relief for all testamentary dispositions (again, the family home is an excluded asset and is not taxed at all), regardless of the asset type or who the recipient is. As mentioned, this has the effect of increasing lock-in and deferring the revenue collected from the tax but it means that assets do not need to be sold on death to fund the tax. Roll-over relief for gifts during lifetime (inter vivos gifts) 51. The rules applying to roll-over relief on death are important because whatever treatment is adopted for transfers on death could also apply to gifts made by a person during their lifetime. Any distinction between the two could lead to unnecessarily complex structuring and outcomes which are the result of tax planning rather than being desirable in themselves. For example, if property is eligible for a roll over if transferred on death but not inter vivos, the owner will be incentivised to retain it until death. However, from a commercial and/or personal perspective, it might be desirable for ownership to be transferred at an earlier point. Taxpayers may well take steps to achieve that outcome in substance while avoiding a change in legal ownership, and this may trigger undesirable uncertainty and disputes. 52. In relation to gifts of appreciated assets to donee organisations, such gifts are currently not eligible for a charitable donation tax credit as they are not monetary. Consistent with this approach, there should be no tax imposed on any appreciation at the time of gift. Either: • the gift should be treated as a realisation event, in which case there would be both taxable gain or loss and a charitable donation credit for the value of the gift; or • the gift should be treated as having no tax consequences, either in terms of taxing gain or loss, or a charitable donation credit. 53. Again, this treatment is consistent with the suggested approach to bequests to such organisations mentioned above at paragraph 46. Roll-over relief for settlements on trusts 54. The same principle should apply to determine when settlements of assets on trusts are subject to tax. A settlement of assets on a trust is in essence a gift, albeit that except in the case of a fixed trust the extent to which any particular donee will benefit from the gift may not be determined at the time the gift is made. Again, a transfer of an excluded home to a trust will not be treated as giving rise to tax in any event, since the family home is not included in the proposed rules. 55. To the extent that roll-over relief depends on the identity of the transferee, settlement on a trust raises an obvious problem. Generally, the trust will have more than one beneficiary, and often their interest in the trust assets will be either discretionary or difficult to determine (as in the case of a life tenant). The narrower basis above in relation to transfers on death would give transferee-based roll-over relief only to transfers to spouses and civil law or de facto partners. Accordingly, any transfer to a trust which does not have such a person as the sole possible beneficiary would probably not be entitled to roll- over relief. 56. Under the broader basis above, where roll-over relief applied to all testamentary transfers (that is, to any beneficiary under a will or on intestacy, whether they were an individual or a trust) then all settlements on trust would be eligible for roll- over relief. Again, the treatment on death needs to be consistent with the treatment before death to avoid convoluted asset planning. Roll-over relief for in-kind distributions by trusts 57. Assets settled on a trust may subsequently be distributed to one or more of the beneficiaries. Under current law, such a distribution is treated as a realisation of those assets by the trustee for market value, with no provision for roll-over relief. The beneficiary is treated as having received a trust distribution equal to the market value of the asset distributed. 148 Future of Tax Interim Report 58. In analysing the effect of the proposed reform to these kinds of transactions, it is helpful to keep quite separate the position of: • the trustee, who is transferring an asset which is potentially subject to tax; • the beneficiary, who should be taxed on the distribution in the same way as the beneficiary would be taxed if the distribution were in cash rather than in kind. One way to keep this distinction clear is to consider the position if the asset were first sold to the beneficiary for market value, and the proceeds then distributed to the beneficiary in cash, the cash being used to pay the purchase price of the asset. 59. If there is a narrow approach to roll-over on death and gifts, then rules would be required to prevent trusts being used to circumvent such restrictions. The treatment of a distribution by a trust could conceivably depend upon the nature of the trust. If the distribution to the beneficiary is one that is required by the terms of the trust deed (e.g. if the property is held for named beneficiaries in equal shares, to be distributed on the happening of a specified event) then roll-over relief might be provided on the basis that the distribution gives effect to an already identified beneficial ownership. 60. In other cases, the current treatment of distributions of revenue account assets (i.e. treated as disposed of for market value) might be more appropriate. However: • Concerns about the effect of imposing tax on a transfer where there is no consideration to pay the tax may still support roll-over relief, as in the case of a transfer of illiquid assets on death. • If roll-over relief is provided for transfers of certain assets on death, gifts, and contributions to a trust, and if those assets are taxed when distributed by a trust, the amount of tax involved may be considerable. This calls into question whether a different tax treatment for distributions from trusts can be justified. • Taxing distributions from trusts differently from transfers on death would create a distinction between property held on trust and property held outright. For example, it would be preferable from a tax perspective to leave appreciated property to a person outright rather to leave it to them as a trustee. The former course would allow the property to be passed on free of tax (on death) rather than taxable (on winding up of the trust). Is there a need for deemed realisation events for trust assets? 61. Assets that are not eligible for roll-over relief on death can be transferred to a trust as a way of avoiding tax on gain on the transferor’s death, for assets not entitled to roll-over relief (under the narrow approach – note that the rules outlined below would not seem necessary if the broader roll-over relief were available on death and gifting). Although the inter vivos transfer to the trust will trigger recognition of gain or loss up to the time of the settlement, if the assets are held by the trust when the transferor/settlor dies, the additional gain or loss that would have arisen because of death can be avoided. Given that trusts are likely to soon have a 125 year perpetuity period, it is also possible that a trust can be used as a device to avoid two or three “tax on death” realisation events (again, under a narrow approach). 62. It is possible to have a rule that deems a family trust to have disposed of its assets for their market value when certain events occur or time periods pass. For example, assets could be deemed sold for their market value when the settlor who contributed the assets dies — this option would be most consistent with the rationale behind denying rollover relief on death, unless the settlor truly had no control over the trust. 63. Alternatively, excessive deferral through trusts could be avoided if a family trust were deemed to sell its assets on a more periodic basis, e.g. every 20 years (possibly with some roll-over relief if appropriate). The Group understands Canada has a provision of this kind. 149 Future of Tax Interim Report Involuntary dispositions of business assets 64. Roll-over relief needs to be considered where a business “disposes” of an asset involuntarily and reinvests the proceeds in a replacement asset. Examples are where: • land is taken under the Public Works Act 1981; • an asset is destroyed by a natural disaster. In this case there will be a gain if any insurance proceeds or other compensation exceed the asset’s cost price. 65. The Group considers that these transactions should be treated as dispositions, but that where the proceeds are reinvested in a replacement asset, roll-over relief should be provided. There may be a requirement that the replacement asset is of a similar nature to the one disposed of. Where this requirement is not met, that means the taxpayer has taken the opportunity effectively to step away from ownership of the type of asset disposed of, either to invest in another type of asset, or to fund consumption. In that case, the argument for deferring tax on any appreciation the person has enjoyed is weaker. 66. The Group recognizes that this proposal: • may encourage people to make reinvestment decisions they would not make otherwise, because there will be a tax preference to reinvest in an asset the same or similar to the one lost; • may also encourage people not to accept offers for appreciated property which are not compulsory, in order to be made an offer which is compulsory and therefore attracts roll-over relief. On the other hand, offers for depreciated property would be accepted before compulsory acquisition, in order to allow a deduction to be claimed. Disposition of business assets where proceeds reinvested 67. This in turn raises the issue of whether roll- over relief should be extended to voluntary dispositions where proceeds are reinvested in a replacement asset. An example of such relief is section 1031 of the US Internal Revenue Code, which allows roll over where proceeds of sale of a non-trading stock business asset is reinvested within 180 days of sale in another such asset which must be identified within 45 days of sale. The seller must also not have received the sale proceeds. Since 2017, section 1031 applies only to real estate assets. 68. New Zealand provided roll-over relief of this kind in respect of depreciation recapture on personal property business assets until 1988. 69. This form of roll-over relief is intended to eliminate the lock-in effect for businesses which for whatever reason need to replace one asset with another. For example, the business may be growing and needs to sell smaller premises to obtain large ones. Or it may need to change its location or upgrade its productive capacity. It could apply to a farmer seeking to sell a farm in one location and acquire a larger farm in a different area. Imposing tax on the sale will reduce the amount available for reinvestment and therefore discourage transactions which are otherwise economically efficient. This is an inevitable consequence of a realisation based tax, as opposed to an accruals-based one. 70. Potentially this form of relief could apply when business premises are sold and replaced with other business premises. 71. Providing roll-over relief for such transactions can have the following disadvantages: • It can result in lock-in and long term tax deferral, which reduces the equity benefits of the tax and the revenue generated. Potentially, the tax can be deferred until the owner, or their heirs, decides to use the proceeds of sale for consumption rather than investment. 150 Future of Tax Interim Report • It discourages taxpayers from investing in assets which do not qualify for the relief, where that would be more efficient than investing in assets which do. • It is likely to give rise to persistent efforts to expand the relief. • It requires both complex legislation and enforcement and is likely to give rise to disputes from time to time. • It is likely to require loss ring-fencing on all kinds of assets for which such reinvestment is possible. Without ringfencing, taxpayers selling assets of the kind to which like-kind exchange roll-over is available would: – in relation to depreciated assets, ensure that they do not qualify for roll-over relief, and thus be able to deduct the loss against other income; – in relation to appreciated assets, ensure that they do qualify for roll over relief if at all possible. 72. On the other hand, extensive roll-over may be seen as more in accord with a realisation based approach to taxing asset gains. The Group is still considering the extent to which roll-over relief should be provided. 73. Consideration will also need to be given in this context to the rules taxing livestock, and in particular how the extension of the taxation of income from capital would apply to livestock taxed under the herd scheme. Corporate re-organisations 74. Roll-over relief would also be considered for corporate reorganisations where there is no change in economic ownership. A relatively simple example is the transfer of an asset to a company of which the owner of the asset is sole shareholder. Looking through the corporate veil the transferor still owns the asset and following the Group’s principles roll-over relief should be provided. The Group needs to consider whether roll-over relief nevertheless needs to be restricted to prevent it being used for tax minimisation such as when the asset is transferred for debt rather than shares. 75. For the same reason, roll-over relief should be considered for de-mergers. 76. In relation to amalgamations, current law provides a useful starting point. Generally, in an amalgamation between New Zealand companies, roll-over relief means there is no gain or loss for the companies concerned, but there is no roll-over relief for the shareholders in any non-continuing company. In the time available, the Group has not been able to develop any firm or detailed options in relation to these types of transactions. Intra-group transactions 77. Transactions within a wholly owned group do not give rise to any change in economic ownership. Accordingly, there is a good argument for excluding them from the calculation of taxable income. There is also a risk that if they are included, they will: • be used to trigger a deduction for losses that in economic substance are unrealised • be used to generate multiple deductions for a single loss. 78. Accordingly, such transactions should be subject to roll-over treatment. Relationship Property transfers 79. Relationship property transfers of revenue account property are already entitled to roll- over relief and these rules should also apply to included assets. V How to tax Tax on capital gains continues to be imposed as income tax and is not a new, different, tax 80. Implicit in the Group’s approach is that the income brought into the tax base by taxing more realised capital gains should be taxed in the same way as any other income, unless there is some reason to do otherwise. The rules taxing more capital gains can be seen as no more than expanding the definition of what is a revenue account asset, albeit in a reasonably far-reaching manner. 151 Future of Tax Interim Report 81. This means: • taxing income from the realisation (or deemed realisation) of included assets at the person’s usual marginal rate, with no indexation for inflation; • collecting that tax in the same way as income tax is currently collected. 82. This is a key aspect of the Group’s design. The proposed design retains the new rules within the existing legislative framework contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. This means that: • there is no need to draft an entirely new set of tax legislation; • in many respects, existing law will provide all the detailed supporting provisions and mechanisms that are required for the tax to operate; • the tax will be calculated and collected in a way that is already familiar to taxpayers and advisors; • existing law may be able to be simplified, once the majority of asset disposals are taxable. For example, it may be possible to repeal the sections defining when sales of land are taxable, once all sales of land other than the excluded home are taxable. 83. However, the Group also acknowledges that modifications to this approach may be needed. For example, most taxpayers whose income is limited to salary and wages, New Zealand dividends and interest, do not have to file a tax return because they have no income from which tax is not withheld at an appropriate rate. Under the proposed extension, if such a taxpayer sells some New Zealand shares, they will have to file a tax return. Some form of withholding tax, either by the buyer or an intermediary, or a transaction- specific return, may be a better alternative, or a useful adjunct, to requiring the person to file an annual tax return. This is considered further in the last section of this Appendix. Capital gains discount 84. The Group does not propose any capital gains discount because there does not seem to be any sound principle that would require a discount. However, in the event that a discount is thought necessary, rather than taxing capital gains (or some capital gains) at a lower rate, only a fraction of the gains or losses could be included in taxable income. For example, a 50% discount for capital gains can be achieved by taxing 50% of the gain at usual rates, rather than by taxing the entire gain at 50% of the normal rates. Applying a discount or different tax rates to different asset types causes significant classification issues as between capital gain assets and revenue assets. Assets that might crystallise losses are classified into revenue account assets (full deductions for losses) and assets that might increase in value are classified as capital account assets (discounted tax on the gain). Any discounted approach would reduce the amount of legislative simplification that could be achieved and would not be as effective at reducing tax-induced investment distortions. Inflation adjustment (indexation) 85. With respect to inflation adjustment, there is a strong case in principle for inflation adjustment of cost base. However, there are two good reasons why in practice the case is not made out. • First, there is no inflation adjustment for any other forms of income. Lenders, for example, must pay tax on all the interest they receive, with no exclusion for the portion that represents inflation. This can have a significant effect on their effective tax rate. Borrowers are similarly entitled to take a deduction for interest with no adjustment for inflation. There is also no inflation adjustment for the cost of trading stock. With a first-in first-out (FIFO) cost flow assumption, the lack of inflation adjustment for trading stock has a similar effect to the lack of inflation adjustment for a long term capital asset. There are also other forms of unrealised income, such as the discount on a zero coupon bond, that do not enjoy either deferral or indexation. Accordingly, it would seem inconsistent with existing policy to index income from sale of capital assets only. 152 Future of Tax Interim Report • Second, the lack of inflation adjustment is something of a quid pro quo for taxing on a realisation, rather than accrual, basis. Generally, tax is imposed on income calculated on an annual basis. However, we propose that the new rules apply on a realisation basis. The resulting deferral benefit will counteract, sometimes entirely, the cost of paying tax on the inflation component of a capital gain. For example, suppose inflation is 2% pa and an asset purchased for $1 million appreciates at 7% pa in nominal terms. After ten years, the asset is sold for $1.967 million, of which $0.219 million is inflationary gains. If the inflation adjusted gain were taxed on an accrual basis, the nominal after tax rate of return would be 5.35%. By taxing the nominal gain on realisation, the nominal after-tax rate of return decreases only slightly (in other words, the tax burden increases only slightly), to 5.12%. 86. The interaction between deferral and inflation is shown in the following table. The table assumes inflation of 2%, nominal interest of 5%, and a tax rate of 40%. Based on those assumptions, taxing nominal income produces a nominal tax rate of 40%, while taxing real income produces a nominal tax rate of 24%. • The first section shows the effective tax rate on nominal interest income after 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 years, which is 40%. • The second section shows the effective tax rate on an equivalent capital gain on a realisation basis. Assuming a sale at year 10, the nominal effective tax rate decreases to 35%, demonstrating that the person paying tax on a realisation basis has a lower tax cost than the person receiving a regular income stream, though the rate is still higher than it would be if it were inflation adjusted. • The third section shows the effect of taxing only 50% of the gain – capital gain discounts are often used as a proxy for inflation adjustments. As the table shows, a 50% discount does much more than adjust for the effect of inflation. • The fourth section shows the effect of taxing on an inflation adjusted and realised basis. Because the tax is imposed on a realised basis, after one year the rate is lower than 24%. • The fifth section shows the effect of taxing real gains on an accrual basis, which is that the nominal tax rate is 24%.

The Group is concerned about the adverse impact of taxing nominal income with respect to retirement savings. However, it does not consider that this is so much of an issue with property gains and these issues are considered more fully in Chapter 7 on Savings. Effect on social policy schemes 88. Consideration will also need to be given to how capital gains are dealt with for purposes of entitlements and obligations under social policy schemes such as Working for Families and child support. While the eligibility tests may use taxable income as a base, they also deal with many forms of payments that are not taxable income. It may be that changing the tax characterisation of the proceeds of sale of a particular asset makes little difference to the seller’s entitlements or obligations under social policy schemes, but this will need to be understood better. The issue can be illustrated by a person receiving Working for Families payments through the year. At the end of the year they are entitled to a part of the gain from the sale of a rental property. If this is included income for the purpose of the person’s Working for Families entitlement they may be required to repay some, or all, of the payments they received. VI Capital expenditure 89. As a general proposition, the effect of bringing a gain on sale of an asset into the tax base is that expenditure incurred in acquiring that asset will be deductible from the sale proceeds at the time of sale. Various capital costs incurred subsequent to acquisition will also be deductible from the sale proceeds – for example, costs of making significant improvements to the asset. Distinguishing between those asset-related costs which are routine and thus deductible when incurred and those which are of a capital nature (e.g. repairs and maintenance versus improvements) will be the same in this context as it is under current law. The only difference is that under current law, costs which relate to a capital asset are generally not deductible (but may be depreciable). Building costs 90. Bringing all land into the tax base will mean that all building related costs will be deductible on sale, if they have not already been deducted as incurred or by way of depreciation (recognising that buildings are not currently depreciable). Cost flow assumptions 91. In the case of fungible assets, such as shares in a company, where a holding may be both acquired and disposed of in a number of transactions, identifying the cost of a particular sale requires assumptions to be made about the identity of the items sold, often referred to as cost flow assumptions. The usual range of assumptions are: • the assets sold are the earliest acquired (FIFO); • the assets sold are the last acquired (LIFO); • the assets sold have the weighted average cost of the assets held at the time; • the assets sold are those selected by the taxpayer. 92. Which assumption applies can have a significant impact on the profit from sale. On the basis of rising prices, FIFO will produce more income from sale than LIFO, with weighted average cost in the middle. 93. Current law relating to trading stock generally requires taxpayers to use either FIFO or weighted average cost. The method adopted must be consistent with the person’s financial accounts. For other property on revenue account, specific identification of the asset is used. These matters are still under consideration. Personal assets in the base 94. The Group proposes that gains on all land other than the family home be included in the tax base. This raises an issue as to the deductibility of expenses incurred in relation to such land where it is not used for revenue-producing purposes. An example is a family bach which is not rented out. The issue also arises for family baches which are rented out on a less than 100% basis, but only to the extent that expenditure is non- 154 Future of Tax Interim Report deductible due to the private limitation, generally as determined by the mixed use asset rules. 95. Expenses relating to the private enjoyment of the bach should not be deductible. The Group proposes that all expenditure which would be immediately deductible if the bach were fully rented out should be treated as relating to private enjoyment, and all expenditure which would have to be capitalised should be treated as part of the cost of the bach and deductible on sale. This means that: • rates, insurance and interest costs would remain non-deductible; • costs such as installing a swimming pool will be deductible when the bach is sold. 96. This approach is not altogether theoretically satisfactory. Costs incurred in acquiring depreciating assets, such as a swimming pool, should not be fully deductible on sale. The portion of the costs that is deductible on sale should only be the market value of the depreciated assets, since the assets have been used to generate a private benefit in the interim. However, due to concerns about complexity and compliance costs the Group does not propose any adjustment be made to reflect this. Assets introduced into the base 97. In some cases, assets will enter the base other than by way of being acquired. Examples are: • assets held by a person who migrates to New Zealand; • assets owned by a person which are converted from private to business use; • a house which a person ceases to use as a family home, for example, if the person moves to a new family home and rents out the former family home. 98. Consistent with existing law, the Group proposes that such assets enter the tax base at their market value at the time of introduction. This would generally require a valuation of the property. Where an excluded home ceases to be an excluded home, rather than requiring the owner to incur the expense of a valuation, it may be acceptable to rely on a recent ratings valuation, or an interpolation of the ratings valuations immediately before and immediately after the sale. The Group will consider this issue with an aim of developing a proposal that will not jeopardise revenue while minimising compliance costs so far as possible. 99. Because of the subjectivity inherent in valuations, where a valuation figure would produce a loss (i.e. is higher than actual sales), it may be desirable to either ring-fence that loss, or use the median rule, as we propose for transitional valuations (discussed below). VII Treatment of capital losses 100. From an economic perspective, it is desirable so far as possible that the tax treatment of gains and losses be symmetrical. Ideally, this would mean that net losses are refunded in cash. However, this is not desirable from a revenue perspective, and such losses are instead able to be carried forward or (in the case of corporate groups) grouped. At the level of an individual transaction, the benefit of a loss-making transaction can be claimed immediately if the taxpayer has a net profit for the year. 101. Taxing capital gains on a realisation basis raises a particular problem in this respect. Because taxpayers can decide whether or not to sell an asset in a particular year, they can choose to sell depreciated assets in order to accelerate the tax benefit of the loss and retain appreciated assets in order to defer the tax cost. 102. This kind of cherry-picking is particularly problematic: • in the case of fungible assets, where the sale of a depreciated asset to realise a tax loss can be followed immediately by the acquisition of an identical asset. Effectively, the taxpayer can return losses on an accrual basis and gains on a realisation basis; 155 Future of Tax Interim Report • in the case of traded assets where there is also a traded hedge. Taxpayers can generate a tax loss with very little economic cost or risk by acquiring offsetting assets (for example, a call and a put over the same shares) and selling the asset with a loss just before the end of the year, then selling the asset with a gain just after. This is often referred to as a straddle transaction. The ability to use straddle transactions to generate tax benefits may be diminished in New Zealand to the extent that the assets which would be used in such transactions are financial arrangements and so already subject to comprehensive taxation on some form of accrual basis. 103. In many countries, these issues mean that capital losses are ring-fenced, so that they can only be used against capital gains. 104. For assets that are not fungible, there is of course a real consequence of selling a loss- making asset, as well as a tax consequence. The seller has given up its exposure to the asset, and thus the chance to recoup its loss. Similarly, a person who retains an appreciated asset is taking the risk that the asset will decline in value. 105. At this stage, the Group proposes that ring- fencing of losses apply to: • Portfolio listed shares and derivatives that are not already treated as financial arrangements. Losses should be able to be offset only against capital gains and dividends from such assets. • Land held for private purposes. Such losses should be non-deductible altogether, on the basis that they represent private consumption. • Losses arising from non-market transactions. 106. However, the more extensive the roll over relief the more there may be a need to widen loss ring-fencing. That is because extensive roll-over relief would be likely to defer taxing gains, creating more opportunity to defer gains but realise losses. In any case it is the expectation of the Group that officials would monitor the use of losses under the new rules and extend loss ring-fencing if that is justified by revenue risk. VIII Transitional rules 107. In general, capital gains taxes have been introduced in other countries either: • for all affected assets, with effect from a certain day, i.e. on the basis that gains and losses from that day on are in the base (this was the approach taken by the Republic of South Africa); • only for assets acquired on or after a certain day (this was the approach taken by Australia when it introduced a general capital gains tax in 1985). 108. The second approach allows taxpayers to retain assets acquired before introduction of the tax and continue to earn tax free capital gains. The advantage of the Australian approach is that it largely removes the need for extensive valuations on implementation date, the significant compliance costs and room for associated disputes. However, the Group understands it is not uncommon, more than 30 years after the introduction of capital gains tax in Australia, to find taxpayers who are still able to accrue tax-free gains because they have not sold assets acquired before the introduction of the tax. This is likely to lead to distortions in asset ownership and would significantly defer the achievement of the objectives sought by introduction of the tax. Accordingly, on balance, the Group’s view at this stage is that the “valuation day” approach be adopted. 156 Future of Tax Interim Report 109. As noted, a valuation day approach does mean there is a need to value all assets that are to be subject to the new rules as at a given day. This will impose a significant cost on many taxpayers for certain asset types. For listed shares and other market traded assets this should be relatively straightforward in most cases, but it will impose compliance costs, and may be unreliable, for other assets. For example, obtaining a reliable value for a private company, or of goodwill associated with a business, is likely to require significant time and expense. There is also a risk that taxpayers will overstate these values, so as to minimise gains/create losses when the relevant assets are eventually sold. The consequences of over-statement are higher if there is no ring-fencing of losses. 110. There are at least two ways to address these issues, which can be applied separately or in tandem. 111. One way is to apply a median rule, which the Group understands was the approach taken in Canada. Under this approach, in calculating the gain or loss from an asset held on the valuation day, the taxpayer’s cost in the asset is the median of: • actual cost, including costs incurred both before and after valuation day; • value on valuation day, plus costs incurred after valuation day; • sale price. 112. The median rule means that a valuation day value which is higher than actual cost cannot increase a deductible loss on sale above the actual loss (since the median figure will be actual cost). This is some protection against losses being claimed because of inflated valuations. It also means that a valuation day value which is lower than actual cost cannot increase a taxable gain above the actual gain (for the same reason). If an asset has had past losses these can be recouped up to the level of future gains. This rule would be adopted for all assets, other than possibly for listed assets. 113. To illustrate the median rule, suppose an IT start-up business is operated by a special purpose company where the three employees and their relatives are also the principal shareholders. The company incurs running costs of $25,000 per year and salaries of $40,000 for each employee. The company is funded by issuing shares. On valuation day the company has made no sales, but there are hopeful signs, and a registered valuer values it at $1.5 million. One year after the tax is introduced, the company is wound up, returning nothing to its investors, who have contributed $600,000 over the four years of its existence, $100,000 of which is incurred after the valuation day. 114. The investors’ gross revenue from sale is $0. The median value of the shares is therefore the median of: • $0 sale proceeds; • $1.5 million valuation plus $100,000 incurred after valuation, for a total of $1.6 million; • $600,000 cost. 115. The median figure is $600,000, and that will be the aggregate loss in respect of the shares, which will be divided between the shareholders in accordance with the amount they invested in the company. 116. It is important to understand how the median rule applies when a person incurs post-valuation day costs which have to be capitalised. As in the above example, these costs are added to the valuation day value. This should generally ensure that the impending introduction of the tax does not affect decisions as to when capital expenditure is incurred. For example, suppose a person owns a building damaged by an earthquake. The cost of the building before the earthquake was $8 million. The value of the building immediately before the earthquake was $12 million. The earthquake reduced the value to $9 million. The owner intends to pay $3 million to bring the building up to code, which will restore the value to 157 Future of Tax Interim Report $12 million. If this money is spent before the valuation day for the new rules, then the value of the building on valuation day will be $12 million and the cost will be $11 million. If the money is spent after the valuation day, then the valuation figure will be the $9 million valuation plus the $3 million of post-valuation day costs for a figure of $12 million. Cost will again be $11 million once the repairs are done. The tax treatment of any sale should be the same, regardless of when the repairs are done. 117. The median rule does not deal with compliance cost issues. In order to deal with compliance cost issues, the Group believes consideration should be given to developing acceptable rules of thumb. In particular, these might include: • using rateable value (RV) for real property, plus any capital costs incurred since the date the RV was published; • where taxpayers apply IFRS rules requiring assets to be valued at fair market values, the value adopted under those rules; • at the taxpayer’s election, allowing taxpayers with hard to value assets to pro rate the actual gain or loss on a time basis, though this may be difficult with assets whose cost base includes a number of items of expenditure spread over a number of years, or where taxpayers are unlikely to have kept a track of cost base, such as goodwill. 118. Consideration should also be given to whether these rules are appropriate in other transitional situations, for example when a person migrates to or from New Zealand, or a house becomes or ceases to be a family home. IX Taxation of shares in foreign companies 119. In order to explain the issues arising from extending the taxation of gains on sale of assets to foreign shares, the existing tax treatment must be first understood. The issue then is how this treatment might be modified if gains on sale of assets became generally taxable. Current taxation of New Zealand residents investing in foreign companies 120. New Zealanders investing in shares in foreign companies are taxed under one of three different regimes. Broadly: • The controlled foreign company (CFC) regime applies to interests of 10% or more in foreign companies that are (generally) 50% or more controlled by 5 or fewer New Zealand residents, other than interests in companies resident in Australia. • The foreign investment fund (FIF) regime applies to all other interests in foreign companies, other than – for interests of more than 10%, companies resident in Australia; – for interest of less than 10%, listed companies resident in Australia; – interests held by a person whose total foreign share portfolio cost less than $50,000 to acquire, if the person elects not to return FIF income. • For interests not taxed under either of the above regimes, shareholders are generally: – taxable on dividends, unless the shareholder is a company holding at least 10% of the company, in which case the dividends are exempt; – subject to tax on sale only if they hold the shares on revenue account. 158 Future of Tax Interim Report 121. Under the CFC regime: • The shareholder’s share of income earned by the foreign company is taxed to the shareholder as it is earned by the foreign company if the income is “attributable foreign income” – essentially income that could just as easily have been earned directly in New Zealand. There is generally no attribution for active foreign business income because it does not meet this test. • Dividends are only taxed if the shareholder is not a company. • Gains on sale are only taxed if the shares are held on revenue account. • Foreign tax imposed on the relevant income is generally able to be claimed as a tax credit against New Zealand tax. 122. The FIF regime provides for a number of different taxing methods depending on the level of shareholding in the foreign company. But in general taxpayers with less than 10% holdings must use either: • the fair dividend rate (FDR) method, which taxes the shareholder each year on 5% of the annual opening value of its foreign share portfolio, and takes no account of dividends or actual gains and losses (though foreign withholding tax on dividends are creditable against the tax on FDR income); or • the comparative value (CV) method, which taxes the shareholder on dividends plus accrued gains and losses during the year. 123. Other methods are provided for hard to value shares. 124. Generally shareholders are required to use the FDR method, except for shares which are close substitutes for debt. Natural persons and family trusts may choose in any year to apply the CV method to their foreign share investment portfolio. In this case, however, they are not able to claim a deduction for any loss. 125. This pattern of taxation reflects a range of different objectives including a desire to prevent foreign companies being used to defer the imposition of New Zealand tax. For purposes of this Report, the only issue is how and whether it should be modified to deal with the new rules. CFC interests 126. An issue that we have considered is defining when capital gains of a CFC are to be attributed foreign income or not. Generally, this should be evident from the nature of the income produced by those assets, or the nature of the business in which they are used. If a CFC earns only non-attributed income it logically follows that any gains on property would be non-attributed income. 127. A second issue is the taxation of any gains or losses made by the shareholder from sale of a CFC interest. In relation to an interest in a non-attributing CFC, the objectives of the current CFC regime suggest it would not be appropriate to tax gains on sale of such an interest by a company. Currently neither attributed income, nor actual distributions, from such an interest are taxed. This ensures that New Zealand companies investing in foreign businesses are not taxed more heavily than local residents, or other foreigners making the same investment. It is an approach that is widely adopted. It would run counter to this approach to tax the gain on sale of such a CFC. Furthermore, such a tax could at least in some cases be avoided by the company paying a dividend to its New Zealand shareholder which would be exempt. 128. The Group notes this does mean that such gains are likely not to be taxed at all at the time they are derived, since the country where the CFC is resident will generally not tax unless the CFC is land rich. However, the gain will in effect be taxed either when it is distributed (with no imputation credits) to New Zealand resident shareholders, or when a shareholder in the New Zealand holding company sells its shares, if that sale is subject to tax (as would be the case under the proposal). 159 Future of Tax Interim Report 129. If the shareholder in the non-attributing CFC is not a company, then the gain on sale of the shares should be subject to tax in the usual way, just as a dividend would be taxable. 130. The same reasoning means that gains on sales of shares in an attributing CFC should be taxable to any New Zealand resident shareholder. Losses should similarly be deductible, but this should be subject to loss ring-fencing, applying the same rules as currently exist for attributed foreign losses. 131. A CFC may derive some attributable and some non-attributable income (if attributable income is less than 5% of total income, it is not attributed). In this case the gain could be taxable (or loss deductible) in the same proportion as the proportion that the value of assets giving rise to attributable income bears to the value of all assets in the CFC, over some period of time. The Group understands that a similar approach is taken in Australia. Should New Zealand not mirror the Australian rules then the expectation is that any New Zealand company with active CFC income would have an incentive to relocate to Australia. FIF interests 132. A significant benefit of the current FIF regime – in particular, the FDR rules taxing foreign shares on a 5% deemed return – is that investment by a New Zealand resident in foreign shares is subject to New Zealand tax even when the foreign company does not pay a dividend and even when the shares are not sold for many years. In addition, our tax rules for KiwiSaver and similar investment entities substantially rely on the FDR rules to make their rules governing interaction with their investors possible to operate. Accordingly, there seem to be real advantages to retaining FDR, rather than moving to taxing only actual dividends and realised gains. Retention of the FDR regime for FIF investments is the Group’s preferred approach at this stage. 133. The Group notes that the fall in risk-free rates of return since FDR was introduced in 2007 indicates that the 5% FDR rate could now be too high, even in the context of a system which ordinarily taxes both gain on sale and dividends. The secondary market 1 year government bond yield has fallen from 6.99% in 2007 to 1.77% and the 5 year rate has fallen from 6.5% to 2.14%. We are still considering this issue and at the same time are considering removal of the CV option for individuals and family trusts. Other interests 134. In relation to portfolio interests in Australian listed companies, not subject to the FIF regime), it seems appropriate to simply tax realised gains and losses, in the same way as is proposed for other assets. However, this treatment may have to be modified for investment by portfolio investment entities, as discussed later. 135. In relation to other interests in Australian companies, the treatment proposed above for non-attributing CFCs may be appropriate, i.e.: • exemption for New Zealand companies; • taxation on a realisation basis for all other owners. X Taxation of non-residents 136. Where possible, the rules that currently apply to tax non-residents on their New Zealand- sourced income should also apply to income in the form of capital gains. This will generally mean taxing property located in New Zealand, and not taxing property located elsewhere. 137. In the case of land, the result of applying the location test is obvious. The same applies to physical property. Location is somewhat less obvious when applied to debts, shares and other intangible property, though rules have been developed to determine it. Some of New Zealand’s tax treaties remove the right to tax the residents of treaty countries on the sale of assets other than New Zealand land, New Zealand land-rich companies (wherever resident), or assets of a New Zealand branch, 160 Future of Tax Interim Report though most do not remove that right. Where the right is removed, it is in return for similar treatment of New Zealand residents by the treaty country. This is also the position taken in the OECD Model which influences the double tax agreements New Zealand has entered into with other countries. Many countries with broad-based capital gains taxes have similar limitations in their domestic law. The domestic law limitations can go further – for example, even sales of shares in land-rich companies could be exempt if the shareholder and their associates do not hold more than a certain percentage (say, 10%) of the company. This exception can apply to all companies, or only those that are listed. 138. The Group proposes that in line with the practice generally adopted in other countries, non-residents should only be taxed on sales of: • interests in land located in New Zealand (broadly defined, so that it includes for example any right relating to physical resources in New Zealand); • interests in companies deriving more than half their value from New Zealand land, unless the non-resident is a portfolio investor in a listed company 81 ; • assets of a New Zealand branch. XI Taxation on migration 139. If no tax is imposed when a person migrates – or, more specifically, terminates tax residence in New Zealand – then migration will be a simple way to avoid a realisation-based capital gains tax. In fact, there will be an incentive to migrate for the owners of appreciated assets. For example, a New Zealand resident with a significant tax-free gain on land in a foreign country would have an incentive to migrate before selling the land, unless there is a deemed tax on migration. 81 Unless there is a specific over-ride, some treaties may over-ride the imposition of tax in this case. 82 Setting the cost base by reference to the date the person ceases to be a transitional resident is the approach already adopted in the financial arrangement rules – see section EW 41(1)(b). 140. An option for dealing with this problem is to deem assets to be disposed of for market value upon migration. Deemed disposal could be limited to those assets that cease to be subject to tax on sale when a person becomes non-resident. So, for instance, it might not apply to ownership of land in New Zealand, but would apply to ownership of land outside New Zealand. We are considering whether a deemed disposal could also be made optional, as we understand is the case in Australia, so that a natural person migrant could elect to remain taxable with respect to the asset. For that person the asset would remain an included asset and the person would be taxable in New Zealand on it for the full gain on sale. This protects temporary migrants from being taxed on assets when they leave and then return still holding the asset. It also better provides for the avoidance of double tax on the same income by use of double tax agreements. 141. When a person migrates to New Zealand, they should similarly be treated as having acquired their assets for market value on the first day they become New Zealand tax resident (or, in the case of a transitional resident, become a resident who is not a transitional resident). 82 This will establish their cost base for the purpose of taxing subsequent sales. However, sales of non- New Zealand property made by a transitional migrant would not be subject to tax. XII Taxation of partnerships and look-through companies (and their owners) 142. Extending the taxation of gains from capital assets does not seem to raise any particular additional issues for fiscally transparent entities such as partnerships and look-through companies (LTCs). Gains and losses from sales of relevant assets by these entities will become taxable or deductible, and 161 Future of Tax Interim Report these gains or losses will be allocated to the partners or shareholders in the same way as other taxable gains and losses are allocated. Sale of a partnership interest or a share in a look-through company should be treated as a sale by the shareholder or partner of its share in the relevant assets. 143. The Group notes that there are currently a number of de minimis rules in the LTC and partnership provisions, that allow gains and losses on disposal of LTC shares/a partnership interest to be ignored. The continued appropriateness of these provisions in the context of an extended tax on capital gains on sale will need to be considered. 144. The Group does not propose any change to existing law regarding entry and exit of a new partner. Entry of a new partner is treated as a sale by the existing partners of an interest in the partnership assets to the new partner and exit of a partner is treated as a sale by the exiting partner of its interest in the partnership assets to the continuing partners. 145. Treatment of a new partner as having acquired an interest in the partnership assets can give rise to complexity, due to the fact that the new partner may have a different cost in its share of the assets than the other partners. This issue already applies to depreciated property and the proposed reform will exacerbate this issue. Accordingly it needs to be considered in more detail as part of the reform. 146. The Group understand that Inland Revenue treats: • a contribution of a revenue account asset to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest (or an increased interest) as a sale of the entire amount of the asset contributed (despite the contributing partner’s retention of an interest in the asset); and • a distribution of a partnership asset in specie as a 100% sale for market value. 147. The Group’s view is that the same approach could apply to assets to be included in the new rules. XIII Taxation of companies 148. The Group proposes that assets held by companies should in most cases be subject to the rules taxing realised capital gains in the same way as assets held by individuals. The only difference would be for sales of shares in group companies. The taxation of sales of shares by companies, along with other issues for corporate groups, is considered in a separate section. XIV Taxation of New Zealand shareholders in New Zealand tax resident companies As a general proposition, taxing gain on sales of shares is appropriate, but there are issues 149. As a general proposition, it seems logical to tax share gains under the proposed rules just as we tax the gains made by investing in other property. The issue however is that our imputation system treats companies as in effect agents for shareholders. The company derives income in its own capacity but it derives that income for the benefit of shareholders. We should tax that income either at the shareholder level or at the company level but not both. We do currently tax companies on their income and shareholders on dividends but the imputation system allows company tax to be credited against tax on dividends. Under the rules if we are to tax share gains at the shareholder level, as well as taxing the company on gains earned by the company then we could tax the same gains twice. 150. However, not taxing shareholders on share gains would seem to undermine the integrity of the extended rules. In effect shareholders could realise untaxed gains by selling shares. The company would be taxed on gains it makes but that could allow for significant deferral of tax. The objective of taxing share gains is to limit this deferral and not to double tax equity. 162 Future of Tax Interim Report 151. However, taxing gains on sales of shares raises double tax/double deduction issues that the Group is considering. For example: • To the extent the company has taxed retained earnings at the time of a share sale, taxing the portion of the sale price attributable to those earnings is double taxation (double taxation of retained earnings). • To the extent the company owns an asset which has increased in value during the time the shareholder owns its shares, the sale will impose tax on a portion of the gain (the amount the share buyer is prepared to pay for that gain). If the company sells the asset post-sale of the shares, imposing tax on the full amount of the gain is double taxation (double taxation of unrealised gains). • To the extent that a company has realised losses which are not eliminated by the share sale, the sale will give rise to a double deduction, once for the company when the losses are used (by the company or another company under loss grouping) and once for the selling shareholder when the shares are sold (double deduction of realised losses). • To the extent the company owns an asset with unrealised loss at the time of a share sale, the sale will crystallise a deduction for that loss. If the company sells the asset post-sale of the shares, allowing a deduction for the full amount of the loss is a double deduction (double deduction for unrealised losses). Double taxation of realised gains 152. In the Group’s view, the double taxation of retained earnings does not require any legislative response if a company realises a taxable gain and then distributes that as an imputed dividend. The imputation system operates to remove double taxation. Distributions can be “virtual”, by way of the company making a bonus issue of shares which it treats as a taxable bonus issue. The bonus issue will increase the tax cost of shareholders’ shares, and therefore reduce their taxable gain on sale. Frequent taxable bonus issues also have the merit of ensuring that corporate income is taxed at the shareholders’ marginal rates. The Group appreciates that taxable bonus issues may not be appropriate in all cases, particularly for listed companies. Double taxation also “washes out” once the retained earnings are distributed to the share purchaser and the share purchaser on-sells the shares. 153. For example, suppose a company has $7,200 of after-tax earnings, on which tax has been paid at the full 28% rate. If a 10% shareholder sells its shares in the company before these earnings are distributed, and the sale is taxable, the Government will collect tax twice on the portion of the sale price attributable to those earnings. However, there will be no double taxation: • if the company distributes the earnings as a dividend before the sale; or • if the company makes a fully imputed taxable bonus issue of shares with a tax value of $7,200. Assuming that no shareholders have a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT), this would involve the company: – issuing shares and electing for those shares to have a taxable value of $6,700; – paying $500 of RWT; – attaching $2,800 of imputation credits to the dividend. The 10% shareholder would then hold shares with the same value as before, but an increased cost base for tax purposes of $670. This would reduce the shareholder’s gain on sale; or • once the purchaser receives a distribution of the retained earnings and then sells the shares. For example, suppose there is no dividend or bonus issue. The purchaser of 10% of the shares pays an additional $720 for the retained earnings in the company at 163 Future of Tax Interim Report the time of sale 83 . This means that taxable income of only $1,000 (at the level of the company) has given rise to total taxable income of $1,720. However, suppose that the earnings are then distributed to the purchaser, and then purchaser then sells its shares in the company: – The distribution of the retained earnings will not give rise to any additional taxable income (in effect), by virtue of the attachment of imputation credits to the dividend (though the payment of a dividend may change the rate of tax imposed). – The price for the on-sale of the shares (now ex dividend, i.e. conveying no interest in the retained earnings) by the purchaser will be reduced by virtue of payment of the dividend. Assuming again that the effect of the retained earnings was to increase the price of the shares by $720, the price reduction once the retained earnings are gone will also be $720. This second sale will reverse the double taxation that arose on the first sale, by allowing the purchaser a net deduction for the amount paid to acquire the retained earnings. However, this benefit may not arise for some time. Accordingly, taxing share sales may cause companies to distribute more of their taxable earnings, either as cash dividends or as taxable bonus issues. 154. Given the existence of the taxable bonus issue solution, and the fact that New Zealand listed companies tend to distribute a relatively high proportion of their taxable income in any event 84 , the Group’s view at this stage is that the issue of double taxation of retained earnings (gains taxed first at company level and then again at shareholder level) may be 83 Given the imputation credits in the company, the actual additional amount may well be more than this, though it should not exceed $1,000. 84 An analysis of NZX sharemarket data shows that imputation credits of large companies amount to about 1.8% of their market capitalisation, showing there is not a significant build-up of undistributed taxed income. See Imputation and the New Zealand Dividend Psyche (EY 2015). 85 Though Australian rates of capital gains tax are much lower than the marginal rate, not least because superannuation funds, taxed at 10% on capital gains, are significant investors in the share market. able to be managed in practise under the existing imputation rules and might not require a new legislative response. The Group notes that Australia does not provide any legislative remedy for this issue, even though its law does not provide for taxable bonus issues. 85 155. One exception relates to the continuity rule for imputation credits. To the extent that a share sale eliminates imputation credits, payment of a post-sale dividend will not solve the double taxation issue. The Group understands that Australia’s rule for imputation credit continuity is considerably narrower than the New Zealand rule, and focuses on situations where a company with non-resident owners (who cannot use imputation credits) becomes owned by residents (who can). The Group’s view is that if the new rules on taxing capital gains are implemented, then the restrictions on imputation continuity should be relaxed in a similar way in order to minimise the risk of double taxation. Double taxation of unrealised gains 156. The second possible source of double taxation relates to unrealised gains. For example, suppose: • a company holds an asset with an unrealised gain of $10,000, at the time that a 10% shareholder sells its shares in the company; • the sale price for the 10% holding reflects this appreciation (less deferred tax), i.e. that it is $720 greater than would otherwise be the case (being 10% of $10,000 less 28% tax); • shortly after sale, the company sells the asset for a $10,000 gain. In this case, 10% of the gain on sale of the asset has been taxed twice. 164 Future of Tax Interim Report 157. It will generally not be possible to deal with this situation by way of a pre-sale distribution or taxable bonus issue, since at that time no gain has been realised. The double taxation can only be eliminated once the gain is distributed and the purchaser sells its shares. • The distribution to the purchaser will not give rise to any additional income (again by virtue of the attachment of imputation credits). • The purchaser will sell the shares for a price that does not include the appreciation in the asset’s value but will be entitled to a deduction for its cost price which does include that appreciation. 158. In unlisted companies, these kinds of issues may be able to be dealt with by way of the purchaser acquiring the assets of the company or liquidating the company shortly after selling the assets. Another possibility is to allow the parties to elect to treat a sale of all of the shares in a company as though it were a sale of the assets. For example, the purchaser and seller could elect that: • the company be treated as having distributed all of its assets to the seller for their tax value (so no gain or loss to the company); • the seller be treated as selling the assets to the purchaser for the transaction value (giving rise to gain or loss to the seller, equal to the difference between the transaction value and the seller’s cost in the shares); • following which the purchaser would be treated as contributing the assets to the company for their transaction value (so no gain or loss for the purchaser), and: – purchaser has a market value basis in the shares; – company has a market value basis in its assets. Because the company has a market value basis in its assets, sale of those assets will not trigger tax on gain accrued before the share sale. 159. This is an issue the Group is still considering. Double deduction for realised losses 160. Mirror issues potentially arise for companies with realised and unrealised losses. For example, suppose a company with a $10,000 taxable loss, which has not been grouped. If a 10% shareholder sells its shares in the company, the price will generally reflect the existence of the loss. The sale will not give rise to a double deduction, since the corporate loss is not refunded but carried forward (subject to the continuity of ownership requirement). However, if the company generates $10,000 of income in the period post-sale, the loss will effectively have given rise to two deductions. Again, this benefit will be recaptured when the purchaser sells the shares in the company or pays unimputed dividends. The sale price will reflect the increase in the company’s value as a result of the $10,000 of income generated post-sale. 161. In relation to realised losses, the Group does not propose any response to the possibility of double deductions, except where the company has grouped its loss by way of a loss offset election before the sale. A rule of this kind already exists. A person is denied a deduction for a share loss in relation to shares in a company which has grouped a loss with another company. However: • this rule applies only to corporate vendors; • the introduction of a generally applicable tax on gains and losses from share sales means this provision needs to be reviewed to ensure it is effective, and whether it is the best way to deal with this problem. 162. Double deductions in a corporate group are considered further below. 165 Future of Tax Interim Report Double deduction for unrealised losses 163. In relation to sale of a company with unrealised losses, the Group considers that some response should be developed to the problem of deductions at both the shareholder and corporate level. This could, for example, be a requirement that if more than 50% of the shares in a company are sold for a loss, the kind of mechanism referred to above to avoid double taxation of unrealised gains could be made mandatory. Distribution of untaxed gains 164. Currently, companies are able to distribute capital gains tax free on liquidation. The purpose of this rule appears to be to allow the capital gain preference to apply to assets held through companies, though concerns about ordering/streaming mean that the capital gains preference only applies to distributions on liquidation. 165. To the extent that assets which are currently on capital account are brought within the tax base, gains on sale will become taxable, and it will clearly no longer be necessary to allow those gains to be distributed free of tax. Capital gain distributions will accordingly become much smaller over time. However, where gains would not be taxed to shareholders if the relevant assets were held directly (or, in the case of a non-asset related receipt, if the relevant amount were received directly) there is no obvious reason for changing the current provisions which allow capital gains to be distributed tax free. 166. The Group has considered three cases in particular in this respect: • Sales of shares in CFCs by a company. The Group considers that gains from the sale of shares in a non-attributing CFC should not be taxed if the seller is a company, but should be taxed otherwise. Accordingly, such gains made by a company should not be able to be passed through tax-free to shareholders, unless perhaps the shareholder is a company which also would not have been taxable on the gain. • Sales of shares in FIFs by a company, assuming that these remain subject to the FDR method. Gains in excess of FDR income are treated as capital gain amounts (see in particular section CD 44(8C)). Tax- free treatment of such distributions should continue, since it produces the same result as direct ownership by the shareholder. • Unrealised capital gains accrued before the introduction of the tax. Transitional relief means these gains are not proposed to be taxed to the company. In order to preserve this benefit, distribution of such gains on liquidation should also be tax-free. 167. To illustrate this last point, suppose the following facts. Before the extension of income from capital, Shareholder A contributed $200,000 to A Ltd, which used the money to buy a rental property, with no debt. On the day the tax is introduced, the property is worth $300,000 and this is also the value of the A Ltd shares. One year later the property is sold for $330,000 and A Ltd is wound up. 168. A Ltd will be taxable on $30,000 of its $130,000 gain. At a 28% rate, the tax owing is $8,400. $21,600 can be distributed as a fully imputed taxable dividend. The remaining $100,000 of gain can be distributed as a capital gain amount. Shareholder A will receive a distribution of $321,600 (the sale proceeds less tax). $21,600 will be a fully imputed dividend. The rest of the amount ($300,000) will be treated by Shareholder A as proceeds of sale of shares. Since Shareholder A has a cost base for tax purposes of the value of the shares on the date the tax was introduced, i.e. $300,000, Shareholder A will not be taxed on any of this amount. 169. Suppose instead that Shareholder A sells A Ltd to Shareholder B for $310,000 in between the effective date for the tax on the one hand and the sale of property and distribution of the sale proceeds on the other. There is no change to the company’s tax position. However: 166 Future of Tax Interim Report • Shareholder A now has a pre-CGT capital gain of $100,000 and a taxable gain of $10,000. The $10,000 is the difference between the actual sale price to Shareholder B and Shareholder A’s deemed tax cost of $300,000. • Shareholder B has a dividend of $21,600 fully imputed, plus a loss on sale of $10,000, being the difference between the non- dividend amount received on liquidation ($300,000) and the amount Shareholder B paid for the shares ($310,000). 170. The amount of income recognised is the same in either case. There is $30,000 of income at the corporate level, and no net income at the shareholder level. Qualifying companies 171. Qualifying companies are able to pass out capital gains to shareholders on a tax-free basis without having to liquidate (other companies can only distribute capital gains to shareholders tax free on liquidation). This regime now applies only to companies already in the regime on 31 March 2011 and is subject to ownership continuity. The only benefit of a qualifying company is the ability to distribute capital gains tax free but be taxed at the lower 28% company tax rate. Under the proposed rules there would be no future tax free capital gain so the regime would seem redundant. On that basis the Group is considering recommending the repeal of this regime. Winding up of a company 172. Currently, the tax rules treat amounts distributed on the winding up of a company as being first a return of available subscribed capital, second distribution of net capital gains, and lastly a dividend. The first two amounts are generally not taxable. The Act also provides that amounts which are taxable as dividends are not also taxable as sale proceeds. We do not consider this would need to change under the proposed rules in terms of the tax outcome. However, we need to consider further the rules distinguishing between returns of capital, distributions of capital gain, and dividends. The distinction will be particularly important for non-resident shareholders, who may face different levels of tax on dividends and capital gains. The policy objective is that realised or unrealised capital gains that arose before the implementation date of the new rules would remain able to be distributed free of either taxation on dividends or tax on gains related to those historical capital gains. XV Taxation of trusts General 173. The taxation of contributions to, and distributions by, trusts has been considered above in the section on roll-over relief. As with companies, extension of the taxation of income from capital should apply to assets held by trusts in the same way as it applies to assets held by individuals. 174. Under this approach, the current approach to taxing trust income would continue to apply. That is, there would be a single layer of income, taxable to either the trustee or a beneficiary. Distributions (other than of beneficiary income) from complying trusts (whether in cash or in kind) would continue to be tax-free to the beneficiary in all cases on the basis that tax has already been paid as trustee income. Distributions from foreign trusts would be tax free to the beneficiary only if they represented corpus or realised capital gains. Realised capital gains would not include gains which are taxable under the new rules. Avoidance 175. The realised capital gains tax rules may prompt some taxpayers to look for ways to transfer assets without paying the tax. One way this might be achieved is by way of holding the assets in a trust and then “transferring” the trust. While it is not generally possible for a beneficiary of a trust (other than a unit trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes) to transfer its interest to another person for consideration in a way that would give the transferee enforceable rights against the trustee, in the case of a discretionary 167 Future of Tax Interim Report trust, a change of trustees, or a change of the control of a corporate trustee, may be used to achieve an effective transfer of ownership of a trust’s assets. 176. The Act already contains a rule that treats certain changes in a trustee or a trust deed as triggering a deemed disposal of property held by the trust, if the purpose of the change is to defeat the bright line rule in the land taxing provisions. A similar rule would be needed to support the rules taxing capital gains. XVI Taxation of KiwiSaver and other managed investment entities 177. Since the introduction of KiwiSaver and the portfolio investment entity (PIE) regimes in 2007 most managed investment in New Zealand has been through PIEs, though some workplace saving still takes place through superannuation schemes outside the PIE rules. 178. This section considers how the proposed extension of the taxation of income from capital would apply to: • KiwiSaver saving through a multi-rate PIE (MRPIE) in the form of an open ended investment fund. Most KiwiSaver saving is through MRPIEs of this sort; • a MRPIE that is a closed end property fund. This is another relatively common form of PIE; • a listed PIE; • a superannuation fund. 179. It is important to ensure that any tax extension in relation to income from capital takes these vehicles into account, given their important role in investing New Zealanders’ capital. It is also important to recognise that investments can be made directly or through vehicles. So far as possible, the tax rules should maintain a level playing field between those choices. KiwiSaver investment through MRPIEs 180. Key features of the MRPIE tax regime, which should not be disturbed by the new rules if at all possible, are: • imposition of only one level of tax; • imposition of tax at portfolio investor rates, generally lower than but related to the investor’s marginal tax rate; • income calculated on the same basis as it would be if an individual invested directly; • keeping tax “outside the fund”, so that it is treated as an investor level expense rather than a fund level expense. 181. For most assets held by MRPIEs, the new rules will have no effect: • Debt investments are already comprehensively taxed under the financial arrangement rules. • Portfolio shares, other than Australian listed and New Zealand shares (for this purpose, referred to as “foreign shares” and “Australasian shares” respectively), are proposed to continue to be subject to the FDR regime. 182. The new rules would only affect MRPIEs investing in property and in Australasian shares although these constitute a material part of many KiwiSaver and other managed fund investments. Under current law, a gain on sale of Australasian shares by a PIE is specifically tax exempt, and gains from sales of property are generally on terms that mean that they too are not taxed. This aligns the taxation of assets held by MRPIEs with the taxation of assets held directly by natural persons or trusts (in most cases). However, under the new rules, gains from sales of these assets will prima facie be taxable to natural persons and trusts, so it follows that they should also be taxable to a PIE. 183. Feedback from advisors and industry suggests that imposing a realised capital gains tax on such assets held by MRPIEs, while retaining the benefits of the MRPIE tax 168 Future of Tax Interim Report regime, would require significant systems changes, amongst other practical issues. This appendix attempts to describe the issue that applying a realised capital gains tax would cause. It then goes on to consider some other options. Realised capital gains tax for MRPIEs 184. The tax issue is in part a function of the open-ended nature of MRPIEs 86 , and in part a function of the tax benefits they provide. The key issue is the need to allocate realised gains and losses to investors not on a simple pro rata basis (that is, pro rata with the value of their investments on the day of realisation). Instead realised gains and losses need to be allocated taking into account the movement in the value of the assets during the period the investor has actually been invested in the MRPIE. We refer to this approach to taxing realised gains or losses on Australasian shares held by a MRPIE as a “partnership approach”. 185. Suppose for example that a MRPIE buys an asset at the beginning of June for $1,000. At the beginning of July it is worth $1,300 and at the end of August when it is sold it is worth $1,200 (so the income to be allocated to investors is $200). Suppose also that investors A and B own 1% of the MRPIE at the beginning of June, but at the end of June, B redeems her units for cash, and is replaced by C, who invests an equivalent amount. A owns 1% of the fund throughout the period. 186. In order for the current benefits of the PIE regime to be retained, A and C cannot be allocated an equal share of the $200 gain on realisation of the asset at the end of August. A must be allocated $2, i.e. 1% of the gain. However, C bought into the fund on 30 June, when the asset was worth $1,300. That is, C will have paid $13 for her 1% interest in the asset. It would clearly be wrong for her to be taxed, like A, on $2 of the realised gain. She should have a loss of $1. The balancing figure 86 That is, they stand ready on a daily basis to issue and redeem their interests. This means that they need to keep a very good track of the value of their portfolios, and also that investors who want to cash out their investments will generally do so by way of redemption rather than sale. is B, who should have a taxable gain of $3, which will reflect her economic gain on exiting the MRPIE on the basis that the asset was worth $1,300. 187. Currently this kind of calculation is not required. All of a MRPIE’s taxable income is able to be accrued on a daily basis (using either a market value method or FDR) and allocated to investors on a per unit basis during that day. Changes in the value of Australasian shares are accrued, generally on a daily basis, for the purpose of determining the prices at which the fund should issue and redeem units. But there is no need to allocate realised capital gains at all, because those gains are not taxed. 188. In order for a MRPIE to allocate realised capital gain using a partnership approach, it would need to keep a record, for all units issued on a particular day, of the gain or loss arising for each relevant investment held by the PIE on that day. This record would have to be maintained until a unit was redeemed (at which time all the unrealised gain or loss attributable to that unit would be crystallised) or the relevant investment was sold. The gain or loss on sale would be adjusted for any gain or loss already recognised due to redemptions (and, prima facie, subscriptions, as referred to below). The gain or loss so adjusted would be allocated to the units existing on sale in accordance with the amount of accrued gain and loss allocated to them with respect to the investment, which in turn would depend on when the units were issued. 189. The partnership approach also suggests that when a PIE issues units to a new investor, existing unitholders should be treated as selling to that investor a share of their investments, thus triggering a taxable gain or loss for existing unitholders. However, it might be possible to suspend such gain or loss until the investors redeem or the investment is sold by the PIE. 169 Future of Tax Interim Report 190. The example above is very much simplified. In reality, units are issued and redeemed on a daily basis, and MRPIEs are frequently investing in other MRPIEs. A retail KiwiSaver scheme will often invest in a wholesale PIE that in turn invests in a specialist PIE that invests in actual shares. Applying this partnership approach to determining PIE income would raise significant practical problems and system changes. 191. A further issue is the effect that a realised capital gains tax would have on proceeds available to an investor in a MRPIE on withdrawal of their investment. Currently, MRPIEs generally provide pricing data based on pre-tax redemption proceeds, on the basis that tax is a matter for the investor, and in any event depends on the investor’s tax rate. But the discrepancy between pre-tax and post- tax redemption proceeds is relatively small, given that tax is paid on accrued income at least annually. If a tax were imposed on a realisation basis, then for a MRPIE that did not realise shares for long periods, the discrepancy between pre-tax and post-tax investment proceeds could be much greater, which might be difficult for investors to appreciate in advance of redemption. 192. It should be understood that this partnership approach to MRPIE taxation would not involve any additional layer of tax on PIE investment. Only the gains of the MRPIE would be taxed. There would be no further tax on distributions or withdrawals, except, in the case of a withdrawal, to the extent of accrued unrealised gains attributable to the withdrawing investor. This income would be calculated by the MRPIE and attributed to the withdrawing investor along with the attribution of other income earned during the withdrawal period. 193. It might be also be considered desirable to consider the taxation of sales of units in a MRPIE. Currently, sales of units in MRPIEs are rare, and in any event are usually treated by the MRPIE as redemptions by the transferor followed by a fresh issue of shares to the transferee. If a realisation based tax were imposed without any tax on the sale of MRPIE interests, sales might be seen as a way of transferring effective ownership without tax and thus deferring tax. This is the argument for taxing share gains. However, since MRPIEs can distribute gains as excluded (thus untaxed) income it would seem pointless attempting to tax gains. Taxing unimputed MRPIE distributions would be contrary to the objective of those rules – which is to ensure that tax is paid at the fund level. This is an issue still under consideration. Accrued capital gains tax 194. One way to avoid these difficulties would be for a MRPIE to pay tax on Australasian shares on an accrual basis. This would be consistent with the current systems for calculating the net asset value of the fund, which forms the basis for pricing of unit redemptions and issuances. It would therefore have a relatively low compliance cost. However, it would create a disadvantage for investment through a MRPIE compared to direct investment. Since shares are expected to appreciate in value over time, taxation on accrual is more onerous for the owner than taxation on realisation. The extent of the disadvantage depends on the frequency of trading. The less frequently shares are realised, the more significant the disadvantage of being taxed on an accrual basis. 195. Investment through a MRPIE rather than directly already enjoys the tax advantage of a lower tax rate for most investors. Another potential tax advantage for a MRPIE in paying tax on unrealised gains in Australasian shares is that there would be no need for any loss ringfencing in relation to such shares. 196. If the existing rate differential and removal of ringfencing is not sufficient to counteract the disincentive of accrual taxation on Australasian share gains, a possible way to address this disadvantage would be to reduce the level of inclusion of capital gains from Australasian shares in taxable income. However, the amount of the reduction required to make accrual and realisation based taxes equivalent depends on the level of turnover 170 Future of Tax Interim Report and on the MRPIE’s nominal interest rate. For example, assuming a tax rate of 28%, a nominal interest rate of 5%, and a fund that realises 20% of its accumulated accrued capital gain each year (reflecting an average 5 year holding period), the appropriate rate of inclusion would be 88%. That is, for each $100 of accrued gain, $88 should be subject to tax. At a 50% realisation rate (reflecting an average two year holding period) the appropriate inclusion rate would be 97% (a shorter holding period means taxing on accrual rather than realisation is less costly and therefore justifies a smaller discount). 87 Adoption of a single discount rate for all capital gains on Australasian shares would give a disproportionately large benefit to funds with high turnover, and a disproportionately small benefit to funds with low turnover. However, it would likely be complex to provide a discount that takes into account a fund’s actual trading history, which is likely to change over time. 197. Valuation and liquidity issues are the other reasons for not generally taxing accrued capital gains. Neither would seem to be a problem for these types of PIEs. Their assets are valued, usually on a daily basis, and are easily realisable. Tax on capital gains as a fund expense 198. A third possible way to deal with this issue would be to provide that the tax on capital gains is a fund level expense. This would be a partial return to the pre-PIE tax system, where investment funds were generally taxed as unit trusts. It would require unit prices to be adjusted to recognise the deferred tax liability. In order for the deferred tax liability to be calculated, the tax would have to be imposed at a single rate. A mechanism would then have to be found to adjust this rate to the investor’s marginal rate. Otherwise it would have to be accepted as a derogation from one of the objectives of the PIE regime. The Group does not see this as a promising option 87 The inclusion rate is slightly lower as the tax rate decreases, but the difference is small. For example at a 17.5% rate, the inclusion rate is 86% and 96%. Tax Australasian shares on a FDR or similar basis 199. A fourth option would be to tax Australasian shares on an FDR or similar basis. This would be administratively workable, just as the FDR regime is workable. However, for New Zealand shares it would need to be integrated with the imputation system and would again create a significant distinction between direct and managed investment (assuming direct investment in Australasian shares is not taxed on an FDR basis). Continue with current exclusion 200. The last option is to continue with the current exclusion for gains from Australasian shares. This is the simplest option but would obviously mean that MRPIEs would have a significant tax advantage (no tax on share gains) over direct shareholding or investing via other entities, which would be taxed under the new rules. 201. The Group intends to engage in further consultation with the industry on the above options. Property MRPIEs 202. Some MRPIEs invest in unlisted real property, either directly or through a special purpose company. Because this investment is illiquid, such funds are generally closed, and do not offer redemption facilities. Investors wanting to realise their investment before the fund winds up have to do so by selling their units to another buyer. Accordingly, there is less need for daily valuations or allocations of income. Valuations are typically produced once a month, quarter or year. Allocations of income are on a similar basis. Even though income will accrue on a daily basis, all income for the relevant period (month, quarter or year) will accrue to the investors of record on the allocation date. 203. Property MRPIEs will generally carry a deferred tax balance in their accounts reflecting the difference between the accounting and tax book value of fit out. 171 Future of Tax Interim Report 204. Taxing Property MRPIEs on an accrual basis seems much more problematic than for open ended MRPIEs. Their assets are illiquid and more difficult to value. The imposition of tax on a realisation basis also seems less problematic, in that such investments are generally longer term ones from the perspective of the investor. Accordingly, it may be preferable for Property MRPIEs to pay tax on a realisation basis, and to allocate this tax to investors of record on the date the realisation occurs. 205. However, taxation on this basis raises a number of issues in relation to sales of interests in Property MRPIEs. In particular: • if sales of MRPIE interests are not taxable, then it would be possible for the tax on sale of a Property MRPIE’s assets to be eliminated by ensuring that all of the interests in the MRPIE are acquired by a tax exempt investor, such as a charity, shortly before the sale; • it may be difficult for a MRPIE to calculate its deferred tax liability, since the rate of tax on sale would depend on the tax rate of investors at the time of sale (though if the MRPIE holds its properties in a company rather than directly, the prima facie deferred tax liability might be on the basis of the ordinary corporate tax rate). 206. The Group intends to engage in further consultation on this issue. Listed PIEs 207. The amount invested in listed PIEs is much smaller than that invested in MRPIEs. Listed PIEs are not vehicles for KiwiSaver investment. Nevertheless, they are a material part of our capital market. 208. Listed PIEs are generally taxed as companies. Investors do not pay tax on an attribution basis, but on dividends, with imputation credits able to be attached in the usual way. The difference between taxation of a Listed PIE and taxation of an ordinary company is that: • a Listed PIE is tax exempt on gains from sale of Australasian shares; • dividends paid by a Listed PIE are: – required to be imputed to the extent the company has credits to do so; – excluded income to the extent they are not imputed; – able to be excluded from income at the election of the shareholder to the extent that they are imputed. 209. These rules mean investors in a Listed PIE are taxed in a similar way to investors in a MRPIE (though the tax rates for lower marginal rate investors will usually be higher than their portfolio investor rates). However, the investors’ liquidity is provided by trading on the market rather than by redemptions. 210. From a practical perspective, because Listed PIEs do not have to attribute income to their investors, it should be possible for them to pay tax on gains on a realisation basis. 211. Under the new rules, distributions by a Listed PIE can continue to be treated as they are at present: • Unimputed dividends should continue not to be taxable, though for PIEs holding Australasian shares or real property investments, the amount of unimputed dividends will be reduced, since the Listed PIE’s gains will generally be taxable (as for other companies, gains accrued before the extension of the tax will remain exempt). Gains on shares taxed under the FDR regime in excess of the 5% rate would continue to be tax exempt, and therefore would give rise to unimputed dividends when distributed. 172 Future of Tax Interim Report • Imputed dividends should continue to be able to be excluded from income at the election of the investor, so as to ensure the tax rate on the investments does not exceed 28%. 212. Gains from sale of shares in a Listed PIE should prima facie be subject to tax. However, as with MRPIEs listed PIEs can distribute any gain to investors as excluded untaxed income – by way of issuing new shares. If listed PIEs were not able to distribute unimputed income as excluded income but MRPIEs were, there would seem to be a clear incentive for listed PIEs to reform as MRPIEs and establish a market for investors to sell units just as some property MRPIEs already do. Again this is still under consideration but the Group has a concern if individuals owning shares will be taxed on gains but investors in closely substitutable entities are not. This is for the same reason that sales of shares in any other company should be subject to tax. If the sale is not taxable, investment in a Listed PIE can be used as way for shareholders to dispose of otherwise taxable assets without having to pay tax. While the sale price will be discounted for the Listed PIE’s deferred tax liability, this discount does not result in any actual tax revenue, and will generally be less than the amount of tax otherwise payable (because it is deferred). Furthermore, tax-free disposals could be used as a way to transfer income from higher rate taxpayers to lower rate ones. These issues are all still being considered. Other Entities 213. Life Offices are another entity where policyholders are not taxed on unimputed distributions of income. It follows that it might not be appropriate to tax policyholders on gains in their policies at the policyholder level. That is, it might not be appropriate to tax these investors in a manner similar to shareholders – once at the entity level and again at the shareholder level. 88 An example is AMP Life Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940. 214. Māori authority distributions are taxable only when the distribution is out of income of the Māori authority. A distribution of accrued gains (even if taxable on realisation) would not it seems be a distribution of income so that again it might not be appropriate to tax members on gains in selling any interest in a Māori authority. This issue may have little or no practical significance, since interests in Māori authorities are generally not able to be sold. XVII Taxation of corporate groups 215. Sales of shares of group companies raise particular double tax and double deduction issues especially if income or loss can be attributed from a company to another group member, and the attributing company is later sold. For example, a group company could incur a loss and have the loss transferred to another group company, which allows the other group company to enjoy the loss through attribution. The loss company, whose shares will have fallen in value as a result of incurring the loss, could be sold and the selling company thereby would realise a capital loss. 88 This would allow the same economic loss to effectively be deducted twice within the group. Similar issues arise with attribution in the consolidation regime and also through extracting value with exempt intra-group dividends. Possible double deduction issues for companies outside of the company group context were discussed in paragraph 160 and 163. 216. An example of why adjustments are necessary in loss attribution scenarios: • Suppose a member of a company group incurred a tax loss. It could deduct this loss itself, but the benefit of the tax deduction would be confined to that company. The company would be likely to fall in value as a result of incurring the loss. The parent company could sell the shares of the company and realise a loss from selling its 173 Future of Tax Interim Report shares, but this is the only time the parent would have a tax benefit from the loss it suffered through owning the subsidiary that lost income. • Suppose instead the loss company transferred the loss to the parent. The parent could deduct the transferred loss. The loss company’s shares would also have fallen in value as a result of incurring the loss. If the parent sold those shares for a loss, the parent company would be allowed a deduction for that, in addition to the loss it deducted when the loss was transferred to it. The parent would have claimed the same economic loss twice. • In order prevent this, the cost base of the shares of the loss company should be reduced by the amount of the loss transferred. This reduces the capital loss to be incurred on the sale by the same amount, preventing the double loss deduction for the parent. • Consequential adjustments would also be required to the cost base of the shares of the company which benefits from having the loss transferred to it. This is explained in the discussion below. 217. Some countries have considered these issues and have adopted share cost base adjustment rules which manage them. The following describes the rules the Group considers might be required under the new rules in the company group context. Cost base of shares – general rules 218. Before discussing the adjustments, it is useful to recap the general rules for determining the cost base of shares for any shareholder of a company. This does not consider details of cost base rollover adjustments as a result of rolling over income or loss. • Acquisition cost – the starting point for the shareholder’s cost base in shares is the cost of acquiring them. If they are purchased from another shareholder, it is the purchase price. If the shares are acquired upon incorporation of a new company, it is the amount contributed to the company in exchange for the initial issue of shares. If a new company is incorporated and property (other than cash) is contributed, then rollover rules could potentially apply which means the company shares’ cost base would be the cost base of the transferred property rather than the market value of the transferred property. • Capital contribution – If an existing shareholder makes additional capital contributions with respect to shares it already owns (as opposed to having new shares issued), then the cost base of the shares is increased by the amount of additional capital contributed to the company (again, if property is contributed, rollover could potentially apply). • Company distributions – Although a distribution from a company with respect to its shares (such as by a dividend) is a transfer of value from the company to the shareholder, the general rule is not to adjust the cost base of shares for the distribution. If the distribution is an imputed dividend, then no adjustment should be made because the distribution is of income that has already been taxed. If the cost base of the shares were reduced, then there could potentially be double tax when the shares are later sold. If the distribution is an unimputed dividend, then the dividend itself is usually taxable, so there is no need to reduce the cost base of the shares. A special rule for an unimputed dividend that is not taxable because of the intercorporate dividend exemption is discussed below. If a distribution is by way of a share buyback with some shares cancelled, then the distribution results in a realised gain or loss on disposal of those shares, with the cost base of the remaining shares unchanged. If the distribution is made in liquidation of a company, then there would be a realised gain or loss on disposal of the shares (although if the shareholder is a company that owns all of the shares of the liquidated company, then rollover may apply). 174 Future of Tax Interim Report Elective group loss transfers 219. If two or more companies are members of the same at-least 66% commonly-owned group, then a loss of one company may be transferred to another company in the group. This may be done simply by electing and reporting the transfer in self-assessment, or by having the loss-receiving company pay the loss-transferring company a payment equal to the amount of the loss (a subvention payment). The subvention payment is deductible/assessable. Group loss offset – no subvention payment 220. Take the case where a loss offset is affected without a subvention payment. If no adjustment is made, then a grouped loss has the potential to be deducted twice. For example, in the AMP Life Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 case referred to above, a group company whose shares were held on revenue account incurred a loss which was transferred to its parent company. The shares in the group company were later sold for a loss. This resulted in the same economic loss to effectively being deducted twice. 221. In order to prevent this the Group proposes that the cost base of the shares of the company transferring the loss must be reduced by the amount of the loss transferred. This means a capital loss from selling the shares is reduced by the same amount as the loss transferred. 222. Suppose the company that transferred the loss is two levels down from the company that sells the shares (of the loss company’s parent). There is still a double loss potential unless the cost base of the parent company’s shares is also reduced. This means a cost base reduction for the amount of the transferred loss must be mirrored up a chain of companies. Loss co ($100) Profit Co $100 loss transferred To Profit Co Loss Parent 1 Loss Parent 2 Profit Parent To p C o Reduce Loss Parent 1 basis in Loss Co shares by $100 Reduce Loss Parent 2 basis in Loss Parent 1 shares by $100 Reduce Top Co basis in Loss Parent 2 shares by $100 175 Future of Tax Interim Report 223. Although the cost base of the loss transferring company’s shares are reduced, the total cost of the group shares as a whole should not change, as the shareholders (collectively) still paid a certain amount for the group company shares (collectively). In order to reflect this, the company receiving the benefit of the transferred loss should have the cost base of its shares increased by the amount of the loss it receives. It obtains the benefit of having tax on its profit offset by the transferred loss, which is the intended policy outcome. This benefit increases the value of the company. Unless an adjustment is made to the cost base of its shares by increasing it for the loss received, this benefit would be undone by capital gain on selling its shares. In order to prevent this, the cost base of the shares should be increased by the amount of the loss it receives. As with the loss company, the increase in the cost base of the shares should be mirrored up a chain of companies. 224. Suppose a loss is transferred from a subsidiary to its parent. The cost base of the shares of the subsidiary should be reduced by the amount of the loss transferred. Under the mirroring provision, the cost base of the shares of the parent should also be reduced by the amount of the loss transferred. But under the rule for receiving the transferred loss, the cost base of the shares of the parent should be increased by the amount of the loss. In effect, these two adjustments cancel each other out, and the cost base of the shares of the parent remains unchanged. This is the right outcome as, from the perspective of the shareholder of the parent, its cost in the two-company group is the same and the sharing of loss between the two companies does not affect the cost of the shares of the parents of the two-company group. Loss co ($100) Profit Co $100 loss transferred To Profit Co Loss Parent 1 Loss Parent 2 Profit Parent To p C o Reduce Loss Parent 1 basis in Loss Co shares by $100 Reduce Loss Parent 2 basis in Loss Parent 1 shares by $100 Reduce Top Co basis in Loss Parent 2 shares by $100 Increase Profit Parent basis in Profit Co shares by $100 Increase Top Co basis in Profit Parent shares by $100 176 Future of Tax Interim Report Other provisions • Loss exceeds cost base of shares – we do not propose that the cost base of shares could ever be negative. Therefore, the negative adjustment to the cost of the base of the shares of the loss company would be the lesser of the loss amount and the cost base of the shares (before the adjustment). 89 Since the adjustment to prevent the double deduction could not then be fully made, we also proposed that the adjustment for the company receiving the loss be the amount of the loss company’s adjustment, even if it less than the amount of the loss transferred. As the loss adjustment is mirrored up a chain of companies, no company’s shares cost base could be less than zero (although, if this limit applies to reduce a parent company’s adjustment by more than the loss company’s adjustment, we do not propose any additional change to the loss-receiving company’s adjustment). 89 There is an argument that the excess of the transferred loss over the cost base of the shares should be treated as income, however, we are not proposing this. • Minority interests – the loss transfer provisions require at least 66% common shareholding, so it is possible that there could be minority shareholders in the loss or profit company. As minority shareholders generally will not benefit from the loss transfer, no adjustment should be made for shares they own in the loss company. An adjustment should be made only for shares held by a company that is in a group with at least 66% common ownership with both the loss company and the company receiving the loss transfer. If an adjustment is made for less than 100% of the loss company shares, an adjustment for the full amount of the loss transferred must be made for those shares that are able to be adjusted. Loss co ($100) Loss Parent 1 Loss Parent 2 To p C o Loss Co transfers $100 loss to Loss Parent 1 Reduce Loss Parent 1 basis in Loss Co shares by $100 Cost base of shares unchanged Cost base of shares unchanged 177 Future of Tax Interim Report •Timing of adjustments – Elective loss transfers are usually decided after the end of the income year, when tax returns are filed. So there could be some logic to having the adjustment effective as of the last day of the income year. However, because the loss transfer affects the tax position of the companies during the income year, and the potential of double loss could arise if the loss company is sold during the same income year, we proposed that if a relevant company is sold during the year, an adjustment must be made immediately before the sale. Group loss offset – subvention payment 225. If a group loss offset is given effect by a subvention payment – then the treatment is much simpler. No share cost base adjustments would be necessary. 226.The loss company would receive a payment from the profit company in order to absorb the loss. This will transfer value to the company so the loss no longer represents in inherent loss in the value of the shares. The same will apply for the profit company. The profit company obtains the benefit of the loss offsetting tax on its profit, but the company’s value is reduced by the amount of the payment, so there is no need to increase the cost base of shares in order to prevent double tax. Consolidated groups 227.Companies that are members of a New Zealand consolidated group must still determine their own taxable income. 90 The taxable income of each group member is combined (subject to some adjustments) and tax for the group is paid by the nominated company. 228.Each member of the consolidated group can be viewed as contributing their income and loss to the group as a whole on a current basis. This raises the possibility of double deductions or double tax if a group member is 90 See section FM 3 Income Tax Act 2007. 91 The Income Tax Act currently has an anti-avoidance rule if shares in a consolidated group member are held on revenue account and they are sold for a loss after manipulations to reduce the value of the shares. See sections CV 3 and FM 23. 92 Treas.Reg. section 1.1502-32. sold unless automatic adjustments are made. This is an issue already, but currently it is unlikely that shares in a consolidated group member would be held on revenue account. 91 The United States has comprehensive rules for making adjustments to the cost base of shares in consolidated group companies. 92 We are proposing adopting rules such as these but much simpler. 229.For each year, the cost base for shares in each consolidated group member would be: •the opening cost base; plus •contributions to capital made during the year; plus •taxable income of the group member as determined under section FM 3(2) (if positive); less •distributions of the consolidated group member made during the year; less •tax loss of the group member as determined under section FM 3(2) (if negative). 230.As with the elective loss transfer, for chains of companies, adjustments to the share cost base of lower-tier companies should be mirrored up a chain of companies. Also, share cost bases should not be reduced below zero. 231. Adjustments should be made at the end of the income year, but if a relevant company is sold during the income year, the adjustment should be made with effect immediately before the sale. 232.Further consideration needs to be given to the treatment of intra-group transactions, which are ignored when determining a member company’s taxable income position, to ensure no unintended consequences arise. 178 Future of Tax Interim Report Corporate groups – exempt intercorporate dividend 233. A last category for an automatic adjustment is for payment of a dividend from a wholly- owned group member. 234. As mentioned earlier, generally no adjustment would be required for receipt of an imputed dividend (as that is usually a distribution of taxed income) or for receipt of an unimputed dividend (since the dividend is usually taxed). However, we propose that the cost base of shares in a wholly-owned subsidiary should be reduced by the amount of a dividend paid by the wholly-owned subsidiary, unless: •The dividend is imputed, and the shareholder and the company are not members of the same imputation group of companies; or •The dividend is paid by a member of the same imputation group of companies, and the dividend was paid out of income that was taxable income of the company paying the dividend; it is appreciated that there will be practical difficulties in applying this rule and it is still being considered. 235. The last point reflects the fact that an imputation group allows easy transfers of credits within the group, so payment of an imputed dividend is not, in itself, sufficient to establish that it was paid out of taxed income of the company. The reason for this rule can be shown by a simple example: •Parent Co owns Sub Co. The cost of the Sub Co shares is $100 and Sub Co has assets worth $100. •Buyer wants to buy all the shares of Sub Co. It is willing to pay Parent Co $100 for the shares. •Instead, Parent and Buyer agree to the following: –Buyer lends Sub Co $90; –Sub Co pays a $90 dividend to Parent Co (reducing the value of Sub Co shares from $100 to $10) (the dividend is exempt under section CW 10); –Buyer pays $5 to Parent Co for all of the shares of Sub Co (generating a $95 capital loss for Parent Co but only a $5 economic loss, which is amply compensated for by the tax benefit); –Buyer owns all of the shares of Sub Co. It capitalises the loan and has the shares with a cost base of $95. 236.Although such an extreme transaction could be challenged, it serves to illustrate the general issue which could be addressed with an adjustment for the cost base of the shares for the payment of an exempt dividend in some cases. XVIII Livestock and other assets 237.An essential part of the detailed design of the rules for extending the taxation of capital gains will be integration with existing regimes. The integration will depend on the more material design issues referred to in this Appendix. For example, the bloodstock tax regime might be unaffected as bloodstock are already either held on revenue account (taxable) or exempt from tax, depending on the activities of the owner. 238.Farmers can apply various regimes for valuing livestock for tax purposes, including national standard costs or by applying the herd scheme. National standard cost in effect treats livestock as trading stock of the farmer. Because national standard cost livestock is explicitly on revenue account the rules extending the taxation of capital gains would not apply. 239.However, under the herd scheme livestock is valued each year at the national average market value. Changes in national average market value from year to year are treated as being on capital account and not subject to tax. The Group understand that a significant number of farmers use the herd scheme to value all or most of their livestock. Careful consideration of the issues associated with herd scheme livestock and the proposed rules will be necessary. 179 Future of Tax Interim Report XIX Administrative aspects 240.Because the rules taxing realised capital gains do not impose a new tax, no changes to the existing machinery for returning income and paying tax seem obviously necessary. Nevertheless, the degree to which these rules will impact on Inland Revenue should not be under-estimated. Many taxpayers who have not previously needed to interact with Inland Revenue are likely to be required to do so. For example, a wage or salary earner with just PAYE income and interest income with a holiday home need not file tax returns at present. Under the rules they would need to do so when their holiday home is sold. Overseas experience suggests that taxation of property gains in particular proves to be a technically difficult and contentious area of tax law, especially if the rules have wide roll- over relief and loss ring-fencing. Many family trusts do not prepare financial statements or file tax returns. Whilst an excluded home remains outside the proposed rules, most other assets (share investments, holiday homes) will need to have their cost base and capital improvements recorded (to be deducted against any sale of the property that might realise capital gains). When a person emigrates from New Zealand, a deemed disposal of their New Zealand assets could produce taxable gains and final tax liabilities. 241.Under proposals contained in the recently introduced Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018- 19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill, Inland Revenue will automatically assess an individual’s tax refund or tax to pay where it judges that the income information which it has received for the person from third parties such as employers and banks throughout the year (reportable income), represents all income for the period. 242.Because any taxpayer may have made a capital gain in any tax year, the number of cases in which Inland Revenue would be confident to automatically assess based on reportable income would reduce, unless there was some in-year reporting of gain information. Even then, it would not be possible for the Commissioner to complete their assessment since capital gain income is highly likely to have expenses deductions. Inland Revenue will need the systems and resources to administer what will be a material expansion of the income tax administration, both in terms of funding, and technically skilled staff and audit capability. 243.The Group’s preliminary views on certain compliance issues are as follows: •Withholding taxes. These seem especially relevant to individuals, who might otherwise not be required to file a tax return. It may be sensible to impose tax on gains on sale on a withholding basis, where the tax is paid either by the vendor or the purchaser. Withholding tax is already part of the brightline provisions, where land is sold by a non-resident. Imposing a withholding tax could improve collections but might not necessarily reduce compliance costs (higher costs for the payer required to make the withholding payment and individuals would still require a “wash up” calculation in an annual tax return). Setting a withholding rate would be problematic as net gains are taxed and withholding taxes ordinarily apply to gross payments. It is also not clear to what extent withholding taxes could be relied upon. A further difficulty is that withholding obligations should not be imposed on shares if that would be likely to reduce the liquidity of capital markets. • The effect on provisional tax obligations. It might not be sensible for a person who derives a large gain from a one-off sale to thereby be put into the provisional tax regime, with consequences not only for the year of the sale, but for the next year too. It is possible that current provisional tax rules should apply given that taxpayers already have the option of estimating at the third provisional tax date. We note that owners of revenue account property can already face late changes in provisional tax liabilities and the new rules would not change this. 180 Future of Tax Interim Report •Information obligations. Given the amount of time that may pass between a cost being incurred to acquire or improve a capital asset and that cost being deductible (i.e. when the asset is sold), in the Group’s view it may be desirable for some kind of contemporaneous documentation to be required to be filed with Inland Revenue on an annual basis, itemising the cost of the assets subject to the rules, in order to ease compliance at the time of sale. It need not be the case that this documentation creates any kind of obligation on the Commissioner to confirm it until the time when the relevant asset is sold. The Commissioner would also have ready access to the cost information should an audit be required. XX Other Issues 244.There are a number of other issues largely relating to how the new rules would integrate with existing tax rules. These include: •existing rules for taxing revenue account property (including their holding costs); • finance lease and share swap rules; •bad debt rules restricting deductions if not in the business of lending or trading and if to an associated person; •share cancellation and repurchase and Treasury stock rules; •share for share exchanges and share lending; •amalgamation of companies; •employee share schemes and options. 245.We expect that there will also be other issues that will arise as a result of industry and stakeholder consultation and of course through the Generic Tax Policy Process. 181 Future of Tax Interim Report In the course of its consideration of the issues discussed in this report, the Group received advice papers from its Secretariat - a cross agency group of officials mainly from the Treasury and Inland Revenue.

These projections rely on modelling assumptions and are subject to uncertainty. All estimates are preliminary and presented for indicative purposes only. All estimates using Household Economic Survey (HES) data should be considered indicative and may have wide confidence intervals. Sample survey data is subject to sampling and non-sampling errors. These estimates have been produced either directly from HES or using the Treasury’s micro-simulation model of the tax and welfare system. Estimates rely on modelling assumptions and are subject to considerable uncertainty. The 1988 Jensen equivalence scale has been used for equivalizing household incomes. In some cases, the officials’ secretariat has made adjustments to reflect underreporting of household expenditure in survey data compared with the national accounts aggregates. Owing to data limitations, such adjustments are approximate and may not accurately reflect differences across expenditure categories or income deciles. In some cases, there are differences between charts and estimates in the Interim Report and earlier officials’ papers owing to data updates and modelling changes. All estimates are subject to further data updates and modelling refinements. Access to HES data was provided by Statistics New Zealand under conditions designed to give effect to the security and confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act 1975. 183 Future of Tax Interim Report Accommodation supplement: A non-taxable benefit payment that provides cash assistance for a person’s accommodation costs in the private market (both owners and renters).

[Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-annual-rates-trans-tasman-savings-portability-kiwisaver-and-remedial-matters-act-2010 "Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010")

Facilitation of Budget 2010 PIE tax rate changes
================================================

2010 Act facilitates Budget 2010 tax rate changes to portfolio investment entity (PIE) investments. Amendments apply from 1 Oct 2010.

### Background

To coincide with the personal tax cuts announced in the 2010 Budget, the tax rates that apply to portfolio investment entity (PIE) investments (known as prescribed investor rates or PIRs) are being reduced from 1 October 2010. The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act contained some provisions to facilitate this change in rate, including a transitional method for applying the new rates.

This Act contains an alternative transitional method, designed to reduce compliance costs for some PIEs, and also some remedial amendments to the changes introduced in the Budget Act.

### Key features

#### Alternative part-year calculation method

*   An exit PIE can elect to treat the 2010-11 tax year as if it were two tax years, split by 1 October. A PIE that elects this option calculates its tax liabilities based on existing PIRs until 30 September, and based on the post-Budget PIRs from 1 October onwards.
*   PIEs that elect this method will generally have to file returns and pay tax for both part-years.
*   Foreign tax credits that are attributable to the first part-year ending on 30 September can be carried over to the second part-year.

### Detailed analysis  

#### Alternative part-year calculation method ("hard close" option) (section HM 42B)

The Act introduces new section HM 42B, which provides that for the 2010-11 tax year, PIEs to which section HM 42 applies (exit PIEs) can elect to treat the year as two separate tax years, split by 1 October 2010. A PIE makes such an election by filing its returns under sections 57B(5) or (7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) as described below.

If a PIE is not an exit PIE, or it does not make an election to use this transitional method, it must apply the 1 October PIR changes as set out in HM 60(3).

##### Effect of calculation method

A PIE that elects this option calculates its investors' tax liabilities using existing PIRs (12.5%, 21%, 30%) for the first part-year (1 April to 30 September). The PIE then calculates its investors' tax liabilities for the second part-year (1 October to 31 March) using the post-Budget PIRs (10.5%, 17.5%, 28%).

If an investor notifies an electing PIE of a new PIR after 1 October, that PIR is only applied to income attributed to the second part-year. The investor's tax liability for the first part-year remains unchanged.

##### Requirements for returns and tax payments

Section HM 42B(3) provides that an electing PIE must generally file tax returns and pay any resulting tax at the end of both part-years. However, a PIE can choose to send account summaries to its investors and certain information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, as required by sections 31C(4) and 57B(7) of the TAA respectively, separately for each part-year, or in a single consolidated form.

##### Treatment of foreign tax credits

Section HM 42B(4) sets out that foreign tax credits are not extinguished by the end of the first part-year. Specifically, despite the deemed tax year-end on 30 September, foreign tax credits (credits under subpart LJ) that are attributable to the first part-year can be carried over and used in the second part-year.

Credits attributable to the second part-year cannot be used to offset tax liabilities in the first part-year, as those liabilities are crystallised when the PIE performs its end-of-year tax calculation on 30 September.

#### Transition of rate for certain investors (section HM 58)

Section HM 58 is designed to automatically change investors' notified investor rates to reflect the new PIRs that take effect from 1 October 2010.

The Act introduces a remedial amendment to this section, so that investors with a notified investor rate of 19.5% are also transferred to the appropriate new rate, 17.5%, on 1 October. This change is necessary because PIEs with late balance dates will not necessarily have transitioned their investors from 19.5% to the 21% rate (introduced in the 2009 Budget) at 1 October 2010. Without the amendment, those PIEs would not have been able to use the section as it was intended.

#### Amendments to the existing PIR transitional rule (section HM 60)

The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act included a transitional method for PIEs to apply the 1 October PIR change. This Act makes two remedial amendments to that transitional rule.

*   In section HM 60(3), the words "in every period for the income year" are replaced by "in the period". This change clarifies that quarterly PIEs, which calculate and pay tax each quarter, need to apply an updated notified investor rate only to the current and future quarters. PIEs with yearly calculation periods must apply the rate most recently notified by an investor to every day in the current income year.
*   Despite the above rule, for the 2010-11 income year, a PIE with a yearly calculation period only has to apply a tax rate notified on or after 1 October to every day on or after 1 October. For days before 1 October, the PIE has a choice: it can apply the pre-Budget tax rate that corresponds to the newly notified rate, or it can choose not to adjust the investor's tax liability for days prior to 1 October.

The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act also repealed the exemption to the rule in section HM 60(3), described above. This exemption applied if the PIE made voluntary payments of tax to meet an investor's tax liability under section HM 45. The repeal was unintended. This Act reinstates this exemption through new subsection 3B.

### Application date

These amendments apply from 1 October 2010.
INCLUDED ASSETS EXCLUDED ASSETS How might taxing more capital gains work? Income earned from selling one of the assets below is added to all the other money you earned during the year. Your total income then gets taxed normally like everyone else’s at the same rate. taxworkinggroup.govt.nz READ MORE IN THE FINAL REPORT AT INVESTMENT PROPERTY FAMILY HOME LAND PERSONAL OR HOUSEHOLD ITEMS LIKE: SHARES CAR BUSINESS ASSETS BOAT INTANGIBLE PROPERTY SUCH AS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ART Only gains from the start date of any new law would be taxed when an asset is sold. Losses are also calculated from this date. Assets will need to be valued but this doesn’t have to happen on the day the law comes into force. The Group has proposed several ways to help make it easy to determine the valuation. Assets bought before valuation day – any money lost between the day the law came into force and the sale of one of the included assets above, will generally be able to be used to reduce the tax you pay on gains from other assets. However, assets bought after valuation day – losses will generally be able to be used to offset tax paid on other income, but there are some circumstances where this is limited to income earned from asset sales. VALUATION DAY LOSSES taxworkinggroup.govt.nz HOW COULD THE TAX BE APPLIED? HERE ARE SOME SCENARIOS: PROPERTYSHARES MANAGED FUNDS Mary owns a few rental properties. She bought one for $500,000 in 2017 and sells it for $800,000 in 2023. Let’s say new tax rules come into force on 1 April 2021 and Mary decides to accept the next Council Valuation of $700,000 as the value of her house. Mary won’t be taxed on $200,000 gain that occurred before 2021. It’s only the $100,000 gain after 1 April 2021 that matters. Mary spent $70,000 on renovations after the date of the council valuation, but ahead of the sale so her net gain is $30,000. Mary doesn’t earn any wages, but she receives $60,000 each year from her rental income. So how much tax does Mary need to pay in 2023 when she sells the property? Under the current rules, Mary is only taxed on her $60,000 of rental income and not the $30,000 she earns from selling the property, meaning she pays $11,020 in tax. Under the new proposal, Mary would be taxed on $90,000 of income, because her net gain from selling her property is included. This means she pays $20,620 in tax – exactly the same as the amount of tax paid by someone who earns $90,000 in wages. Wiremu bought some shares for $40,000 after the new rules had been introduced. A few years later, he sold them for $50,000. That’s a capital gain of $10,000. Wiremu also earns $48,000 in wages, so his total income in the year he sold the shares is $58,000. Wiremu’s employer would have already sorted the tax on his wages, paying $7,420 to Inland Revenue. At today’s rates, his extra $10,000 would be taxed at 30%. Wiremu will have $3,000 more tax to pay, because of the gain from the shares, for a total tax bill of $10,420. That’s exactly the same as someone who earned $58,000 just in wages.

Her scheme provider took care of the tax she owed, according to the PIR tax rate she selected earlier. Her tax depends on the kind of assets her fund is invested in. Let’s say the value of the parcel of Australian and New Zealand shares in her KiwiSaver increased by $1,000 over the year and her tax rate for KiwiSaver was 28%. Her scheme provider would pay $280 from her account to Inland Revenue. If those shares had a bad year and dropped in value by $1,000, then Alex would get $280 back from Inland Revenue. The Tax Working Group has recommended some reductions to KiwiSaver taxes to ensure that low- and-middle-income earners are better off overall.

What you need to know about factual reviews
-------------------------------------------

The factual review process has been established to enhance the utility of binding rulings in situations where a ruling is, or is likely to be, issued subject to a critical factual condition.

The process will give taxpayers an opportunity to obtain a level of certainty from Inland Revenue regarding the likelihood that the condition will be satisfied.

### What is the status of a factual review?

A factual review is carried out separately from the binding ruling process, and does not constitute an audit or investigation. The carrying out of a factual review will not affect the Commissioner's ability to make a binding ruling under s 91E(4)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Whilst a green letter is not legally binding on the Commissioner, it does constitute Inland Revenue's considered view regarding that issue, which will not be subsequently revisited and/or overturned other than in exceptional circumstances.

If a taxpayer disagrees with the outcome of a factual review, the matter can be taken up if and when an audit is subsequently commenced. Further, the relevant condition can be tested through the disputes process in the usual manner.

The period of a factual review will match the period of the associated binding ruling.

### What happens when you request a factual review?

On receipt of a factual review request, Inland Revenue will consider whether the eligibility criteria have been satisfied, and will notify the taxpayer accordingly.

### How long will a factual review take?

A factual review is an opportunity for taxpayers to enter into a dialogue with Inland Revenue personnel with the relevant experience regarding the likelihood that a factual condition will be satisfied. Personnel will be available for an appropriate amount of time within a 3-month period from the date the request is approved. It is envisaged that during this time there will be ongoing discussion with the taxpayer.

It is hoped that within the allocated time agreement may be reached, or that Inland Revenue is able to reach a concluded view, but neither outcome is guaranteed or a requirement of this process. The 3-month period may be extended in exceptional circumstances, but this will be entirely at the Commissioner's discretion.

Once either an agreement or view is reached, or the amount of time allocated to the factual review has come to an end (if sooner), the outcome of the review will be communicated in writing to the taxpayer. Depending on the timing, this letter may accompany the draft or finalised binding ruling, or may be issued at a later date. Once the outcome of a factual review has been communicated with a taxpayer, no further correspondence will be entered into at that time.

The carrying out of a factual review will only affect the timing of the issue of the related draft or final ruling in exceptional circumstances (ie the issue of a ruling, or completion of the ruling project, will generally not be deferred pending the outcome of the factual review).

### Who bears the cost of the factual review?

There will be no charge made by Inland Revenue to the applicant for a factual review. Where Inland Revenue and the taxpayer agree to engage independent external expertise, the cost will be borne by the taxpayer. In all cases, the taxpayer will be responsible for the costs of its own personnel and any advisers or experts used or consulted by it.

### Information required for a factual review

The factual review will be based on information provided by the taxpayer for the purposes of the binding ruling application, together with:

*   any relevant information supporting the factual position taken,
*   any models/methodologies (i.e. pricing methodologies, calculations, letters from experts), and
*   any further information requested by Inland Revenue.

* * *

Who may apply for a factual review?
-----------------------------------

Only taxpayers who have applied for a binding ruling may request a factual review. A factual review may be requested in writing at any time prior to or immediately following the issue of the ruling.

In practice, such a request is likely to arise as a result of Inland Revenue's binding ruling team advising of the need for a critical condition to the ruling. However, it is possible that the need for such a condition may be identified as early as the pre-lodgement meeting. In those circumstances, the factual review may be carried out in parallel with the consideration of the binding ruling.

A factual review may be requested in relation to one or more critical factual conditions in the ruling (eg conditions as to value, market rates or generally accepted accounting practice). However, to ensure that the Commissioner's limited resources are applied to the most appropriate and necessary cases, a factual review will only be undertaken in situations where Inland Revenue is satisfied that:

*   the factual condition is both potentially contentious and central to the efficacy of the ruling (eg in situations where the arrangement may not proceed unless the condition can be satisfied),
*   an advance pricing agreement could not be sought in the alternative, and
*   Inland Revenue has sufficient resources available to undertake the review.

**In addition, the following will be accorded higher priority:**

*   prospective arrangements (i.e. have not yet commenced),
*   there is major commercial significance, and
*   requests by taxpayers who have entered into a Co-operative Compliance Agreement with the Commissioner.

It is expected, given the requirement that the factual condition must be both contentious and central to the efficacy of the ruling, that the number of qualifying requests for factual reviews will be low.

If you wish to apply for a factual review this must be done in writing and sent to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f684839a9f989185b69f8492d891998082d8988c)

* * *

Who is responsible for the factual review?
------------------------------------------

The reviews will be undertaken by specialist staff with expertise in the relevant commercial matters (eg valuation and financial modelling). Where Inland Revenue does not retain expertise in a specific discipline, with agreement from the taxpayer Inland Revenue may engage independent external expertise (with the cost to be borne by the taxpayer). Where a condition in a prospective arrangement relates to unknown future variables, the factual review will focus on the relevant methodology and/or accepted commercial principles.

Inland Revenue will ensure consistency between the factual review and the binding ruling (particularly aspects of and the terms of the relevant conditions). If the binding ruling to which the factual review relates is withdrawn, or the conclusion provides a final contrary view, the factual review process will end. If you are issued an interim contrary view, the factual review process may be suspended.

* * *

Communication of the outcome of a factual review
------------------------------------------------

The outcome of a factual review will be communicated in writing as either a green (positive), amber (neutral) or red (contrary) letter, as follows:

*   A green letter confirms that Inland Revenue considers that the relevant condition will be, or is likely to be, satisfied. However, the condition will not be removed from the binding ruling. Provided that the taxpayer does not deviate from the factual circumstances that exist when a green letter is issued, Inland Revenue will not seek to further test the condition by way of audit other than in exceptional circumstances.
*   An amber letter indicates that Inland Revenue has not been able to conclude within the amount of time allocated to the factual review that the relevant condition will be, or is likely to be, satisfied. Inland Revenue will not necessarily seek to audit the taxpayer solely as a result of the issue of an amber letter. If the condition is subsequently tested during an audit, the taxpayer will have a further opportunity to engage with Inland Revenue at that time.
*   A red letter indicates that Inland Revenue considers that the relevant condition will not be, or is not likely to be, satisfied, and puts the taxpayer on notice that an audit is likely. If the Commissioner subsequently considers as a result of the audit that the condition is not satisfied, Inland Revenue will then treat the ruling as not applying (in accordance with the binding rulings legislation). It should be understood that even in cases where a red letter is issued, the Commissioner is still required to issue the associated binding ruling including the relevant condition, unless the ruling application is withdrawn.

The outcome of a factual review will not apply in the event of a material omission or misrepresentation relevant to the review. Similarly, the outcome of a factual review will cease to apply if the binding ruling to which it relates ceases to apply (eg because of a material omission or other circumstance within ss 91EB or 91FB of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

Fair dividend rate foreign currency hedges
==========================================

2013 legislation provides a rule allowing eligible taxpayers to apply Fair Dividend Rates to foreign currency hedges rather than the financial arrangement rules.

_Sections CV 18, DV 25, EM 1 to 8 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

There can be a mismatch in the tax treatment of foreign currency hedges and certain offshore assets - those that are taxed under the fair dividend rate (FDR) rules and certain ASX-listed shares. This mismatch can make it more difficult to effectively hedge investments in certain offshore assets.

To address the mismatch, the new legislation provides an optional rule that effectively allows eligible taxpayers to apply FDR to their foreign currency hedges rather than the financial arrangement rules. The new rule is designed to, as much as possible, eliminate the tax mismatch.

To ensure the new rule is robust, there are restrictions on when it can be applied to ensure it is used as intended.

### Background

Under the FDR rules, changes in an asset's value are not taxed. Instead, FDR assets are generally taxed on an imputed return of 5%. Conversely, changes in a hedge's value are fully taxed under the financial arrangement (FA) rules. This mismatch in treatment means that a hedge that is effective in removing the impact of unexpected currency fluctuations before tax ceases to be effective after tax.

To illustrate, say a person has an offshore asset portfolio worth US$10,000 and the NZD/USD exchange rate unexpectedly rises from $0.75 to $0.80. The person's asset portfolio is taxed under the FDR rules. In New Zealand dollars, the portfolio's value falls from NZ$13,333 to NZ$12,500 (rounded to nearest dollar). If the person had used a foreign currency hedge to completely remove the exchange rate risk, before tax is taken into account, the hedge will increase in value by NZ$833, exactly cancelling the change in their portfolio's value. The hedge is totally effective before tax.

The story is different after tax. The offshore assets have lost NZ$833 of value. However, under the FDR rules, no deduction is given for this decrease. Despite this, the $833 increase in the hedge's value is taxable. After tax, the person has lost NZ$833 from their asset portfolio but gained only NZ$600 from their hedge; the shortfall of $233 is created by the tax payment.

The mismatch does not arise with all types of foreign currency-denominated investments. Many assets denominated in foreign currencies are taxed on the same or similar basis to foreign currency hedges. This underpins why the new rule applies only in relation to certain assets.

### Key features

New subpart EM provides for a new tax calculation method for certain foreign currency hedges entered into for assets taxed under FDR or ASX-listed shares that are not subject to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, provided the sale of those shares would not be taxable.

The new rule is optional. Eligible taxpayers can elect what hedges it applies to, and to what extent it applies for each hedge (subject to thresholds) to ensure the use of the new rule is appropriate.

The new rule only applies to widely held entities to help ensure it is used only as intended. These entities generally have muted incentives to take aggressive tax positions, have investment mandates and other documentation that disclose investment strategies.

### Detailed analysis

### _New calculation for income or deductions from a hedge_

New section EM 6 is the core of the new rule. It provides that an eligible taxpayer who has elected to use the new rule has income or an expense of:

FDR portions value x 0.05 x valuation period  
                  days in the year

_FDR portions value_ is the current market value of a taxpayer's hedges to the extent that the taxpayer has elected for this rule to apply to those hedges.

_Valuation period_ is how often a taxpayer values their offshore assets (for example, each day, each week, each month). This period must be shorter than the term of the hedges a taxpayer enters into, to ensure the calculation is carried out at least once per hedge entered into.

This section therefore aligns the tax treatment of FDR assets (and some ASX-listed shares) with hedges of those assets for eligible taxpayers that have elected to use this new rule. Both assets and hedges will be taxed at approximately the same rate and with a common valuation period.

New sections CV 18 and DV 25 provide that the income or expense calculated using the above formula is taxable or deductible (as applicable). Note that section DV 25 does not override the general permission; any deemed expense that arises under section EM 6 must be related to a taxpayer's business in order for it to be deductible. The capital limitation is overridden to ensure that a negative result of the above formula arising due to eligible ASX-listed shares held on capital account is still deductible.

### _Financial arrangement rules will not apply_

New section EM 1(3) provides that the financial arrangement rules do not apply to a hedge to the extent a taxpayer has elected for this new rule to apply (that is, its _fair dividend rate hedge portion_). Tax on the hedge is calculated solely under subpart EM.

The financial arrangement rules apply as usual to the remainder of the hedge.

### _Eligible assets_

The new tax calculation method is available in relation to hedges used to hedge:

*   assets that are taxed under the FDR method; and
*   shares listed on the ASX exchange which are not subject to the FIF rules, provided the sale of those shares would be exempt under section CX 55 or would be a capital receipt as the shares are held on capital account.

The purpose of the new rule is to align the tax treatment of foreign currency hedges with the assets those hedges are entered into for. This mismatch is most significant for hedges entered into for the asset types listed above. For other assets the mismatch is either much less pronounced or does not exist, so the current treatment is more appropriate.

### _Eligible entities_

The new rule for taxing hedges is designed to apply only to widely held investment funds and other similar entities. This restriction is intended to help ensure the new rule will be used only as intended. Widely held funds generally have muted incentives to take aggressive tax positions and have investment mandates and other documentation that disclose investment strategies.

This restriction is provided by new section EM 2, which largely mimics the widely held entity criteria in the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) rules (sections HM 14 and HM 15, together with the exemptions in sections HM 21 and HM 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007).

### _Eligible hedges and hedge portions_

The new rule can only be used in relation to genuine foreign currency hedges - financial arrangements that are entered into with the sole purpose of offsetting exposure to foreign currency exchange movements in the value of their assets.

To reflect this, new section EM 3 provides the criteria for an eligible hedge. For example, a hedge must not be entered into with an associated person and, when it is first entered into, must have a fair value of zero.

An eligible hedge will not automatically be subject to the new tax calculation. A taxpayer must choose this option. This choice can be made for a specific hedge on the day the hedge is entered into or can be made for all hedges entered that will be entered into in the future.

This new method of calculating tax can be applied to part or all of a hedge. Accordingly, the taxpayer's choice needs to include the portion of the hedge or hedges to be subject to the new calculation (the _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ of the hedge). There are limits on this, which are described below.

There is no prescribed way for how this decision is to be made, but sufficient records must be kept in order to satisfy the general record-keeping requirements placed on taxpayers.

_Hedges of hedges_

The definition of a "hedge" for the purposes of subpart EM includes a hedge of a hedge - that is, a foreign currency hedge that effectively cancels out another foreign currency hedge. This can be used to close out a hedge early.

The rules requiring an election for subpart EM to apply, as well as the limits on maximum _fair dividend rate hedge portions_, apply to hedges of a hedge in the same way as they apply to a hedge.

### _Maximum fair dividend rate hedge portions_

The intention of the new rule is that it should only apply to hedges entered into for certain types of offshore investment - in other words, those assets where the tax mismatch is most significant. It is appropriate that hedges entered into for other types of offshore investment continue to be taxed as they are currently. Accordingly, new section EM 5 provides rules that set out the maximum _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ that a taxpayer can elect.

There are two possible methods that a taxpayer can use to determine this maximum. The taxpayer is required to use the same calculation method for all of its hedges. The first method is designed to be accurate but is complicated to apply. The second method is simpler but may be less accurate. To balance this, the latter method is more restrictive.

These calculations need to be performed only on the day a hedge is first entered into. There is an additional quarterly test, described below, to ensure that a hedge's initial _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ remains appropriate over time.

_Method one_

The first calculation method uses the formula:

1.05 x (eligible currency assets + proxied currency assets) \- FDR hedges amount  
                                 calculation hedge amount

_Eligible currency assets_ refers to the eligible assets (as described above) denominated in the same currency as the hedge being entered into (the _calculation currency_).

_Proxied currency assets_ refers to the eligible assets denominated in a different currency but the taxpayer hedges that currency with the _calculation currency_.[1](#01)
In the formula, all amounts should be expressed in the _calculation currency_.

_FDR hedges amount_ refers to the amount of the _calculation currency_ that is hedged by the taxpayer's hedges, excluding the hedge that the calculation is being carried out for (the _calculation hedge_), to the extent that they have elected for this new tax calculation method to apply (that is, each hedge's _fair dividend rate hedge portion_).

_Calculation hedge amount_ refers to the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by the _calculation hedge_.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Z has a portfolio of:<br><br>*   US$20,000 worth of shares in US-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$40,000)<br>*   AU$10,000 worth of shares in Australian companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$15,000)<br>*   AU$20,000 worth of Australian bonds (non-eligible assets, worth NZ$30,000).<br><br>Z currently has two foreign currency hedges:<br><br>*   A hedge for US dollars with a foreign amount hedged of $20,000 (equivalent to NZ$40,000) and a _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ of 0.50.<br>*   A hedge for Australian dollars with a foreign amount hedged of $20,000 (equivalent to NZ$30,000) and a _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ of 0.25.<br><br>Z is looking to enter into a new hedge for AU$10,000. The maximum _fair dividend rate portion_ for the hedge would be 0.55:<br><br>1.05 x (AU$10,000 + $0) \- (AU$20,000 x 0.25)  =  0.55  <br>                              AU$10,000 |     |

_Method two_

The second calculation method uses two formulas. A taxpayer's maximum _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ is the lesser of the two.

The first formula is:

1 - non-eligible currency assets  
           hedges amount

Unlike method one, this formula includes a taxpayer's assets regardless of the currency they are denominated in, not just the _calculation currency_. This may make it simpler for some taxpayers.

_Non eligible currency assets_ refers to the total value of a taxpayer's foreign assets excluding eligible assets, converted to New Zealand dollars. _Hedges amount_ refers to the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a taxpayer's hedges, including the _calculation hedge_, again converted to New Zealand dollars. Importantly, this is _not_ the amount of New Zealand dollars hedged; it is the amount of foreign currency hedged expressed in New Zealand dollars at the day's prevailing exchange rate.

The second formula is:

1.05 x eligible currency assets \- FDR hedges amount  
             current hedge amount

_Eligible current assets_ refers to the market value of a taxpayer's eligible assets.

_FDR hedges amount_ refers to the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a taxpayer's hedges _to the extent the taxpayer has elected for subpart EM to apply to that hedge._

_Current hedge amount_ refers to the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by the hedge currently being entered into.

All amounts in the formula should be converted to New Zealand dollars.

If the result of the first formula is less than zero, the person's maximum _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ is zero.

The objective of this second method is to allocate a taxpayer's hedges to their non-eligible assets first. The rationale is that subpart EM is designed to reduce the fluctuations in the after-tax position of someone who hedges. Currency fluctuations will affect the tax position of non-eligible assets far more than it will affect the tax position of eligible assets. Allocating hedges to non-eligible assets first therefore provides the largest reductions in fluctuations in the after-tax valuation of a taxpayer's portfolio caused by currency movements.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Z from the example above decides instead to use the second method to calculate the maximum _fair dividend rate portion_ for its new $10,000 Australian dollar hedge. This hedge is equivalent to NZ$15,000.<br><br>The value of Z's non-eligible assets (in New Zealand dollars) is $30,000 and the value of Z's eligible assets (in New Zealand dollars) is $55,000. Z currently has a total of $70,000 foreign currency hedged (expressed in New Zealand dollars); after entering into this new Australian hedge its amount of total foreign currency hedged will be $85,000.<br><br>_Result of first formula_<br><br>1 \- NZ$30,000  =  0.65  <br>     NZ$85,000<br><br>For the second formula, Z's US hedge has a _fair dividend rate portion_ of 0.50 and hedges the equivalent of NZ$40,000. Z's Australian hedge has a _fair dividend rate portion_ of 0.25 and hedges the equivalent of NZ$30,000. The item _FDR hedges amount_ in the second formula is therefore NZ$27,500 (= 0.50 x NZ$40,000 + 0.25 x NZ$30,000).<br><br>_Result of second formula_<br><br>1.05 x NZ$55,000 \- NZ$27,500  =  2.02  <br>            NZ$15,000<br><br>The lesser result from the two formulas is 0.65. Z's maximum _fair dividend rate portion_ for its new Australian dollar hedge is therefore 0.65. |     |

### _Quarterly test_

The two apportionment methods described above provide appropriate initial maximum _fair dividend rate hedge portions._ The quarterly test described below ensures that, going forward, the _fair dividend rate hedge portions_ for a taxpayer's hedges remain appropriate.

The formula below provides a taxpayer's _quarterly FDR hedging ratio_:

FDR hedges amount  
eligible currency assets

_FDR hedges amount_ refers to the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a taxpayer's hedges to the extent the taxpayer has elected for this tax calculation to apply to those hedges (that is, the _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ of each hedge), converted to New Zealand dollars. This is not the amount of New Zealand dollars hedged but is the amount of foreign currency hedged, expressed in New Zealand dollars at the day's prevailing exchange rate.

_Eligible currency assets_ refers to the total value of the taxpayer's eligible assets, also converted to New Zealand dollars.

If a person's _quarterly FDR hedging ratio_ is greater than 1.05 they must adjust the _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ to the result of the formula below:

                 0.85                    x FDR hedge portion  
quarterly FDR hedging ration

The effect of this formula is to bring an entity's _quarterly FDR hedging ratio_ to 0.85. This adjustment must be carried out, at the latest, five working days after the end of the quarter.

If a taxpayer breaches the threshold in two consecutive quarters, it will not be able to use this new tax calculation method for currency hedges for the next two quarters.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| At the end of a quarter, the value of Y's portfolio is:<br><br>*   US$10,000 worth of shares in US-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$20,000)<br>*   AU$20,000 worth of shares in Australian companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$30,000).<br><br>Y has currently has a single foreign currency hedge: a hedge for US dollars with a foreign amount hedge of $20,000 (equivalent to NZ$40,000) and a _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ of 0.80.<br><br>In the first formula, the _FDR hedges amount_ is NZ$32,000 (= $40,000 x 0.80) and _eligible currency assets_ is NZ$50,000 (= $20,000 + $30,000). The result under the formula is 0.64:<br><br>NZ$32,000  =  0.64  <br>NZ$50,000<br><br>Y will therefore pass the quarterly test.<br><br>Next quarter the value of Y's shares fall, and they are only worth US$5,000 and AU$10,000 for the US and Australian shares, respectively. Assume for simplicity that exchange rates have not changed, so the US shares are now worth NZ$10,000 and Australian shares worth NZ$15,000.<br><br>In the formula _FDR hedges amount_ remains at NZ$32,000 but the amount of _eligible currency assets_ has fallen to $25,000. The result under the formula is now 1.28.<br><br>NZ$32,000  =  1.28  <br>NZ$25,000<br><br>This exceeds 1.05, so Y will have to adjust its two hedges based on the formula below. This means Y will have to change its _fair dividend rate hedge portion_ on its US dollar hedge so it is 0.53.<br><br>_US dollar hedge_<br><br>0.85 x 0.80  = 0.53  <br>1.28 |     |

### Application date

The new rules apply from 17 July 2013.

1It is generally impractical to hedge every currency a fund is exposed to. Funds therefore often do what is referred to as "proxy hedging". They find correlations between the smaller currencies and larger ones (such as the USD), and hedge their exposure to the smaller currencies using the larger ones.

Fairer administration of child support scheme
=============================================

**12 March 2020**

A proposed law change will improve the administration of the child support scheme to ensure greater fairness for children and their families.

The Child Support Amendment Bill introduced today follows a public consultation exercise in 2017 and subsequent discussions with the Privacy Commissioner and others.

“The proposals in the Bill are aimed at improving the administration of the child support scheme, and do not fundamentally change the child support formula,” said Revenue Minister Stuart Nash.

“The child support scheme affects approximately 135,000 carers, 166,000 liable parents and 185,000 qualifying children.

The main proposals in the Bill would enable:

• fairer and more effective penalty rules,

• a grace period for penalties for people new to the scheme,

• employer deductions of child support for newly liable persons,

• a four year time bar for reassessing child support, and

• a wider definition of “income” for child support purposes.

“The Coalition Government wants to do what’s best for the children in scheme.

“We want to help liable parents get it right from the start and encourage them to meet their obligations. The proposed law change would remove obstacles to compliance and make it simpler to comply.

“For example, it proposes a penalty grace period for people new to the scheme.  During the 60-day grace period, penalties would not be charged and Inland Revenue would work with people to help them get on track.

“Overly punitive penalties can cause liable parents to disengage with the scheme, which defeats the purpose of having rules in the first place. The proposed changes balance the need to incentivise timely payment, with the desire to support liable parents who are trying to stay on track with their payments.

“The proposed grace period targets newly liable parents who may not yet fully understand their obligation. It would allow Inland Revenue to contact them to explain the consequences of failing to comply.

“The Bill also proposes that a person’s investment income be automatically taken into account to get a better picture of their ability to support their children.

“The Bill also contains a number of technical amendments to assist the administration of the scheme, including proposals to make the scheme work better with people with unique circumstances.

“We can offer a better, more efficient service. And we can offer a service that delivers better outcomes for children. That’s what this Bill is all about,” says Mr Nash.

Fairer tax measures pass into law
=================================

**28 June 2019**

Reforms to tax rules designed to ensure greater fairness in child support, retail trade, and residential investment have now passed into law.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 has this afternoon received the Royal Assent.

“One of the biggest changes will require offshore businesses that supply low-value goods to New Zealand to collect GST,” Mr Nash says.

“From 1 December offshore businesses who supply more than $60,000 of services and low-value goods per year will pass on GST directly to Inland Revenue.

“GST has always been payable on purchases from overseas but administration and collection costs have been prohibitive for Customs. The GST on goods valued above $1000 will continue to be collected by Customs at the border.  
  
“The legislation ensures offshore suppliers are on a level playing field with domestic retailers. There are 26,000 small businesses in the retail sector employing more than 62,000 people. They are required to collect GST on their sales. The same requirement now applies to offshore retail giants.

“It is estimated the tightening of the GST system will collect approximately $126 million in revenue per year by 2022/23.

“The second major change means residential property investors no longer get a tax break by using losses from rental properties to offset tax on other sources of income, such as salary and wages. Those losses will now be ring-fenced to the property portfolio.

“Before now, investors with loss-making rental properties could subsidise part of the cost of their mortgages with reduced tax on other income. This helped them to outbid other home buyers for properties. Yet they often make tax-free capital gains when these properties are sold.

“The new law also provides greater oversight of land transfers to ensure those buying and selling properties are complying with tax rules on property speculation. It will require most people who buy and sell properties to supply their IRD number on transfer documentation.

“Other changes right a wrong which meant some people who became a parent as a result of sexual assault were forced to pay child support if the baby was cared for by others. People required to make such payments in the past may now qualify to be exempted from those payments, backdated to September 2006. This could mean they are eligible for a refund of any payments made.

“The exemptions and possible refunds are decided by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on a case by case basis.

“As well as these significant initiatives, the new law will enshrine the right of taxpayers to keep their tax records in te reo Maori.

“Inland Revenue has allowed taxpayers to keep records in te reo Māori for more than 20 years but this has never been enshrined as standard practice through legislation. The right to use te reo Māori should be officially recognised in the law rather than at the discretion of a Government department.

“Our revenue system enables vital public services to be funded, but it also needs to be fair in the way it is administered. These changes achieve that,” Mr Nash says.

Family assistance provisions
============================

2006 remedial amendments to the family assistance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004.

##### Sections 103 to 111

Several remedial amendments have been made to the family assistance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. Some were required to fine-tune the provisions to ensure that they give full effect to the policy intent of the Working for Families package, while others correct minor drafting errors.

### In-work payment and weekly compensation

The changes are intended to remove any doubt that concurrent entitlement to the in-work payment and weekly compensation under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 is limited to incapacity suffered on or after 1 January 2006.

### Key features

The reference in section KD 2AAA(1)(d) to subsection (7) has been replaced by a reference to subsection (8). The change clarifies that when subsection (8), relating to eligibility for the in-work payment when weekly compensation payments are received as a result of incapacity arising on or after 1 January 2006, applies, the requirements for income from an activity and full-time earner do not apply.

To further remove doubt, paragraph (xvi) of the definition of "salary or wages" has been omitted from the list in section KD 2AAA(5)(a)(i) of source deductions that are not eligible income from an activity. Paragraph (xvi) of the definition of "salary or wages" relates to payments of weekly compensation made under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001. Instead, new subparagraph KD 2AAA(5)(a)(iii) was inserted to clarify that only weekly compensation payments under the 2001 Act in respect of incapacity before 1 January 2006 are not eligible income from an activity.

### Application date

The amendments apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment.

* * *

### In-work payments and Paid parental leave

The change clarifies that recipients of parental leave payments are not precluded from entitlement to the inwork payment if they met the necessary full-time work test before receiving paid parental leave.

### Key features

Paragraph (x) of the definition of "salary or wages" has been omitted from the list in section KD 2AAA(5)(a)(i) of source deductions that are not eligible income from an activity. Paragraph (x) of the definition of "salary or wages" related to parental leave payments made under Part 7A of the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987.

The inclusion of parental leave payments in the list created an inconsistency between the requirement to have income from an activity and the requirement to normally be a full-time earner, both of which must be met, with the result that recipients of paid parental leave would have been precluded from entitlement.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment.

* * *

### Family assistance for shared care arrangments

The changes provide flexibility by allowing entitlement to the relevant elements of family assistance when a shared care arrangement is intended to continue for at least four months (one-third of a year), and the proportion of care is such that each parent has exclusive care for at least one-third of the shared care period. This could mean, in some instances, that parts of a shared care period fall in two tax years, something that was previously prevented if the shared care arrangement began within four months of the end of a tax year.

### Key features

The rule in section KD 2AA(2) that defines who is a principal caregiver has been replaced with a more flexible rule that maintains the idea of one-third of a year as being an indication of some permanence to the shared care arrangement. The new rule allows any four-month period to apply so that the period does not have to fall entirely within a tax year.

**Example**  
  
A shared care arrangement that began on 1 February 2007 and was expected to continue at least until June 2007 would meet the new test. Previously, as there were less than four months to the end of the tax year, the sharing of the family assistance entitlement could not have begun until the first day of the following tax year, 1 April 2007.

The provision relating to the parental tax credit is unchanged - the requirement is one-third of the entitlement period.

The rule in section KD 2AA(2B) that defines who is a principal caregiver for the purposes of the in-work payment was slightly different in that the period of care does not have to coincide with the period of eligibility for the in-work payment. That rule has also been replaced to allow the greater flexibility in application.

### Application date

The amendments apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment.

* * *

### In-work payment for continuous eligible periods

### 

The concept of an "eligible period" is a critical component of the family assistance system. Under the changes, when there are eligible periods of part-weeks that together form one continuous period, families will not lose entitlement to the in-work payment in any weeks in which the eligibility criteria are otherwise met.

### Key features

The in-work payment is available only when the employment criteria are met for a full week. If an eligible period was less than a week, the law previously would not allow in-work payment to be made for that week even if the eligible period was consecutive with another eligible period. This was contrary to the policy intent.

The replacement definition of "weeks" in section KD 2AAA(2) allows the recognition of contiguous eligible periods as if they were one so that entitlement to the inwork payment is available for all full weeks in which the relevant employment criteria are met. It also maintains the correct treatment when only one unbroken eligible period is involved.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment.

* * *

### Ring-fencng of family support

The change ensures that the ring-fencing provisions reflect the policy intent that maximum family support entitlement would be guaranteed for periods spent on a benefit if a family's annualised monthly income (calculated on a month-by-month basis while on a benefit) is below the abatement threshold.

### Key features

Ring-fencing in the family assistance provisions is intended to protect families who move from benefit to work, or vice versa, during the year. Without ringfencing, they would incur an end-of-year overpayment of family support if their full-year income was at a higher level than their on-benefit income.

However, ring-fenced periods did not previously create new "eligible periods". This meant that when the abatement formula was applied to an eligible period that contained a ring-fenced period, it was possible for the income to eliminate entitlement, even for the periods that had been ring-fenced, and the benefits of ring-fencing were lost. The additional paragraph inserted in the definition of "eligible period" in section OB 1 provides for a ringfenced period also to be an eligible period so that it can be excluded from the abatement formula.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the tax year beginning 1 April 2005, the commencement date for the ring-fencing provisions.

* * *

### Minor technical and drafting amendments

A number of amendments correct errors of a minor technical or drafting nature. Some of these are the result of inadvertent wording and printing changes in the drafting of the Taxation (Working for Families) Act. Other amendments clarify the effect of links to definitions that also apply elsewhere in the Income Tax Act 004.

#### Formula for calculating "net specified income"

The formula in section KD 1(1)(g)(ii) for calculating "net specified income" when the person is a major shareholder in a close company (generally, a company with five or fewer shareholders) has been amended to replace the item "(c - d)" with "c". The change was needed to reflect the current tax position of a close company. Changes to close company and imputation rules created a need to amend the formula, but the need was overlooked when the relevant imputation credit provisions were introduced.

#### Formula for calculating family assistance tax credits

The definition of item "IWP or CTC" in the formula for calculating the subpart KD credits (family assistance) in section KD 2(2) has been amended to make it clear that a person may get the in-work payment (IWP) or the child tax credit (CTC) but not both concurrently.

#### Application of definitions

Section KD 3(1) has been amended to clarify that the definitions of "qualifying person" and "employment" specific to the purposes of the family tax credit apply to both the calculation of the family tax credit and the rules for the family tax credit.

#### Drafting oversight

Section KD 5(6A) (b)(ii) was amended by the Taxation (Working for Families) Act 2004 by replacing the former reference to section KD 5B with the words "sections KD 2 and KD 3", section KD 5B having been repealed in that Act. However, the need for in-work payment in the list of rates to be included in the calculation of interim instalments in the section was overlooked. That oversight has been rectified.

#### Adjustment of amounts

The method by which the Governor-General, by Order in Council, is to adjust the threshold of the family tax credit is prescribed in section KD 5C.

Section KD 5C has been amended to correct an inadvertent wording change that would have required the Order in Council to change the whole of the family tax credit, rather than just the item amount in the formula, as was intended. This would have had the effect of prescribing a fixed amount of family tax credit, rather than an amount that has regard to after-tax income of an eligible family.

#### Payment of arrears by the Commissioner

Under the general rules for payment by instalment, instalment payments can be made only for a period going forward from the date of application.

However, the Commissioner is able to pay the arrears of tax credits for the period since a benefit ceased when a person goes off a benefit but delays application for family assistance to be paid by the Commissioner.

The opportunity was taken to remove duplication in the relevant provisions by amending section KD 7(3A) to make it clear in what circumstances the provision can be used, and by repealing section KD 7(3C).

### Application date

The minor amendments apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006.

Family Dispute Resolution Act Mediated Agreement Not Privileged/Confidential
============================================================================

The Appellant appealed the High Court judgment which found that an agreement produced through mediation under the FDRA was not privileged and/or confidential

Case

McKay v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZCA 138

Legislative References

Child Support Act 1991 ss 4, 7, 15 and 90; Family Disputes Resolution Act 2013 ss 12 and 14

### Summary

The Appellant appealed the High Court judgment which found that an agreement produced through mediation (“the Mediated Agreement”) under the Family Disputes Resolution Act 2013 (“the FDRA”) was not privileged and/or confidential, and was therefore available for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) to use when making an assessment under the Child Support Act (“the CSA”). The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the Mediated Agreement was not privileged or confidential, allowing the Commissioner to rely on that document as proof of parentage when making a CSA assessment.

### Impact

This case confirms the Commissioner’s position that Family Dispute Resolution (“FDR”) mediation agreements are not privileged or confidential so as to preclude her from using them to make child support assessments under the CSA.

### Facts

In 2014 the Appellant had a brief liaison with a woman, A. In 2015, A gave birth to a son, B. A DNA report (“the DNA Report”) commissioned by the Appellant very strongly supported the Appellant being B’s biological father. On 23 July 2015, the Appellant and A entered into the FDR process under the FDRA which culminated in the Mediated Agreement. The Mediated Agreement included an acknowledgement by the Appellant that he was B’s father. On 3 August 2015, the FDR provider gave A and the Appellant a form recording the outcome of the FDR (“the FDR Form”), under ss 12(7) and (8) of the FDRA. The FDR Form did not attach the Mediated Agreement, but included a reference to the matters agreed upon within it.

On 25 August 2015, the Commissioner received a child support application from A naming the Appellant as the father of B and attaching the DNA Report and the Mediated Agreement. The Commissioner assessed the Appellant for child support on the basis the Mediated Agreement included a written statement by the Appellant acknowledging that he was the father of B, under s 7(1)(e) of the CSA.

The Appellant filed a notice of objection to the Commissioner’s assessment under s 90(1) of the CSA stating, inter alia, that the Mediated Agreement was privileged under s 14(2) of the FDRA and that he had not agreed to its disclosure.

### Decision

_The High Court Decision_

The High Court held that the Mediated Agreement was neither privileged nor confidential and that the Commissioner was entitled to take it into account in her child support assessment.

_Discussion_

The Court of Appeal found the High Court was correct in concluding that s 14 does not confer privilege on the Mediated Agreement. It agreed with the High Court’s observation that the underlying purpose of the privilege conferred by s 14(2) was to encourage parties engaged in settlement negotiations to speak freely, and to facilitate out of court resolution.

In addition, the CSA contemplated the use of mediated agreements by the Commissioner in making determinations on the liability of parents to pay child support under the CSA \[s 15(1) and (3)\]. Therefore such agreements were not “statements” for the purposes of the application of s 14, with the result that the Mediated Agreement was not privileged.

The Appellant also argued that s 14(2) of the FDRA applied because the Commissioner was a “person acting judicially” when making child support assessments. However, the Court of Appeal found the only inquiry required of the Commissioner under the FDRA is to be satisfied that the statutory definition of ‘parent’ applies to the Appellant. Such an inquiry was purely administrative.

The Court did not accept the Appellant’s further submission that the terms of the Mediated Agreement were confidential. The Mediated Agreement did not contain any agreement between the parties to that effect and there was nothing in the statutory scheme to justify inferring it. The fact that the contents of the Mediated Agreement may be included in the FDR form prepared by the FDR provider and subsequently given to the Family Court under s 13 of the FDRA provides clear indication that the document is not confidential to the parties. The Court reached that conclusion even though there may have been a misunderstanding of the legal position about confidentiality on the part of the Appellant.

The Court further stated that the Commissioner is under a statutory duty to exercise her functions under the CSA so as to achieve the legislative objects. Once the Commissioner was satisfied that the Appellant was B’s parent within the statutory definition the Commissioner was under a duty to exercise the functions of assessment contemplated by the CSA.

_Costs_

The Court of Appeal did not order costs on the appeal. While not a test case, there was an element of public interest in the outcome of that case. In addition, the Court acknowledged the Appellant had been misled into believing that the Mediated Agreement was privileged and confidential and that he would not have signed it if he had known that it would be used by A to make him liable to pay child support without any court proceeding being undertaken. The Court also found the Appellant had not unduly enlarged the work of the Commissioner in the proceeding.

[Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-livestock-valuation-assets-expenditure-and-remedial-matters-act-2013 "Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013")

Family scheme income from employment benefits
=============================================

2013 amendment will see certain types of non-cash benefits taken into account for Working for Families Tax Credits and more. Applies from 1 Apr 2014.

_Sections MB 7B and MB 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

### Background

"Family scheme income" is used to calculate entitlements and obligations for a number of different forms of social assistance. A key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity. In the context of social assistance, this means that entitlements to, for example, Working for Families Tax Credits should apply equally to people on the same effective income. Inequity arises when a non-cash benefit is provided as a substitute for salary or wages, if it is not included in family scheme income in the way that salary or wages would be.

This amendment will see certain types of non-cash benefits taken into account for Working for Families Tax Credits, the student allowances parental income threshold, and community services card entitlements.

### Key features

New section MB 7B requires employees who receive certain non-cash benefits to include them in their family scheme income calculations as follows:

*   The availability of an employer-provided motor vehicle for an employee's private use is included if it is part of an explicit salary trade-off - that is, if the employee would be entitled to a greater amount of employment income if they chose not to receive the non-cash benefit.
*   An employee who receives short-term charge facilities will also be required to include these if the value of benefits received in a year is more than the specified threshold in section CX 25(3). This applies to any employee, not just those employees who work for charitable organisations.

Section MB 7(2) sets out the amounts which must be included in a person's family scheme income, if they receive one of the benefits referred to above.

*   For a motor vehicle which is made available for the person's private use, the amount to be included is the amount by which their employment income would be increased in the absence of that benefit.
*   For short-term charge facilities to be included their aggregate value for a person in the relevant income year must be above a threshold. That threshold is the lesser of 5% of the employee's salary or wages, or $1,200. The amount to be included is the aggregate value of all short-term charge facility fringe benefits, including fringe benefit tax.

As a consequence, the title of section MB 8 has been amended to avoid confusion with new section MB 7B.

### Detailed analysis

It is important to note that section MB 7B applies to all employees, not merely employees of charitable organisations.

When explaining the concept of an explicit salary trade-off, section MB 7B(1)(b) uses the phrase "the person would be entitled to a greater amount of employment income should the person choose, or have chosen, not to receive the benefit".

The inclusion of the clause "or have chosen" is not intended to signify that a fringe benefit will arise where a person was offered such a choice and chose the greater amount of employment income. Instead, it is intended to refer to situations where the person has previously been offered a choice between the benefit and a greater amount of employment income, has chosen the benefit, and would not receive a greater amount of employment income if they now chose to not receive the benefit.

The short-term charge facilities may be provided by multiple employers. Therefore an employee who receives short-term charge facility fringe benefits from more than one employer during the tax year will need to aggregate their benefits to determine whether the aggregate value of those benefits is greater than the threshold.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 April 2014.
FAMILYBOOST – QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THE BASICS What is FamilyBoost? FamilyBoost is a new childcare payment that will be made to eligible households, to help with the rising costs of early childhood education (ECE). How much is FamilyBoost? Households can be reimbursed up to 25 percent of their ECE fees incurred after the 20 Hours Free and MSD Childcare Subsidy have been taken into account. This is up to a maximum amount of $75 per week. Payments to families will be made three-monthly. So, for the $75 per week payment cap, the three-monthly equivalent amount of $975 would be paid. Am I eligible for FamilyBoost? If your household earns up to $180,000 and you have costs from a licensed ECE provider, you will be eligible to receive FamilyBoost up to a maximum of $975 every three months (this is the equivalent of $75 per week, paid in a three-monthly lump sum). The payment slowly reduces for household incomes over $140,000 to a maximum of $180,000, as shown in the table below. Household income Maximum weekly rebate Amount refunded, paid three-monthly Up to $140,000 $75 $975 $150,000 $56.25 $731.25 $160,000 $37.50 $487.50 $170,000 $18.75 $243.75 When will I be able to get FamilyBoost? If you’re eligible and apply, your first FamilyBoost payment will be paid in October 2024. This covers the three-month period from 1 July – 30 September. HOW IT WILL WORK What do I need to do? Make sure you are registered for a personal myIR account to apply for FamilyBoost. More information on how to register for myIR can be found on the Inland Revenue website: www.ird.govt.nz/myir Start saving your ECE invoices from 1 July in either a PDF or JPEG format. Make sure that the name on your ECE invoice matches your details in your myIR account, and that all your other details are up to date in myIR. If you have a physical copy of your ECE invoice, you can take a digital photo of your invoice. From September, you will be able to register through Inland Revenue’s online account, myIR. When you have all your invoices collected for the 1 July to 30 September quarter, The Questions and Answers below were correct as of 25 March 2024. Subsequent decisions were made, legislation was enacted and FamilyBoost came into effect on 1 July 2024. To read the most up to date information about FamilyBoost, please visit www.ird.govt.nz/FamilyBoost upload them into myIR and Inland Revenue will calculate your payment to be paid into your bank account in October. What’s the timeline for applying? 1 July 2024: ECE fees which families have paid from 1 July onwards are eligible for FamilyBoost, so you will need to save all your ECE invoices for the period starting 1 July 2024. September 2024: Registrations open in myIR for FamilyBoost. You can choose to register from this date or later. 1 October 2024: Applications for FamilyBoost open. You can register and apply at the same time. How often will I need to apply for FamilyBoost? You will need to apply via Inland Revenue’s online account, myIR. From 1 October you’ll be able to claim your previous three-month ECE invoices (for the period 1 July – 30 September) by uploading them in myIR. You can only claim once in a three-month period. You should continue collecting invoices for your next FamilyBoost claim on 1 January, which will cover invoices for the period 1 October 2024 – 31 December 2024. You can save up your invoices to claim less often i.e. six monthly or annually. I share the care of my child/ECE costs with my child’s other parent. Can we both get FamilyBoost? FamilyBoost can be claimed by both separated parents of a child in shared care, provided each parent meets at least a portion of the ECE costs and have separate invoices. Separated parents will not be able to claim more than the $75 per week household cap, but each parent will be treated as having a separate household. I pay my grandchild’s ECE costs. Am I eligible for FamilyBoost? Yes, as long as the child for whom you pay ECE costs is in your household. The ECE invoice must also be in your name. If your grandchild is not in your household, you will not be able to claim FamilyBoost, even if the ECE invoice is in your name. Will I be able to claim FamilyBoost for all of my children? FamilyBoost is made available on a per household (rather than per child) basis, so you will only be able to make one FamilyBoost application for each three-month period. You will be able to claim FamilyBoost for your ECE costs, and be reimbursed up to $75 per week regardless of which child the ECE costs are for. If your children attend different ECE providers you will still be able to claim FamilyBoost, you will just need to provide your invoices from both providers. I am self-employed and don’t file my income with Inland Revenue until the end of the tax year. How will my income be calculated for FamilyBoost? Your income will be calculated based on the most recent tax return you have filed with Inland Revenue and adjusted to reflect a three-month period. For example, if your most recent return declared earnings of $120,000 for the tax year, the income used to determine your FamilyBoost refund would be $30,000. I am on a benefit. Will I still be able to get FamilyBoost? Yes. As long as you have ECE costs for a child in your household you will be able to receive FamilyBoost. What if I don’t have access to the internet? Inland Revenue can only accept online FamilyBoost applications. However, you can access the internet through using public libraries, Inland Revenue service kiosks, or family and whānau members. Customers will be able to use their mobile phones and public Wi-Fi to apply. I need help accessing myIR and/or applying for FamilyBoost. What help is available? More information about applying for FamilyBoost will be available on the Inland Revenue website after the Budget Day announcement on 30 May. Or for information on how to register or access myIR head to www.ird.govt.nz/myir Inland Revenue also offers support through their call centre, Front of House sites and through their Community Compliance Officers and Kaitakawaenga Māori. You can find out more about support available on the Inland Revenue website: www.ird.govt.nz/contactus My ECE provider does not charge me any fees. Am I still able to claim for FamilyBoost? No. FamilyBoost is calculated as a proportion of your ECE costs. If you do not have ECE costs, then you will not be able to claim FamilyBoost. Am I eligible for FamilyBoost even if I receive MSD’s Childcare Subsidy? If you receive the Childcare Subsidy and have additional costs that you pay on top of the subsidy you will be able to claim FamilyBoost for those additional costs. You will not be able to claim FamilyBoost for the costs covered by the Childcare Subsidy. What income information will be used for FamilyBoost? Inland Revenue doesn’t have full income data for families until a tax year has ended. To get support to families more quickly, FamilyBoost will be based on the most recent income information Inland Revenue holds, whether that is the past income year or current income year. Using the most recent income information also helps prevent families being over or underpaid, as we’re not asking people to predict what they think they’ll earn. Payments are full and final, meaning there are no tax bills or ‘square ups’ at the end of the tax year. I have more questions about FamilyBoost. Where can I get more information? Further information about how to access FamilyBoost will be released on Budget Day, May 30. INFORMATION FOR ECE PROVIDERS What do I need to do to make sure families attending my centre will be able to access FamilyBoost? As long as the invoices you provide contain all the information required to apply for FamilyBoost then there will be no need for you to do anything further. The information required to be included on the invoice will be finalised through our consultation with ECE providers. What support will Inland Revenue provide ECE centres? Inland Revenue will talk to providers during the consultation process to understand how we can support them. Inland Revenue will also provide ECE centres with content and guidance on FamilyBoost that centres can pass on to parents. EXAMPLE FAMILIES A couple both earning salary/wages Parents Laura and Annalie, have two children in ECE for 30 hours each week, Leo (2) and Holly (4). They have a combined family income of $150,000 and spend $350 per week on ECE fees. This means their three-monthly income is $37,500 and three-monthly fees cost is $4,550. The ECE invoices are in Laura’s name. In October, Laura logs into myIR and registers for FamilyBoost, providing information on who her partner is and what children are in her household. She then uploads her ECE invoices for July-September and submits her application for this three-month period, confirming the details she provided in her registration. Because of their level of income, they will receive $731.25 as a refund. Laura continues to collect her invoices between 1 October 2024 – 31 December 2024 so that she is ready to claim FamilyBoost again on 1 January 2025. A family where one partner is a salary/wage earner, and the other is self-employed Dharmendra works full time for wages, earning $1,700 per week ($88,400 a year). His partner, Neisha, is self-employed, working roughly 30 hours per week for her carpentry business. Neisha’s last income tax return was filed on 7 July 2024, for the period 1 April 2023 – 31 March 2024. For that period, she earned $50,000. They have two children, Samira (4) and Niam (2). The combined weekly daycare cost for both children is $531 per week at a daycare in Christchurch. Due to their level of income, they are not eligible for a childcare subsidy from Work and Income. Dharmendra receives wages, so Inland Revenue uses his gross wages paid between 1 July to 30 September 2024 of $22,100. Neisha’s income for this quarter will be calculated as $12,500 ($50,000 / 4). Their combined income for the quarter is $34,600. The ECE invoices are in Dharmendra’s name. In September, Dharmendra registers for FamilyBoost via myIR. In October, Dharmendra logs onto the account and submits the first claim, confirming their family’s details and including the invoices he’s been saving since July which show they’ve spent $6,903 on daycare in the last three months. The family’s earnings for the quarter are under the three-monthly threshold of $35,000, so the family receives $975 into their bank account. Single parent with one child Jacqui earns $85,000 per year and has one child aged 3 in ECE for 40 hours per week. Her child is eligible for the 20 Hours free, she pays for the remaining 20 hours. This is another $250 per week. Jacqui will receive back 25 percent of the fees she pays. So she will be reimbursed $812.50 as her three-monthly FamilyBoost refund. A couple living together, one working casual hours Moana and William have a child, Tim. Moana and William are in a relationship and live together. William works as a tile layer and earns $110,000 annually. Moana works casually at her local supermarket and earned $5,000 in the last three-month period. Tim attends the local ECE provider on days when both Moana and William are working. In the last three- month period Moana and William have incurred $2,000 of ECE costs and have earned $32,500. The ECE invoices are in Moana’s name. She has collected the last three months of ECE invoices and applies for FamilyBoost. As Moana and William’s income for the three- month period is below $35,000 no abatement occurs and Moana is paid out 25% of their ECE fees, a $500 refund. Two parents who are separated and have week-about care Mike and Piper are separated and share care of their three children 50/50. Two children (3 and 4) are in ECE for 30 hours a week and each parent pays half the fees. The fees are $290 per week, and each parent is separately invoiced $145 per week by the centre. Piper earns $90,000 and Mike earns $170,000. Piper and Mike have separate households and can both apply for FamilyBoost. Mike incurs $1,885 in ECE costs over the three-monthly period. When he submits his receipts via myIR, he is refunded $243.75. Due to Mike’s high income of $170,000, the maximum amount he receives from FamilyBoost is abated. Piper also incurs $1,885 in ECE costs over the three-monthly period. When she submits her receipts, she is refunded $471.25. Her refund is not abated as she earns under the three- monthly income threshold.

On 12 June 2014, the New Zealand Government signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the U.S Government to assist New Zealand financial institutions (NZFIs) to comply with FATCA. On 30 June 2014, the legislation enabling NZFIs to meet their FATCA obligations became law. Financial institutions and (where permitted) third-party service providers began collecting and/or reporting FATCA information from 1 July 2014. Inland Revenue acts as an intermediary between NZFI’s and IRS, and provide services to collect and securely store FATCA-related information from NZFI’s, sponsoring entities and third party service providers and then transmit this information in a timely manner to the IRS. Annual FATCA reporting is between 1 April and 30 June for NZFI's submitting information to Inland Revenue, for the previous reporting period ending 31 March. 30 September is the final date for Inland Revenue to exchange FATCA information with the United States. 2.2 Purpose The purpose of this user guide is to provide information and guidance to NZ reporting entities. You will learn how to: • Register for FATCA • Prepare and submit you FATCA disclosures • Get and grant access to third party service provider/intermediaries • View history of your disclosures; and • Cancel FATCA registration 2.3 Inland Revenue’s Support Role If you require assistance you can phone Inland Revenue on 0800 377 774, between 8.00am – 4.30pm Monday to Friday. From a mobile or overseas, the phone number is +64 4 978 0779. Alternatively you can email us at fatca@ird.govt.nz 2.4 Due Diligence We expect all FATCA-reporting entities to read and understand the FATCA Due Diligence requirements available on our website www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: FATCA), before proceeding with the rest of the document. 2.4.1 Nil returns Nil reports are not required to be received by Inland Revenue; however a Nil Report can be filed in myIR. We expect NZFI’s to fulfil their due diligence obligations and retain these records for the statutory seven year period so that you can demonstrate your compliance, if required.

Note: Third party intermediaries or service providers are unable to register on behalf of NZFI's. This process only provides access for reporting purposes. However, tax agents are able to register and report on behalf of a client that they are linked to. To grant access to a third party intermediary using the token method, this can be done through Manage intermediaries under your FATCA account in myIR. Figure 5. Here you will be able to determine the account permissions (file, full account access, make payments or view) that the third party will have and send them a token. Before granting access, you will need: • An active myIR account • The email address of the person (from the third party intermediary) you’re granting access to; and • Your financial institution’s IRD number To grant access to the third party intermediary: 1. Go to Manage intermediaries. Read ‘What to expect’ and click Next. 2. Click Add a record. 3.

This will send an email with a token to the third party intermediary to redeem in their myIR. Once they have access, you will be able update or cancel their access under your logon settings. Figure 8. Access requests received via myIR If a third party has requested third party intermediary access to your FATCA account through their myIR, you will receive an email with a link inside it to approve or decline the request. Figure 9. 12FATCA - Registration and reporting user guide Clicking the link will redirect you to myIR, so you can see the details of their request e.g. type of permission requested. If you weren’t expecting this request you should decline it. Otherwise, select Ye s and click Submit to approve third party access. Note: If you receive a request for multiple accounts, you will not be able to decline one and accept others. Instead you need to decline or accept all. Figure 10. 4.2 Gain third party Access If you are a third party intermediary completing FATCA reporting obligations on behalf of a client, you need to approach the client to get a ‘token’ (one token for each client). Alternatively you can make a request access to your client’s FATCA account, online via your myIR account. IMPORTANT: Tokens will expire after 24 hours.

Notice pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA (the Agreement) New Zealand has, pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement, received notification from the United States Government that it has granted more favourable terms to a Partner Jurisdiction. Article 7 provides that more favourable terms apply automatically to the Agreement unless a decision is made to decline them. New Zealand has not declined the application of the terms. The following paragraphs are therefore to be treated as being included in Section VI of Annex I of the Agreement beginning on 3 July 2014. With reference to paragraph G, no written notice was provided to the United States before 3 July 2014. G. Alternative Procedures for New Accounts Opened Prior to Entry Into Force of this Agreement. 1. Applicability.

The alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section shall be available only for those New Individual Accounts or New Entity Accounts, as applicable, opened prior to the earlier of: (i) the date New Zealand has the ability to compel Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to comply with the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, which date New Zealand shall inform the United States of in writing by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, or (ii) the date of entry into force of this Agreement. If the alternative procedures for New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, described in paragraph H of this section are applied with respect to all New Entity Accounts or a clearly identified group of such accounts, the alternative procedures described in this paragraph G may not be applied with respect to such New Entity Accounts.

The information required to be reported with respect to such a New Account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the New Account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. c) By the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must close any New Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section for which it was unable to collect the required self- certification or other documentation pursuant to the procedures described in subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section. In addition, by the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Individual Accounts (without regard to whether such accounts were High Value Accounts), perform the due diligence procedures specified in paragraph D of section II of this Annex I, or (ii) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Entity Accounts, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section IV of this Annex I. d) New Zealand must report on any closed account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(c) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported for such a closed account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. H. Alternative Procedures for New Entity Accounts Opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015. For New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to treat such accounts as Preexisting Entity Accounts and apply the due diligence procedures related to Preexisting Entity Accounts specified in section IV of this Annex I in lieu of the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I. In this case, the due diligence procedures of section IV of this Annex I must be applied without regard to the account balance or value threshold specified in paragraph A of section IV of this Annex I. 2

FBT-value of brokerage provided by sharebrokers to employees
============================================================

QB considers the value for FBT purposes of brokerage services provided by sharebrokers to their employees. It applies from Mar 2006.

**Income Tax Act 2004-section ND 1K(1)(a)-FBT-value of services**

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2004.

We have been asked to consider what is the value for FBT purposes of brokerage services provided by sharebrokers to their employees.  In an item in _Public Information Bulletin_ No 161 ("PIB 161"), the Commissioner accepted that, for FBT purposes, the value of brokerage services provided to employees would be the lowest value of brokerage that would be charged to preferred clients of a sharebroker.  The correctness of this item has now been questioned. 

**Valuation rule**

Section ND 1K(1)(a) applies to value brokerage provided to employees by a sharebroker (being services of a type normally provided by sharebrokers as part of their business).  Under section ND 1K(1)(a) the value of brokerage is the price charged by the employer for the "same or similar" services to the public in the open market in New Zealand on ordinary trade or professional terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other.

**Meaning of "the public"**

The expression "the public" means the community as a whole or a member of the community:  _Evans v Lee_ \[1964\] SASR 219; _Jennings_ _v Stephens_ \[1936\] Ch 469.  In this context the expression "the public" includes any member of the community who may seek the sharebroking services of a sharebroker. 

**Are brokerage services provided to employees similar to services provided to the public?**

"Similar" does not mean "exactly the same": see _Mays v Roberts_ \[1928\] SASR 217; _Greenleaf v Goodrick_ 101 US 278; _NZ Central Region etc Local Government Officers' Union v_ _Lower Hutt City Council_ (1992) 1 ERNZ 558.  Whether the services provided to employees of sharebrokers are similar to the service provided to members of the general public depends on what the essential features of the service provided to the general public are and whether the services provided to employees have those characteristics. 

In order to buy or sell listed securities investors must place orders through a sharebroker.  Sharebrokers may provide additional advisory services to some clients for an increased fee but the essential features of the basic brokerage service provided by sharebrokers are:

*   The placement of orders for the sale or purchase of listed securities; and
*   The settlement of transactions for the sale and purchase of securities on behalf of their clients through the NZX's electronic trading system or the electronic trading system of another stock exchange.  These services may be accessed either electronically or by telephone. 

Under the NZX Participation Rules, employees of sharebrokers are subject to a number of restrictions such as minimum holding periods for shares, preference being given to client orders, the inability to participate in Initial Public Offers, priority being given to orders given by members of the public and the inability to trade through sharebrokers other than their employers.  However, the Commissioner considers that the restrictions do not alter the essential nature of the brokerage services provided.  These restrictions affect the timing, number and nature of the security transactions that employees may undertake and may limit access to the brokerage services.  It is acknowledged that potentially the restrictions may affect the price at which securities may be bought or sold as employees, but the provision of the service would still result in the employee either obtaining securities or selling securities.  The fact that employees of sharebrokers are not able to trade through a sharebroker other than their employer also does not affect the nature of the service provided.  The brokerage services provided to employees (the purchase and sale of securities on behalf of the employees) are similar to the brokerage services normally provided by sharebrokers to the public**.**  In each case the service provided is the sale or purchase of securities in accordance with instructions given to the sharebroker. 

**What is the value of brokerage provided to employees?**

The value of brokerage for FBT purposes is the rate that would be charged by the employer to a member of the general public.  Generally brokerage rates are calculated on a graduating scale based on the size of each trade (that is, the brokerage is a percentage of the order amount) subject to a minimum charge.  Sharebrokers may also apply a "trader rate" to customers who have traded in excess of a specified amount of brokerage.  A lower rate may also be charged for on-line brokerage services.

The value of brokerage provided by sharebrokers to their employees is to be determined on a transaction by transaction basis according to the scale of charges applied by the particular sharebroker.  If a lower rate of brokerage would have been available to an employee even if the employee was not employed by the sharebroker, for example, because of the volume of transactions undertaken by the employee, the lower rate would be the value of the brokerage provided to the employee for FBT purposes.   

In the light of the above, in the Commissioner's view, the item in PIB 161 does not correctly reflect the law.  Accordingly, the item is withdrawn from 31 March 2006 and from that date should not be considered to be an expression of the Commissioner's view of the law.  This statement now represents the Commissioner's view on the value of brokerage services provided by sharebrokers to their employees.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

Determination FDR 2008/01 discusses the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in a non-resident issuer to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

As the non-resident issuer invests solely in financial arrangements denominated in New Zealand dollars, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Act applies and New Zealand resident investors are prevented from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the non-resident issuer having assets which 80% or more by value consist of financial arrangements denominated in New Zealand dollars, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to use the fair dividend rate method. The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is a unit trust that is established and tax resident in Australia;
2.  is managed by Liontamer Investment Management Pty Limited (Liontamer), a company incorporated and tax resident in Australia, or an entity which is associated with Liontamer;
3.  issues New Zealand dollar denominated units (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) to New Zealand resident investors;
4.  invests proceeds from the issue of units in assets which are financial arrangements, in relation to which the return on maturity is calculated by reference to either:
    1.  The movement in the value of an underlying basket of:
        *   shares in companies listed on a recognised exchange,
        *   commodities,
        *   real property,
        *   non-NZD denominated fixed interest securities traded on a recognised market.
    2.  The movement in an index or selected indices relating to the value of items listed in (i) above.
    3.  The movement in the value of an underlying actively managed fund or basket of funds investing in items listed in (i) above;
    4.  The movement in currencies traded in a recognised market;
    5.  Any combination of (i) to (iv).
5.  if it invests in financial arrangements in relation to which the return is determined by reference in any way to underlying non-New Zealand dollar denominated fixed interest securities, does not invest in any currency arrangements which provide an overall economic return as if the securities were denominated in New Zealand dollars;
6.  does not derive a fixed return in excess of 1.00% per annum from its investment in financial arrangements;
7.  may make distributions to the unit holders on a regular basis, but does not guarantee that any income will be derived or that a distribution will be made;
8.  may pay to an investor an amount exceeding the issue price of the unit on redemption, but at the time the unit is first issued does not guarantee the redemption price of a unit will exceed its issue price.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"Associated" mean associated persons under sections OD 7 and OD 8 of the Act;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LF 2(3) of the Act;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"Recognised exchange" means a recognised exchange under section OB 1 of the Act;

"Recognised market" means recognised exchange under section OB 1 of the Act, reading paragraphs (c) and (d) of the definition of recognised exchange to include currencies or financial arrangements;

"Slice rule" means the slice rule under section CD 15(3) of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years.

Fair dividend rate method not to be used for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
========================================================================================================

FDR 2008/02 discusses the fair dividend rate method not to be used for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund.

### Determination

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in a non-resident issuer to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

New Zealand resident investors who satisfy the requirements of section EX 40(7) of the Act will qualify to use the fair dividend rate (FDR) method to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer, and are not prevented from using the FDR method pursuant to section EX 40(8) and EX 40(9) of the Act in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

However, I consider that it is not appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to use the fair dividend rate method. Due to the nature of the overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant), application of the FDR method would impose unnecessarily high compliance costs on New Zealand investors each of whom would be required to perform a substantial number of quick sale calculations and associated foreign exchange calculations every time they withdraw funds from the non-resident issuer during the year.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is the Macquarie Cash Management Trust, a unit trust that is established and tax resident in Australia;
2.  is managed by Macquarie Investment Management Limited (Macquarie), a company incorporated and tax resident in Australia, or an entity which is associated with Macquarie;
3.  issues Australian dollar denominated units (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) to New Zealand resident investors;
4.  invests proceeds from the issue of units in assets which are Australian dollar denominated financial arrangements, currently short-term Australian dollar denominated debt securities;
5.  does not invest in any currency arrangements which provide an overall economic return as if the securities were denominated in New Zealand dollars;
6.  may make distributions of income (if any) to the unit holders in the form of cash or additional units but does not guarantee that any income will be derived or that a distribution will be made.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires-

"Associated" mean associated persons under sections OD 7 and OD 8 of the Act;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LF 2(3) of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years.

Dated at Wellington this 8th day of February 2008.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Macquarie Escalator)
======================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/03 covers use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Macquarie Escalator).

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in a non-resident company to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a FIF for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the foreign investment fund rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their shares in the non-resident company each year.

Due to the presence of hedging arrangements involving instruments that may be highly effective in terms of hedging the underlying foreign currency financial arrangement, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Act could apply for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years to shares in the non-resident company and prevent the use of the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the presence of a financial arrangement which is potentially effectively hedged, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to use the fair dividend rate method.

The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) is in substance an equity investment that contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument that effectively provides guaranteed returns.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are interests in an Australian Limited Partnership (either the Macquarie Escalator NZ 2007 (Nikkei 225 Index) Limited Partnership or the Macquarie Escalator NZ 2007 (DJ EuroStoxx 50 Index) Limited Partnership) which holds shares in a non-resident company. The General Partner of the Partnership is Escalator NZ GP Co Pty Limited. The Australian Limited Partnership is treated as a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes such that the shares in the non-resident company are treated as held directly by the New Zealand investors. The non-resident company:

1.  is an Australian incorporated company;
2.  issues Australian dollar denominated ordinary shares (not being fixed rate shares, non-participating redeemable shares or guaranteed return shares) to the New Zealand investors through the Australian Limited Partnership;
3.  invests proceeds from the issue of shares in a foreign currency denominated note, which is a financial arrangement that is linked to an underlying index such as:
    1.  an equity index;
    2.  a commodities index;
    3.  a property index;  
          
        and provides returns calculated by reference to a percentage participation in the performance of the underlying index over each investment term (of approximately three years);

4.  provides a return to investors at the end of the investment term based on the returns received from the investment in the index linked note, which is not a fixed return;
5.  enters into foreign currency forward contract hedging arrangements for the purpose of providing New Zealand investors with the economic equivalent of an overall New Zealand dollar exposure in respect of their investment.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

'Australian Limited Partnership' means a partnership registered under the Partnership Act 1892 (NSW);

'Financial arrangement' means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

'Fixed rate share' means a fixed rate share under section LF 2(3) of the Act;

'Non-participating redeemable share'means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act;

'Guaranteed return share' means a share involving an obligation under section EX 40(9)(e) of the Act;

'Non-resident' means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

'The Act' means the Income Tax Act 2004, or any equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Macquarie reFleXion Trust)
============================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/04 covers the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (Macquarie reFleXion Trust).

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in a non-resident company to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a FIF for the New Zealand resident investor, which is a unit trust that has elected to be a portfolio investment entity ("PIE").

The New Zealand resident PIE investor is required to apply the foreign investment fund rules to determine its tax liability in respect of its shares in the non-resident company each year.

Due to the presence of hedging arrangements involving instruments that may be highly effective in terms of hedging the underlying foreign currency financial arrangements invested in by the non-resident company, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Act could apply for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years to shares in the non-resident company and prevent the use of the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the presence of financial arrangements which are potentially effectively hedged, I consider that it is appropriate for the New Zealand resident investor in this arrangement to use the fair dividend rate method.

The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) is in substance an investment that contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt investment that effectively provides fixed returns.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are shares held by one or more New Zealand resident unit trusts, each a Macquarie reFleXion Trust that has elected to be a portfolio investment entity ("the Trust"), in a non-resident company that:

1.  is incorporated in the Cayman Islands;
2.  issues classes of ordinary shares (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) which are denominated in New Zealand dollars directly to the New Zealand investor (the Trust);
3.  converts the New Zealand dollar proceeds from the issue of shares for foreign currency;
4.  invests the foreign currency in a series of foreign currency denominated total return swaps, which are financial arrangements, each of which is linked to or designed to replicate the returns on an underlying fund or index, such as:
    
    1.  an equity fund or index;
    2.  an index of hedge funds;
    3.  a commodities fund or index;  
          
        and each of which provides returns calculated by reference to the performance of those underlying funds or indices over a 6 year 10 month investment term and each of which is not akin to a debt investment in that returns will vary dependent upon the performance of the fund or index over time;
    
      
    
5.  provides a return to the Trust at the end of the investment term based on the returns received from the investments in the index or fund-linked total return swaps, which is not a fixed return;
6.  enters into various foreign currency hedging arrangements for the purpose of providing the ultimate New Zealand investors (investors in the Trust) with the economic equivalent of an overall New Zealand dollar exposure in respect of the principal of their investment (any gains are subject to foreign currency fluctuation).

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

'Financial arrangement' means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

'Fixed rate share' means a fixed rate share under section LF 2(3) of the Act;

'Non-participating redeemable share' means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act;

'Non-resident' means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

'The Act' means the Income Tax Act 2004, or any equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (ING Diversified Yield Fund)
=====================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/05 covers a type of attributing interest in a FIF for which the fair dividend rate method can't be used (ING Diversified Yield Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the Deputy Commissioner, Policy Advice Division, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the non-resident issuer to which this determination applies (the ING Diversified Yield Fund ('DYF')) are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ('FIF') for primarily New Zealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

The non-resident issuer invests predominantly in financial arrangements (at least 80% of the investment mix) which, while not directly denominated in New Zealand dollars, provide a New Zealand Dollar equivalent return through the use of hedging arrangements. For the 2007-08 income year, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2004 ('the Act') does not exclude New Zealand resident investors from using the fair dividend rate ('FDR') method to determine their tax liability under the FIF rules, since the financial arrangements are not denominated in New Zealand dollars (although there are hedging arrangements in place). However, for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years the broadening of section EX 40(9)(d) under the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, means the New Zealand resident investors will be excluded from using the FDR method due to the hedging arrangements.

The policy intention is that investments in the DYF should not qualify for the FDR method as the DYF's investments are akin to New Zealand dollar denominated debt investments. However, in the absence of this determination, most New Zealand resident investors will be required to use the FDR method for the 2007-08 income year. This result is inconsistent with the policy intention of the FIF rules.

In addition, New Zealand resident investors would have to apply three tax methods in three income years, as follows:

*   Before the 2007-08 income year, investments in the DYF were excluded from the FIF rules due to its residence status in a 'grey list' country;
*   For the 2007-08 income year the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the FDR method; and
*   For the 2008-09 and later income years the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the comparative value calculation method.

It is clear that New Zealand resident investors will incur greater compliance costs than if only one of the FIF calculation methods was used uniformly over the term of their investment.

Despite investors in the non-resident issuer prima facie being able to use the FDR method to their investment for the 2007-08 income year, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years. The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains predominantly investment in debt securities and is sufficiently hedged so that it is akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the FDR method not be used by New Zealand resident investors in the non-resident issuer.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is an Australian unitised trust established on 1 July 2003 (known as the ING Diversified Yield Fund);
2.  is managed by ING (NZ) Administration Pty Limited ('ING Administration'), a company incorporated and tax resident in Australia, or an entity which is associated with ING Administration;
3.  invests through a Cook Islands company in a portfolio of Collateralised Debt Obligations ('CDOs'), Credit Opportunity Funds ('COFs') and New Zealand Dollar denominated cash holdings;
4.  has a target rate of return (after fees) of 2% above the New Zealand 90-day bank bill rate;
5.  hedges 100% of its investments on a total portfolio market value basis to the New Zealand dollar.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"CDOs" means Collateralised Debt Obligations which are high-yielding international interest bearing securities issued by offshore special purpose vehicles. The special purpose vehicles use the proceeds from the securitisation to invest in corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities and other credit products. Collateralised Debt Obligation securities are typically rated by external credit rating agencies;

"COFs" means Credit Opportunity Funds which are structured credit funds that invest in a diverse range of corporate debt securities including senior secured bank loans, unsecured investment grade bonds, non investment grade bonds, second-ranking corporate bonds, mezzanine loans and distressed corporate bonds. Credit Opportunity Funds invested into by the non-resident issuer include both rated and non rated credit funds;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004, or any equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (ING Regular Income Fund)
==================================================================================================================================================

Determination FDR 2008/06 covers a type of attributing interest in a FIF for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (ING Regular Income Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the Deputy Commissioner, Policy Advice Division, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the non-resident issuer to which this determination applies (the ING Regular Income Fund ('RIF')) are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ('FIF') for New Zealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

The non-resident issuer invests predominantly in financial arrangements (at least 80% of the investment mix) which, while not directly denominated in New Zealand dollars, provide a New Zealand dollar equivalent return through the use of hedging arrangements. For the 2007-08 income year, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2004 ('the Act') does not exclude New Zealand resident investors from using the fair dividend rate ('FDR') method to determine their tax liability under the FIF rules, since the financial arrangements are not denominated in New Zealand dollars (although there are hedging arrangements in place). However, for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years the broadening of section EX 40(9)(d) under the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, means the New Zealand resident investors will be excluded from using the FDR method due to the hedging arrangements.

The policy intention is that investments in the RIF should not qualify for the FDR method as the RIF's investments are akin to New Zealand dollar denominated debt investments. However, in the absence of this determination, most New Zealand resident investors will be required to use the FDR method for the 2007-08 income year. This result is inconsistent with the policy intention of the FIF rules.

In addition, New Zealand resident investors would have to apply three tax methods in three income years, as follows:

*   Before the 2007-08 income year, investments in the RIF were excluded from the FIF rules due to its residence status in a 'grey list' country;
*   For the 2007-08 income year the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would apply the FDR method; and
*   For the 2008-09 and later income years the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the comparative value calculation method.

It is clear that New Zealand resident investors will incur greater compliance costs than if only one of the FIF calculation methods was used uniformly over the term of their investment.

Despite investors in the non-resident issuer prima facie being able to apply the FDR method to their investment for the 2007-08 income year, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years. The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains predominantly investment in debt securities and is sufficiently hedged so that it is akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the FDR method not be used by New Zealand resident investors in the non-resident issuer.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is an Australian unitised trust established on 20 September 2005 (known as the ING Regular Income Fund);
2.  is managed by ING (NZ) Administration Pty Limited ('ING Administration'), a company incorporated and tax resident in Australia, or an entity which is associated with ING Administration;
3.  invests directly into a portfolio of Collateralised Debt Obligations ('CDOs'), and New Zealand Dollar denominated cash holdings;
4.  has a target rate of return (after fees) of 1% above the New Zealand 90-day bank bill rate over a rolling 12-month period;
5.  hedges 100% of its investments on a total portfolio market value basis to the New Zealand dollar.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -  
"CDOs" means Collateralised Debt Obligations which are high-yielding international interest bearing securities issued by offshore special purpose vehicles. The special purpose vehicles use the proceeds from the securitisation to invest in corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities and other credit products. Collateralised Debt Obligation securities are typically rated by external credit rating agencies;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004, or any equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2007-08 income year for an investor in the RIF unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (ING Credit Opportunities Fund's interests in offshore credit opportunities funds)
===================================================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/07 discusses use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (INGNZ COF's interests in offshore credit opportunities funds).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager, Inland Revenue, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

The ING Credit Opportunities Fund ("INGNZ COF") invests in a number of offshore credit opportunities funds ("COFs"). INGNZ COF's portfolio of COF investments is fully hedged to the New Zealand dollar.

Shares/units in COFs, to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for INGNZ COF. INGNZ COF is required to apply the FIF rules to determine its tax liability in respect of their investments in COFs each year.

COFs comprise interests in non-residents that hold assets of which 80% or more by value consist of financial arrangements that are hedged items having a value in New Zealand dollars governed by a hedging instrument that is highly effective. Therefore the fair dividend rate ("FDR") method under the FIF rules could not apply for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years to units/shares in COFs held by INGNZ COF, in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

I consider that it is appropriate for INGNZ COF to use the FDR method in relation to COFs for the 2008-09 and subsequent income years. Although the assets of the COFs are entirely financial arrangements and the currency risk to INGNZ COF has been removed, I consider these investments (as described to me by the applicant) to be more akin to equity than debt. This is because they are designed to deliver above-average but volatile returns from trading on market opportunities. Much of the investment proposition is in the fund manager(s), rather than in the underlying debt assets themselves. It is therefore my view that, overall, INGNZ COF's investments are not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated financial arrangement.

### Scope of determination

The following requirements need to be satisfied for this determination to apply for an income year to interests in COFs (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) held by INGNZ COF:

*   A COF must have a minimum "period turnover percentage" of 35% over the lesser of the following "measurement periods":  
      
    
    1.  a period of three accounting years of the COF ending on or before 28 February immediately before the start of the relevant income year; or
    2.  a period from the commencement date of the COF, ending immediately on 28 February before the start of the relevant income year.  
          
        (For clarification, "relevant income year" refers to INGNZ COF's income year beginning on 1 April and ending on 31 March.)
    
      
    The "period turnover percentage" is calculated as the average of the turnover percentages for each complete and incomplete accounting year of the COF in the relevant "measurement period":  
      
    1.  For each completed accounting year of the COF, the turnover percentage for that accounting year would be calculated as A / B x 100, where A is total sales plus total purchases in that year, divided by 2, and B is the average total market value of the COF's investment portfolio in the year; and
    2.  For any incomplete accounting year of the COF, the turnover percentage would be calculated on an annualised basis as A / B x 100, where A is total annualised sales plus total annualised purchases for the relevant period, divided by 2, and B is the average total market value of the COF's investment portfolio in that period.

*   INGNZ COF, in respect of an interest in a COF for which the requirements in (1) are met, will exercise no control or influence over the investment decisions of the relevant COF, including the "period turnover percentage" and the asset allocation decisions of the manager.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"COFs" means non-New Zealand tax resident credit opportunities funds the units in which are held by the ING Credit Opportunities Fund (INGNZ COF). COFs are structured credit funds that invest in a diverse range of corporate debt securities including senior secured bank loans, unsecured investment grade bonds, non-investment grade bonds, second-ranking corporate bonds, mezzanine loans and distressed corporate bonds;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LF 2(3) of the Act;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act;

"INGNZ COF" means the ING Credit Opportunities Fund, a New Zealand tax-resident unit trust that is a portfolio investment entity (as that term is defined in the Act). INGNZ COF holds units/shares in offshore credit opportunities funds (the subject of this determination);

"Measurement period" is defined in the Scope of determination;

"Period turnover percentage" is defined in the Scope of determination;

"Relevant income year" is defined in the Scope of determination;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004, or any equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which INGNZ COF may use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for INGNZ COF's income years commencing on or after 1 April 2008.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Macquarie Highpoint Trust)
============================================================================================================================

Determination FDR 2008/08 covers the use of the fair dividend rate method for a attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Macquarie Highpoint Trust).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in a non-resident issuer to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

As the non-resident issuer invests solely in financial arrangements denominated in New Zealand dollars, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Act applies. In addition, the existence of lock in thresholds may mean that section EX 40(9)(e) of the Act applies. Accordingly, New Zealand resident investors are prevented from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the non-resident issuer having assets which 80% or more by value consist of financial arrangements denominated in New Zealand dollars and the presence of lock in thresholds which potentially provide a guaranteed type return, I consider it is appropriate that New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement may use the fair dividend rate method. The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument or one that effectively provides guaranteed returns.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is the Macquarie Highpoint Trust, a unit trust that is established and tax resident in Australia;
2.  is managed by Macquarie Investment Services Limited (Macquarie), a company incorporated and tax resident in Australia, or an entity which is associated with Macquarie;
3.  issues New Zealand dollar denominated units (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) to New Zealand resident investors;
4.  invests proceeds from the issue of units in assets which are financial arrangements, in relation to which the return on maturity is calculated by reference to the movement in selected indices relating to shares listed on a recognised exchange;
5.  may make distributions to the unit holders, but investors are not guaranteed that any income will be derived or that a distribution will be made;
6.  may provide investors with an amount exceeding the issue price of the unit on redemption, but at the time the unit is first issued the redemption price of a unit is not guaranteed to exceed its issue price.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"Associated" means associated persons under sections OD 7 and OD 8 of the Act;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LF 2(3) of the Act;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"Recognised exchange" means recognised exchange under section OB 1 of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (ABN AMRO Global Equities Hindsight Trust)
===========================================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/09 discusses the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (ABN AMRO Global Equities Hindsight Trust).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the ABN AMRO Global Equities Hindsight Trust ("Hindsight Securities") to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their Hindsight Securities each income year.

New Zealand resident investors may be prevented from using the fair dividend rate income calculation method ("FDR method") in the absence of a determination issued pursuant to section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994 if the options that the ABN AMRO Global Equities Hindsight Trust ("the Trust") invests in are 'out of the money'. This is because the only asset of the Trust would then be a zero coupon bond denominated in New Zealand dollars. Section EX 40(9) of the Act could then operate to disallow the use of the FDR method.

I consider it is appropriate that New Zealand resident investors in Hindsight Securities may use the FDR method. The overall arrangement, as described to me by the applicant, contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt investment that effectively provides a guaranteed return.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) in the ABN AMRO Global Equities Hindsight Trust ("Hindsight Securities") as described in this determination:

1.  ABN AMRO Global Equities Hindsight Trust ("the Trust") has offered Hindsight Securities to investors.
2.  Hindsight Securities comprise an investment in units in the Trust.
3.  The Trust in turn has an economic exposure to zero coupon bonds hedged to New Zealand dollars ("NZD") and a mixture of equity index options purchased from ABN AMRO London ("Index Options").
4.  The term of the investment is approximately 5 years.
5.  Depending on interest rates, for every $1 invested in Hindsight Securities approximately 70 cents will be invested in zero coupon bonds and 30 cents in Index Options.
6.  The Index Options comprise options over four global equity indices.
7.  The end product does not provide a guaranteed return over and above the amount originally invested.
8.  The investors will not bear any currency risk.
9.  On maturity, the value of the zero coupon bonds will equal the initial amount invested by the investors. This amount is guaranteed to be repaid to the investors by the Trust and the capital guarantee is effectively achieved through this element of the investment.
10.  At maturity, weightings will be assigned to each of the four global equity indices dependent on how the indices perform. The investment and return made on the derivative pool (if any) will be paid to the investors.
11.  Depending on the amount of cash required to fund the guaranteed return the Hindsight Securities may be able to provide supplementary returns to boost the performance of the investment, through increasing the investors’ participation rate in respect of the performance of the indices. This will be determined at the close of the offer period when the Hindsight Securities are issued to investors.
12.  A distribution may be made by the Trust during the term of the investment. Any such distribution will be contingent on the Hindsight Securities' performance during the term.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LF 2(3) of the Act.

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act.

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004, or any equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

A type of interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Global Guardian Management Cash Plus Fund)
========================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/11 covers a type of interest in a FIF for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Global Investment Service High Yield Cash Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the Global Guardian Management Limited Cash Plus Fund ("CPF") to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their CPF investments each income year.

CPF invests predominantly in financial arrangements (at least 80% of the investment mix) which, while not directly denominated in New Zealand dollars, provide a New Zealand dollar equivalent return through the use of currency hedging arrangements.

For the 2007/08 income year, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the Act) does not exclude New Zealand resident investors from using the fair dividend rate (FDR) method to determine their tax liability under the FIF rules, since the financial arrangements are not denominated in New Zealand dollars (although the hedging arrangements are in place).

However, for the 2008/09 and subsequent income years, the broadening of section EX 46(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 under the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, means the New Zealand resident investors will be excluded from using the FDR method due to the hedging arrangements.

The policy intention is that investments in the CPF should not qualify for the FDR method as the CPF investments are akin to New Zealand dollar denominated debt investments. However, in the absence of this determination most New Zealand resident investors will be required to use the FDR method for the 2007/08 income year. This result is inconsistent with the policy intention of the FIF rules.

In addition, New Zealand resident investors would have to apply three tax methods in three income years as follows:

*   Before the 2007/08 income year, investments in the CPF were excluded from the FIF rules and were subject to tax on dividends due to the grey list exemption
*   For the 2007/08 income year the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the FDR method
*   For the 2008/09 year and later years the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the comparative value calculation method

It is clear the New Zealand resident investors will incur greater compliance costs than if only one of the FIF calculation methods was used uniformly over the term of their investment.

Despite investors in the non-resident issuer being able to use the FDR method for their investments for the 2007/08 income year, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2007/08 and subsequent income years.

The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains predominantly investments in debt securities and is sufficiently hedged so that it is akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the FDR method not be used by New Zealand resident investors in CPF.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non resident issuer which:

1.  is an Australian unitised trust established on 1 May 2003 (known as the Global Guardian Management Limited Cash Plus Fund ("CPF"));
2.  has as its trustee Global Guardian Management Limited, a company resident in Australia;
3.  is managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited ("NZ Funds");
4.  invests directly in a portfolio comprising of collateralised debt obligations ("CDOs") and New Zealand dollar denominated debt holdings;
5.  with respect to its holdings in CDOs, invests in instruments designed to provide a stable return at a predetermined level over their term based on the makeup of the CDO portfolio. The CDOs are managed within strict investment guidelines to achieve this return , rather than being actively managed to maximise returns;
6.  has a target rate of return (after fees) of 1% above the New Zealand 90 day bank bill rate over a rolling 12-month period;
7.  hedges 100% of its foreign currency exposure on a total portfolio market value basis to the New Zealand dollar.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"CDOs" means Collateralised Debt Obligations which are typically high yielding international interest bearing securities issued by offshore special purpose vehicles. The special purpose vehicles use the proceeds from the securitisation to invest in corporate debt and mortgage backed securities and other credit products. The debt tranches comprising a CDO are typically rated by external credit rating agencies.

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act.

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act.

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004, or the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007/08 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2007/08 income year for an investor in CPF unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

A type of interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Global Investment Service High Yield Cash Fund)
=============================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/11 covers interest in a FIF in which the fair dividend rate method can't be used (Global Investment Service High Yield Cash Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the Global Investment Services Limited High Yield Cash Fund ("HYC") to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their HYC investments each income year.

HYC invests predominantly in financial arrangements (at least 80% of the investment mix) which, while not directly denominated in New Zealand dollars, provide a New Zealand dollar equivalent return through the use of currency hedging arrangements.

For the 2007/08 income year, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the Act) does not exclude New Zealand resident investors from using the fair dividend rate (FDR) method to determine their tax liability under the FIF rules, since the financial arrangements are not denominated in New Zealand dollars (although the hedging arrangements are in place).

However, for the 2008/09 and subsequent income years, the broadening of section EX 46(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 under the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, means the New Zealand resident investors will be excluded from using the FDR method due to the hedging arrangements.

The policy intention is that investments in the HYC should not qualify for the FDR method as the HYC investments are akin to New Zealand dollar denominated debt investments. However, in the absence of this determination most New Zealand resident investors will be required to use the FDR method for the 2007/08 income year. This result is inconsistent with the policy intention of the FIF rules.

In addition, New Zealand resident investors would have to apply three tax methods in three income years as follows:

*   Before the 2007/08 income year, investments in the HYC were excluded from the FIF rules and were subject to tax on dividends due to the grey list exemption
*   For the 2007/08 income year the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the FDR method
*   For the 2008/09 year and later years the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the comparative value calculation method

It is clear the New Zealand resident investors will incur greater compliance costs than if only one of the FIF calculation methods was used uniformly over the term of their investment.

Despite investors in the non-resident issuer being able to use the FDR method for their investments for the 2007/08 income year, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2007/08 and subsequent income years.

The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains predominantly investments in debt securities and is sufficiently hedged so that it is akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the FDR method not be used by New Zealand resident investors in HYC.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non resident issuer which:

1.  is an Australian unitised trust established on 28 March 2000, that commenced operation on 12 June 2000 (known as the Global Investment Services Limited High Yield Cash Fund ("HYC"));
2.  has as its trustee Global Investment Services Limited, a company resident in Australia;
3.  is managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited ("NZ Funds");
4.  invests directly in a portfolio comprising of collateralised debt obligations ("CDOs") and New Zealand dollar denominated debt holdings;
5.  with respect to its holdings in CDOs, invests in instruments designed to provide a stable return at a predetermined level over their term based on the makeup of the CDO portfolio. The CDOs are managed within strict investment guidelines to achieve this return, rather than being actively managed to maximise returns;
6.  has a target rate of return (after fees) of 0.5% above the New Zealand bank deposit rate over a rolling 12-month period;
7.  hedges 100% of its foreign currency exposure on a total portfolio market value basis to the New Zealand dollar.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"CDOs" means Collateralised Debt Obligations which are typically high yielding international interest bearing securities issued by offshore special purpose vehicles. The special purpose vehicles use the proceeds from the securitisation to invest in corporate debt and mortgage backed securities and other credit products. The debt tranches comprising a CDO are typically rated by external credit rating agencies.

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act.

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act.

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004, or the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007/08 and subsequent income years.  
However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2007/08 income year for an investor in the HYC unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

A type of interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Global Investment Service Super Yield Fund)
=========================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/12 covers a type of interest in a foreign investment fund where the fair dividend rate method can't be used (Global Investment Service Super Yield Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the Global Investment Services Limited Super Yield Fund ("SYF") to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their SYF investments each income year.

SYF invests predominantly in financial arrangements (at least 80% of the investment mix) which, while not directly denominated in New Zealand dollars, provide a New Zealand dollar equivalent return through the use of currency hedging arrangements.

For the 2007/08 income year, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the Act) does not exclude New Zealand resident investors from using the fair dividend rate (FDR) method to determine their tax liability under the FIF rules, since the financial arrangements are not denominated in New Zealand dollars (although the hedging arrangements are in place).

However, for the 2008/09 and subsequent income years, the broadening of section EX 46(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 under the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, means the New Zealand resident investors will be excluded from using the FDR method due to the hedging arrangements.

The policy intention is that investments in the SYF should not qualify for the FDR method as the SYF investments are akin to New Zealand dollar denominated debt investments. However in the absence of this determination, most New Zealand resident investors will be required to use the FDR method for the 2007/08 income year. This result is inconsistent with the policy intention of the FIF rules.

In addition, New Zealand resident investors would have to apply three tax methods in three income years as follows:

*   Before the 2007/08 income year, investments in the SYF were excluded from the FIF rules and were subject to tax on dividends due to the grey list exemption
*   For the 2007/08 income year the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the FDR method  
    
*   For the 2008/09 year and later years the FIF rules apply and New Zealand resident investors would use the comparative value calculation method

It is clear the New Zealand resident investors will incur greater compliance costs than if only one of the FIF calculation methods was used uniformly over the term of their investment.

Despite investors in the non-resident issuer being able to use the FDR method for their investments for the 2007/08 income year, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2007/08 and subsequent income years.

The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains predominantly investments in debt securities and is sufficiently hedged so that it is akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the FDR method not be used by New Zealand resident investors in SYF.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non resident issuer which:

1.  is an Australian unitised trust established on 6 December 2000, that commenced operation on 16 September 2002 (known as the Global Investment Services Limited Super Yield Fund ("SYF"));
2.  has as its trustee Global Investment Services Limited, a company resident in Australia;
3.  is managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited ("NZ Funds");
4.  invests directly in a portfolio comprising of collateralised debt obligations ("CDOs") and New Zealand dollar denominated debt holdings;
5.  with respect to its holdings in CDOs, invests in instruments designed to provide a stable return at a predetermined level over their term based on the makeup of the CDO portfolio. The CDOs are managed within strict investment guidelines to achieve this return, rather than being actively managed to maximise returns;
6.  has a target rate of return (after fees) of 1% above the New Zealand 90 day bank bill rate over a rolling 12-month period;
7.  hedges 100% of its foreign currency exposure on a total portfolio market value basis to the New Zealand dollar.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"CDOs" means Collateralised Debt Obligations which are typically high yielding international interest bearing securities issued by offshore special purpose vehicles. The special purpose vehicles use the proceeds from the securitisation to invest in corporate debt and mortgage backed securities and other credit products. The debt tranches comprising a CDO are typically rated by external credit rating agencies.

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act.

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act.

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004, or the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007/08 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2007/08 income year for an investor in the SYF unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (PIMCO Cayman Global Bond (NZD Hedged) Fund)
=============================================================================================================================================

FDR 2008/13 covers the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (PIMCO Cayman Global Bond (NZD Hedged) Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager, Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the non-resident issuer (PIMCO Cayman Global Bond (NZD Hedged) Fund) to which this determination applies held by New Zealand resident investors, including TOWER Asset Management International Bond Fund, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the foreign investment fund rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

As the non-resident issuer invests solely in financial arrangements and due to the presence of hedging arrangements that would be highly effective in terms of hedging the underlying foreign currency financial arrangements, section EX 46(10)(c) of the Act would apply to units in the non-resident issuer to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method in the absence of a determination made under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the non-resident issuer having assets which 80% or more by value consist of financial arrangements effectively hedged to New Zealand dollars, I consider that it is appropriate for a New Zealand resident investor in this arrangement to use the FDR method. I would normally have concerns about using the FDR method for such investments. However, I consider that an investment in an actively traded debt portfolio can be more akin to equity than debt. This can be the case, for example, if the portfolio is designed to deliver above-normal but volatile returns from trading on market opportunities. If the investment proposition to the New Zealand resident investor is sufficiently in the ability of the fund manager, rather than only in the underlying debt assets themselves, then from a policy perspective it is appropriate for the FDR method to be used for the investment.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to units held by New Zealand resident investors, including TOWER Asset Management International Bond Fund, a portfolio investment entity, in a non-resident issuer.

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    
    1.  is a unit trust that is established in the Cayman Islands as a series trust of PIMCO Cayman Trust;
    2.  is known as the PIMCO Cayman Global Bond ( NZD-Hedged) Fund;
    3.  issues New Zealand dollar denominated units (not being fixed rate shares, non-participating redeemable shares or guaranteed return shares) directly to the New Zealand investors;
    4.  invests in a global bond portfolio using a trading strategy based on the benchmark index;
    5.  actively manages the global bond portfolio;
    6.  has a minimum turnover percentage target;
    7.  seeks to hedge 95% to 105% of the value of the global bond portfolio to the New Zealand dollar;
    8.  is managed against a global currency index and is permitted to have currency exposure to plus or minus 25% of the Fund's benchmark index on a per currency basis and is permitted to purchase currencies not represented in the index;
    9.  has a target tracking error measured against the benchmark index.
    
      
    
2.  TOWER Asset Management International Bond Fund will exercise no control or influence over the investment decisions of the non-resident issuer including the target minimum annual turnover percentage, asset allocation decisions and the target tracking error.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Benchmark index" means the index that at the date of this determination is called the Lehman Brothers Global Aggregate Bond Index, or a replacement index with substantially the same features;

"PIMCO Cayman Trust" means a unit trust established in Cayman Islands pursuant to a declaration of trust;

"Series trust" means a separate and distinct unit trust established in the Cayman Islands as a series trust of PIMCO Cayman Trust;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LL 9 of the Act;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating share under section CD 22 of the Act;

"Guaranteed return share" means a share involving an obligation under section EX 46(10)(d) of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Minimum turnover percentage target" means the target percentage agreed with and disclosed before this determination is made to the Policy Manager, Inland Revenue who makes this determination;

"Target tracking error" means the target percentage agreed with and disclosed before this determination is made to the Policy Manager, Inland Revenue who makes this determination.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a foreign investment fund to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2008-2009 and subsequent income years.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (PIMCO Funds: Global investors Series plc Global Bond Fund)
====================================================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2009/03 covers attributing interest in a FIF for which the fair dividend rate method can't be used (PIMCO Funds: Global investors Series plc Global Bond Fund).

**Reference**

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager, Policy Advice Division, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

**Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

Shares in the PIMCO Funds: Global Investors Series plc Global Bond Fund (PIMCO) to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand-resident investors. New Zealand-resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in units in PIMCO each year.

PIMCO invests in global fixed interest securities for which PIMCO has made foreign currency hedging arrangements to provide investors with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on these debt instruments. Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would not apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method but would apply if the New Zealand dollar denominated share class was the only class of shares issued by PIMCO.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand-resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where the New Zealand-resident investor invests in New Zealand dollar denominated shares in PIMCO, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment in PIMCO to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2010-2011 and subsequent income years.

**Scope of determination**

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand-resident investors where:

1.  The FIF:
    1.  is an Irish company, that issues multiple classes of shares;
    2.  is known as "The PIMCO Funds: Global Investors Series plc Global Bond Fund (PIMCO)";
    3.  invests into an undivided pool of global bond investments;
    4.  undertakes hedging in proportion to the shares issued in each currency. The NZD hedging therefore only covers the proportion of the pool of assets that corresponds to the number of NZD shares.
2.  The investors in PIMCO:
    1.  invest into that pool of bond assets through classes of shares that are denominated in various currencies, including one which is denominated in New Zealand dollars (NZD shares);
    2.  that are New Zealand residents invest in the New Zealand dollar class of shares of PIMCO.

**Interpretation**

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Non-residence' means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007.

**Determination**

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

**Application date**

This determination applies for the 2010-2011 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for an investor in PIMCO that chooses that the determination applies for that year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (AMP future directions international bond fund)
========================================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2009/01 covers attributing interest in a FIF for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (AMP future directions international bond fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager, Policy Advice Division, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the non-resident issuer to which this determination applies (the AMP Future Directions International Bond Fund-; "the Fund") are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

The Fund invests predominantly in financial arrangements (at least 80% of the investment mix) comprising government, government-guaranteed and high-grade corporate bonds and securities in countries around the world. Up to 20% of the Fund may be invested in other asset classes (such as shares) with the objective of seeking opportunities to benefit from any above market performance generated by the underlying investment managers in such other asset classes. Consequently, the Fund will use derivatives to offset the exposure to such other asset classes, other than the exposure to the under or over performance of the underlying investment managers. The Fund is available either hedged to Australian dollars or unhedged.

The AMP Capital Hedged Global Fixed Interest Fund ("the AIF Q Fund"), which is resident in New Zealand, invests in the unhedged Fund and aims to be fully hedged to the New Zealand dollar by entering into appropriate currency hedge positions, which are financial arrangements separate from the units that the AIF Q Fund holds in the Fund.

Because the Fund does not have New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements and the AIF Q Fund enters into its own New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements, section EX 40(9)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (taking into account the amendments made to that provision by the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007) and section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 do not exclude the AIF Q Fund from using the fair dividend rate ("FDR") method to determine its tax liability in respect of the units it holds in the Fund under the FIF rules.

However, the AIF Q Fund's hedging strategy ensures that its investment in the Fund is economically equivalent to a loan denominated in New Zealand dollars.

The policy intention is that the AIF Q Fund's investment in the Fund should not qualify for the FDR method as the AIF Q Fund's investment is akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment having regard to the nature of the Fund's investments and the AIF Q Fund's hedging position. However, in the absence of this determination, the AIF Q Fund could choose to use the FDR method for the 2007-2008 and subsequent income years. This result is inconsistent with the policy intention of the FIF rules.

I consider that it is appropriate for the AIF Q Fund to be excluded from using the FDR method in respect of its investment in the Fund for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years. The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) consists predominantly of investments in debt securities and is sufficiently hedged so that it is akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the FDR method not be used by the AIF Q Fund or other similarly hedged New Zealand resident investors in respect of investments in the Fund.

### Scope of determination

The investments that this determination applies are units in the unhedged AMP Future Directions International Bond Fund, a unit trust established in Australia ("the Fund").

The Fund:

*   is resident in Australia for tax purposes;
*   invests predominantly (80% or more of total net assets) in fixed interest securities in countries around the world, including government and government-guaranteed securities, corporate securities, asset-backed securities and hybrid securities (such as convertible notes);
*   can invest in other asset classes (such as shares) but the net exposure (including any derivatives used to offset the market exposure, that is, the exposure other than the under or over performance of the underlying investment managers) to such asset classes shall not exceed 5% of the value of the Fund;
*   has a tracking error measured against a performance benchmark of the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Index.

### Interpretation

In this determination:

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004 or the Income Tax Act 2007, as applicable;

"Target tracking error" means the Fund's target tracking error agreed with and disclosed, prior to this determination, to the Policy Manager, Inland Revenue who makes this determination.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the attributing interest, if the person fully hedges (on a pre-tax basis, plus or minus 10%) the interest back to the New Zealand dollar.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007-2008 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for an investor in the Fund unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (PIMCO Wholesale Global Bond Fund)
===========================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2009/02 covers a type of attributing interest in a FIF for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (PIMCO Wholesale Global Bond Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager, Policy Advice Division, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the EQT PIMCO Wholesale Global Bond Fund (PIMCO) to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in units in PIMCO each year.

PIMCO invests in global fixed interest securities for which PIMCO has made foreign currency hedging arrangements to provide investors with an Australian dollar denominated return on these debt instruments. Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the Act") would apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method if the foreign currency hedging arrangements were made to provide a New Zealand dollar denominated return on these financial arrangements.

Instead of PIMCO undertaking New Zealand dollar currency hedging arrangements New Zealand resident investors can enter into separate foreign currency hedging arrangements to provide a New Zealand dollar equivalent return when the two arrangements, being the investment in PIMCO and the currency hedge, are considered as a single arrangement.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return akin to New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis where the New Zealand resident investor undertakes New Zealand dollar currency hedging arrangements to at least 80% of the value of their interest in PIMCO, I consider that it is appropriate for the investment in PIMCO to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2008-2009 and subsequent income years.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    1.  is an Australian unit trust established on 31 July 1998;
    2.  is known as the EQT PIMCO Wholesale Global Bond Fund;
    3.  issues units denominated in Australian dollars;
    4.  invests predominately in investment grade global fixed interest securities;
    5.  enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to provide a return similar to Australian dollar denominated debt instruments;
2.  In respect of the EQT PIMCO Wholesale Global Bond Fund:
    1.  the volatility risk level of the non-resident issuer is represented to investors as low to medium;
    2.  the average tracking error of the non-resident issuer as measured against the benchmark index is below the level agreed with and disclosed before this determination is made to the Policy Manager, Inland Revenue who makes this determination;
    3.  the non-resident issuer does not adopt a target tracking error above the target percentage agreed with and disclosed before this determination is made to the Policy Manager, Inland Revenue who makes this determination; and
3.  The New Zealand resident investor undertakes New Zealand dollar currency hedging arrangements to at least 80% of the value of their interest in the nonresident issuer.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Benchmark Index" means the Lehman Brothers Global Aggregate Bond Index hedged to the Australian dollar, or a replacement index with substantially the same features;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2008-2009 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for an investor in PIMCO unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund that is a derivative income trust
==================================================================================================================================

FDR 2009/05 covers the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF that is a derivative income trust.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in a non-resident issuer ("the issuer") to which this determination applies are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for portfolio investment entities (PIE) managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited (NZFM). Each PIE is required to apply the FIF rules to determine its tax liability in respect of units in the nonresident issuer each year.

As the issuer holds New Zealand denominated cash, the balance of which may in exceptional circumstances exceed 80% or more by value of its assets, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Act could apply to prevent the PIE from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Despite the fact that the issuer may hold assets which 80% or more by value consist of financial arrangements denominated in New Zealand dollars, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand-resident investors in this arrangement to use the fair dividend rate method. The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is a unit trust that is established and tax-resident in Australia;
2.  has appointed, as Investment Manager, NZFM (a company incorporated and tax-resident in New Zealand) or an entity which is associated with NZFM;
3.  issues New Zealand dollar denominated units (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) to a PIE (or PIEs) for which NZFM is the Investment Manager;
4.  has been established to hold derivative contracts to take or hedge equity or commodity risk by a single investor that is the PIE;
5.  invests proceeds from the issue of units in assets which are foreign currency accounts, New Zealand dollar accounts and financial arrangements that do not provide funds to the issuer;
6.  to the extent to which it invests in foreign currency accounts (or other financial arrangements that provide funds to the issuer, in relation to which the return is determined by reference in any way to underlying non-New Zealand dollar-denominated fixedinterest securities), does not invest in any currency arrangements which provide an overall economic return as if the securities were denominated in New Zealand dollars;
7.  has investment guidelines that prohibit the investment manager from entering into currency arrangements (whether in the issuer itself or through any associated, or commonly controlled, entity) that are intended by the investment manager to achieve an effective hedge of more than 80% of the issuer's foreign currency exposure;
8.  may make distributions to the unit holders on a regular basis, but does not guarantee that any income will be derived or that a distribution will be made;
9.  may pay to the PIE an amount exceeding the issue price of the unit on redemption, but does not guarantee that the redemption price of a unit will exceed its issue price;
10.  the PIE has removed no more than 80% of the foreign currency risk associated with the units.

It is a further condition of this determination that the investment in the issuer is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the PIE with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollardenominated interest exposure.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

"Associated" means associated within the meaning of subpart YB of the Act;

"Financial arrangement" means a fixed-rate share under section LL 9 of the Act;

"Investment Manager" means the person or entity appointed by the trustee to carry out the investment activities of the trustee;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a nonparticipating redeemable share under section CD 22(9) of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2009-10 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for an investor in the issuer unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

FDR 2010/02 covers the use of the fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF and replaces determination FDR 2008/01.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in a non-resident issuer to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

As the non-resident issuer invests solely in financial arrangements denominated in New Zealand dollars, section EX 46(10)(c) of the Act applies. In addition, the non-resident issuer may provide investors the ability to protect capital by locking in a minimum return equal to a proportion of the net asset value or index level achieved by the issuer in relation to the financial arrangements which may mean that section EX 46(10) (d) of the Act applies. Accordingly, New Zealand resident investors are prevented from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91 AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the non-resident issuer having assets which 80% or more by value consist of financial arrangements denominated in New Zealand dollars and the ability of the Funds to lock in a proportion of the net asset value or index level achieved, the Commissioner considers that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to use the fair dividend rate method. The overall arrangement (as described by the applicant) contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument or one that effectively provides guaranteed returns.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is a unit trust that is established and tax resident in Australia;
2.  is managed by Liontamer Investment Management Pty Limited (Liontamer), a company incorporated and tax resident in Australia, or an entity which is associated with Liontamer;
3.  issues New Zealand denominated units (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) to New Zealand resident investors;
4.  invests proceeds from the issue of units in assets which are financial arrangements, in relation to which the value is calculated by reference to either:
    1.  The movement in the value of an underlying basket of:
        *   Shares in companies listed on a recognised exchange;
        *   Commodities;
        *   Real property;
        *   Non-NZD denominated fixed interest securities traded on a recognised market.
    2.  The movement in an index or selected indices relating to the value of items listed in (i) above
    3.  The movement in the value of an underlying actively managed fund or basket of funds investing in items listed in (i) above;
    4.  The movement in currencies traded on a recognised market;
    5.  Any combination of (i) to (iv);
5.  if it invests in financial arrangements in relation to which the return is determined by reference in any way to underlying non-New Zealand dollar denominated fixed interest securities, does not invest in any currency arrangements which provide an overall economic return as if the securities were denominated in New Zealand dollars;
6.  does not derive a fixed return in excess of 1.00% per annum;
7.  may make distributions to the unit holders, but investors are not guaranteed that any income will be derived or that a distribution will be made;
8.  may pay to an investor an amount exceeding the issue price of the unit on redemption, but at the time the unit is first issued does not guarantee the redemption price of a unit will exceed its issue price;
9.  may enter into investments where the value is set by reference to a proportion of the net asset value or index level at specified times or over specified periods which could produce a minimum value in excess of the issue price of the units, but at the time units are first issued does not guarantee a return in excess of the issue price.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"Associated" means associated persons under sections YB 1 to 21 of the Act;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LL 9 of the Act;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 22(9) of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act;

"Recognised exchange" means recognised exchange under section YA 1 of the Act;

"Recognised market" means a recognised exchange under section YA 1 of the Act, reading paragraphs (c) and (d) of the definition of recognised exchange to include currencies or financial arrangements;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Revocation

Determination FDR 2010/02 replaces determination FDR 2008/01. Determination FDR 2008/01 is revoked from the 2010-11 income year.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2010-11 and subsequent income years.

Revocation of Determination FDR 2008/13
=======================================

Determination FDR 2010/01 applies to units held by NZ resident investors including Tower, a PIE, in a non-resident issuer and revokes FDR 2008/13.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Policy Manager, Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the non-resident issuer (PIMCO Cayman Global Bond (NZD Hedged) Fund) to which this determination applies held by New Zealand-resident investors, including Tower Asset Management International Bond Fund, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund.

New Zealand-resident investors are required to apply the foreign investment fund rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

As the non-resident issuer invests solely in financial arrangements and due to the presence of hedging arrangements that would be highly effective in terms of hedging the underlying foreign currency financial arrangements, section EX 46(10)(c) of the Act would apply to units in the non-resident issuer to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method in the absence of a determination made under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

An attributing interest in a foreign investment fund to which this determination applies is the subject of an earlier determination, Determination FDR 2008/13 allowing the use of the FDR method for the interest. Section 91AAO(4) authorises the making of a determination that revokes an earlier determination. This determination revokes Determination FDR 2008/13. The application date varies according to when the attributing interests in the nonresident issuer were acquired.

The determination made in FDR 2008/13 relied on the application of a trading criterion that meant that an actively traded debt portfolio, which met certain criteria, was determined to be more akin to equity than debt. Therefore, despite the non-resident issuer having financial arrangements that were 80% or more by value effectively hedged to New Zealand dollars, its actively traded debt portfolio made it appropriate for the FDR method to be used. However, this criterion is no longer considered appropriate because it creates compliance and administrative concerns, and has now been removed. It is therefore appropriate to revoke Determination FDR 2008/13.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to units held by New Zealandresident investors, including Tower, a portfolio investment entity, in a non-resident issuer.

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    1.  is a unit trust that is established in the Cayman Islands as a series trust of PIMCO Cayman Trust;
    2.  is known as the PIMCO Cayman Global Bond (NZD-Hedged) Fund;
    3.  issues New Zealand dollar denominated units (not being fixed rate shares, non-participating redeemable shares or guaranteed return shares) directly to the New Zealand investors;
    4.  invests in a global bond portfolio using a trading strategy based on the benchmark index;
    5.  actively manages the global bond portfolio;
    6.  has a minimum turnover percentage target;
    7.  seeks to hedge 95% to 105% of the value of the global bond portfolio to the New Zealand dollar;
    8.  is managed against a global currency index and is permitted to have currency exposure to plus or minus 25% of the Fund's benchmark index on a per currency basis and is permitted to purchase currencies not represented in the index;
    9.  has a target tracking error measured against the benchmark index.
2.  Tower will exercise no control or influence over the investment decisions of the non-resident issuer including the target minimum annual turnover percentage, asset allocation decisions and the target tracking error.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Benchmark date" means 8 March 2010;

"Benchmark index" means the index that at the date of this determination is called the Lehman Brothers Global Aggregate Bond Index, or a replacement index with substantially the same features;

"Compensation" means an amount paid by Tower for fee rebates or administrative errors in relation to units in Tower;

"Compensation units" are units in Tower that are:

*   held by a unit holder on or before the benchmark date; or
*   held by a unit holder after the benchmark date, if the units are acquired as a result of compensation in relation to other compensation units;

"PIMCO Cayman Trust" means a unit trust established in Cayman Islands pursuant to a declaration of trust;

"Series trust" means a separate and distinct unit trust established in the Cayman Islands as a series trust of PIMCO Cayman Trust;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under section LL 9 of the Act;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a nonparticipating share under section CD 22 of the Act;

"Guaranteed return share" means a share involving an obligation under section EX 46(10)(d) of the Act;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Tower" means Tower Asset Management International Bond Fund;

"Minimum turnover percentage target" means the target percentage agreed with and disclosed for Determination FDR 2008/13 to the Policy Manager, Inland Revenue who made that determination;

"Target tracking error" means the target percentage agreed with and disclosed for Determination FDR 2008/13 to the Policy Manager, Inland Revenue who made that determination.

### Determination

Determination FDR 2008/13 is revoked.

### Application date

This determination applies as follows:

1.  For the 2015/16 and subsequent income years for:
    1.  units in the non-resident issuer acquired on or before the earlier of 31 March 2010 or the time that the number of units on issue is 5 percent more than the greatest number of units on issue on the benchmark date; and
    2.  units in the non-resident issuer acquired after the benchmark date, if the units are acquired as a result of compensation in relation to compensation units.
2.  For the 2010/11 and subsequent income years for all other units in the non-resident issuer.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method
====================================================================================================================

FDR 2013/01 covers a type of attributing interest in a FIF for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method (the Ospraie Commodity Fund Ltd).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Ospraie Commodity Fund Limited ("the Ospraie Fund"), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for certain portfolio investment entity ("PIE") funds ("the NZFM Funds") managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited.

The investments held by the Ospraie Fund are predominantly financial arrangements. In addition, the NZFM Funds hedge their attributing interests in the Ospraie Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the NZFM Funds from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite this, the overall arrangement (as described by the applicant) contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for the NZFM Funds to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from an attributing interest in the Ospraie Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to shares held by the NZFM Funds in the Ospraie Fund.

Shares in the Ospraie Fund are attributing interests in a FIF for the NZFM Funds.

The Ospraie Fund:

*   is organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands as a limited liability company
*   issues shares, denominated in US dollars, to the NZFM Funds
*   invests in and trades in a global portfolio of commodities and commodity related derivative instruments, denominated in US dollars or effectively hedged to US dollars
*   uses a trading strategy based on active leveraged trading of the commodities and related derivatives.

The NZFM Funds hedge their attributing interests in the Ospraie Fund back to New Zealand dollars.

It is an additional condition of this determination that the investment in the Ospraie Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the NZFM Funds with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

*   "Ospraie Fund" means the issuer, Ospraie Commodity Fund Limited, which is incorporated as a company under the laws of the Cayman Islands
*   "Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend rate method under section YA1 of the Income Tax Act 2007
*   "Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW3 of the Income Tax Act 2007
*   "Foreign investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007
*   "The NZFM Funds" means a unit trust organised under the laws of New Zealand and is a portfolio investment entity, managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited
*   "Portfolio investment entity" means a portfolio investment entity under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the Ospraie Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which the NZFM Funds may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2012-13 and subsequent income years.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Russell Investment Company plc: NZDH-A class shares)
==============================================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2014/01 covers attributing interest in a FIF where the fair dividend rate method can't be used (Russell Investment Company plc: NZDH-A class shares).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Russell Investment Company plc (RIC), an Irish public limited company to which this determination applies, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors. RIC is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. Those sub-funds do not have a separate legal personality under Irish law.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in RIC each year.

The Russell Global Bond Fund (RGBF) is a sub-fund of RIC which invests in a portfolio of transferable debt instruments. RIC issues a class of shares denominated in New Zealand dollars (NZDH-A shares) that provide holders of that class of shares with an interest in the pool of investments held by the RGBF. RIC undertakes hedging for NZDH-A shares, with the intention that this arrangement ensures that the New Zealand dollar value of that class of shares is unaffected by foreign exchange movements.

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would not apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method, but would apply if the RGBF represented a separate foreign company and the NZDH-A share class was the only class of shares on issue.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in NZDH-A shares issued by RIC and the share class, which has a value in New Zealand dollars, is linked to an interest in a pool of debt securities held by RGBF and effectively hedged against foreign currency movements by RIC, I consider that it is appropriate for those holdings in RIC to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2015 and subsequent income years.

### Scope of determination

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    1.  is an Irish public limited company established on 31 March 1994 that issues multiple classes of shares;
    2.  is known at the date of this determination as Russell Investment Company plc; and
    3.  is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds; and
2.  The attributing interest consists of a New Zealand dollar denominated class of shares, NZDH-A, issued by that non-resident that provides exposure solely to a sub-fund that predominantly (ie, 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) holds transferrable debt instruments, and
3.  The investment assets attributable to NZDH-A shares are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident for the purpose of eliminating any exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:  
  
"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act; and

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2015 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in NZDH-A shares in RIC and who chooses that this determination applies for that income year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

FDR 2014/02 covers the use of the fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (Civic Capital Currency Offshore Fund Limited).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Civic Capital Currency Offshore Fund Limited (the Civic Capital Fund), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for certain portfolio investment entity funds ("the NZFM Funds") managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited.

The investments held by the Civic Capital Fund through the Civic Capital Currency Master Fund Limited (the Civic Master Fund) are predominantly financial arrangements. In addition, the NZFM Funds hedge their attributing interests in the Civic Capital Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the NZFM Funds from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite Civic Capital Fund having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangement, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for the NZFM Funds to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from its attributing interest in the Civic Capital Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to shares held by the NZFM Funds in the Civic Capital Fund and Civic Capital Fund's investment in the Civic Master Fund.

The Civic Capital Fund:

*   is organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands as a limited liability company;
*   issues shares, denominated in USD, to the NZFM Funds;
*   Invests in and trades in global currency markets and foreign exchange related derivatives through its investment in the Civic Master Fund.

The NZFM Funds will hedge their attributing interests in the Civic Capital Fund back to New Zealand Dollars.

It is an additional condition of this determination that the investment in the Civic Capital Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide NZFM Funds with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Civic Capital Fund" means the issuer, Civic Capital Currency Offshore Fund Limited, which is incorporated as a company under the laws of the Cayman Islands;

"Civic Capital Currency Master Fund Limited" means the master fund used for holding the investments, which is incorporated as a company under the laws of the Cayman Island;

"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Foreign investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"the NZFM Funds" means a portfolio investment entity managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited;

"Portfolio investment entity" means a portfolio investment entity under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the Civic Capital Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which the NZFM Funds may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2014 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2014 income year for an investor in the Civic Capital Fund unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

FDR 2014/03 covers the use of the fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (Harness Macro Currency Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Harness Macro Currency Fund (the Harness Fund), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for certain portfolio investment entity funds ("the NZFM Funds") managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited. 

The investments held by the Harness Fund, a sub-fund of CitiFirst Investments plc, are predominantly financial arrangements. In addition, the NZFM Funds hedge their attributing interests in the Harness Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the NZFM Funds from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the Harness Fund having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangement, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for the NZFM Funds to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from its attributing interest in the Harness Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to shares held by the NZFM Funds in the Harness Fund, a sub-fund of CitiFirst Investments plc.

CitiFirst Investments plc:

*   is organised under the laws of Ireland as a limited liability company;
*   is authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland;
*   is an umbrella, open-ended investment company;
*   has variable capital;
*   invests in and trades in global currency markets and foreign exchange related derivatives through a total return swap with Citi bank Global Markets Limited.

The Harness Fund is a sub-fund of CitiFirst Investments plc and indirectly invests in trades in global currency markets and foreign exchange related derivatives, primarily through a total return swap.

The NZFM Funds will hedge their attributing interests in the Harness Fund back to New Zealand Dollars.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  That the investment in the Harness Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide NZFM Funds with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.

2.  That the total value of exposures to foreign exchange related derivatives through a total return swap with Citibank Global Markets Limited will be more than 20% of the total asset value of the Harness Macro Currency Fund. If an event occurs that the 20% test is not met, and it is not corrected in 45 days, then this determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.

3.  That the Harness Macro Currency Strategy continuously trades in foreign exchange and foreign exchange related derivative financial instruments. If an event occurs and the requirement is not met for a continuous period of 45 days, then this determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:  
  
"Harness Fund" means the Harness Macro Currency Fund, which is a sub-fund of the issuer CitiFirst Investments plc;  
  
"CitiFirst Investments plc" means the legal entity used for holding the investments, which is incorporated as a company under the laws of Ireland;  
  
"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;  
  
"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;  
  
"Foreign Investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;  
  
"Quarter" has the meaning contained in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;  
  
"The NZFM Funds" means a trust managed by New Zealand Funds Management Limited.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the Harness Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which the NZFM Funds may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2015 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2015 income year for an investor in the Harness Fund unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Wellington Management Portfolios (Dublin) Plc: Global Bond Fund - NZD Share Class)
============================================================================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2015/01 covers a type of attributing interest in a FIF for which the fair dividend rate method can't be used (Wellington Management Portfolios (Dublin) Plc).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the Wellington Management Portfolios (Dublin) Plc: Global Bond Fund (WMP) - New Zealand dollar denominated share class (NZD Share Class) to which this determination applies, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in WMP each year.

WMP invests in global fixed interest securities for which WMP has made foreign currency hedging arrangements to provide investors with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on these debt instruments.  

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would, if not for this determination, require the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in New Zealand dollar denominated shares in WMP, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment in WMP to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2014-2015 and subsequent income years.

### Scope of determination

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The FIF:
    1.  is incorporated in Ireland and issues multiple classes of shares;
    2.  is known at the date of this determination as Wellington Management Portfolios (Dublin) Plc: Global Bond Fund (WMP);
    3.  invests into an undivided pool of global fixed interest securities;
    4.  undertakes hedging in proportion to the shares issued in each currency. The NZD hedging therefore only covers the proportion of the pool of assets that corresponds to the number of NZD shares.
2.  The investors in WMP:
    1.  invest in that pool of global fixed interest securities through classes of shares that are denominated in various currencies including one which is denominated in New Zealand dollars (NZD shares);
    2.  that are New Zealand residents invest in New Zealand dollar class of shares of WMP.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act; and

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2014-2015 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for an investor in WMP that chooses that the determination applies for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund in the Harness Macro Currency Fund.
====================================================================================================================================

FDR 2015/02 covers the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Harness Macro Currency Fund).

**This determination does not apply to the Harness Macro Currency Fund which was a sub-fund of CitiFirst Investments PLC (FDR 2014/03).**

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Harness Macro Currency Fund (the Harness Fund), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF).

The investments held by the Harness Fund, a sub-fund of the Harness Investment Fund, are predominantly financial arrangements. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the investor from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the Harness Fund having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for an investor to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from its attributing interest in the Harness Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to shares held in the Harness Fund, a sub-fund of the Harness Investment Fund.

Harness Investment Fund:

*   is organised under the laws of Luxembourg as a limited liability company;
*   is authorised in Luxembourg as a UCITS (Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities);
*   is an umbrella, open-ended investment company;
*   has variable capital;
*   invests in and trades in global currency markets and foreign exchange related derivatives.

The Harness Fund is a sub-fund of the Harness Investment Fund and directly invests in trades in global currency markets and foreign exchange related derivatives.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in the Harness Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  To mitigate the volatility of the liquid investments, the Harness Fund has a risk management process whereby if the fund experiences a 7.5% decline in a month or experiences a 10% decline in a rolling 12-month period, then the total value foreign currency exposure in the Harness Fund will be reduced to 20% of its net asset value. Should this reduction in the value of foreign currency exposure occur, it is expected that the normal level of this type of investment would be restored within 45 days. Failure to restore the investment to its normal levels would result in this determination ceasing to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.
3.  If the Harness Fund ceases to trade continuously in foreign exchange and foreign exchange related derivative financial instruments or there is a reduction of investment holdings in favour of an investment that provides a New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment, then this determination will cease to apply from the first day of the following Quarter unless corrective action is undertaken to increase the foreign currency exposure back to its previous level within a continuous period of 45 days.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Harness Fund" means the Harness Macro Currency Fund, which is a sub-fund of the issuer the Harness Investment Fund;

"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Foreign Investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax 2007;

"Quarter" has the meaning contained in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"The investor" means the person who has a share in the Harness Fund.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2015-2016 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for an investor in the Harness Fund that chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (GMO Systematic Global Macro Trust)
====================================================================================================================================

FDR 2015/03 covers the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (GMO Systematic Global Macro Trust).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Class A and B units in the GMO Systematic Global Macro Trust ("GMO Trust"), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

The investments held by the GMO Trust are predominantly financial arrangements. In addition, some resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in the GMO Trust back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the GMO Trust having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from its attributing interest in the GMO Trust.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to both Class A and Class B units held by New Zealand resident investors in the GMO Trust.

The GMO Trust:

*   is an Australian registered managed investment scheme;
*   issues units, denominated in AUD;
*   invests in a range of global equity, bond, currency and commodity markets with its normal investment strategy being to trade exchange traded futures, forward foreign exchange contracts, swaps, options and other derivatives using a high degree of leverage; and
*   may also hold exchange traded funds and other funds.

New Zealand resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in the GMO Trust back to New Zealand dollars.

It is an additional condition of this determination that the investment in the GMO Trust is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Foreign investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"GMO Trust" means the GMO Systematic Global Macro Trust, which is an Australian registered managed investment scheme.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the GMO Trust. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2017 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in the GMO Trust and who chooses that the determination applies for that income year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

FDR 2016/01 covers the use of the fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (H2O Global Alpha Feeder Fund (Cayman) Ltd).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the H2O Global Alpha Feeder Fund (Cayman) Limited (the "H2O Feeder Fund" ), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF). 

The investments held by the H2O Feeder Fund, a sub-fund of the H2O Global Alpha Master Fund (the "H2O Fund" ), are predominantly financial arrangements and interests in it may be hedged back to New Zealand Dollars.

Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the investors in the H2O Feeder Fund from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the H2O Feeder Fund having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangement, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for the investors in the H2O Feeder Fund to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from its attributing interest in the H2O Feeder Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to shares held in the H2O Feeder Fund, a sub-fund of the H2O Fund.

The H2O Fund:

*   is organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands as a limited liability company
*   is an umbrella, open-ended investment company
*   has variable capital
*   Invests in and trades in equity, fixed income, precious metals, commodities, credit, volatility, international currency and other markets, primarily using derivatives, over-the-counter instruments and foreign exchange forwards.

The H2O Feeder Fund is a sub-fund of the H2O Fund and indirectly invests in the above mentioned markets that H2O Fund invests in.

Interests in the H2O Feeder Fund may be hedged back to New Zealand Dollars.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in the H2O Feeder Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  The notional derivative position (being the economic value of derivatives) will be more than 20% of the total asset value of the H2O Fund. If an event occurs that the 20% test is not met, and it is not corrected in 45 days, then this determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.
3.  The H2O Fund continuously trades in equity, fixed income, precious metals, commodities, credit, volatility, international currency and other markets. If the H2O Fund ceases to do so for a continuous period of 45 days, then this determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"H2O Feeder Fund" means the H2O Global Alpha Feeder Fund (Cayman) Limited, which is a sub-fund of the issuer the H2O Global Alpha Master Fund;

"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Foreign Investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Quarter" has the meaning in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"The investor" means a person who has a share in the H2O Feeder Fund;

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the H2O Feeder Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which an investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from that interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2017 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2016 income year for an investor in the H2O Feeder Fund unless that investor chooses for this determination to apply for that year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund.
=================================================================================================

FDR 2016/02 covers the use of the fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (Astenbeck Offshore Commodity Fund II Limited).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act).  This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Act.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Astenbeck Offshore Commodity Fund II Limited (Astenbeck Feeder Fund), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

The investments held indirectly by Astenbeck Feeder Fund are predominantly financial arrangements.  In addition, some resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in Astenbeck Feeder Fund back to New Zealand dollars.  Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) could apply to prevent the investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Act.

Despite Astenbeck Feeder Fund having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument.  Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in Astenbeck Feeder Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to investments in Astenbeck Feeder Fund held by New Zealand resident investors.

Astenbeck Feeder Fund:

*   is a Cayman Islands exempted, umbrella open-ended investment company, with variable capital
*   invests all of its investible assets in Astenbeck Master Commodities Fund II Limited (Master Fund)
*   issued/issues shares, denominated in US dollars
*   through its investment in the Master Fund, invests primarily in commodities (which may include commodity futures contracts, forward contracts, swaps and options on the foregoing, collectively referred to as 'commodities'), commodity-related securities, including exchange traded funds and currencies, with an investment objective of achieving superior absolute returns

New Zealand resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in Astenbeck Feeder Fund back to New Zealand dollars.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in Astenbeck Feeder Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide investors a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  As the Master Fund is an actively managed fund, it may temporary close out its derivative investments. This may result in the Astenbeck Feeder Fund having a notional derivative position of less than 20% of its net assets value. Should this reduction in the value of derivative exposure occur, it is expected that the normal level of this type of investment would be restored within 45 days. Failure to restore the investment to its normal levels would result in this determination ceasing to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.
3.  If the Master Fund ceases to trade continuously in derivative instruments or there is a reduction of investment holdings in favour of an investment that provides a New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment, then this determination will cease to apply from the first day of the following Quarter unless corrective action is undertaken within a continuous period of 45 days.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Fair dividend rate method" means fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the ITA

"Foreign investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the ITA

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the ITA

"Astenbeck Feeder Fund" means the Astenbeck Offshore Commodity Fund II Limited, which is a Cayman Islands exempted company.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the Astenbeck Feeder Fund.  This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2017 and subsequent income years.  

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Act, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in the Astenbeck Feeder Fund and who chooses that the determination applies for that income year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may use the fair dividend rate
=============================================================================================================

FDR 2016/03 covers a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may use the fair dividend rate (Man AHL Pure Momentum Limited).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Class A shares in Man AHL Pure Momentum Limited ("AHL Limited"), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

The investments held by AHL Limited may consist predominantly of financial arrangements. In addition, some resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in AHL Limited back to New Zealand dollars.  Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

AHL Limited is a leveraged product and "the Investment Manager will seek to provide an initial target exposure of 300% of the Net Asset Value" and "the investment exposure may be increased or decreased from time to time". Leverage may arise from the use of derivatives and/or borrowing by the company or the underlying funds in which it invests.

Notwithstanding that AHL Limited may have assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from its attributing interest in AHL Limited.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to Class A shares held by New Zealand resident investors in AHL Limited.

AHL Limited:

*   is a Cayman Islands exempted company operating as an open-ended investment fund registered under the Companies Law of the Cayman Island (2013 Revision)
*   issues shares that are not denominated in New Zealand dollars
*   employs a systematic momentum strategy through investment in derivative instruments and equity or debt securities (using a high degree of leverage), to provide exposure to a range of global equity, bond, currency and commodity markets, and
*   may also hold exchange traded funds and other funds.

New Zealand resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in AHL Limited back to New Zealand dollars.

It is a condition of this determination that the investment in AHL Limited is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.

It is an additional condition of this determination that the FDR method will apply unless the absolute value of AHL Limited’s actual notional derivative exposure is 25% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days. Should this occur, the determination ceases to apply from the first day of the quarter immediately following the expiry of the 45 day period.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007

"Foreign investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007

"AHL Limited" means Man AHL Pure Momentum Limited, which is a Cayman Island exempted company operating as an open-ended investment fund registered under the Companies Law of the Cayman Island (2013 Revision).

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in AHL Limited.  This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2017 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for the 2016 income year for an investor in Class A shares in Man AHL Pure Momentum Limited unless that investor chooses that determination to apply for that income year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (BlackRock Global Funds World Bond Fund)
=================================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2016/04 covers a type of attributing interest in a FIF where the fair dividend rate method can't be used (BlackRock Global Funds World Bond Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in BlackRock Global Funds (BGF), a public limited company established under the laws of Luxembourg to which this determination applies, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors. BGF is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. Those sub-funds, whilst economically separate, do not have a separate legal personality.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in BGF each year.

The BGF World Bond Fund (the Fund) is a sub-fund of BGF which invests in a portfolio of global fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements. The Fund has on issue a number of share classes including a class of shares denominated in New Zealand dollars (the NZD share class) that provides holders of that class of shares with an interest in the pool of investments held by the Fund. Foreign currency hedging arrangements are in place, which effectively provide investors with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on the financial arrangements held by the Fund.

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would not apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method, but would apply if the Fund represented a separate foreign company and the NZD share class was the only class of shares on issue.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in NZD share class issued in the Fund, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2016-17 and subsequent income years.

### Scope of determination

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    1.  is incorporated in Luxembourg, established on 14 June 1962, and issues multiple classes of shares;
    2.  is known at the date of this determination as BlackRock Global Funds; and
    3.  is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds; and
2.  The attributing interest consists of a New Zealand dollar denominated class of share issued in the BlackRock Global Funds World Bond Fund, a sub-fund of BlackRock Global Funds which provides exposure solely to a sub-fund that invests in a portfolio predominantly of fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements; and
3.  The investment assets attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of share are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident for the purpose of eliminating any exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors.
4.  The hedging mandate for the NZD investments is to be in the range of 99.5 -100.5%.

### Conditions stipulated

This determination is issued on the condition that the hedging mandate does not change to fall outside the 80% - 125% range, being the hedging range required by NZIAS 39 for a hedging instrument to be highly effective under section EX 46(10)(b).

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act; and

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2016-2017 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in the New Zealand denominated class of share issued in the BlackRock Global Funds World Bond Fund and who chooses that this determination applies for that income year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

FDR 2016/05 covers the use of the fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (Kynikos Global Capital Partners Limited).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act). This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Act.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Kynikos Global Capital Partners Limited (the "Kynikos Fund") to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

The Kynikos Fund's investment objective is capital appreciation derived from a managed portfolio. The Fund will have the ability to trade in any market or any security in which it thinks it can trade profitably, including but not restricted to equities, preferred equities, debt, distressed debt, swaps, put options, call options, multiple option strategies, stock index futures, single stock futures and private placements.

The investments held by Kynikos Fund are predominantly financial arrangements. In addition, some resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in the Kynikos Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) could apply to prevent investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Act.

Despite the Kynikos Fund having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in the Kynikos Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to Class B and Class C share investments in the Kynikos Fund held by New Zealand resident investors.

The Kynikos Fund:

*   is organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands as a limited liability company
*   is an open-ended investment company
*   invests primarily in equity derivatives through its prime brokers.

The determination is subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in Kynikos Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide investors a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  As it is an actively managed fund, the Kynikos Fund may temporarily close out its derivative investments. This may result in the Kynikos Fund having a notional derivative position of less than 20% of its net assets value (NAV).  
      
    Should this reduction in the value of derivative exposure occur, it is expected that the level of NAV of at least 20% would be restored within 45 days. Failure to restore the investment to this level would result in this determination ceasing to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.
3.  If the Kynikos Fund ceases to trade continuously in derivative instruments or there is a reduction of investment holdings in favour of an investment that provides a New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment, then this determination will cease to apply from the first day of the following Quarter unless corrective action is undertaken within a continuous period of 45 days.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"Kynikos Fund" means the Kynikos Global Capital Partners Limited;

"Fair dividend rate method" means fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Foreign investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"The investor" means the person who has a share in the Kynikos Fund.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the Kynikos Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2016 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Act, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in the Kynikos Fund and who chooses that the determination applies for that income year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

FDR 2016/06 covers the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (True Partners Fund).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act).  This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Act.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the True Partners Fund are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF).

Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent the investor from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the True Partners Fund having assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the potential for New Zealand investors to effectively hedge their investments in the True Partners Fund to New Zealand dollar values, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for an investor to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from its attributing interest in the True Partners Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to shares held in the True Partners Fund.

The True Partners Fund:

*   is organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands as a limited liability company
*   invests primarily in derivatives.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in the True Partners Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  As it is an actively managed fund, the True Partners Fund may temporarily close out its derivative investments. This may result in the True Partners Fund having a notional derivative position of less than 20% of its net asset value. Should this reduction in the value of derivative exposure occur, it is expected that the level of net asset value of at least 20% would be restored within 45 days. Failure to restore the investment to its normal levels would result in this determination ceasing to apply from the first day of the following quarter.
3.  If the True Partners Fund ceases to trade continuously in derivative instruments or there is a reduction of investment holdings in favour of an investment that provides a New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment, then this determination will cease to apply from the first day of the following quarter unless corrective action is undertaken to increase the foreign currency exposure back to its previous level within a continuous period of 45 days.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

"True Partners Fund" means the True Partners Fund

"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007

"Foreign investment fund" means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007

"The investor" means the person who has a share in the True Partners Fund.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the True Partners Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which an investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2017 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Act, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in the True Partners Fund and who chooses that the determination applies for that income year.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================

FDR 2016/07 covers the use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a FIF (K2 Alternative Strategies NZ Portfolio).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act). This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Act.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Class A shares in the K2 Alternative Strategies NZ Portfolio Limited (“K2”), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in K2 each year.

K2 invests, directly and indirectly (via a broadly diversified portfolio of underlying hedge funds) in a mix of asset types, including cash, equities, debt securities and derivatives. Its investment objective provides exposure to equity, credit, currency and commodity markets. K2 enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to provide investors with New Zealand dollar denominated exposure.

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) could potentially apply to prevent investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Act.

Notwithstanding that K2 may have assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of any hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in K2.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to Class A share investments in K2 held by New Zealand resident investors.

K2 Alternative Strategies NZ Portfolio Limited:

*   is a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands;
*   issues Class A shares, which are denominated in New Zealand dollars;
*   invests in underlying assets predominantly consisting of cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, equity and debt securities, which provide exposure to a range of equity, credit, currency and commodity markets.

The investment in the Class A shares are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by K2 for the purposes of mitigating exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors.

These currency hedging arrangements are targeted to be highly effective (80-125%).

The determination is subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in K2 is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide investors a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  In the event K2 directly holds equities offering a fixed rate of return or financial arrangements that provide funds to another person of an amount that is equal to or greater than 80% of K2’s net asset value (NAV), it is expected that the level of such financial arrangements will be restored within 45 days (to less than 80%). Failure to restore the investment to this level would result in this determination ceasing to apply from the first day of the following Quarter.
3.  K2 must be a foreign PIE equivalent in terms of section HM 3 of the ITA at all times. In the event that K2 ceases to meet the requirements set out in section HM 3 at the end of two consecutive quarters, this determination will cease to apply from the first day of the following quarter.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Controlled foreign company” means controlled foreign company under section EX 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Fair dividend rate method” means fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Financial arrangement” means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Foreign PIE equivalent” means foreign PIE equivalent as defined under section HM 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“K2” means K2 Alternative Strategies NZ Portfolio Limited;

“PIE” means a portfolio investment entity as set out in subpart HM of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“The investor” means the person who has a share in K2.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in K2. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2017 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Act, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in K2 and who chooses that the determination applies for that income year.

Dated this 22nd day of December 2016.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Russell Investment Company plc: NZDH-A-DURH class shares)
===================================================================================================================================================================================

FDR 2017/01 covers a type of attributing interest in a FIF for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Russell Investment Co plc).

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Russell Investment Company plc (RIC), an Irish public limited company to which this determination applies, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) for New Zealand resident investors. RIC is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. Those sub-funds do not have a separate legal personality under Irish law.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in RIC each year.

The Russell Global Bond Fund (RGBF) is a sub-fund of RIC which invests in a portfolio of transferable debt instruments. RIC issues a class of shares denominated in New Zealand dollars (NZDH-A-DURH shares) that provide holders of that class of shares with an interest in the pool of investments held by the RGBF. RIC undertakes hedging for NZDH-A-DURH shares, with the intention that this arrangement ensures that the New Zealand dollar value of that class of shares is unaffected by foreign exchange movements.

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would not apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method, but would apply if the RGBF represented a separate foreign company and the NZDH-A-DURH share class was the only class of shares on issue.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in NZDH-A-DURH shares issued by RIC and the share class, which has a value in New Zealand dollars, is linked to an interest in a pool of debt securities held by RGBF and effectively hedged against foreign currency movements by RIC, I consider that it is appropriate for those holdings in RIC to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2017 and subsequent income years.

### Scope of determination

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The non-resident issuer:

1.  is an Irish public limited company established on 31 March 1994 that issues multiple classes of shares;
2.  is known at the date of this determination as Russell Investment Company plc; and
3.  is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds; and

2.  The attributing interest consists of a New Zealand dollar denominated class of shares, NZDH-A-DURH, issued by that non-resident that provides exposure solely to a sub-fund that predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) holds transferrable debt instruments and
3.  The investment assets attributable to NZDH-A-DURH shares are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident for the purpose of eliminating any exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Financial arrangement” means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Act;

“Non-resident” means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act; and

“The Act” means the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2017 income year and subsequent income years.  However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in NZDH-A-DURH shares in RIC and who chooses that this determination applies for that income year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Russell Investment Company plc: NZDH-A class shares)
==============================================================================================================================================================================

Any investment made by a New Zealand resident investor in the NZDH-A class of shares in the Global High Yield Fund, a sub-fund of Russell Investment Company plc, is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from the interest for the 2019 and subsequent years.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Russell Investment Company plc (“RIC”), an Irish public limited company, to which this determination applies, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors. RIC is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. Those sub-funds do not have a separate legal personality under Irish law.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in RIC each year.

The Global High Yield Fund (“GHY Fund”) is a sub-fund of RIC which invests in a portfolio of corporate debt instruments. RIC issues a class of shares denominated in New Zealand dollars (“NZDH-A shares”) that provide holders of that class of shares with an interest in the pool of investments held by the GHY Fund. RIC undertakes hedging for NZDH-A shares, with the intention that this arrangement ensures the New Zealand dollar value of that class of shares is unaffected by foreign exchange movements.

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (“FDR”) method, but would apply if the GHY Fund represented a separate foreign company and the NZDH-A share class was the only class of shares on issue.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in NZDH-A shares issued by RIC and the share class, which has a value in New Zealand dollars, is linked to an interest in the GHY Fund that invests predominantly in corporate debt instruments that are highly effectively hedged against foreign currency movements, I consider that it is appropriate for investors holding those interests in RIC to be excluded from using the FDR method for the 2019 and subsequent income years.

### Scope of determination

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

*   The non-resident issuer:
    *   is an Irish public limited company established on 31 March 1994 that issues multiple classes of shares; and
    *   is known at the date of this determination as Russell Investment Company plc; and
    *   is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds; and
*   The attributing interest consists of a New Zealand dollar denominated class of shares, NZDH-A, issued by that non-resident that provides exposure solely to the GHY Fund that predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) holds corporate debt instruments; and
*   The investment assets attributable to NZDH-A shares are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident for the purpose of eliminating exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors on a highly effective basis.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section EX 44 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and

“Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and

“Non-resident” means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2019 and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination also applies for an income year beginning before the date of this determination for a person who invests in the NZDH-A class of shares in the GHY Fund and who chooses that the determination applies for that income year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method (Units in the Two Trees Global Macro Fund)
===============================================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in units in the Two Trees Global Macro Fund is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income from the interest.

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in the Two Trees Global Macro Fund ("Two Trees Fund"), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") for New Zealand resident investors.

The investments held by the Two Trees Fund may consist predominantly of financial arrangements providing funds to a person. In addition, some investors may hedge their attributing interests in the Two Trees Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent those investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Notwithstanding that the Two Trees Fund may have assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and the presence of the hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in the Two Trees Fund.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to units held by New Zealand resident investors in the Two Trees Fund.

New Zealand resident investors may hedge their attributing interests back to New Zealand dollars.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in the Two Trees Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  The absolute value of the Two Trees Fund's notional derivative exposure must not fall to 20% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days. Should this occur, the determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following quarter.

Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (ISAM Systematic Trend – Class Q shares)
=========================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend, is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income from the interest.

[TIB Volume 32 No 1 February 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no1)

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend, to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund for New Zealand resident investors.

ISAM Systematic Trend holds directly or indirectly assets of which 80% or more are financial arrangements providing funds to a person. In addition, some New Zealand resident investors hedge their attributing interests in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would apply to prevent those investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from their attributing interests in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend. Although ISAM Systematic Trend directly or indirectly invests in assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and New Zealand resident investors may enter into New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not similar to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt investment.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to Class Q shares held by New Zealand resident investors in ISAM Systematic Trend.

The ISAM Systematic Trend’s investment objective is to grow the value of its assets, providing returns with low correlations to the stock and bond markets through the implementation of systematic trading models. ISAM Systematic Trend achieves its investment objectives by primarily investing in ISAM Systematic Trend Master. ISAM Systematic Trend Master trades primarily in global futures, swaps and forward contracts including with respect to stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy commodities, agriculture and metals, as well as in over-the-counter spot foreign exchange and metals transactions.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend is not part of an overall arrangement that provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  The absolute value of ISAM Systematic Trend’s notional derivative exposure must not fall to 20% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days. Should this occur, the determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following quarter.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“ISAM Systematic Trend” means a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on 9 February 2010 known at the date of this determination as ISAM Systematic Trend;

“ISAM Systematic Trend Master” means a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on 9 February 2010 known at the date of this determination as ISAM Systematic Master; and

“The investor” means the person who has a share in ISAM Systematic Trend.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund, being a direct income interest in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2020 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination apply for the income year.

Dated this 29th day of November 2019.
