It is divided into the following parts: • changes to the treatment and determination of dividends; • the determination of ownership rules; • changes to the loss carry forward and grouping rules and changes to the carry forward of credits in imputation credit accounts; • the introduction of a new tax recovery provision - section 276; and • the introduction of a qualifying company regime. The part relating to dividends covers not only technical amendments to the definition but also the conse- quences of treating cash and non-cash dividends in a similar fashion. Moreover, it discusses the spe- cific temporary exemptions to the general removal of the intercorporate dividend exemption. The new ownership tests of voting interest and market value interest provide a measure of a person’s interest in a company. These interest tests are relevant in a number of regimes, such as the loss carry forward and grouping provisions, imputation credit carry forward provisions, tax recovery, and the qualifying company regime. The new carry forward and grouping of loss provisions require 49% continuity of shareholding for the carry forward of losses and 66% commonality of shareholding for the grouping of losses. New tracing requirements which should ease compliance concerns considerably are introduced. The credit continu- ity provisions have also been amended to reflect the aggregation of minimum voting and minimum market value interests. Deficiencies existing under the previous credit continuity provisions have been corrected and the continuity threshold has been reduced from 75% to 66%. The tax recovery provision - section 276 will now enable Inland Revenue to seek recovery of tax from both the directors and shareholders of a company. Moreover, these directors and shareholders must have been present at the time the arrangement (which left the company unable to met its tax liabilities) was entered into. To this extent, the provision is better targeted. The qualifying company regime was first discussed in the Valabh Committee’s discussion document on “Distributions from Companies” in November 1990. The regime is targeted at closely held companies and essentially treats the company and its shareholders as one entity in a fashion more in line with the tax treatment of partnerships. Note that section references in italics refer to the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992. Other sec- tion references are to the Income Tax Act 1976. Amending legislation for the livestock and depreciation regimes was also passed in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1992. These and other miscellaneous items will be covered in detail in a later TIB. 4 Part I - Dividends Introduction The Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992 makes many changes to the definition of “dividends” and to dividend related sections of the Income Tax Act 1976. This Part of the TIB covers the following areas: Technical amendments to the definition of bonus issue dividend contained in sections 3, 4 and 4A of the Act Many of these changes have been made in response to the recommendations of the Valabh Consultative Committee which are contained in its two Reports on the Taxation of Distributions from Companies, re- leased in November 1990 and July 1991. Other amendments are required to take account of the re- moval of the intercorporate dividend exemption from 1 April 1992. Amendments to section 63 of the Act which provides exemptions for companies from the taxation of dividends The general intercorporate dividend exemption has been removed with effect from 1 April 1992. How- ever, temporary exemptions have been inserted in section 63 for dividends paid between members of a specified group, and for redemptions of units and interests from certain unit trusts and group invest- ment funds. Changes to resident withholding tax, fringe benefit tax and imputation consequent upon removal of the intercorporate dividend exemption From 1 April cash and non-cash dividends are treated alike - that is, they may have imputation credits attached and are taxable to the recipient. The above regimes have been amended to reflect this. Section 3 - Bonus Issues Summary • Previous section 3 is replaced • Structural changes are made • Definition of “ten year bonus issue” is inserted Section 3 replaces the existing definition of “bonus issue” in section 3. The replacement takes effect from 1 April 1992. Most of the change is structural. All definitions re- lating to bonus issues - for example, “taxable bonus issue” and “non-taxable bonus issue” - now appear in section 3(1). They previously were contained in section 4(3). The right of election (as to whether a bonus issue is taxable or non-taxable) now in section 3(3) appeared previously in section 4(5). Amounts previously excluded from definition of bonus issue The definition of “bonus issue” has been expanded to clarify that bonus issues made before 20 August 1985 from capital gains and bonus issues from asset revaluation reserves before 16 December 1983, which were excluded from the definition of “bonus issues” at the time, are not bonus issues for the pur- poses of the Act. Amounts bonus issued from capital gains between 1985-88 A definition of “ten year bonus issue” has been in- serted into section 3(1). The definition refers to bo- nus issues which were subject to the 10 year rule - i.e. bonus issues made between 31 March 1982 and 1 Oc- tober 1988. Amounts bonus issued during this time could be distributed tax free after 10 years. The definition was inserted as a result of the Valabh Committee recommendation that, where bonus is- sues were made from capital gains between 20 Au- gust 1985 and 1 October 1988, the amount bonus is- sued should be tax free on winding up regardless of whether the 10 year period had expired. This is be- cause capital gains are tax exempt on distribution in a winding up. The Valabh Committee recommended that this should be effective from the date of assent of the Bill. However, this has been changed to 30 September 1991. The substantive change is effected in section 4A(1)(c), 4A(2) and 4A(2A). Application Date The new section 3 comes into effect on 1 April 1992. However, section 5(15) retrospectively applies the definition of “ten year bonus issue” where it is used in those provisions of section 4A which apply from the 1988/89 income year (in particular, section 4A(1)(c)). In substance, this is only for the period from 30 September 1991 to 1 April 1992. Section 2 - Definitions Definition of “non-cash dividend” Section 2(7) replaces the section 2 definition of “non- cash dividend”. The substantial definition is now in section 4(3) and a cross reference to that definition appears in section 2. Section 2(9) inserts into section 2 a cross reference to the definition of “unit trust” in section 211. References to unit trusts appear in amendments to section 63 5 Section 4 - Amendment of Dividend Definition Summary • Shareholder capacity test is inserted • Credit to shareholder’s account is a cash dividend • Retained earnings test in 4(1)(ba) and (e) is deleted • Dividend paid to associate of shareholder is de- rived by associate • Dividends arising from use of company property are paid up to 6 months after end of income year of payer • Companies may use market rate of interest in de- termining dividend arising from intercorporate loans • Shareholder may retrospectively credit salary, in- terest and dividends to eliminate debit in share- holder current account • Low-compliance method of calculating dividends arising in relation to corporate shareholder current account is inserted Section 4 amends section 4 of the Act, which provides a list of items which are included in the definition of “dividend”. Shareholder capacity test A shareholder capacity test has been inserted into the opening words of section 4(1). To be a dividend, an amount must be received by a shareholder in that capacity. New subsection 4(1A) provides that, in determining whether any payment is made by a company having regard to that person’s capacity as a shareholder in the company, the fact that the payment is made on terms which differ from those on which the company would make any similar payment to someone who was not a shareholder is indicative of the fact that the payment is made having regard to the person’s ca- pacity as shareholder. However, other factors might also indicate that an amount is received in a share- holder capacity. So, for example, where a corporate shareholder re- ceives from a company a trading credit which is ad- vanced to all those who trade with the company, the benefit does not pass to the shareholder by virtue of its shareholding. Inland Revenue will issue a more detailed TIB item on the circumstances in which a benefit is received by virtue of shareholder capacity. Credits to shareholder accounts are cash dividends Section 4(1)(b) amends section 4(1), clarifying that paragraph (a) applies to monetary amounts includ- ing credits to shareholder accounts. This means that such credits are cash dividends for the purposes of the qualifying company regime and resident with- holding tax (refer to the definition of "non-cash divi- dend"). This does not represent any change but is merely for the purposes of clarification. Loans to shareholders Section 4(1)(c) deletes section 4(1)(b) with effect from 1 October 1989. That paragraph provided for the Commissioner to deem the principal of a loan to a shareholder to be a dividend where it was not a bona fide loan. This paragraph is now redundant: any concessional interest element of a loan is a dividend under paragraph (e) and any forgiveness of the loan is a dividend under paragraph (ba). Deletion of retained earnings test in section 4(1)(ba) and (e) Section 4(1)(d) and (e) delete the “retained earnings” test from paragraphs (ba) and (e), as recommended by the Valabh Committee. From 1 April 1992, it will no longer be necessary for a company to have prof- its for a distribution from that company to be a divi- dend. Notional distributions from producer boards and co-operative companies Section 4(1)(f) makes no substantive change to the dividend definition. Notional distributions made under sections 394U and 394ZA are already deemed to be dividends. It is considered helpful to include in section 4(1) all items which are deemed to be divi- dends under other provisions of the Act. Group Investment Funds Section 4(2) amends provisions relating to group in- vestment funds, the taxation of which is covered by section 211A of the Act. They are taxed as compa- nies in relation to category A income. This amend- ment clarifies that section 4(2)(b) applies only to pay- ments of category A income. Definitions Section 4(3) inserts section 4(3) which provides defi- nitions of terms used in the dividend provisions. The definition of “bonus issue” is a cross reference to the section 3 definition. “Non-cash dividend” is defined, which is relevant for the purposes of resident and non-resident with- holding tax calculations and the qualifying company regime. A credit to a shareholder’s account is ex- cluded from the definition of non-cash dividend. Value of 4(1)(e) benefits and election for bonus issues Section 4(4) repeals section 4(4)(b), which provided valuation rules in relation to section 4(1)(e) dividends (use of company property). These have been incor- porated into the valuation provisions of section 4(10). 6 Section 4(5) has also been repealed because the right to elect whether bonus issues are taxable is now con- tained in section 3. Dividend paid to associate of shareholder derived by associate Section 4(5) amends section 4(7), enacting the Valabh Committee recommendation that, where an amount is paid to an associate of a shareholder, a dividend arises to the associate and not to the shareholder. Repayment of loan to shareholder Section 4(6) amends section 4(8), which provides for amendment of an assessment where a shareholder who has received a loan from a company which has been deemed to constitute a dividend repays the loan. The subsection has been amended as a result of several changes which have occurred - the repeal of paragraph 4(1)(b), the introduction of paragraph 4(1)(ba) and the imposition of fringe benefit tax on non-cash dividends prior to 1 April 1992. It is now also obligatory on the Commissioner to amend an assessment where he is informed of the repayment of the loan. The amendment is effective from 1 October 1989 unless the Commissioner has amended an assess- ment of tax or fringe benefit tax between that date and the date of assent of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992. This operates to ensure that any amendment of an assessment by the Commissioner during that period stands. Payment and valuation of dividends arising from use of company property Section 4(7) replaces the previous section 4(10), which provided valuation rules in relation to dividends arising from loans to shareholders. The new section 4(10) has been expanded to apply to all benefits passing under section 4(1)(e), not just concessional interest loans. It is now clear, in section 4(10)(a), that such divi- dends are paid to, and derived by, shareholders for the purposes of the resident and non-resident with- holding tax and dividend withholding payment re- gimes. It has been argued in the past that it is not clear that such dividends are “paid” for the purposes of the non-resident withholding tax and foreign divi- dend withholding payment regimes. • Section 4(1)(e) dividends paid up to 6 months after income year of payer Section 4(1)(e) dividends are calculated quarterly (to mesh with the valuation rules provided in the fringe benefit tax regime) but are paid and derived on the date the shareholder is notified of the amount of the dividend or, at the latest, 6 months after the end of the income year of the paying company. This is to ease compliance costs for companies. The concession does not apply for the purposes of the qualifying company regime. Companies that wish to take advantage of the 1 year exemption for dividends paid between companies in specified groups in section 63(2F) may prefer to de- rive such dividends at the end of the income year of the paying company. • Valuation of dividends arising from use of prop- erty As section 4(10) now applies to all types of section 4(1)(e) dividend, a general valuation rule has been inserted into paragraph 4(10)(b). This applies to divi- dends arising from the use of company property, except the granting of a loan to a shareholder. For example, where the shareholder (who is not an employee) has free use of a house owned by the com- pany, the dividend arising will be calculated under section 336O(6) - the market rent for that property. (Use of a house is not generally covered by fringe benefit tax, but by section 72. However, paragraph (b) applies notwithstanding anything contained in the section 336N(1) definition of fringe benefit.) Valuation of dividends arising from concessional interest loans Section 4(10)(c) provides that as a general rule, where there is a concessional interest rate loan, the amount of the dividend is the difference between the rate of interest which applies to the loan under subsection 4(11), calculated on a daily basis, and the amount payable by the shareholder during the quarter. Subsection 4(11) is new and provides the benchmark for calculating the amount of dividend arising where there is a concessional interest loan. Section 4(11)(a)(i) provides that where the loan is to an individual shareholder, the benchmark against which to calculate the amount of dividend arising is the prescribed rate of interest applying for valuation of concessional interest loans under the fringe ben- efit tax regime. This is also the rate applicable where the loan is to a corporate shareholder and the lender elects that the FBT rate will apply. In practice, because a concessional interest loan will generally be advanced by a company to a corporate shareholder where there is a close association between the two, the share- holder will be able to influence this election. Section 4(11)(a)(ii) provides that where the loan is payable in a currency other than NZ currency, the benchmark rate is the rate the Commissioner has prescribed for the currency for the quarter. This is obligatory for an individual shareholder (where the Commissioner has prescribed a rate), but a company advancing a loan to a corporate shareholder may elect to apply this rate. The Commissioner has not to date prescribed any rate under this paragraph. 7 Section 4(11)(a)(iii) effectively provides that the benchmark in relation to a loan to a corporate share- holder is a market rate of interest unless the lender elects to apply the rates referred to above. Retrospective crediting of shareholder current account to eliminate loan Section 4(11)(b) applies to shareholder current ac- counts and mirrors section 336O(2A), which applies to shareholder/employees. Where a shareholder’s current account is in debit during a year and the shareholder subsequently has credited to the account dividends (which will be cash dividends) or interest which are not resident with- holding income and are assessable income of the shareholder in that year, the amounts are credited from the beginning of the year or, if later, the date the account went into debit. This provides a mechanism to eliminate any divi- dend arising under a shareholder current account where there is no loss to the revenue in so doing. This will be of advantage to corporate shareholders, because intercorporate shareholder current accounts will generally operate only in relation to companies within a group and dividends paid within a group are not resident withholding income (section 327B(2)(b)(via)). Example Co. A Co. D Co. B Co. B is 90% owned by Co.. A. Co. A has a share- holder current account with Co. B. No interest is charged on the account and it has had a $1000 debit balance from 1 April 1992. In August 1992, Co. B pays a cash dividend of $1000 to Co. A by crediting its shareholder cur- rent account. That dividend has no imputation credits attached. It is not resident withholding income and is returned by Co. A in same year. The $1000 is deemed to have been applied in re- payment of the loan from the beginning of the year. No section 4 (1)(e) dividend arises. Low-compliance method of calculating balance in corporate shareholder current account New section 4(11)(c) provides a mechanism for cal- culating the dividend arising from an inter-corporate current account advance which should reduce com- pliance costs for companies. The general rule for calculating the dividend arising from a concessional interest loan is set out in section 4(10)(c). That section requires calculation of the daily balance owing under the loan. This concessional rule provides that, for companies operating a shareholder current account, the com- pany advancing loans under that account may elect that the daily balance of the loan is the average of the outstanding balance of the loan at the end of each month in the year. Alternatively, it can elect that the daily balance is the average of the balances at the beginning and end of the income year. This mechanism can only be used, however, where the difference between the dividend which would be calculated under the general rule requiring the cal- culation of actual daily balances and the dividend calculated under this concession is 30% or less. Benefit arising from use of company property by corporate associate of shareholder excluded from dividend definition for 1 year Section 4(7) also inserts a new subsection (12) into section 4. It provides that, from 1 April 1992 until 1 April 1993, the use of a proprietary company’s property by a corporate associate of a shareholder of the company will not constitute a dividend under section 4(1)(l). This will chiefly apply to remove from the scope of the dividend definition for one year the concessional interest element of loans provided by a parent to a subsidiary, or between sister companies. However, new section 4(12) will also cover use of any other property of the company by the associate. As a result, resident and non-resident withholding tax and foreign dividend withholding payment are not payable on such benefits passing to associates during that period. This rule only applies where the property is not made available to the associate in lieu of the company pro- viding a benefit to the shareholder. Transitional: Dividends paid to an associate of a shareholder between 1 April 1988 and 31 March 1992 Section 4(5) replaces the previous section 4(7), under which dividends paid by a proprietary company to an associate of a shareholder were deemed to be derived by the shareholder. The Valabh Committee recommended that from 1 April 1992 such dividends be derived by the associate. In addition, they recommended that where divi- dends were paid to associates between 1 April 1988 and 31 March 1992, taxpayers could in effect elect whether the dividend would be derived by the share- holder or associate. In order to avoid a formal election, section 4(11) pro- vides that, where a dividend was paid to an associ- ate during that period, the associate is deemed to derive the dividend in two circumstances: a) where the associate includes the dividend in as- sessable income for the year the dividend was de- rived; 8 • “returned capital amount” • “returned share premium amount” and • “excess return amount” where the company is winding up. These terms are defined in section 4A(2A). The definition of these terms refers to the definition of “shares of the same class” in section 4A(2) and it is helpful to consider first when shares are of the same class. Shares of the same class Two shares are of the same class when they carry : • the same right to exercise voting power in relation to the company's constitution, distributions, vari- ation in capital and election of directors; and • the right to the same amount per share of distribu- tions of profits, assets, paid up capital and quali- fying share premium. Example 1: If one share has $1 paid up capital, another has $2 paid up, and the company is re- quired to repay those differing amounts to the respective holders of the shares, the shares are in different classes. Example 2: Two shares have capital of $1 paid up. The premium paid on one is $0-50 and the other $1-00, but the holders are each entitled to receive the return of $0-75 of share premium. The shares are in the same class. Under paragraph (c), two shares are also of the same class where they have the same rights set out above but where the amount per share paid on issue is the same and that amount differs from the amount paid on issue of other shares in the company. This re- quires a company to be able to identify and distin- guish those shares from other shares in the company and to elect that those shares are in the same class. b) where the dividend would have been exempt from income tax and where there was no require- ment to deduct dividend withholding payment from that dividend. Example A Co. B Co. C A is a shareholder (but is not an employee) of Co. B, which in December 1990 advanced a low in- terest loan to its subsidiary Co. C. Both compa- nies are resident in New Zealand. The concessional interest element of a loan advanced to a shareholder is a dividend under section 4(1)(e). Where it is advanced to an associate of a shareholder, it is a dividend under s4(1)(l). Section 4(11) provides that, in this situation, that dividend is derived by Co. C. Until 31 March 1993, such dividends derived by Co. C are ex- empt from tax. Accordingly by virtue of section 4(11), Co. C (and not A) would be deemed to derive the dividend income. No election would need to be made by Co. C. Section 5 - Exclusions from the Definition of Dividend Section 5 makes amendments to section 4A, which excludes items from the definition of dividend. Summary • Previous paragraphs 4A(1)(c) to (g) (tax free re- turns on redemption of shares) are amalgamated into new 4A(1)(c) • Amounts bonus issued from capital gains between 20 August 1985 and 1 October 1988 are tax free on winding up from 30 September 1991 • Capital gain amounts retain character when distrib- uted to resident corporate shareholders on wind- ing up Section 5(1) repeals section 4A(1)(b) with effect from the 1988/89 income year. That paragraph only ap- plied to distributions made between 1 April 1988 and 1 October 1988. In relation to distributions made be- tween the 1 April 1988 and 1 October 1988, the ex- emption provided by this paragraph is encompassed in new section 4A(1)(c). Amounts which are tax free on redemption of shares Section 5(2) amalgamates previous paragraphs (c) to (g) of section 4A(1), all of which relate to the tax free element of a dividend on full or partial winding up. The new section 4A(1)(c) is backdated to the 1988/ 89 income year unless a taxpayer elects otherwise. This is because it remedies certain defects in the pre- vious provisions. It is considered that taxpayers would prefer the retrospective change. However, for those who may be penalised by this, a right of election to apply the previous provisions is available. Paragraph 4A(1)(c) lists those amounts which may be returned tax free on the redemption or cancellation of a share, subject to the Commissioner being satis- fied redemption is not in lieu of the payment of a dividend. The tax free amounts are the: 9 Example: A company has the following shares: 1 share $1-00 capital fully paid, $1-00 premium paid to $0-50 1 share $1-00 capital fully paid, $1-00 premium fully paid. In terms of the constitution, both shares carry the right to distributions of the same premium. However, the company can identify and distin- guish the two shares, and the holders of them, and elects that they will be in separate classes. The two shares are then treated as shares of dif- ferent classes. Returned capital amount The returned capital amount (defined in section 4A(2A)) is in effect: - all amounts of capital ever paid up on shares of the same class as those being redeemed, pro-rated across - the total number of shares of that class ever issued prior to the redemption. This does not include “non-qualifying capital” (de- fined in section 4A(2)), which is essentially 10 year bonus issues which are still serving time and non taxable bonus issues. These amounts are not re- turned tax free on redemption of shares during the life of the company. However, on winding up of the company, amounts bonus issued from capital gains and qualifying share premiums may be returned tax free. This applies to 10 year bonus issues, only after 30 September 1991. Returned share premium amount This is also defined in section 4A(2A). It is in effect: • the total amount of qualifying share premium paid prior to the redemption in relation to shares of that class which have ever been issued (i.e. the class re- ferred to above in the definition of returned capi- tal amount), pro-rated across • the number of shares in that class. The formula refers to “the lesser of the amount deb- ited to the company’s share premium account in re- spect of the redemption” and the amount calculated as described above. This is a mechanism for ensur- ing that a distribution must be made from the com- pany’s share premium account in order for the dis- tribution to be tax free. “Qualifying share premium” is defined in section 4A(2) and is in the same terms as the previous sec- tion 4A(1)(e). It applies to any premium paid that was credited to a share premium account and did not arise from the issue of shares in one company as con- sideration for the acquisition of shares in another company. Example Class A shares - 10 shares $1-00 capital fully paid $0-50 premium fully paid. Class B shares - 10 shares $1-00 capital fully paid $1-00 premium fully paid. (The shares carry the right to different amounts of premium on redemption and therefore are in two classes). Distribution to each shareholder in respect of • class A shares is $1-50 per share • class B shares is $2-00 per share Amount which may be returned tax free per share: Returned capital amount - class A - $10/10 = $1 class B - $10/10 = $1 Returned share premium amount - class A - $5/10 = $0-50 class B - $10/10 = $1-00 Excess return amount This amount is tax free only on winding up of the company. The excess return amount is: The amount per share received by a shareholder on winding up, less returned capital and share pre- mium amounts, multiplied by the formula set out in the definition. The formula is in effect capital gain amounts distrib- uted to shareholders on winding up, together with unallocated share premium, divided by the total amount received by shareholders on winding up, less returned paid up capital and returned share pre- mium amounts. It is essentially the shareholder’s share of capital gains and capital assets distributed on winding up. Unallocated share premium is included in the amount which is tax free under this head. Very lit- tle share premium should fall into this category - possibly only in the very rare event that a class has been redeemed but share premium belonging to that class has not been returned. Example Company A has two shareholders, B and C. B has 10 $1 shares paid up with $0-50 premium fully paid C has 10 $1 shares paid up with $1-00 premium fully paid (Cont'd on Page 10) 10 $60 - $1.50 x = $25 The shares do not carry the same rights to return of premium and therefore are in different classes. Reserves of company A at the time of winding up are: $ 20paid up capital 15share premium 500capital gains 670retained earnings 1,205 It has $330 in its imputation credit account. This example sets out the amount which is an assessable dividend in the hands of B. On winding up B receives per share 1.00p.u.c. 0.50premium 25.00capital gains 33.50retained earnings 60.00 $16-50 imputation credits are attached to the divi- dend. Amounts which are not an assessable dividend per share: 1. returned capital amount - $10 10 2. returned share premium amount - $5 10 3. excess return amount - $500 $1205 - $15 - $20 B therefore receives dividend income of $50.00 ($33.50 plus $16.50 imputation credits). No tax is payable by a shareholder on a .33 rate. Benefits paid to shareholder/employees not a dividend Section 5(3) amends section 4A(1)(i), which takes out of the dividend definition benefits paid to share- holder/employees. This removes any exposure to double taxation which may occur because a benefit is taxable both as a dividend and under the fringe benefit tax regime. The scope of the paragraph has been extended to cover all benefits which could be dividends. So, for example, where a benefit is provided to an associ- ate of a shareholder/employee, and is subject to FBT, it is not a dividend. This amendment is retrospec- tive to the 1988/89 income year. Use of property not a dividend if included in income under section 72 Section 5(4) inserts into section 4A(1) a new para- graph, (ia), which prevents double taxation where a benefit, being use of a house, is taxed to a share- holder under section 72. This may occur where the shareholder is also an employee of the company pro- viding the house. This amendment is also retrospec- tive to the 1988/89 income year. Capital gain amount retains character when distributed to corporate shareholder on winding up Section 5(6) ensures that, where amounts which are capital gains in the hands of a company which is winding up are distributed to a corporate share- holder, they retain their character. This change does not apply where the recipient is non-resident - see the section 309(2) definition of “dividend”. Definition of “specified company” Section 5(8)provides that the definition of “speci- fied company” is in substance the same as the previ- ous definition. It is used in the definition of dividend in section 309(2). No double taxation of non-qualifying amounts on distribution Section 5(9), apart from inserting the definitions of terms used in section 4A(1)(c), replaces the previous section 4A(3) with one which takes account of the new form of section 4A(1)(c). There is no change in substance. Payment for shares in foreign currency Section 5(9) also inserts a new subsection, (3A), into section 4A. It clarifies that where paid up capital or premium was paid in a foreign currency on the issue of shares, the amount paid is deemed to be equal to the amount that would have been paid in New Zea- land dollars to make the payment of premium or paid up capital in foreign currency if payment was made on the date of redemption. Example A NZ shareholder paid $NZ300 in March 1989 to pay up capital of $A200 in relation to shares in an Australian company. The shares are re- deemed in January 1993, by which stage $A200 = $NZ350. In calculating the amount which is not a dividend on redemption, the amount paid to the company to pay up the shares is deemed to be $NZ350. (From Page 9) = $1 = $0.50 11 ously provided that, in determining the amount of capital gain which is not a dividend on winding up, capital gains are reduced by capital losses arising in the same year, or a year subsequent to that, in which the capital gain arose. Section 4A(11) now also provides that capital losses which arise in or after the 1992-93 year, in a year prior to that in which the capital gain arose, will also reduce the capital gain amount. Changes consequential upon amalg- amation of previous section 4A(1)(c) - (g) Section 5(10) makes changes in section 4A(6) and (7) to refer to the new section 4A(1)(c). Capital losses reduce capital gains available for tax-free distribution on winding up Section 5(11) amends section 4A(11), which previ- Section 6 - Use of the term Dividends This section inserts into the Act a section 4B which sets out the meaning of the term “dividend” as it is used in different sections of the Act, or which pro- vides a cross reference to the section in which the section 4 definition is modified. Those provisions in the now repealed section 394ZC have been moved to subsections 4B(1) and (2). Section 9 - Intercorporate Dividend Exemption Summary • A 2 year exemption is provided for dividends paid on pre-Budget redeemable preference shares • There is a 1 year exemption for dividends paid between members of a specified group • A 1 year exemption is provided for dividends aris- ing on redemption of units in certain unit trusts Section 9 makes several amendments to section 63 of the Act. Redeemable preference shares Two amendments have been made to provisions in- serted into section 63 shortly after the 1991 Budget. Under those provisions - section 63(2C) and (2D) - dividends paid on redeemable preference shares is- sued after the 1991 Budget are taxable. Section 9(1) substitutes the words “the person de- riving the dividend” for “any person” in section 63(2C)(b)(i). This is to clarify that where a dividend is paid after the 1991 Budget to a shareholder of a share issued pre-Budget and the share is subse- quently sold, the dividend is not taxable. Section 9(2) amends subsection 63(2D) which defines fixed rate share. Paragraph (a) has been replaced with a provision which clarifies that a share is still a fixed rate share even though there is provision for the amount of dividend payable on the share to vary: • by a fixed relationship to a rate of income tax and/or • to compensate the shareholder for any default by the company paying the dividend or loss suffered by the shareholder. Grandfathering of redeemable preference shares Section 9(3) inserts section 63(2E) which retains the intercorporate dividend exemption until 1 April 1994 for dividends paid on pre-Budget fixed rate redeem- able shares. “Fixed rate” is in effect defined in para- graph (h). A share is considered fixed rate even if there is provision for the dividend payable on a share to vary according to the income tax payable on the dividend. A “share” includes a: • section 192 or 195 debenture, • fixed rate unit in a unit trust. Included as exempt are dividends paid on shares acquired after the Budget pursuant to a pre-Budget binding contract. However, where shares were ac- quired after the Budget because of the exercise of a pre-Budget option to put or sell the shares, the divi- dends paid on the shares are not exempt. The exemption is subject to the condition in (2E)(e) that no term of the share is altered after Budget (ex- cept where the alteration is pursuant to a pre-Budget binding contract). It is not uncommon for a contract for the issue of shares to require collateral security to be provided by the issuing company or an associate. Concern has been expressed that where such a security is substi- tuted, this may constitute an alteration of the term of the share, for the purposes of this provision and section 63(2C)(b)(ii). Such substitution is not consid- ered to constitute an alteration of the term of the share. The share is also not grandfathered where a post- Budget financial arrangement has been issued to defeat the intended application of the section, which is to exempt until 1 April 1994 dividends paid in re- spect of pre-Budget, unaltered redeemable prefer- ence shares. There are some exceptions to the grandfathering which are contained in paragraphs (b) and (c). In relation to (b), dividends derived from foreign com- panies are exempt from tax anyway under subsection 63(2A). Dividends derived from exempt companies, and dividends set out in subsection (2J), were tax- able prior to the general removal of the intercorporate dividend exemption. 12 Exemption for dividends paid within specified groups Section 63(2F) retains the intercorporate dividend exemption until 1 April 1993 for dividends paid be- tween members of a specified group. At that stage, companies will have the option to consolidate for income tax purposes. Dividends paid between mem- bers of a consolidated group will remain exempt. Definition of Specified Group A Paid up capital “Specified group” status is determined by refer- ence to the repealed section 191(4) and (6)(b) - i.e. the pre-1992/93 specified grouping require- ments are retained for the purpose of the 1 year exemption. Group status is determined at the time a dividend is paid. A dividend is exempt where at the time of pay- ment the same persons hold the whole of the paid up capital in the same proportions in the payer and recipient companies. Fixed rate dividend shares are not taken into ac- count. The other general provisions of section 191 ap- ply, of course, in determining group status so that, for example, the Commissioner has power under section 191(6A) to disregard a small amount of paid-up capital. B Voting Interests Although paid up capital is the primary test to determine specified group status, companies can elect to apply a test based on the voting in- terests of shareholders. This forms the basis of the new grouping rules. The “common voting interest” test (section 191(2)(a)) in this context requires that at the time of payment of the divi- dend, there is a group of persons who hold 100% of the voting interests in the same proportion in the payer and recipient companies. Any election to group on the basis of voting in- terests must be made by notifying the Commis- sioner at the time the first dividend is paid after 1 April 1992. That election is irrevocable - that is, where it is made, dividends paid until 1 April 1993 are exempt only where shareholders have 100% of the common voting interests in the recipient and payer companies at the time the dividend is paid. Voting interests are defined in section 8C. For an explanation of the operation of that provision see Part II. Fixed rate shares are excluded if they carry insignificant voting rights. Both methods of determining specified group status are subject to an anti-avoidance provision in subsec- tion (2G). Where the Commissioner considers that any shares in either the recipient or payer company have been subject to any arrangement for the purpose of enabling those companies to be a specified group, the dividend will not be exempt under subsection (2F). Redemption of units in unit trusts Section 63(2H) provides for dividends arising from the redemption of units in certain unit trusts, and redemption of interests in certain group investment funds, to be exempt until 1 April 1993. Background Corporate managers of unit trusts act as intermedi- aries in the sale and purchase of units. Where no purchaser for a unit is available, the unit trust re- deems the unit from the manager. Part of the re- demption proceeds may be a dividend to the man- ager. Until 1 April 1992 that dividend was exempt. The Government requires adequate time to consider how to address the impact of removing the inter-corpo- rate dividend exemption on unit trusts, and to con- sult with unit trust operators in that process, particu- larly in view of the Valabh Committee’s proposals to modify the treatment of unit trusts for tax purposes. It proposes to do this following passage of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992. In the meantime, it is concerned that public unit trusts are not placed at a disadvantage vis a vis companies and overseas unit trusts. The Government is also concerned to ensure that no opportunity exists for a general exemption for re- demption of units to be used to enable companies to avoid the taxation of intercorporate dividends. The exemption on redemption from a manager is therefore granted until 1 April 1993 for three catego- ries of unit trusts: • unit trusts with 100 or more unassociated unit holders • unit trusts with fewer than 100 unassociated unit holders, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the unit trust - is a widely-held investment vehicle for direct investment by members of the public; or - has fewer than 100 unit holders because of tem- porary or unusual circumstances • units trusts which have made an election to forego the temporary intercorporate dividend exemptions in relation to pre-Budget redeemable preference shares and dividends paid within specified groups. Group investment funds operate in a similar way to unit trusts in relation to category A income, and the rules applying to unit trusts also apply to such funds in respect of that income. 13 Exemptions do not apply to dividends taxable prior to 1991 Budget Section 63(2J) provides that the exemptions granted in relation to members of specified groups, pre- Budget redeemable preference shares and unit trusts do not apply to dividends which were taxable prior to the 1991 Budget. Miscellaneous Dividend Amendments Sections 35 - 38: Non-Resident Withholding Tax on Dividends Summary • Capital gains distributed to a corporate share- holder on winding up do not retain their charac- ter • Formulae are inserted for calculating NRWT on non cash dividends Sections 35 to 38 amend the non-resident withhold- ing tax regime. Capital gains distributed to corporate shareholder on winding up do not retain character Section 35 amends the section 309(2) definition of “dividends” by adding paragraph (a)(ii). It provides that capital gains made by a New Zealand corporate which are paid on winding up of the company to a related foreign corporate shareholder are subject to non-resident withholding tax. Whether companies are related is determined under section 4A(12) - es- sentially, companies are related if one owns 20% of another. Formulae for calculating NRWT on non- cash dividends Sections 36 and 37 align the format of the provisions requiring deduction of non-resident withholding tax with that of resident withholding tax. Section 36 repeals section 312(4). This change, to- gether with the amendments in Section 37, means that a deduction of NRWT is not made in relation to taxable bonus issues and non-cash dividends, but in its stead the payer of the dividend makes a payment to IRD of an amount equivalent to such a deduction. Section 37 replaces the previous section 313. There are now formulae for calculating the amount of NRWT to be paid in relation to non-cash dividends. The formula for non-cash dividends which are not taxable bonus issues is a x b 1 - a where“a” is the rate of non-resident withholding tax and “b” is the amount of dividend paid. Section 10 - Accruals Regime Section 10 makes two minor amendments to the ac- cruals regime. The Bankruptcy Act has been repealed and the ref- erence to that in section 64F(1)(c) is therefore redun- dant. Forgiveness of debt - section 4(1)(ba) and 4(1)(l) dividends Where a company forgives a debt owed to it by a shareholder, the forgiven debt is a dividend under section 4(1)(ba). Forgiveness of debt is also taxable under the accruals regime. To avoid double taxation, any section 4(1)(ba) dividend is excluded from the base price adjustment in section 64F(2) of the accru- als provisions. It is therefore taxable under the divi- dend provisions rather than the accrual rules. Section 64F(2) has been amended so that where an associate of a shareholder is forgiven a debt owed to a company, and that amount is an assessable divi- dend under section 4(1)(l), it is excluded in calculat- ing the base price adjustment in relation to the asso- ciate. The amendment applies from 26 July 1989 - the date that section 4(1)(ba) dividends were excluded from the base price adjustment. Section 4(1)(l) dividends which arise on forgiveness of a debt are, like section 4(1)((ba) dividends, tax- able to corporates and do not qualify for any of the temporary exemptions from tax granted to compa- nies under section 63. Section 15 - Deduction for Expenditure in providing Fringe Benefits to Employees Section 105A has been redrafted so that it is more comprehensible. It now applies to all, not just pri- vate, companies. Section 27 - Distribution of Trading Stock to Shareholders Unnecessary words have been deleted in section 197(3). 14 In relation to “a” where a lesser rate is payable un- der a treaty, then “a” is that rate. Example Co. A pays to a non-resident $100 non-cash divi- dend. It has no imputation credits attached. NRWT is applicable at the full rate of 30%. Un- der section 313(1)(a) the following amount of NRWT is payable: 0.3 x $100 = $42.85 1-0.3 Imputation and dividend withholding payment credits The provisions relating to imputation and dividend withholding payment credits attached to the divi- dend continue to apply. Imputation credits attached to the dividend have no effect. They are not included in the amount of the dividend (section 309(2)) and no credit against NRWT is available for them. To the extent that dividend withholding payment credits are attached to the dividend, they are in- cluded in the amount of the dividend, so NRWT is payable on both the dividend and credits. The payer of the dividend does not pay NRWT to the extent NRWT is covered by a DWP credit (section 311(2)). Any excess DWP credits are refundable to the recipi- ent (section 394ZQ(2)). Payment of NRWT Payments of NRWT are made on the 14th (from 1 July 1992, the 20th) of the month following deduc- tions (section 315). Section 38 makes a minor technical amendment to section 320(2), which relates to the power of the Commissioner to recover NRWT where there has been default in deduction. It aligns the date on which the NRWT is due to that in section 315. Sections 39 - 44 - Resident Withholding Tax on Dividends Summary • Non-cash dividends are subject to RWT • No RWT is payable on dividends paid between members of a group of companies Section 39 makes a minor amendment to the resident withholding tax (RWT) regime. The definition of “taxable bonus issue” in section 327A(1) has been repealed; that term is defined in section 3 for the purposes of the Act. Section 40 makes three amendments to section 327B, which sets out exemptions from the requirement to deduct RWT. • Consequential change - grouping First, section 327B(2)(a)(v) (which provided an ex- emption from RWT on interest where companies were in the same group) has been amended to fit with the new grouping rules, which enable group status to be determined, where appropriate, on a day by day basis. • Non-cash dividends subject to RWT Paragraph 327B(2)(b)(i) has been deleted. Prior to 1 April 1992 non-cash dividends provided to a share- holder were subject to fringe benefit tax. Paragraph (b)(i) therefore exempted such dividends from de- duction of RWT. From 1 April 1992, non-cash and cash dividends will be treated in the same way - i.e. assessable to the re- cipient. There is therefore a general obligation for a company providing a non-cash dividend to a share- holder (who is not also an employee) to pay RWT on that dividend. • No RWT on dividends paid between members of a group New paragraph (via) is inserted into section 327B(2)(b). This provides that dividends (both cash and non-cash) are exempt from RWT where the payer and recipient companies are members of the same group at the time of payment of the dividend. Deduction of RWT from non-cash dividends Section 41 makes amendments to section 327C, which provides for the deduction of resident withholding tax. From 1 April 1992 cash and non-cash dividends are treated alike. In general, both will be subject to resident withholding tax. Section 327C(1)(b) provides the mechanism for cal- culating the amount of resident withholding tax pay- able on cash dividends. That paragraph has been amended to ensure that it does not apply to non-cash dividends. New paragraph (1)(c) applies to non-cash dividends. It provides that RWT payable on a non-cash dividend is calculated in accordance with the following for- mula: ( a x b) - c 1 - a where a is the rate of RWT b is the amount of dividend paid c is foreign non-resident withholding tax where the dividend is not paid in New Zea- land, or where the dividend is sourced in New Zea- land, the amount of imputation and divi- dend withholding payment credit attached to the dividend 15 Examples All companies are resident in New Zealand. 1. Company A owns 70% of Company B. Com- pany B advances an interest-free $1,000 loan for one year (from 1 April 1992 to 31 March 1993) to company A. The market rate of the loan would be 10% p.a., and the dividend arising therefore is $100. The dividend is not credited. No RWT is payable as at the time of payment of the dividend Companies A and B are in the same group. 2. Where Company A owns 40% of Company B in the above circumstances, $49.25 RWT is payable, calculated as follows: .33 x $100 = $49.25 .67 Section 4(10)(a) provides that the dividend is deemed to be paid by Company B within 6 months of the end of its income year (assum- ing the shareholder is not notified of the amount of dividend earlier). Co. B is deemed to pay the dividend on 30 September 1993. Section 327C(1) states that a deduction of RWT is to be made at the time of making the pay- ment of the dividend. Where a company pays a non-cash dividend from which it is required to deduct RWT the company is to pay to IRD an amount equal to the amount of a deduc- tion. In the above example, therefore, Com- pany B must pay to IRD $49.25. Under section 327E(4), that amount is to be paid by the 14th (after 1 July 1992, the 20th) of the month following payment. In this ex- ample payment is due on 20 October 1993. Co. A will derive income of $149.25 (section 327K(1)) and will receive notification that a dividend of $100 has been paid, in respect of which $49.25 resident withholding tax has been paid (section 394I). All the standard provisions of the RWT re- gime apply. For example, if the recipient has a Certificate of Exemption, no deduction is made. The recipient company also enters a credit for the resident withholding tax credit in its im- putation credit account (section 394D(1)(va)). This process is illustrated in the diagram ap- pearing below. 3. If Co. B attaches to the dividend $10.00 impu- tation credits, the amount of RWT to be de- ducted is computed as follows: ( .33 x $100 ) - 10.00 = $39.25 RWT .67 Resident Withholding Tax on Intercorporate Dividends Company Q Company L Income$120.00 Tax payable$39.60 Less Imputation Credits$20.00 Tax to pay$19.60 Imputation Credit Account: CR Imp. credit attached$20.00 Company A Income$149.25 Tax payable$49.25 Less Credits$49.25 Tax to pay$ 0.00 Imputation Credit Account: CR Imp. credit attached$20.00 RWT$29.25 Company DCompany B 10%40%60% $100 non-cash dividend $20 imp. credit RWT to pay: 0.33 0.67 90% $100 cash dividend $20 imputation credit No RWT x $100 - $20 = $29.25 () 16 Section 327C(1)(d) retains the current provisions in relation to taxable bonus issues. Section 41(4) makes an amendment to section 327C(7) of the Act (which sets out circumstances in which no deduction of RWT is to be made) consequent upon the removal of the intercorporate dividend exemp- tion. Paragraph (d) has been deleted. That para- graph provided that liability to withhold RWT is re- lieved where the payer of dividends has taken rea- sonable steps to confirm that the recipient of the divi- dends is a company. However, dividends which are still exempt from in- come tax under section 63 (for example, dividends paid under pre-Budget redeemable preference shares until 1 April 1994) are not resident withholding in- come (section 327B(2)(b)(ii)). Section 42 amends the section requiring agents and trustees who receive resident withholding income to deduct RWT on receipt. The requirement for such a deduction in relation to taxable bonus issues has been extended to apply to non-cash dividends. Section 43 amends section 327K, which provides for RWT deductions to be credited against income tax. These amendments are made as RWT deducted from dividends is no longer linked, for purposes of noti- fication and crediting of tax, to the dividend with- holding payment regime. In the case of all dividends (and not just specified dividends as previously provided) the amount of resident withholding income includes the amount of RWT deducted (as noted earlier, in the case of non- cash dividends, this includes RWT paid). Subsection 327K(2) now provides for a credit of tax under that provision for RWT deductions on all divi- dends. Section 44 removes the link created in section 327L between RWT deductions and dividend withholding payment credits for notification and crediting pur- poses. Sections 45 and 46 - Fringe Benefit Tax Section 45 makes several amendments to the fringe benefit tax regime. Summary • Benefits paid to corporate associates of share- holder- employees in general are not subject to FBT until 1 April 1993 • Benefits paid to non-executive directors and secre- taries who are shareholders are derived in shareholding capacity Benefits Paid to Corporate Associates of Shareholder-employees First, under a combination of previous subsections 336N(3) and 336N(3A) benefits paid to corporate associates of shareholder/employees were subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT). This results in an unsatis- factory position for the 1992-93 income year, because the tax treatment of certain benefits provided by companies to corporate associates of shareholders differs depending on whether a shareholder owning the company providing the benefit is also an em- ployee of that company. This situation arises because, under section 4(12), section 4(1)(e) dividends (e.g. concessional interest on loans, use of property) paid by a proprietary com- pany to corporate associates of shareholders are ex- empt from tax, NRWT and FDWP until 1 April 1993. The amendment contained in subsection 336N(3A) will take benefits provided to corporate associates of shareholder/employees out of the fringe benefit tax regime and, where the employer is a proprietary company, into the dividend regime (section 4A(1)(i) will not apply to such benefits). A parallel treatment will therefore apply for, amongst other things, low interest loans advanced by Company B to Company C in the following circumstances: A = shareholder or shareholder/employee | Co. B | Co. C The exemption from fringe benefit tax is subject to an anti-avoidance rule. It does not apply where the benefit is provided under an arrangement which has the purpose of providing a benefit to the share- holder/employee. The amendment to section 336N outlined above will apply with respect to benefits provided on or after 1 April 1992. Benefits provided to shareholder/ employees Subsection (3B) restates the existing provision that where a shareholder/employee receives a benefit, it is deemed to be received in the capacity of employee. Benefits provided to executive officers Subsection (3C) implements the Valabh Committee recommendation that where a benefit is provided to a non-executive director or secretary of a company and that person is also a shareholder, the benefit is derived in that person’s capacity as shareholder. No fringe benefit tax on non-cash dividends As fringe benefit tax will not be payable on non-cash dividends after 1 April 1992, section 336N(8) has been repealed with effect from that date. 17 Section 46 makes an amendment to section 336O(2A) which was recommended by the Valabh Committee. The amendment ensures that where income is retro- spectively credited to a shareholder/employee’s cur- rent account so that a loan does not give rise to an FBT liability, there is also no dividend liability in relation to that current account. The amendment is retrospective, applying to FBT on loans owing after 1 April 1989. Sections 49 to 61 - Imputation and Dividend Withholding Payment Regimes Summary • Imputation credits are attachable to non-cash divi- dends • A credit arises for overpaid provisional tax where there is a joint assessment • There is a requirement for an RWT deduction to be specifically identified in notification to a share- holder • A company can receive a refund owing following breach of credit continuity Attachment of imputation credits to non- cash dividends Section 49 amends the definition of “dividends” for the purposes of the imputation regime. Companies will, after 1 April 1992, be able to attach imputation credits to non-cash dividends. Imputation Credits and Joint Assessments Section 50 also amends the imputation regime. A 1990 amendment prevented companies which were jointly assessed crediting all of the tax to the impu- tation credit account of the company paying the tax. This was achieved by inserting the words “on income derived by the company” in section 394D(1)(a). As it was expected that consolidation would be in place by 1 April 1992 and therefore the joint assess- ment process would no longer be operative, section 50 of the Act as it was introduced merely deleted these words. It is now necessary to retain them un- til consolidation is available. However, paragraph (a) has been altered so that it is now clear that it does not prevent companies from obtaining a credit for overpaid provisional tax. The amendment is retrospective to the 1990-91 in- come year. Shareholder Dividend Statements Section 52 makes several amendments to section 394I, which provides for a company paying a dividend to give information to a shareholder about the divi- dend. The first amendment provides for shareholders to be notified wherever resident withholding tax is de- ducted from a dividend (except in relation to a speci- fied dividend which is essentially a dividend which cannot carry an imputation credit). A new paragraph 394I(1)(ca) is inserted requiring companies to separately identify in shareholder divi- dend statements any RWT deducted from the divi- dend. Section 52(4) of the Act provides a period of grace in relation to the requirement to separately identify an RWT deduction in the shareholder dividend state- ment. Strictly, companies at present are not required to separate RWT from DWP credits. However, it appears that most do. In the event that companies are not able to alter their systems from 1 April 1992 and record RWT credits separately, the recipient may treat the RWT credit as a DWP credit. Refund owing where breach of credit continuity has occurred Section 53 provides that where a company has failed to maintain continuity in relation to imputation cred- its and a debit has arisen to its imputation credit ac- count, it may receive a refund of tax which it has owing, despite a nil balance in its ICA, up to the amount of debit arising on loss of continuity. Grouping of loss arising from conversion of excess imputation credits Section 54 provides that companies which have excess imputation credits and which convert these to a loss may offset that loss against income derived by an- other company in the group. At present, companies are only able to do this in relation to imputation cred- its converted to a loss in a year prior to offset. Dividend Withholding Payment regime Section 55 amends section 394ZK(2) as a consequence of the alteration of the “dividends” definition for imputation purposes. Previously, for dividend with- holding payment purposes it was necessary to bring back in non-cash dividends which had been excluded under the imputation regime. Order in which credits of tax are refundable Section 56 provides an ordering rule between DWP and RWT credits now that an RWT credit is not a DWP credit for the purposes of allowance of a credit of tax. A DWP credit is credited after an RWT credit (which is credited after an imputation credit). This is required so that companies know, where there is a refund of tax, whether to debit the ICA (in the case of a refund of RWT) or DWPA (see section 394ZW(1)(ca)). 18 Notification where DWP credits attached to dividend Section 58 makes amendments to section 394ZZB, which provides for notification of shareholders where dividend withholding payment credits are attached to dividends. These amendments are re- quired as a consequence of the decision not to treat RWT credits as DWP credits. Branch Equivalent Tax Accounts Sections 59 and 61 implement the Valabh Committee recommendation that taxpayers be able to elect to operate a branch equivalent tax account retrospec- tively. Part 2 - Measurement of Voting and Market Value Interests Introduction Section 7 inserts into the Income Tax Act new sections 8A to 8F which relate to the measurement of voting and market value interests held in companies by shareholders. The measurement of such interests is relevant to the following provisions of the Act: • continuity provisions - sections 188, 191A(1)(b) and (2)(e) 394E(1)(g), 394ZW(1)(f) and 394ZZP(3)(d) • company grouping and loss offset provisions - sections 190A, 191, and 191A • recovery of tax from directors and shareholders - section 276 • qualifying company regime - Part XIIAA The new provisions apply from the 1992-93 income year. Under the new provisions, shareholders’ economic interests in a company will generally be measured by reference to their voting interests held in that com- pany, both directly and indirectly through inter- posed companies. In certain circumstances, the shareholders’ economic interests in a company will also be determined by the market value of interests in the company. The cir- cumstances where the market value is also measured are limited to instances where the voting interests do not reflect the true economic interests held in a com- pany. Special tracing rules have been incorporated to lower the compliance and administration costs of applying the new measurement provisions (for example, by limiting the circumstances where indirect voting and market value interests have to be traced through multiple tiers of companies). Voting Interests - Section 8C Summary • Shareholders’ interests in companies are generally measured by reference to voting interests held in companies. • Voting interests include both direct and indirect voting interests carried by shares or options in that company. •Voting interest in a company equals the sum of shareholder decision-making rights. •Requirement to look through all interposed corpo- rate shareholders in a company to determine the ultimate owners of that company. •Indirect voting interests held through interposed companies are determined by multiplying down each level of direct voting interest in the chain. •A special corporate entity can't have a breach in continuity as its shares are deemed to be held by the same person. •Interests held by bare trustees and nominees are re- quired to be traced through to the beneficial own- ers. Calculation of voting interests - Sections 8C(1) and (2) A person’s voting interest in a company equals that person’s percentage share of the total shareholder decision-making rights carried by shares or options in that company. Shareholder decision-making rights are defined in section 8B as rights attaching to shares or options to vote or participate in decision-making concerning: • dividends or other distributions; or • the constitution of the company; or • any variation in the capital of the company; or • the appointment or election of directors. If the percentage of rights held by a person to vote on these different types of decision-making varies, the average of these percentage voting rights is used to calculate the person’s voting interest in a com- pany. 19 Special Corporate Entities - Section 8C(3)(a) Special provision for entities covered by the special corporate entity definition is necessary because these entities generally do not have share capital or share- holders that are natural persons, features on which the general loss and credit carry forward and group- ing rules are predicated. A special corporate entity is defined in section 8B to mean any: • public authority; • local authority; • state-owned enterprise; • statutory producer board; • statutory body established by a specific statute • Life Insurance Fund; or • Group Investment Fund. Where no shares have been issued by a special cor- porate entity, it is deemed to have issued shares in it which carry all shareholder decision-making rights. Its members or directors are deemed to hold all the shares and options over shares in it. No breach of shareholder continuity is possible in respect of a special corporate entity or its subsidiar- ies, because its deemed shares are deemed to be held by the same single person. Nominee Interests - Section 8C(3)(b) Any voting interest held by a nominee for a person is deemed to be held by that person and not by the nominee. A nominee is defined in section 8B as meaning any person who holds anything on behalf of, or to the order of, another person, but does not include a trus- tee other than a bare trust. Under the new nominee provision, a person is no longer deemed to be the nominee of his/her spouse or child, as was the case under former section 191(1)(d). The significance of this change is that transfers of shares within a family group will poten- tially breach shareholder continuity except where such transfers are pursuant to a matrimonial prop- erty agreement or a disposition under a will or intes- tacy. The nominee provisions will continue to require one to look to the beneficial owner of shares in determin- ing whether continuity or commonality of shareholding requirements have been satisfied. Shares held by discretionary trustees will not be cov- ered by the nominee provisions and accordingly no look through rule operates in respect of discretion- ary trustees. As noted below, however, a general trust anti-avoidance provision in section 8E will ap- ply to discretionary trustees. JackJohnJill C CoD Co Example 1: Averaging of differing voting rights A company has two shareholders, Vivian and Chris. The company has two classes of shares. Class A shares carry a right to vote on matters other than the payment of dividends and ap- pointment of directors. Class B shares carry un- restricted voting rights. Vivian holds all 1000 of the A shares in the company while Chris holds all 1000 of the B shares. Vivian’s percentage vot- ing interest in the company is calculated as fol- lows: 50 + 50 + 0 + 0 = 25% 100100100100 Chris’s percentage voting interest is therefore 75% Indirect voting interests - Section 8C(3)(d) There is a requirement (substantially modified for purposes of the continuity provisions by section 8E), when calculating voting interests held in a company, to look through all interposed corporate sharehold- ers to ascertain the ultimate owners of the company. The shareholder’s indirect voting interest is deter- mined by multiplying the shareholder’s voting inter- est in the interposed company in which he or she owns a direct voting interest by the direct voting in- terest that each interposed company owns in another company in the chain.

These instruments are also not taken into account for the purposes of the Income Tax Act provisions which are dependent on the measurement of voting inter- est provisions, e.g. the shareholder continuity re- quirements in the loss carry forward and grouping rules. However, modified definitions of excluded securities apply for purposes of the credit continu- ity provisions. A section 192 debenture is one with rates of interest varying according to company profit levels. A section 195 debenture is a debt issued in substitu- tion for shares. Excluded securities An “excluded security” means any fixed rate share or section 195 debenture issued by any company which does not carry any voting rights other than those that arise only in protective situations. These protective voting rights must be essentially passive and may only be used defensively to protect a share- holder’s interest in a company. The protective vot- ing rights only include rights that: • arise only in circumstances where the position of the holder of the share or debenture may be altered to the holder’s detriment; and • are granted to the holder of that share or debenture for the purpose of assisting that holder to prevent such alteration; and • at the time of issue of the share or debenture the protective voting rights were not expected to arise. Fixed rate shares or section 195 debentures which carry voting rights other than the prescribed protec- tive rights do not qualify as excluded securities for the purposes of section 8C(3)(c), and therefore would be taken into account in the calculation of voting in- terests held in companies. Such fixed rate shares and section 195 debentures would consequentially also be taken into account for the purposes of, for example, the loss carry forward and grouping rules. Pre-budget security A pre-budget security is any section 192 and 195 debenture or fixed rate share issued before 30 July 1991, or issued after 30 July 1991 if subject to a bind- ing contract entered into before 30 July 1991, where no term of the security or binding contract is altered after that date. Pre-budget securities can be disre- garded when calculating voting interests held in a company. Pre-budget securities will not therefore retrospectively limit the carry forward of company losses. As a result of the application of section 8C(3)(c) to section 192 and 195 debentures only: • section 192 debentures issued after 30 July 1991; and • section 195 debentures issued after 30 July 1991 that carry voting rights (other than protective rights) are taken into account in calculating voting interests in a company. Any section 192 debenture issued af- ter 30 July 1991 is taken into account as a share in determining the holder’s economic interest in a com- pany because such a debenture, with its floating rate of return ( based on the profits of the company), is akin to an equity instrument. Excluded option An “excluded option” is also disregarded under sec- tion 8C(3)(c) when measuring voting interests held in a company. An excluded option is one where: • the directors of the company did not have actual or constructive knowledge that the option had been granted; or • neither the grantor (not being the company whose shares are the subject of the option) nor any person associated with the grantor holds at the time the option is granted, any share over which the option is granted; or • the option is granted on arm’s length terms (sub- ject to an anti-avoidance provision) and the option does not carry any voting rights (other than pro- tective voting rights); or • the option exercise price is set by reference to the market value of the share at the date of exercise of the option and the option does not carry any vot- ing rights (other than protective voting rights); or • the share over which there is an option is an ex- cluded security (as defined in section 8B); or • the option is over a share issued before 30 July 1991. 21 Market Value Interests - Section 8D Summary • Shareholders’ market value interests in a company are measured in circumstances where their eco- nomic interests in the company are not accurately reflected by their voting interests. • A direct market value circumstance may exist in respect of a particular company. • An indirect market value circumstance can arise in respect of a company that is associated with a com- pany further up a chain of companies which has a direct market value circumstance. • A shareholder’s market value interest in a company equals that person’s percentage share of the total market value of shares and options held in the com- pany. • A person’s direct market value interest in any com- pany in a chain is deemed to equal the person’s direct voting interest unless a direct market value circumstance exists in respect of that company. Where market value circumstances exist, the share- holders’ economic interests in a company must be determined by reference both to their voting interests and to their market value interests in the company. Market value circumstance - Section 8B A market value circumstance is defined in section 8B and exists where: • the company has on issue a section 192 or 195 de- benture (not being an excluded security or pre- budget security); or • the company has on issue a share (not being an excluded security or pre-budget security) the pay- ment of a dividend on which is guaranteed by a third party, and the directors of the company have actual or constructive knowledge of that guaran- tee; or • an option (not being an excluded option) to acquire a share in that company exists (a call option); or • an option (not being an excluded option) to require a person to acquire a share in the company exists (a put option); or • an arrangement which has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of any provi- sion which is dependent upon measurement of vot- ing and market value interests exists. The above type of market value circumstance is re- ferred to in section 8B as a direct market value cir- cumstance. A market value circumstance will not apply in re- spect of a company where no share or option over a share in the company has a value higher than nil. In this situation, shareholders’ interests in a company will be measured solely by reference to voting inter- ests. It is expected, given that a market value circum- stance is narrowly defined, that the application of the market value interest test will be the exception rather than the rule. In the vast majority of cases, it should only be necessary to apply the voting interest test. Indirect market value circumstance - Section 8B If a direct market value circumstance exists in respect of a company which is in a chain of companies, para- graph (b) of the market value circumstance definition deems an indirect market value circumstance to arise in respect of every other company in the chain that is associated with that company and is below the direct market value circumstance company. Special rules apply for the measurement of interests in an indirect market value circumstance company (section 8D(4), discussed below). Calculation of market value interests - Section 8D(1) A person’s market value interest in a company equals his or her share of the total market value of shares and options held in the company. Market value in- terests include both shareholders’ market value in- terests held directly in a company and shareholders’ indirect market value interests in the same company held through interposed companies. Indirect market value interests - Section 8D(3)(d) and (4) As with voting interests, when calculating market value interests held in a company, all interests held through interposed corporate shareholders are looked through to their ultimate owners. A shareholder’s indirect market value interest in a company is aggregated with any other indirect mar- ket value interests held by that person through dif- ferent chains of companies and any direct market value interest of that shareholder. A person's direct market value interest in a company is deemed to be equal to the person's direct voting interest unless a direct market value circumstance exists in respect of that company. 22 Determination of Market Value - Sections 8B and 8D(2) Summary • The market value of a share or option quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange is an amount equal to the middle market quotation at that time. • Statutory criteria are set down for ascertaining a recognised exchange. • Commissioner’s approval that a particular market constitutes a recognised exchange can be sought. • The market value of a non-listed share or option is the amount a willing purchaser would pay for it in an arm’s length transaction. • Some statutory guidance is given as to acceptable valuation methods. The market value of an interest is easily determined where the company is a listed company or otherwise traded on a market. The middle market quotation method will not apply where such quotation is not a fair reflection of the market value at that time of the share or option to be valued. Section 8B defines a recognised exchange. However the definition does not contain a list of specific ex- changes. Instead, the criteria defining a recognised exchange is set down to enable taxpayers to assess for themselves whether a particular exchange consti- tutes a recognised exchange under that criteria. The statutory criteria for ascertaining a recognised exchange are as follows: • the number of participants in the market or having access to the market; and • the frequency of trading within the market; and • the nature of trading in the market, including how prices are determined and transactions are effected; and • the potential or demonstrated capacity of a person to significantly influence the market; and • any significant barriers to entry to the market; and • any discrimination in the market on the basis of quantity bought and sold unless based on the risks involved, the transaction costs, or economies of scale. It is also possible for a taxpayer to seek the Commis- sioner's approval of particular markets. In the case of any share or option over a share not quoted on a recognised exchange, paragraph (b) of the market value definition provides that the market value of such share or option is the amount that a willing purchaser would pay to acquire that share or option in an arm’s length transaction. The amount is to be determined by using a valuation method Example 3:Calculation of individual’s indirect market value interest Vivian Co D 100% voting interest Sister Codirect mvcCo C Co B Co A (mvc = market value circumstance) Result:Vivian’s indirect market value interest in Co A = 19.2% (80% x 100% x 40% x 60%) Sister Co’s direct market value circumstance does not affect Co C or any other company in the chain as it is not necessary to trace through Sister Co to measure own- ership interests in Co A. market value = voting interest (s8D(4)) market value = voting interest market value measurement used market value = voting interest 60% 40% 100% direct mvc - post-1991 Budget s192 debenture on issue indirect mvc 80% 23 which conforms with commercially acceptable prac- tice and results in a valuation that is fair and reason- able having regard to the tenor of sections 8B to 8F. Some guidance regarding acceptable valuation meth- ods is given in the market value definition, which provides that in appropriate cases regard may be had to: • the present value at that time of the company’s anticipated income or cashflows; and • the realisable value at that time of the company’s assets. Options may affect the value of shares over which they are issued. The terms of options are therefore taken into account in the valuation of shares. How- ever, to prevent double counting, the value of the share will exclude the value attributable to the op- tions. Market Value Interests: Special Corporate Entities, Nominees, and Excluded Securities/Options and Pre-Budget Securities - Section 8D(3)(a), (b) and (c) The special corporate entity, nominee, excluded se- curity/option and pre-budget security provisions, relating to market value interests, mirror the equiva- lent provisions relating to voting interests contained in section 8C which have been previously discussed. As well as being disregarded in the calculation of market value interests, excluded securities or options and any pre-budget securities (as those terms are defined in section 8B) do not in themselves trigger a market value circumstance. Modifications to Measurement of Voting and Market Value Interests in relation to Continuity Provisions - Section 8E Relief For Certain Transfers - Section 8E(2) Relief from the continuity of shareholding require- ments is provided for: • transfers of shares made pursuant to a matrimonial property agreement or on the death of a share- holder. Those shares are deemed to have been acquired by the transferee on the same date those shares were acquired by the transferor. • transfers of shares in a company under the will or intestacy of a deceased person. Those shares are deemed to have been acquired by the beneficiary or trustee of the estate on the same date those shares were acquired by the deceased person. Where a spouse who has received shares pursuant to a matrimonial property agreement subsequently dies, then for the purposes of the continuity provi- sions, the beneficiary or trustee of the estate under the will or intestacy of that deceased spouse shall be deemed to have acquired the shares on the same date they were acquired by the spouse of the deceased. Corporate Trustees - Section 8E(3) A corporate trustee (other than the Public Trustee, Maori Trustee or a trustee company in terms of the Trustee Companies Act 1967) will be deemed to have sold any company shares it holds to a third party and immediately reacquired those shares if there is any change in the shareholding of the corporate trustee itself. The effect of this deemed sale and reacquisition is that, where a corporate trustee holds in excess of 51 percent of the shares in a loss com- pany, there will be a breach of continuity in respect of that loss company. The deemed sale and reacquisition of shares owned by a corporate trustee will, however, be deemed not to occur if it can be shown that the change in the cor- porate trustee’s shareholding did not: • change the beneficial ownership of the company shares held by the corporate trustee; or • otherwise have a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the continuity provisions. General Trustee Anti-Avoidance Rule - Section 8E(4) Any shares in a company held by a trustee will be deemed to be sold to a third party and immediately reacquired where there is a change in the trust’s ben- eficiaries under an arrangement which has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the continuity provisions. For example, where a settlor is made a beneficiary under a discretionary trust, there generally will be an issue as to whether such an arrangement exists. Shares held in Capacity of Trustee only - Section 8E(5) Every trustee of a particular trust holds any shares or options only in their capacity as trustee of that trust. The general corporate look through rules (sections 8C(3)(d) and 8D(3)(d)) therefore do not apply to a corporate trustee (not being a bare trustee). In other words, it is not necessary to trace the shares owned by a corporate trustee through to the shareholders of that corporate trustee. This treatment of a corporate trustee is appropriate as shares held by a corporate trustee are in substance held not so much by a “com- pany” (which should normally be looked through) but rather are held by a trustee which happens to be a company. A trustee’s holding of shares under a particular trust is not aggregated with any shares which that trustee 24 also holds in a capacity other than as trustee of that trust. For example, shares held in that trustee’s per- sonal capacity or in that trustee’s capacity as a trus- tee under a different trust. Change in identity of trustees Changes in the identity of the trustees of the same trust will not be taken into account for shareholder continuity purposes - unless any change in the trus- tees has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the continuity provisions. An exam- ple of such a purpose or effect would be where the change in trustees results in a change in the benefi- cial ownership of the trust’s assets. Example 4: Application of Associated Person Rule in section 8E(6) A B 100%100%100%100%100%100% 123456 9%9%9%9%9%9% Six private companies each holding 9% of the voting interest in Loss Co Nominee Loss Co 54% Special Tracing Rules - Section 8E(6) to (9) Summary Special tracing rules are provided to reduce compli- ance costs associated with the shareholder continu- ity requirements. • All direct voting or market value interests of less than 10 percent are deemed not to be held sepa- rately and instead are deemed to be held by a no- tional single person. • All indirect voting or market value interests of less than 10 percent are attributed to the interposed shareholder company rather than the actual share- holders. • Corporate look through rules do not apply to cer- tain companies (e.g. listed companies) which hold directly or indirectly less than a 50 percent voting or market value interest in a company. • Companies using the special tracing rules have the option not to apply those rules if that would assist them in satisfying shareholder continuity require- ments. • In certain circumstances, the special tracing rules will not apply where the directors of a company had actual or constructive knowledge that a conti- nuity provision requirement would not have been satisfied but for the special tracing rules. Less than 10 percent direct interests - Section 8E(6) and (8) All direct voting or market value interests of less than 10 percent are deemed not to be held separately by the actual shareholders and instead are deemed to be held by a notional single person. As a result, trans- fers of shares between less than 10 percent share- holders can be disregarded. This pooling concept represents a substantial modification of the general rules governing the measurement of voting and mar- ket value interests and, in particular, the general cor- porate look through rules (sections 8C(3)(d) and 8D(3)(d)). It is important to note that the pooling of all less than 10 percent direct interests takes place before the application of the corporate look through rules in sections 8C(3)(d) and 8D(3)(d) and, there- fore, it is not necessary to look through companies which hold a less than 10 percent interest in another company. In ascertaining whether a shareholder’s direct inter- est in a company is less than 10 percent, the inter- ests of associated corporate shareholders are aggre- gated. In the example below (which also illustrates the nominee look through rule in section 8C(3)(b)) the six companies, each holding 9 percent of the voting interests (via a nominee) in Loss Co, are “thrown out of” section 8E(6) by the application of the associated person rule in that provision. Each of the 9 percent interests is attributed to individual A, who therefore cannot use section 8E(6) to avoid a breach of conti- nuity in Loss Co when the 54 percent interest in Loss Co is sold to B. 25 When shareholders with a less than 10 percent direct interest in a company increase their interests in a company to 10 percent or more, they “fall out of” the pooling provision of section 8E(6) and need to be taken into account separately for shareholder conti- nuity purposes. Example 5 : Changes in the 10 percent pool A 6 percent shareholder acquires additional shares in the same company, which gives that shareholder a 15 percent interest. The share- holder falls out of the less than 10 percent pool. The increase in the shareholder’s interest is treated as a 15 percent change in ownership in the company, subject to the rule described in the paragraph below. Section 8E(8) introduces a further concession of al- lowing less than 10 percent interests to be accounted for separately if that would assist in satisfying share- holder continuity requirements. Example 6 : Changes in the 10 percent pool A shareholder increases its shareholding in a loss company from 9 to 11 percent. Without the ap- plication of section 8E(8), this increase would be treated as a 11 percent change in shareholding. The loss company, however, can account for that shareholder’s interest separately under sub- section (8) from the beginning of the continuity period. The increase in the shareholder’s inter- est can therefore be treated as a 2 percent rather than 11 percent change in ownership in the loss company. Less than 10 percent indirect interests - Section 8E(7)(b) and (8) All indirect voting or market value interests of less than 10 percent are attributed to the interposed share- holder company rather than the actual shareholders. When determining a less than 10 percent indirect interest, the rule in subsection 6 which deems a sin- gle notional person holder of less than 10 percent direct interests, is ignored. The different indirect interests a shareholder may hold in an issuing company through different chains of companies are not aggregated in ascertaining whether a shareholder’s indirect interest in an issu- ing company is less than 10 percent. This tracing concession does not apply where the shareholder with a less than 10 percent indirect in- terest is associated with the issuing company. Section 8E(8) gives the issuing company the option to trace through interposed companies and attribute to the shareholders of those interposed companies their less than 10 percent indirect interests if that would assist in satisfying shareholder continuity re- quirements. Example 7: Tracing option Issuer Co is a wholly owned subsidiary of Par- ent Co. A shareholder increases his or her shareholding in Parent Co from 9 to 15 percent. In the absence of section 8E(8) this increase would be treated as a 15 percent change in own- ership in the issuing company. Instead the Issuer Co can account for that shareholder’s interest separately under subsection (8) and therefore treat the shareholder’s increased interest as a 6 percent rather than 15 percent change in own- ership in the issuing company. Limited attribution companies - Section 8E(7)(a) and (8) A limited attribution company is defined in section 8B as meaning any: • building society ; or • cooperative company; or • listed company ; or • widely-held company; or • limited attribution foreign company. A widely-held company is any company which has not less than 25 shareholders (treating associated shareholders as one person) and is not a closely-held company. A limited attribution foreign company is any com- pany which is: • a non-resident company or a company resident in New Zealand which, pursuant to a double tax agreement (DTA), is treated as not being resident in New Zealand for the purpose of the DTA; and • not a closely-held company. A closely-held company is a company in which five or fewer persons (with associated shareholders be- ing treated as one person) own, in the aggregate, over 50 percent of the direct voting interests (or, if a market value circumstance exists in respect of the company, over 50 percent of the direct market value interests) in the company. The corporate look through rules in sections 8C(3)(d) and 8D(3)(d) also do not apply when a limited attri- bution company holds directly or indirectly a less than 50 percent voting or market value interest in another company. Example 8 : Limited attribution company LAC Co increases its interest in Issuer Co from 49 to 51 percent. In the absence of section 8E(8) this increase would be treated as a 51 percent change in ownership in Issuer Co. Instead Issuer Co can treat its shareholding under subsection (8) as always being attributed to the sharehold- ers of LAC Co. The change of ownership in Is- suer Co is therefore treated as being only of 2 per- cent. 26 In determining the 50 percent threshold the direct interest owned by a limited attribution company in an issuing company is aggregated with any indirect interests held through different chains of companies. Special tracing anti-avoidance provision - Section 8E(9) Where the directors of a company know or could reasonably be expected to know that the require- ments of any continuity provision would not have been satisfied but for the application of section 8E(6) or (7), that continuity provision is deemed not to have been satisfied. This anti-avoidance provision does not apply if a breach in continuity is due solely to ordinary trad- ing on a recognised exchange between persons with less than 10 percent interests in the company.

For the purposes only of the credit account continu- ity provisions the following post- Budget instruments are taken into account in measuring voting and mar- ket value interests held in a company : • fixed rate shares ; • section 192 and 195 debentures. Any option to acquire or dispose of such a fixed rate share or section 195 debenture is also taken into ac- count. Fixed rate shares falling within paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “market value circumstance”, cer- tain options over shares and the issue of section 192/ 195 debentures are market value circumstances for purposes of the credit continuity provisions Part 3A - Loss Carry Forward Rules Introduction Section 22 repeals section 188 and substitutes a new section 188. The new section 188 utilises the new measurement of ownership interests in a company, inserted by sec- tion 7. The main changes from former section 188 are as follows: • a purpose provision is inserted for the first time in the loss carry forward rules; • the minimum continuity of shareholding which must be maintained at all times during a continu- ity period for a company to carry forward its losses has increased from 40 percent to 49 percent; • the lowest percentage voting or market value inter- est held by each shareholder during the continuity period is used to determine whether the shareholding continuity requirements have been satisfied. • where shareholder continuity is breached during an income year, losses can be carried forward and set off against any current part year profit attrib- utable to the period before the change of owner- ship. The new section 188 applies from the 1992-93 income year. Purpose of Section 188 - Subsection (1) The purpose of the loss carry forward rules is to per- mit companies to carry forward and set off a loss only where the tax benefit arising from such set off is ob- tained, at least to the extent of 49 percent, only by the same natural persons who effectively bore the loss through their shareholdings. General provisions - subsections (2) to (5) • The amount of any loss incurred by a taxpayer in any income year is determined under the Act; • There is no time limit on carrying forward a loss for set off against assessable income derived in sub- sequent income years. • A $10,000 limitation applies to losses incurred in certain specified activities before the 1991 income year (section 188A). • Where a taxpayer carries forward losses incurred in two or more income years, those losses must be set off against assessable income in the order they were incurred. • Where, if a profit had been made from the trans- action in which the loss was incurred, the amount of the profit would not have been assessable in- come, that loss cannot be carried forward under section 188. Loss Adjustment For Debt Remission - Subsection (6) Section 188(5) deals with the situation where a debt, which has been taken into account in calculating a loss incurred by a taxpayer in an income year, is sub- sequently remitted or becomes irrecoverable. The loss previously calculated is required to be adjusted so as to exclude the amount of any debt which has been remitted or becomes irrecoverable. The various circumstances in which a debt is remitted or can- vision purposes to the extent that the change is solely attributable to a change in the market value of the company’s assets or to a change in the market value of the company’s shares which is not attributable to any change in the terms of those shares. Change In Market Value Of Company Assets - Section 8E(10) Any change in a shareholder’s market value interest in a company can be disregarded for continuity pro- 31 celled for the purposes of subsection (6) are set out in paragraph (c) of that subsection. The loss adjustment provisions do not apply where the remission or cancellation of a debt is taken into account under the accrual rules. For the purposes of giving effect to subsection (6), the Commissioner may at any time alter any assessment notwithstanding the four year time limit for amend- ment of assessments in section 25 of the Income Tax Act. General Rule for Carrying Forward of Losses by Companies - Subsection (7) Summary • a 49 percent continuity of minimum voting inter- ests needs to be maintained by a group of persons at all times during the continuity period; • the same group of persons must also maintain 49 percent continuity of minimum market value inter- ests if the loss company has a market value circum- stance; • the lowest percentage voting or market value inter- est held by each shareholder during the continuity period is used to satisfy shareholder continuity requirements; A company can only carry forward its losses if at all times during the period from the beginning of the year of loss to the end of the year of carry forward (the continuity period), a group of persons held, in aggregate, at least 49 percent of the minimum vot- ing interests in the company. If at any time during the continuity period a market value circumstance exists in respect of the loss company, the same group of persons must also hold at least 49 percent of the minimum market value interests in the loss company throughout that continuity period. Minimum voting or market value interest The lowest percentage voting interest or market value interest (where a market value circumstance exists) held by each shareholder during the continu- ity period is used to determine whether the shareholding continuity requirements have been sat- isfied. A breach of continuity can therefore poten- tially take place where the number and identity of a loss company’s shareholders does not change during a continuity period, but the proportion of shares held by each shareholder does. Example 1: Application of minimum voting or market value interest rule • Standard balance date company incurs loss in 1992-93 income year; • Shareholding proportions equivalent to voting or market value interest percentages; • Shareholding changes on 31.06.93 Loss CompanyLowest ShareholderShareholdingPercentage 1.04.9231.06.93 %%% A206020 B801010 C-30- 100%100%30% Result:49% test breached (minimum continuity = 30%) Loss company cannot carry forward loss (incurred in 1992-93 income year) to the 1993-94 income year. Part Year Loss Carry Forward - Subsection (8) Where there has been a breach of shareholder conti- nuity part way through a company’s current income year, a loss incurred by the company which is attrib- utable to the part period of the income year after the change in shareholding may be carried forward by the company. The relief from the general shareholder continuity requirements in subsection (7) only applies to the relevant current part year loss period and does not extend to later periods (i.e. subsequent carry forward years). Adequate accounts must be furnished to the Com- missioner showing the amount of loss reasonably and fairly attributable to that part year. Subsection (8) will also apply where companies are formed part way through an income year and incur a loss in the period to the end of that income year. 32 Setting Off Carried Forward Losses Against Current Part Year Profits - Subsection (9) Where shareholder continuity is breached during an income year, previous year losses can be carried for- ward to that income year and set off against any cur- rent part year profit that is attributable to the period before the change in shareholding. The relief from the general shareholder continuity requirements in subsection (7) only applies to the relevant current part year profit period and does not extend to earlier periods (i.e. the year of loss and any intervening carry forward years). Any loss incurred in income years prior to the 1992- 93 income year can be carried forward and set off against any current part year profit derived in the 1992-93 and subsequent income years. This part year profit set off rule has not previously been included in the loss carry forward rules. In order to gain the benefit of subsection (9), a com- pany must provide adequate accounts to the Com- missioner that relate to the part year of profit and detail the amount of profit reasonably and fairly at- tributable to that part year.

Loss Carry Forward Transitional Rules - Subsection (13) Losses incurred by a company in the 1991-92 and prior income years which do not meet the new con- tinuity requirements from the beginning of the year of loss may carry forward those losses to the 1992- 93 and subsequent income years if the following dual test is satisfied: • the 40 percent continuity test applicable as from the 1991 Budget night is satisfied from the beginning of year of loss until the end of the year of loss uti- lisation. From the 1991 Budget night the lowest per- centage of rights held by each shareholder in a com- pany is taken into account.; and • a 49 percent continuity of shareholding, computed using the new rules from the beginning of the loss company’s 1992-93 income year until the end of the year of loss utilisation. Non-Standard Accounting Year - Subsection (14) The term “income year’ means a corresponding ac- counting year where a taxpayer has a non-standard accounting year. Part Year Loss Carry Forward of 1990-91 and 1991-92 Losses - Section 188AA Section 23 inserts a new section 188AA in the Income Tax Act relating to the part year carry forward of losses incurred by companies in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 income years. Under former section 188(7B), in determining con- tinuity of shareholding between 30 July 1991 and the end of the 1991-92 income year, the lowest number of shares held during that period is deemed to be held at all times during that period for shareholder continuity purposes. It also had the unintended ef- fect of preventing the carry forward of part year 1990- 91 and 1991-92 losses incurred by companies formed after 30 July 1991 or incurred by existing companies after 30 July 1991 following a breach in shareholder continuity. Section 188AA corrects the situation, by allowing such companies the carry forward from the 1990-91 and 1991-92 income years of part year losses. The loss company is required to prepare and furnish to the Commissioner adequate accounts that relate to the part year of loss and detail the amount of loss reasonably and fairly attributable to that part year. Losses of Mining Companies and Petroleum Miners - Section 188C Section 24 inserts a new section 188C relating to losses of mining companies and petroleum miners. The only purpose of new section 188C is to separate out from new section 188 the mining provisions previ- ously contained in subsections (9) and (9A) of former section 188. Special Partnerships - Section 211B Section 30 amends section 211B of the Income Tax Act, which relates to special partnerships, to pro- Example 4: Section 188(13) application to loss incurred by standard balance date company in 1990-91 in- come year • Standard balance date loss company • Loss carried forward to 1993-94 and subsequent income years until utilised 1.4.9031.3.9130.7.9131.3.9231.3.93 Loss incurred 40% test underAs modified former s188from 1991 Budget night lowest % of rights test 49% test under new s188 from beginning of 1992-93 income year 34 vide that a claim for a loss carry forward by a spe- cial partnership will not be allowed unless the Com- missioner is satisfied that: • if the partnership had been a company; and • the interests of the partners in the partnership’s certified capital had been shares in the company the loss could have been carried forward to a later in- come year in accordance with new section 188. The criteria for the carry forward of losses is there- fore the same for both special partnerships and com- panies. Part 3B - Loss Grouping Rules Company Grouping - Section 191 Summary • Two or more companies may be treated as a group of companies at a particular time. • Two or more companies may be treated as a group of companies for an income year. • Every company in a group of companies is liable for income tax as if it were a company not included in a group of companies. • Income is deemed assessable to a company in a wholly-owned group of companies if the wholly- owned group had been treated as one company. • A group of companies may apply to be jointly as- sessed. Group of companies at a particular time - Subsection (3)(a) In relation to two or more companies, where at any time the aggregate of the common voting interests is at least 66 percent, those companies shall be treated as a group of companies at that time. The common voting interest is equivalent to the lowest percentage voting interest of each shareholder in each of those companies at a particular point of time. Where a market value circumstance exists in respect of any of the relevant companies, the aggregate of the common market value interests must also be at least 66 percent. The common market value interest is equivalent to the lowest percentage market value interest of each shareholder in the relevant compa- nies at a particular point in time. Group of companies for an income year - Subsection (3)(b) In relation to two or more companies, where at all times during an income year the aggregate of the common voting interests is at least 66 percent, those companies shall be treated as a group of companies for that income year. The common voting interest is equivalent to the lowest percentage voting interest of each shareholder in each of those companies at a particular point in time. Where a market value circumstance exists in respect of any of the relevant companies, the aggregate of the common market value interests must also be at least 66 percent. The common market value interest is equivalent to the lowest percentage market value Introduction Section 25 repeals former section 191, which related to groups of companies and the circumstances in which one company may claim a deduction for the losses of another company, and substitutes new sec- tions 191 and 191A. New section 191 sets out the general purpose of the company grouping and loss offset provisions and, in particular, the circumstances where two or more companies are treated as a group of companies. New section 191A sets out the circumstances where losses can be offset within groups of companies. The new company grouping and loss offset provi- sions utilise the new measurement of ownership pro- visions. The substantive effect of many of the provisions in new sections 191 and 191A is similar to that of former section 191. There are, however, several important differences which are set out below: • under the new grouping and loss offset rules, loss and profit companies must be members of the same group at all times from the beginning of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is in- curred to the end of the year of offset; • the specified group/ordinary group distinction is removed; • the means by which corporate groups actually off- set losses are simplified under the new rules. Groups of companies are able to offset the losses and profits of member companies against each other by a combination of subvention payments and elections; • part year grouping of losses is permitted. The new loss offsetting rules are designed to restrict the ability of companies which are not members of the loss source group from benefiting from those tax losses. The new company grouping and loss offset rules contained in sections 191 and 191A apply from the 1992-93 income year. 35 interest of each shareholder in the relevant compa- nies at a particular point in time. Whereas under former section 191 a group of com- panies’ status was only tested at two points in time (31 March in the year of loss and 31 March in the year of offset), new section 191 requires the 66 percent commonality to be maintained at all times from the commencement of a loss company’s income year in which the loss is incurred to the end of the loss com- pany’s income year in which the loss is offset. Wholly-Owned Group Of Companies - Subsection (4) A wholly owned group is defined as two or more companies where the aggregate of the common vot- ing interests or common market value interests, as the case may be, is 100 percent. The definition is used, for example, for purposes of the interim in- ter-corporate dividend exemption. Company Liable As If Not A Member Of A Group - Subsection (5) Every company in a group of companies is assessable and liable for income tax as if it were a company not included in a group of companies. This provision ensures that special provisions of the Act, relating to certain taxpayer companies (e.g. mining compa- nies and life insurance companies), are still applica- ble in determining the assessable income of those companies. Example 1: Application of group of companies for an income year test • Companies A to F are all standard balance date companies • There is no change of shareholding during the income year • A market value circumstance exists, viz s192 debenture on issue (issued after 30 July 1991) • Shareholding proportions are equivalent to voting and market value interest percentages Common Voting ShareholderCompany ACompany BCompany Cor Market Value Interests %% % % 1 302020 20 2 304030 30 3 40 40 50 40 100100100 Aggregate of Common Voting or Market Value Interests90% Result:Companies A, B and C qualify as a group of companies for the income year Example 2: Application of group companies for an income year test • Same facts as in example 1 Common Voting ShareholderCompany DCompany ECompany For Market Value Interests %% % % 1 601050 10 2 105010 10 3 30 40 30 30 100100100 Aggregate of Common Voting or Market Value Interests50% Result:Companies D, E and F do not qualify as a group of companies for the income year 36 Income Deemed Assessable To Company If Group Treated As One Company - Subsection (6) Where profits or gains are derived by a company in a wholly-owned group, those profits and gains are deemed to be assessable if they would have been assessable income had the wholly- owned group been treated as one company. This is an anti-avoid- ance provision. Joint Assessment Of Group Income - Subsection (7) The Commissioner may, on written application by or on behalf of all the companies in a wholly-owned group, make a joint assessment of the income tax payable in respect of the income derived by the group member companies in an income year. Any such sin- gle return of group income will need to be signed by a group company officer duly authorised by all the companies in the wholly-owned group. Each member company of a group of companies in respect of which a joint assessment has been made is separately liable for the tax for which it would have been liable if each company had been assessed sepa- rately. Non-Standard Accounting Year - Subsection (8) Every reference in section 191 to an income year is a reference to the accounting year corresponding with that income year where a taxpayer has a non-stand- ard accounting year. Loss Offset between Group Companies - Section 191A General rules - subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c) : The amount of any loss available for offset is deter- mined under the Act. Group offset of losses is permitted only where, in addition to satisfying the minimum 66 percent commonality of ownership test, the continuity of ownership test is also satisfied. If a profit made from the transaction in which the loss was incurred would not be assessable income, no offsetting deduction is allowed. Loss Offsetting Machinery: General Rules - Subsection (2) Summary • a group of companies has the option of offsetting its losses by either subvention payment or election; • the amount of loss offset is restricted to the lesser of a profit company’s profit or a loss company’s loss; • a loss company and a profit company must be members of the same group at all times from the beginning of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is incurred to the end of the year of offset; • only non-dual resident companies incorporated in New Zealand and non-residents carrying on busi- ness in New Zealand through a fixed establishment (to the extent of that branch’s losses) may offset losses; • A loss company must maintain shareholding con- tinuity during the year of offset; • The amount of any loss offset (whether by way of subvention payment or election) is assessable to the loss company and deductible to the profit company in the year of offset. Losses available for offset within a group - subsection (2)(a) The losses eligible for offset within a group in the year of offset are: • current year losses incurred by a loss company in the income year of offset; and • prior year losses incurred by a loss company which are eligible to be carried forward under section 188 to the income year of offset. Method of offset - subsection (2)(b) Subject to the loss offsetting requirements in subsec- tion (2) being satisfied, company losses can be off- set by either election or subvention payment. The loss company has the option to either: • elect by notice in accordance with section 191A(3) that the whole or part of its loss be deducted from the assessable income derived in the year of offset by a profit company (any such election to be irrevo- cable); or • receive a subvention payment from a profit com- pany under an agreement providing for the profit company to bear or share in the loss company’s loss. 37 Commonality of ownership requirements - subsection (2)(c) To offset a loss incurred during a current income year, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group for that income year. To offset a carried forward loss, the loss company and the profit company must be members of the same group of companies for the entire period beginning with the income year in which the loss is incurred and ending with the year of offset. Where the profit company has a later balance date than the loss company in the year of offset, both com- panies must be members of the same group until the end of the profit company’s income year correspond- ing to the year of offset. Offsetting of losses available to certain companies only - Subsection (2)(d) Loss grouping will only be available in respect of the losses of: • companies that are incorporated in New Zealand and which are not dual resident companies; or • companies (which are not dual resident companies) that are carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, i.e. a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company. The combined effect of this provision and section 191A(1)(c) is that non-resident companies are only able to offset their losses to the extent of the losses of their New Zealand branches. Continuity of ownership requirements - Subsection 2(e) A loss company is required to maintain continuity of ownership during the year of offset. Where the bal- ance date of the profit company is later than the bal- ance date of the loss company, the loss company will have to maintain shareholder continuity until the end of the profit company’s accounting year before its loss can be offset against the assessable income of the profit company. Loss offset not to exceed assessable income of profit company - Subsection (2)(f) The amount of a loss offset (whether by way of sub- vention payment or election) cannot exceed the amount of assessable income derived by the profit company in the year of offset. Example 3 In the year of offset, Loss Co had $200 of losses (comprised of losses incurred in the year offset and losses carried forward to that year) available to offset . Profit Co derived $100 of profits. The amount of the loss offset is limited to a maximum of $100. Therefore, it is not possible to transform a profit company into a loss company by means of the loss offset. Subvention payment requirements - Subsection (2)(g) First, the amount of the subvention payment must not exceed the amount of the loss company’s loss. Example 4 In the year of offset Loss Co had $100 of losses available to offset and Profit Co had derived $200 of profits. The amount of the subvention pay- ment is restricted to a maximum of $100; there- fore, the subvention payment therefore cannot constitute the whole of the profit company’s profit. Therefore, it is not possible to transform a loss company into a profit company by means of the subvention payment. Second, the subvention payment must be made: • not later than the 31st day of March that, in rela- tion to the year of offset, is the latest date to which the time for the furnishing of the loss company’s re- turn may be extended under section 17(6) of the In- come Tax Act; or • within such further time as the Commissioner may allow. Third, the subvention payment must not be a pay- ment that would otherwise than under section 191A(2) be taken into account in calculating the as- sessable income of either the loss company or the profit company. Fourth, the loss company is required to give notice to the Commissioner of any subvention payment it receives. Amount of loss offset deductible by profit company - Subsection (2)(h) The amount of any loss offset (whether by way of election or subvention payment) is deductible by the profit company in the year of offset as if it were ex- penditure necessarily incurred in the production of assessable income during that year. Amount of loss offset assessable to loss company - Subsection (2)(i) The amount of any loss offset (whether by way of election or subvention payment) is deemed to be as- sessable income derived by the loss company in the year of offset. Subvention payment not a dividend - Subsection 2(j) Any subvention payment made by a profit company shall not be treated as a dividend paid by the profit company to the loss company. Loss Offset Notice Requirements - Subsection (3) Notices are required under section 191A(2) to be given to the Commissioner by the loss company where it: 38 • either elects that the whole or part of its loss be deducted from a profit company’s assessable in- come derived in the year of offset; or • receives a subvention payment from a profit com- pany. Every notice under subsection (2) is required to be given in writing and shall be given to the Commis- sioner: • not later than the 31st day of March that, in rela- tion to the year of offset, is the latest date to which the time for the furnishing of the loss company’s re- turn may be extended under section 17(6) of the In- come Tax Act; or • within such further time as the Commissioner may allow. Part Year Grouping - Subsections (4) and (5) Summary • Situation of loss or profit company sold or formed during an income year addressed. • Reciprocal situation of vendor or purchaser/sub- scriber group also addressed. • Part year grouping only allowed in relation to pe- riod where loss company maintains shareholder continuity and commonality of shareholding be- tween loss and profit companies is maintained. • Part year grouping is subject to the provision of adequate accounts. The general part year grouping rule is that only that part of the loss that is incurred in the same period as the profit is derived may be offset provided during that period: • the loss company maintains continuity of shareholding; and • commonality of shareholding between loss and profit companies has been maintained. Therefore, loss and profit “caps” (i.e. amounts al- lowed to be offset) are based on periods where con- tinuity and commonality requirements are satisfied in respect of all companies participating in a part year grouping arrangement. Loss company sold or formed during income year 1Pre-sale carried forward and current part year losses The carried forward and pre-sale current part year loss of the loss company may be offset against the pre-sale current part year profit of the vendor group.

Part year grouping situation for vendor group Section 191A(5), which relates to carried forward losses, is only relevant to the part year grouping situ- ation of vendor groups. 1Sale of loss company during income year The vendor group may offset its pre-sale current part year profit against the carried forward and pre-sale current part year loss of the loss company. 2Sale of profit company during income year The vendor group may offset its carried forward and pre-sale current part year loss against the pre-sale current part year profit of the profit company. Part year grouping situation for purchaser/subscriber group 1Sale/formation of loss company during income year The purchaser/subscriber group may offset its post- sale/formation current part year profit against the post-sale/formation current part year loss of the loss company. 2Sale/formation of profit company during income year The purchaser/subscriber group may offset its post- sale/formation current part year loss against the post-sale/formation current part year profit of the profit company.

A dual resident company itself is defined as any company which is: • resident in New Zealand; and • either - -treated pursuant to a double tax agreement (DTA) as not being resident in New Zealand for the purpose of the DTA; or -liable to income tax in another country or ter- ritory by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation. Anti-Avoidance Provision - Subsection (7) A deduction for a loss offset shall not be allowed in calculating the assessable income of any company where any shares in that company or in any other company have: • been subject to an arrangement; or • have had any rights attaching to them extinguished or altered by any means whatsoever for the pur- pose of enabling a company to meet the require- ments of subsection (2) so as to defeat the intent and application of section 191A. Example 10: Arrangement vulnerable to anti- avoidance provision All the shares in a prospective loss company are transferred prior to the income year in which that company starts to make a loss, subject to an ar- rangement that the shares will be transferred back to their original owners after the end of the loss year. The anti-avoidance provision will also apply where it is the shares of the parent com- pany of the prospective loss company that are ac- quired subject to a buy back arrangement. Adjustment Of Loss Offset Deductions - Subsection (8) The loss company may elect by notice in writing given to the Commissioner, within six months after the date on which the Commissioner gave the loss company notice of the loss reduction, to allocate the loss reduction to the original profit companies in such manner as the loss company, in its discretion, de- cides. Where a profit company is no longer a member of the same group of companies as the loss company (whether by sale or liquidation), the loss company cannot elect to allocate amounts of the loss reduc- tion in excess of the amount of loss reduction if it was prorated among the original profit companies. Where the election to allocate the reduced losses is not made, the loss reduction will be pro-rated. Treatment Of Groups Prior To 1992-93 Income Year - Subsection (9) This provision is relevant to the interpretation of sec- tion 191A(2)(c)(iii) and (iv) which require a profit company and a loss company to be in the same group of companies in the income year the loss was in- curred. Subsection (9) provides that, for pre 1992- 93 income years, the end of income year test for de- termining group of company status, which was the group of companies test under the former sec- tion 191, will continue to apply. This provision is necessary as the group of compa- nies test under new section 191, which requires commonality to be maintained at all times during an income year, only applies in respect of a full income year from the 1992-93 income year. Loss Offset Adjustment For Debt Remission - Subsection (10) Subsection (10) is similar to the debt remission pro- vision in the carry forward of loss provisions. It effectively imports section 188(6) into section 191A to allow the adjustment of loss offset deductions al- lowed under section 191A(2) where any debt com- prised in a loss giving rise to an offset deduction is subsequently remitted or cancelled. Where two or more profit companies have been al- lowed a deduction in respect of a loss company’s loss, and that loss is reduced under section 188(6), the adjustment of the loss offset deductions will be determined in accordance with section 191A(8). This is necessary because a particular debt (which is sub- sequently remitted or cancelled) is subsumed in a loss company’s loss in a particular income year. Where a loss company’s loss is offset against the assessable income of two or more profit companies, it is not possible to trace the part of the loss which arose from a particular debt which is subsequently remitted or cancelled. Non-Standard Accounting Year - Subsection (12) Every reference in section 191A to a year of offset, a preceding loss year or an income year is deemed to be a reference to the accounting year corresponding with that income year where a taxpayer has a non- standard accounting year. 42 Part Year Grouping in 1991-92 Income Year - Section 191B Section 26 inserts a new section 191B in the Income Tax Act relating to the current part year grouping of losses in the 1991-92 income year. Subsection (3A) of former section 191 (inserted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1991) required a group of companies to maintain commonality of ownership at all times from 30 July 1991 to the end of the loss company’s 1991/92 income year in order for it to be able to offset losses incurred in the 1991- 92 income year. The provision had the unintended effect of preventing companies acquired or formed after 30 July 1991 from grouping their post-acquisi- tion or post-formation 1991-92 profits or losses. Section 191B will allow companies acquired or formed after 30 July 1991 to offset their post-acqui- sition or post-formation 1991-92 profits or losses against the profits or losses of other members of the group they entered as a result of their acquisition or formation. A loss company utilising this provision is required to prepare and furnish to the Commissioner ad- equate accounts that relate to the part year of loss and detail the amount of loss reasonably and fairly attrib- utable to that part year. The former section 191(7A) will continue to apply to grouping of losses incurred in the 1991-92 income year. Therefore, part year grouping is allowed un- der new section 191B if the loss company maintains shareholder continuity of 40 percent under the old rules as modified from Budget night until the end of its 1992-93 income year. The continued application of former section 191(7A) in respect of the 1991-92 income year means that it is only the purchaser (or subscriber) of a loss com- pany that can take advantage of new section 191B. A vendor of a loss company in the 1991-92 income year would have automatically fallen foul of former sec- tion 191(7A). Deductibility of Interest on Money Borrowed to Acquire Shares in Group Companies - Section 106(1)(h)(ii) Section 16 amends section 106(1)(h)(ii) of the Income Tax Act, which allows a company to claim an inter- est deduction on money borrowed to acquire shares in another company in the same group as the borrow- ing company. Under the new section 191, two or more companies must be members of a group at all times during the income year to qualify as a group of companies for that income year. Section 16 effectively preserves the group of compa- nies definition under former section 191 in relation to section 106(1)(h)(ii). A company will therefore continue to be able to claim an interest deduction on money borrowed to acquire shares in another com- pany if both companies are members of the same group of companies at the end of an income year. State-Owned Enterprises - Repeal of Section 197B Section 28 repeals section 197B of the Income Tax Act, which effectively prevented one state-owned enter- prise grouping with another. Section 197B is no longer necessary in light of the new special corporate entity (which state-owned enterprises are a category of) provisions contained in new sections 8A to 8F, relating to the measurement of voting and market value interests. The definition of “state-owned enterprises” as being persons specified in the Fourteenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, contained in former section 197B, has been transferred by section 2(8) to section 2 of the Income Tax Act. Attributed Foreign Losses and Tax Credits - Consequential Amendments Sections 31, 32 and 33 make consequential changes to the provisions in Part IVA of the Act relating to at- tributed foreign losses and foreign tax credits. Part 3C - Carry Forward of Imputation Credits - Section 51 Section 51 introduces amendments to section 394E on the carry forward of credits in the imputation ac- count. Identical amendments are made to carry forward of credits in the dividend withholding payments ac- count and branch equivalent tax account. The changes made by sections 51, 57 and 60 apply the new provisions contained in sections 8A to 8F, as introduced by section 7 of this Amendment Act. Sec- tions 8A to 8F provide for the measurement of in- terests in a company. The changes : • reduce the continuity threshold from 75 percent to 66 percent; • replace the rights to profit test with tests using voting interests or market value interests; 43 • replace the exemptions provided to listed compa- nies, statutory producer boards and cooperative companies with new concessional tracing rules. With the exception of the continuity threshold, the credit carry forward provisions are thereby aligned with the loss carry forward rules. The changes re- duce compliance costs of taxpayers, especially widely held companies and correct some defects existing under the previous carry forward provi- sions. 66 Percent Continuity Of Shareholding - Section 394E(1)(g) Continuity of shareholding of at least 66 percent is measured by aggregating the minimum voting inter- ests and, where a market value circumstance exists, by aggregating the minimum market value interests held by shareholders of a company. Minimum vot- ing interests and minimum market value interests are discussed in Part 2 above in the context of losses. Where a market value circumstance exists, unless there is 66 percent continuity in shareholding using the voting interest test and 66 percent continuity us- ing the market value test, there will be a deemed debit to the imputation credit account balance at a specified time. The specified time is any time credit continuity is breached. Example 1: Debit Where 66 Percent Continuity Breached C Co has the following credits arising from tax payments. 7/7/93$100 7/11/93$100 7/2/94$300 From 1/4/93, voting rights attached to shares in C Co is held equally between K and L. On 14/ 1/94, L’s interest is sold to M. The continuity of shareholding has been breached with respect to credits arising before the breach. Debits arising to the imputation account are: 14/1/94$200 Assuming K and M continue to hold their respec- tive interests, the credit of $300 may be carried forward. Instruments Relevant to Measure- ment of Voting Interest and Market Value Interest - Sections 8A to 8F Generally, only instruments which carry rights to vote as described in section 8C are relevant to the measurement of voting interests. Instruments with nil or insignificant voting rights are generally ig- nored. For the purposes of credit continuity, how- ever, it is necessary to take into account instruments which are shares as defined in section 2 of the Act and in relation to which dividends are paid which may carry imputation credits. Fixed rate shares and section 192/195 debentures are shares as defined and may carry imputation credits. These instruments are taken into account to ensure greater accuracy in the determination of sharehold- ers interest in the company for credit continuity pur- poses. Only fixed rate shares and sections 192 and 195 de- bentures issued before the 1991 Budget, that is be- fore 8 pm of 30 July 1991 are ignored in the measure- ment of voting and market value interest. Deemed Market Value Circumstance - Section 8B The issue of certain instruments such as options, fixed rate shares and sections 192/195 debentures are deemed market value circumstances. The definition of the term “market value circumstances” is more fully discussed in Part 2 above. As regards fixed rate shares, only post-Budget fixed rate shares, if they fall within paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of market value circumstance give rise to deemed market value circumstances for purposes of the credit account continuity provisions. In addition, issues of post-Budget section 192/195 debentures are deemed market value circumstances. Tracing Concessions - Section 8E As discussed in Part 2 above, a person’s economic interest indirectly held in a company is calculated by multiplying down through interposed companies. To lower compliance and administrative costs, cer- tain attribution rules have been developed which are effectively tracing concessions for purposes of the loss and credit continuity provisions. Tracing concessions apply for interests of less than 10 percent, whether held directly or indirectly in a company. In addition tracing concessions are avail- able to companies for which full compliance would be extremely time consuming. Such companies are defined as “limited attribution companies” - the term is defined as meaning listed companies, widely held companies, limited attribution foreign companies, cooperative companies and building societies. Where a limited attribution company holds less than 50 percent directly of the voting or market value in- terest in a company, the shareholding of the com- pany may be attributed to the company itself. Ac- tual changes in the shareholding of the limited attri- bution company are ignored. The tracing concession would not apply where there is an actual breach in the continuity of shareholding ( which is not solely due to ordinary trading of shares between holders of less than 10 percent interest in the 44 company) and the directors of the company have actual or constructive knowledge of the breach. These concessions are more fully discussed in Part 2 above. The former tracing concessions contained in section 394E(3) to (4) for listed companies, statutory pro- ducer boards and its wholly owned subsidiaries and cooperative companies have been repealed. Date Debit Arises - Section 394E(2) The time the debit arises is the specified time. Continuity period - Section 394E(4)(b) Clarification is provided in section 394C(4)(b) that credit continuity is required from the time the credit arises to the time the debit arises, regardless of whether the continuity period spans several imputa- tion years. Order of debits - Section 394E(4)(c) Any amount of debit may be taken into account once only and is deemed to be offset against credits in the same order in which the credits arise. Credits Arising Before 16 December 1988 New section 394E(4)(d) repeats the old provision which preserves credits arising before 16 December 1988 despite breaches in continuity. This provision is necessary as continuity was not a requirement until 16 December 1988. Section 394E(4)(e) - Transitional Provisions: Credits Arising Before 1 April 1992 Pre-1 April 1992 credits are subject to the transitional provision in section 394E(4)(e). For carry forward into the period post 1 April 1992, those credits must satisfy the old continuity requirements as if the threshold was 66 percent and not 75 percent, in ad- dition to the new continuity requirements. Those credits in respect of which the old continuity require- ments are not complied with will be cancelled by a corresponding debit. In addition, because unused pre-April 1992 credits are deemed to arise on 1 April 1992, they are also subject to the new rules from that date. Example 2 (Illustrating transitional provision) D Co is an imputation credit account company with four shareholders A, B, C and D with 25 percent each of the rights to profits in the com- pany. The imputation credit account has the following transactions: CreditDebit 1/5/91$1500 1/7/91$500 6/2/92 $500 Closing balance 31/3/92$1500 The following share transfers occurred: 9/9/91B to E -25% 7/6/92C to E -25% Applying the old continuity provisions, there is a 50 percent change in shareholding as at 7/6/ 92. At the specified time, being 7/6/92, there has been a breach of the old continuity provi- sions. Applying the new continuity provisions, there is a 25 percent change in shareholding as at 7/6/ 92 (the pre-1 April 1992 credits being deemed to arise in the company’s imputation credit account on 1 April 1992). Continuity under the new pro- visions has been maintained. Continuity of both old and new provisions is re- quired. A debit of $1,000 arises. The $500 credit arising on 6 February 1992 is not lost because shareholder continuity has been maintained for that credit. Part 4 - Tax Recovery Introduction Section 34 replaces the tax recovery provision in sec- tion 276 with a better targeted tax recovery provision. Tax recovery using section 276 may apply to: • asset stripping arrangements; • directors of the company; • controlling shareholders of the company; • other shareholders of the company who have de- rived a benefit from the arrangement. Background The former provision enabled the Commissioner to recover tax from a successor of a company owing tax. A number of deficiencies were identified, its scope was too broad and its wording enabled companies to strip assets out so they were unable to fully meet their tax liabilities. The new provision addresses those deficiencies. It enables the Commissioner to re- cover tax from the shareholders and directors of the company responsible for the company’s actions which result in its not being able to satisfy its tax li- ability. 45 Purpose And Effect of An Arrangement - subsection (2) The tax recovery provision will apply where: • the arrangement entered into has the effect of leav- ing the company unable to satisfy its tax liability; and • it can be reasonably concluded that a purpose of the arrangement was to have this effect. It is not necessary that the purpose underlying the arrangement be a dominant purpose. Excluded Arrangements - Subsection (3) The tax recovery provision will not apply to: • arrangements, both formal and informal, to which the Commissioner is a party; • arrangements to the extent that such arrangements have been previously assessed and the tax duly paid; • any arrangement entered into at a time the com- pany is under statutory management. Example 1 ( To illustrate a type of excluded ar- rangement) Broke Co sells its only asset, making a profit of $1000. The tax liability of $330 is not paid. In- stead the company distributes the profits by way of dividend to its four shareholders. Tax total- ling $330 on the dividend income is paid by all four shareholders. The company is unable to pay its tax of $330. However, as the tax liability is equal to the tax paid by the shareholders, section 276 may not apply to this arrangement. Persons Liable - Directors and Shareholders - Subsections (4) and (5) Section 276 applies to recover income tax from those persons who had sufficient control of the company to have been party to the company’s decision to en- ter into an arrangement which leaves the company unable to meet its tax liability. The persons targeted are also the ones most likely to derive personal ben- efit from the arrangement. Directors per se, control- ling shareholders as defined and non-controlling shareholders who, by virtue of the benefits derived from the arrangement have been party to the arrange- ment, may be liable under this provision. Definition of Director - Subsection (1) For purposes of section 276 a director is a person occupying the legal office of director. Where a cor- porate entity does not have directorships, any trus- tee, manager or other person who acts in the same or similar fashion as a director would be treated as a director of that entity. Executive and Non-Executive Directors - Subsections (4) and (5B) Directorships can be broadly categorised into execu- tive directorships and non-executive directorships. With certain exceptions, both executive and non- executive directors may be jointly and severally liable for outstanding company tax under section 276. A director may avoid this liability where he or she: • casts a dissenting vote against that transaction or arrangement and gives notice of his or her dissent to the Commissioner at the first reasonable oppor- tunity after becoming aware of the arrangement, provided that the director concerned does not de- rive any benefit from the arrangement; or • is a non-executive director and it is proved that at all material times he or she did not benefit from the arrangement and further did not have actual knowledge of the arrangement. Example 2 ( To illustrate exclusions of liability for certain directors) (Assume for purposes of this example and exam- ples 3 and 4 that the shareholders in example 1 did not pay the tax on the dividend income re- ceived) Crooks and Brooks are executive directors of Broke Co. Crooks voted in favour of selling the company’s only asset. Brooks was uncertain about the application of section 276 and dis- sented. Brooks gives notice of his dissent to In- land Revenue the next day. Another director, Savvy is a non-executive director. Savvy voted in favour of the arrangement by proxy, without having any knowledge of the matters discussed. He finds out about the arrangement over drinks the day after the transaction is entered into. Savvy does not benefit from the transaction. Of the three directors, the Commissioner may apply section 276 to recover Broke Co’s unpaid tax from Crooks. Brooks is not liable because he dissented to the arrangement, notice of which was given to the Commissioner at the first oppor- tunity and further because he did not derive any benefit from it. Savvy is not liable because he is a non-executive director who, at all material times, did not derive any benefit from the ar- rangement and did not have actual knowledge of the arrangement. Subsection (1) - Definition of Controlling Shareholders A controlling shareholder is defined as any person with more than 50 percent voting interest or market value interest in a company at the time the arrange- ment is entered into. To determine if a person is a 46 controlling shareholder that person’s voting interest or market value interest is aggregated with the vot- ing interest or market value interest of associated persons. The term “associated persons” is defined in section 8 of the Act. Example 3 ( To illustrate the definition of “con- trolling shareholder” ) Broke Co’s shareholders are: Mr Mangle60 percent voting interest Mrs Mangle10 percent voting interest Susie10 percent voting interest John20 percent voting interest Susie is Mrs Mangle’s sister. Applying the asso- ciated persons test in section 8, Mr and Mrs Mangle and Susie are associated persons. Each of them are deemed to have controlling interests in Broke Co with 80% voting interest or market value interest each ( as the case may be ) in the company. Extent of Controlling Shareholders’ Liability - Subsection (5) Controlling shareholders may be liable for the com- pany’s outstanding tax to the limit of the greater of: • the market value of the controlling shareholder’s direct and indirect shareholding in the company at the time the arrangement is entered into (exclud- ing voting interests or market value interests of associated persons); and • the value of any benefit derived by the controlling shareholder. Example 4 (To illustrate the extent of a control- ling shareholder’s liability) Mr Mangle, Mrs Mangle and Susie received $300 each in dividends from profits arising from the arrangement to sell the asset. John received $100 of dividends. At the time the arrangement was entered into, the market value of the company was $500. The amount of tax to be recovered is $330. As the voting interests were held 60 percent (Mr Mangle), 10 percent (Mrs Mangle) and 10 percent (Susie), each may be liable to the extent as fol- lows: Mr Mangle The greater of: 60/100 x $500 = $300 (market value of interest), or $300 (benefit received) Limit $300 Mrs Mangle The greater of: 10/100 x $500 = $50 (market value of interest) or $300 (benefit received) Limit $300 Susie The greater of: 10/100 x $500 = $50 (market value of interest) or $300 Limit $300 Other Shareholders Other shareholders targeted by the tax recovery pro- vision are shareholders with less than 50 percent voting interest or market value interest in the com- pany, that is, non controlling shareholders. Example 5 ( To illustrate a non controlling share- holder) In the fact situation of Broke Co as assumed in the above examples, John has less than 50 per- cent voting interest in Broke Co. John is a non controlling shareholder. Liability of Non Controlling Shareholders - Subsection (5) A non controlling shareholder is liable where at the time the arrangement was entered into it could rea- sonably be concluded having regard to the materiality of the benefit derived by that shareholder, that the shareholder was a party to the arrangement. Whether or not a benefit received is of sufficient materiality in correlation to the interest held in a com- pany such that it may be reasonably concluded that a person was a party to an arrangement is a question of fact. Extent Of Non Controlling Shareholder’s Liability Where a non controlling shareholder is liable under section 276, the extent of that liability is determined in the same way that it is determined for controlling shareholders. Example 6 ( To illustrate extent of non control- ling shareholder’s liability) (Assume facts from examples 3,4 and 5) John received 1/10th of the total benefits distrib- uted from the arrangement ( $100 out of a total distribution of $1000 ). John’s market value interest is 20/100 x $500 = $100 John has received no greater benefit than his pro- portion of the shareholding in Broke Co. In the absence of other facts implicating John in the ar- rangement, it is not reasonable to conclude that John was a party to the arrangement. John is not liable for the company’s unpaid tax. 47 Liability As Agent Of Company - Subsections (4) (5) and (5A) Where section 276 is applicable, the tax liability of a company is recoverable from the directors and share- holders of the company as agents of the company. Section 268(3) of the Act on the liability of agents and principals states that agents shall be jointly and sev- erally liable where there are several agents. This may conflict with the section 276 provision of recovery from shareholders to the maximum of the sharehold- er’s interest in the company or benefit derived from the arrangement. To avoid such conflict section 276(5) overrides section 268(3) of the Act. Rights Of Objection To Assessment - Subsections (6) and (7) The Commissioner will raise an assessment on the corporate tax-payer who may exercise rights of ob- jection to assessments disputed according to pre- scribed procedure under the Act. Where the com- pany assessed has been wound up, objection rights will be granted to the directors and shareholders from whom recovery is sought. Statutory Limitation On Amended Assessments - Subsection (8) Section 25 of the Act imposes a four year limitation to the issue of amended assessments. Section 276 will not apply where the time limitation has expired in relation to amended assessments. Section 276 will also not apply to the issue of original assessments where the corporate tax-payer has been wound up, provided its final return has been furnished to Inland Revenue by the due date for filing prescribed in sec- tion 17 of the Act. Application Date The new recovery provision in section 276 may ap- ply to any arrangement entered into after the 30th of July 1991 in respect of any income year assessment. Arrangements entered into after 30th July 1991 may be subject to the old and new tax recovery provisions, at the option of the Commissioner. Part 5 - Qualifying Company Regime they are treated in a manner that is closer to that of a partnership. This new status will offer shareholders tax free access to capital gains derived by closely-held companies without having to wind the company up. In addition, a second type of qualifying company has been created, a loss attributing qualifying company. This type of company, as the name suggests, can attribute losses directly to its shareholders. Introduction An elective regime for the taxation of closely-held companies as outlined in section 48 (which introduces a new Part XIIAA of the principal Act) will take ef- fect from the 1992-93 income year. The main objective of the qualifying company regime is to treat, as far as possible, the shareholders and the closely-held company as one entity. To this end Liability For Additional Tax/Late Payment Penalties - Subsection (5) Where the company is charged penalties or addi- tional taxes for late payment, the Commissioner may recover that amount outstanding as part of the tax liability outstanding. Allocation of Liability Among Shareholders For Additional Tax/ Penalties Liability among shareholders whether controlling shareholders or non controlling shareholders or both is apportioned in the same proportion as those per- sons are liable for the principal tax amounts. Example 7 ( To illustrate the allocation of liabil- ity for additional tax/penalties ) From the above examples, the extent of the shareholder’s liability has been determined as: Mr Mangle- $300 } Mrs Mangle - $300 } 90% of $330 tax outstand- ing Susie- $300 } Accordingly each of the three shareholders above may be made liable for up to 90 percent of the total amount of additional tax/penalties. Assuming penalties total $100, each may be li- able for up to $90 of penalties. Allocation Of Liability Among Directors And Shareholders Section 276 does not prescribe how the liability will be allocated between the directors and shareholders. The Commissioner will be able to chose the persons who will be made liable under section 276. The per- sons who are required to pay the tax will be notified via a notice of recovery. Once the debt has been sat- isfied in full, the Commissioner will notify them of their release from liability. 48 The legislation is developed so that taxpayers must first determine whether they fulfil the criteria to be a qualifying company. Both the shareholders and directors of the company must elect by way of a no- tice that the company should be a qualifying com- pany. In addition, certain rules are developed for revocation and cessation of such status. The treatment of the taxation of shareholders and the determination of exempt and imputed dividends from a qualifying company is outlined. In addition, for a company to become qualifying company, quali- fying company election tax must be determined and paid. Then the criteria and mechanisms for becoming a loss attributing qualifying company and the treatment of those losses are discussed. Finally, the transitional measures are outlined, together with the special con- cessions that are available providing the election to be a qualifying company is made before 31 March 1993. Background The Valabh Consultative Committee, in its interim and final reports on the Taxation of Distributions from Companies (released in November 1990 and Budget night 1991 respectively), made recommen- dations on the taxation of closely-held companies. This has formed the foundation for the qualifying company regime. Interpretation - Section 393A Summary • the distinction made between cash and non cash dividends is maintained for distributions from qualifying companies; • a new term of effective interest is introduced. Dividends The definition of dividends that applies to Part XIIAA of the Act is that which applies generally in the Act. However, in relation to dividends paid by qualifying companies, the focus will be on cash-divi- dends and taxable bonus issues, as outlined below. Effective interest A new term, “effective interest”, is introduced. It is necessary to determine a shareholder’s effective interest in a company in order to: • determine the appropriate proportion of a qualify- ing company’s tax liability a shareholder assumes; • determine when certain shareholder elections can be made by majority shareholders; and • serve as the basis for attributing losses of loss at- tributing qualifying companies. The definition of an effective interest picks up on the ownership rules under sections 8A to 8E. The share- holder’s voting interest will primarily determine the effective interest in the company. However, where a market value circumstance exists, the average of market value and voting interest must be taken. An effective interest may be determined at any point in time as being that person’s voting interest (or aver- age of voting and market value interest where appro- priate) in the qualifying company at that time. De- termination of a shareholder’s effective interest on this basis is relevant in applying section 393D. A shareholder’s effective interest may also be deter- mined in respect of an income year. For this purpose, where a shareholder’s voting or market value inter- est in a company varies during the year a weighted average of that voting or market value interest is taken. Example 1 - determining effective interest A shareholder has a voting interest for 5 months of the year of 60%. The shareholder reduces his/ her shareholding to 20 % for the remaining 7 months. The person’s effective interest for the year is: ( .60 x 5) + (.20 x 7 ) 1212 =.25 + .12 =.37 or 37 % The shareholder will therefore be liable for 37% of the total tax assessed for that income year if the company defaults, or be entitled to 37% of the company’s losses if it is a loss attributing quali- fying company. The use of a weighted average to determine a share- holder’s interest where the interest varies should also accommodate part year entry and exit of the share- holder from the regime (Refer section 393H(2) for ability to modify this rule) Any reference to an income year also includes a ref- erence to a non-standard income year. 49 Criteria for Entry into the Regime - Section 393B Summary • certain criteria must be met for companies to qualify for the regime; • special look through rules are developed to ensure that the numbers test is correctly measured; • exceptions to the look through rules in cases of death and divorce of shareholders are catered for, to ensure the numbers test is not breached in those situations. Criteria Companies will be eligible to enter the qualifying company regime so long as the following criteria are met: • at any time during the income year the company is not a foreign company; • the company has at all times five or fewer share- holders or, alternatively, it is at all times a body corporate through which shareholders obtain use of residential property; • each shareholder in the company is at all times a natural person, or trustee of a trust where all divi- dend income from a qualifying company is distrib- uted to beneficiaries, or another qualifying com- pany (subject to look through provisions); • the company receives during the year no more than $10,000 of foreign non-dividend income. Total as- sessable income from financial arrangements in- volving foreign transactions is ignored for the pur- poses of computing whether the $10,000 is breached to the extent that such revenue is less than 10% of the company’s total assessable revenue; • the shareholders and directors have at all times elected that the company be a qualifying company and these elections have not been revoked. How- ever, majority shareholders can elect on behalf of minority shareholders as long as the majority shareholders assume the minority's liability; • The shareholders must also assume personal re- sponsibility for the income tax payable by the com- pany. In general, of course, the company will meet its tax liabilities; • the company has not ceased to be a qualifying com- pany as a result of ceasing to be a loss attributing qualifying company. In addition, the company cannot be a unit trust (as defined in section 211(1)). In certain circumstances where a person fails any one of these criteria, the Commissioner can determine the date on which the company ceases to be a quali- fying company (refer section 393G). Determination of the numbers test Shareholders related by blood or marriage within one degree (e.g. parent/child, husband/wife) are deemed to be one shareholder. It is important to note that brothers and/or sisters are not related to within one degree. The death or dissolution of marriage of shareholders will not break the one degree test, pro- vided that the relevant persons were, prior to the event, treated as a single shareholder. Where the shareholder is a company, provision has been made to look through the shareholder company to their ultimate shareholders under section 393B(3)(a). Where shares in a company are held by a trustee, the shareholders in respect of that trustee’s interest are the persons who have derived beneficiary income or those persons (other than the trustee) who made a shareholder election under section 393D(2), which- ever group is larger in number. In such circum- stances, the trustee is not treated as a shareholder for the purposes of the shareholder count test. Shares held by a nominee are also deemed to be held by the person and not the nominee. A general anti-avoidance provision is included, dis- allowing entry into the regime if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the shares have been subject to an arrangement for the purposes of making them a qualifying company so as to defeat the intention and purpose of the regime Example 2: Shareholder Count Test Shareholders Jack- Father Jane- Wife (step mother) Paul- Son Pauline- Paul’s wife Company A- Qualifying company with Jack, Jane, Paul and Mary (Jack’s sis- ter), and Joe (unrelated). Trust-Beneficiaries, Sandra (Jack’s first wife and mother of chil- dren), Paul (20 years old), Susan (12 years old). For the qualifying company regime, there are only four shareholders. Jack - Jane, Paul, Susan (1 degree from Jack). Joe (unrelated shareholder) Pauline (2 degrees from Jack) Mary (2 degrees from Jack) Sandra (divorced wife, but divorced before com- pany was a qualifying company) It is important to note that the shareholder numbers test does not impact on the determination of each individual shareholder’s effective interest calcula- tion. 50 Elections Summary • To qualify under the regime both shareholders and directors must file notices of elections; • shareholders will also be personally liable for any income tax not met by the company; • all shareholders must file election notices; although a majority election removes the requirement for minority shareholders to file election notices; • elections will generally take effect from the begin- ning of the next income year following receipt of the notice; • certain events will trigger a revocation of a notice; • periods of grace under each of the circumstances are allowed for subsequent elections to be made, thus ensuring the continuance of qualifying status; • the revocation of an election will take effect from the beginning of the year the event took place; • the loss of qualifying status, either through revo- cation or failure to fulfil the criteria, is subject to the Commissioner’s discretion to extend the revo- cation date in certain circumstances. Elections In general, elections take effect on the first day of the income year following the election, although, com- panies may nominate future income years. There- fore, elections must be made within the income year which precedes the year in which the company wishes to qualify. However, a newly-formed company can nominate to be a qualifying company from the first day of the company’s first income year. This is providing such an election is made no later than the time for furnish- ing the company’s first income tax return. Directors’ elections - Section 393C All directors must elect by notice in writing to the Commissioner that the company should be a quali- fying company. A directors’ election may be revoked only by the board of directors notifying the Commissioner. This revocation of election will result in the company no longer meeting the criteria for qualifying company status from the beginning of the income year in which the notice is received by the Commissioner or the later income year specified in the notice. Shareholder elections - Section 393D All shareholders who are sui juris (of legal capacity) must elect by notice in writing to the Commissioner (via a “shareholder election”) that the company should become a qualifying company. They will also be liable for the company’s income tax assessed, based on their respective effective interests in the company. If the shareholder is a trustee, then the trustee and one or more natural person beneficiaries who are sui juris must elect. If there are no sui juris beneficiar- ies, then a natural person (who could be the trustee) must assume liability for the trust’s effective interest and complete a shareholder election. The liability for tax will be to the extent of the net assets of the trust in the case of the trustee, and jointly and severally for the beneficiary or person assuming the benefici- ary’s liability (which could be the trustee). In determining who has to make the election it is important to note that the look through rules only apply for the count test and not for the election re- quirements. Where a chain of qualifying companies exists, only the shareholder qualifying company must complete a shareholder election and assume liability. Similarly, in the case of a nominee interest it is the nominee who elects. Majority shareholder elections One or more sui juris shareholders whose interest exceed fifty percent may elect that the company should become a qualifying company, if in addition to their own liability, they assume that of the minor- ity shareholders. Revocation of shareholder elections - Section 393E A shareholder can revoke an election by notice in writing to the Commissioner. The revocation will take effect from the beginning of the income year in which the notice is received by the Commissioner or any future income year specified in the notice. Any revocation will result in the company not being a qualifying company from the beginning of the rel- evant income year. The following events will result in previous elections being revoked: 1. notice of revocation by shareholder(s); 2. death of a shareholder; 3. sale of the shares to a person who is not currently a shareholder in the qualifying company; 4. a beneficiary of a trust becoming sui juris in cer- tain circumstances; 5. a minority shareholder becoming a majority shareholder and vice versa; 6. any one person of two or more persons who have jointly made an election revoking that election. Periods of grace for each of the events - Section 393F However, a company will not cease to be a qualify- ing company if any of the following occurs: • the company would have been a qualifying com- pany but for the death of the person and the com- 51 pany meets all of the criteria for being a qualifying company within 12 months -for example, by a new shareholder as the executor making a shareholder election within that twelve month period; • any other person eligible to make a shareholder election under section 393D makes or is deemed to have made an election within 63 days after the date of a shareholder revocation; • the acquiring shareholder makes an election within 63 days of the sale or disposal of the shares by the shareholder. • the sui juris beneficiary (where no sui juris benefi- ciary was present before) or a subsequent sui juris beneficiary (where an existing sui juris beneficiary does not want to accept liability for the new sui juris beneficiary) or a majority shareholder makes a shareholder election with 63 days of the first ben- eficiary becoming sui juris; • the minority shareholder makes an election within 63 days of becoming a majority shareholder, or the new majority shareholder makes an election in re- spect of the minority shareholding within 63 days; • a jointly made election is revoked due to any of the events listed above, and a new election is made within the relevant period of grace; • in the case of an issue or allotment of any shares to a person who is not currently a shareholder, the new shareholder makes a shareholder election within 63 days. The Commissioner may extend the periods of grace upon application by either the company or the per- son making the shareholder election. In addition, where an election is revoked and a sub- sequent election is taken up in its place, the latter election is deemed to take effect at the beginning of the income year in which the revocation event or notice took place. The voting (or market value) in- terests of the new shareholder are taken into account in determining the new shareholder’s effective inter- est from the time of first becoming a shareholder in that income year (by virtue of section 394A(2)). Date on which a non-complying company ceases to be a qualifying company - Section 393G Where a qualifying company ceases to fulfil the cri- teria to be such, the company will generally cease to a qualifying company from the beginning of the in- come year in which the event occurred. However, if at the time the event occurred the com- pany could not have been reasonably expected to know that it did not qualify, it can apply to the Com- missioner for a later time of revocation. The Com- missioner may specify a later date on which the com- pany shall cease to be treated as a qualifying com- pany. Events which might trigger the application of this section could include, for example: • a company had an overseas account which it was not aware of for the past three years which has re- sulted in the company tripping the threshold level for foreign income. Generally, the company would lose its status from the beginning of the three year period; or • a shareholder gifted all of its shares to another per- son who was overseas for two years, out of con- tact and unaware that she or he was required to make an election. The shareholder subsequently chooses to decline to make an election. Normally, the time of revocation would be from the beginning of the year in which the shares were gifted, but clearly the Commissioner would exercise his dis- cretion in this instance. Liability of electing shareholder for tax of the company - Section 393H This section determines that the shareholder who has elected for the company to be a qualifying company will be liable for any percentage of the company’s income tax liabilities arising under Part IV of the In- come Tax Act 1976 as if the shareholder was an agent of the company. Moreover, neither the company nor the shareholder/agent will be precluded from an assessment. In general, a shareholder’s part year liability will be satisfied through the weighted average formula. However, the Commissioner can reduce this liabil- ity where shares are sold or disposed of and ad- equate accounts are kept which support a lower amount, and the Commissioner is satisfied, based on the circumstances, that the liable portion com- puted using the weighted average calculation of ef- fective interest would be inappropriate. Taxation of Shareholders - Section 393I Summary • dividends that shareholders receive will either be exempt, fully imputed or returns of 10 year bonus issues; • the costs of providing a non cash benefit to a share- holder will be denied to the company as these ben- efits are exempt dividends in the hands of such shareholders. Dividends A dividend to a resident shareholder from a quali- fying company will either be fully imputed or ex- empt. The distinction is determined under section 393M of the Act. This generally means that where the company pays no tax on a profit such as capital prof- its, they will flow through to the shareholder tax free. Shareholders of some qualifying companies will be able to elect to also have access to the company’s losses. This type of loss attribution qualifying com- 52 pany is covered in more detail under section 393N. Where a non-employee shareholder receives in-kind benefits, the cost of providing such benefits (e.g. in- terest) will be non-deductible to the qualifying com- pany. In addition, the benefit (non-cash dividend) will be exempt to the shareholder by virtue of section 393M. Where a shareholder has borrowed money to acquire shares in a qualifying company, the interest cost attributable to the loan will only be deductible in any income year to the extent that it exceeds the value of non-cash dividends that the shareholder receives in that year. Where a dividend arises through the making avail- able of any property to a shareholder, this dividend will be deemed to be paid and derived at the end of each quarter of the qualifying company’s income year. Note that the concession in section 4(10) for the time of payment for s4(1)(e0 dividends does not ap- ply. Taxation of Qualifying Companies - Section 393J Summary • qualifying companies will be taxed on all dividends they receive from other companies; • losses are restricted in certain circumstances so that they can only be grouped with those of other quali- fying companies; • No RWT will be deducted on dividends paid to a qualifying company prior to 1 April 1992. Taxation of qualifying companies Qualifying companies will be taxed on all dividends they receive. For the 1992-93 income year this means that qualifying companies with early balance dates will be taxed on dividends prior to 1 April, when the general inter-corporate dividend exemption is re- moved (unless those dividends derived by the quali- fying company were from other companies within a 100% commonly owned group). It also means that the exemption until 1 April 1994 for dividends paid on redeemable preference shares issued prior to the Budget will not apply to qualifying companies receiv- ing such dividends. Losses are restricted for grouping purposes, in that a qualifying company in profit can only offset against another qualifying company in the same group in loss. However, this does not restrict the offsetting of qualifying company losses against non-qualifying company profits. No resident withholding tax will be deducted on dividends paid to a qualifying company prior to 1 April 1992. Imputation credits attached to dividends received by the company will be credited to its imputation credit account and will be available to offset its tax liabili- ties. Foreign dividend withholding payment cred- its attached to dividends received by a qualifying company may be credited to its dividend withhold- ing payment account, where the company maintains such an account. Foreign dividends are exempt un- der section 63 of the Act, and subject to the dividend withholding payment regime Qualifying Company Election Tax (QCET) - Section 393K Summary • companies must determine the extent of QCET upon entry into the regime; • the determination of QCET is based on an artificial winding up of the company and is payable at the company tax rate (33%) (see Page 57 for transitional rules); • any losses available to be carried forward upon entry into the regime are automatically lost; • payment of QCET must be made by the company’s terminal tax date for the income year the election applies to (generally, 7 February of the following year). Determination of QCET Dividends paid by a qualifying company to its share- holders will either have maximum imputation cred- its and/or dividend withholding payment credits , attached or be exempt from tax. It is therefore nec- essary to provide an entry tax on the company’s re- serves at the time of entry into the qualifying com- pany regime, as once the company is a qualifying company those reserves will subsequently be tax free to the extent that credits are not attached . The tax on such reserves is referred to as the “qualifying com- pany election tax” or QCET. The company will pay this tax on the amount calcu- lated in accordance with the following formula (broadly, this is the amount which would have been taxable if the company were to wind up): (a - b - c ) x d d where a is the amount available to be a dividend if distributed to shareholders under a deemed winding up excluding ten year bonus issues that are still “serving time”; b is the assessable income (or loss) that would have arisen from the disposal of the company’s assets and liabilities (i.e. such unrealised amounts are not subject to QCET but are carried across into the quali- fying company regime); c is the aggregated balance of the company’s ICA and DWP account prior to becoming a qualifying company (subject to an anti- avoidance provision); 53 d is the resident company income tax rate expressed as a decimal. In addition, on entry into the regime all losses car- ried forward are not available to be used by the quali- fying company. This includes foreign losses and for- eign investment fund losses. With respect to the ten year bonus issues “serving time” where they flow through to the shareholder within the ten year period, such a dividend will be fully taxable and not exempt. Example 3: Determination of QCET A company’s balance sheet (QC Co) on the last day of the 1992/93 income year is as follows. Assets Current Assets Bank10,000 Trading Stock30,000 Debtors 5,00045,000 Fixed Assets Land135,000 Building200,000 Less accumulated depreciation 35,000165,000 Fixture and Fittings80,000 Less accumulated depreciation 45,000 35,000 Shares10,000 Intangible Assets Goodwill30,000375,000 420,000 Liabilities Creditors 30,000 Mortgage150,000180,000 Shareholders’ Funds Capital175,000 Revenue Reserve 65,000240,000 420,000 Other Information: Shares in this case are deemed to be taxable under s65(2)(e). Originally purchased for $9,000. Building has a market value of $220,000. Fixtures and fittings have a market value of $80,000 Imputation credits =15,500 CR Foreign dividend withholding credits = 4,500 CR Losses carried forward =(100,000) Capital includes $30,000 bonus issue shares arising from the capitalisation of revenue reserves on 1 April 1990 (non-taxable bonus issue shares) 54 It is argued that in simple cases an alternative way of calculating QCETcan be determined as follows: a - †b† = QCET c Where a is revenue reserves plus the amount that would be assessable income to the share- holder upon liquidation of the company, less the revaluation of "revenue" type as- sets b is the aggregate balance of the company's ICA and DWP accounts c is .33 Therefore, in the above example: a= 65,000 + 30,000 - 1,000 = 94,000 b= 20,000 c= .33 QCET= 94,000 - 20,000 .33 = 11,020 Payment of QCET - Section 393L The payment of this QCET must be made by the com- pany’s due date for paying income tax as determined under section 388(2). The Commissioner will also require at the date of payment a form setting out relevant details of the company. Additional tax will be levied if the company fails to pay the tax within the stated time period. In addi- tion, the Commissioner can make a default or amended assessment and the company will have the usual objection procedures available to it. The QCET and any additional tax will be treated like income tax and as such is not deductible to the company. This also means that QCET may be subject to the provi- sional tax use-of-money interest provisions. Dividends from a Qualifying Company - Section 393M Summary • this section only applies to dividends paid to resi- dent shareholders; • imputation and dividend withholding payment credits are grossed up to determine the amount of dividends that are imputed. A return of a 10 year bonus issue will still be assessable to the share- holder. Dividends not imputed or a return of a 10 year bonus issue are exempt from income tax; • No FBT is levied on non-cash dividends derived by shareholders of qualifying companies prior to 1 April 1992; • companies can only attach credits to dividends that are cash dividends or taxable bonus issues; • the 66% shareholder continuity requirement to carry forward imputation credits does not apply to qualifying companies. QCET a=175,000 (Note 1) b=80,000 (dep. recovered: Note 2) + 1,000 (sale of shares) =81,000 c=20,000 d=.33 QCET=(a - b - c ) x d d =(175,000 - 81,000 - 20,000) x .33 .33 QCET=11,020 In addition, the company loses all of its losses carried forward upon entry into the regime. Note 1: Assets upon realisation =520,000 less liabilities=180,000 340,000 less capital175,000 bonus issue 30,000145,000 Capital gain on building 20,000 175,000 Note 2: Buildings Market value=220,000 Book value= 165,000 Gain=55,000 Accum. depreciation=35,000 Therefore, depreciation recovered is only $80,000. Fixture: Fittings Market value=80,000 Book value= 35,000 Gain=45,000 Accum. depreciation=45,000 55 The amount of imputation credits that may be attached to the cash dividends is computed as the lesser of : • Maximum Imputation credits 31/3/93 33 x 25,000 = 12,313 67 • Amount calculated using the formula 4,500 x 10,0001,800 25,000 4,500 x 15,0002,7004,500 25,000 The lesser amount is therefore $4,500. The amount assessable to the shareholder there- fore is: Imputation credits ora4,500= 13,636. .33b.33 The second step is to determine the proportion of exempt dividends. This can be computed in the following manner: Total dividend29,500 less assessable dividend 13,636 Exempt dividend15,864 Finally, the shareholder’s position would be determined as follows: Assessable dividend=13,636 Tax (assuming 33% bracket)=4,500 Imputation credits (4,500) Balance taxablenil The imputation account of the qualifying com- pany is reduced to zero. Where a qualifying company maintains a dividend withholding payment account, the attaching of divi- dend withholding payment credits to cash and tax- able bonus issue dividends distributed during an imputation year is computed under section 393M(4) in a parallel manner to that of the crediting of ICA credits. Any non-cash dividends paid to shareholders before 1 April 1992 will not be subject to FBT. Moreover, where a shareholder has a late balance date and a dividend is derived between 31 March and the share- holder’s balance date, that dividend is deemed to be derived by the shareholder in the shareholder’s next income year. The shareholder cannot utilise the imputation cred- its to any of the exempt component of the dividends for the calculation of its individual tax liability. Where a qualifying company receives a refund which places its ICA into debit, the company is entitled to the refund provided that the overpaid tax was not part of an avoidance arrangement. The company dividend statement and shareholder dividend statement required under the imputation Determination of exempt and imputed dividends This section determines the amount of dividends fully imputed and the amount exempt to the share- holder. Where a dividend paid by the company to a resident shareholder exceeds the amount of dividend calculated under the formula, that excess is exempt income in the hands of the shareholder. As this sec- tion only applies to resident shareholders, all divi- dends paid to non-resident shareholders of qualify- ing companies will be assessable and liable to non- resident withholding tax. The formula grosses up the imputation and dividend withholding payment credits by the company tax rate and treats the balance over the dividend as ex- empt. The formula is: a + b c Where:a is the amount of imputation credits attached to the dividends; b is the amount of dividend withholding payment credits attached to the divi- dends; and c is the resident company tax rate ex- pressed as a decimal. Imputation and dividend withholding payment cred- its may be attached only to cash dividends and tax- able bonus issues. The amount of any credits that may be attached to dividends paid during an imputation year (item a) is calculated at the end of each imputation year and is the lesser of: • the maximum imputation credits able to be at- tached under the imputation regime (section 394G(1)); and • the amount calculated using the following formula: a x b c Wherea is the balance in the company’s ICA on the last day of the imputation year in which the dividend is paid; b is the amount of the dividend exclud- ing imputation credits; c is the aggregate of all dividends paid excluding imputation credits A similar exercise is required for dividend withhold- ing payment credits. Example 4: Determination of exempt and im- puted dividends A company has distributed $25,000 cash during the 1992/93 imputation year, in two instalments of $10,000 and $15,000. Its ICA account has a credit balance of $4,500 as at 31 March 1993. 56 provisions must be issued to the shareholder and a reconciliation statement filed by 31 May following the imputation year. A qualifying company must in- form its shareholders in the shareholder dividend statements of the portions of dividends which are ex- empt and taxable. There is no ability to refund ex- cess imputation credits, although excess dividend withholding payment credits are refundable in the normal manner. The continuity requirement (66%) for maintaining an imputation credit account balance does not apply to qualifying companies. Where a company ceases to be a qualifying company there is a debit to the ICA which is equal to the lesser of: • the balance at that time (after attaching maximum possible imputation credits to the dividends paid during the imputation year and up to that time); and • the greatest previous balance in the ICA at that date of any prior breach of the 66% continuity rule. Loss Attributing Qualifying Company (LAQC) - Section 393N Summary • a qualifying company must satisfy additional cri- teria to be a LAQC; • additional election requirements must be met and certain revocation rules apply along similar lines to the qualifying company status requirements; • losses generally will be attributable to sharehold- ers in the proportion of their effective interest in the company; • a LAQC can make a further election to retain for- eign losses at the company level; • the loss of LAQC status automatically ceases the company to be a qualifying company as well. Criteria A company can elect to be a loss attributing qualify- ing company if all the following criteria are met: • the company is a qualifying company; • all shares in the company carry the same rights to; -exercise voting power concerning - .distributions by the company .constitution of the company .variation in capital .appointment of directors; -receive profits; -receive distribution of net assets; -receive distributions of paid up capital; -receive distributions of qualifying share pre- mium. • a notice of election in writing by either a share- holder or a director in the company is furnished to the Commissioner before the beginning of the in- come year (or the date for filing a return for a newly incorporated company which has not been re- voked); and • no share of the company has been subject to an arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the section. Revocation of Election to be a Loss Attributing Qualifying Company - Section 393O The notice of election to be a loss attributing quali- fying company (LAQC) can be revoked by any sui juris shareholder or director. The company shall cease to be a LAQC from the beginning of that in- come year in which the notice is received by the Com- missioner, or a later year if specified. Where any director or shareholder dies, sells/dis- poses of the company’s shares, or new shares are issued or allotted, the acquiring person (not already being a shareholder in the LAQC) must furnish a replacement election within the required time; in the case of death this is 12 months, and for the sale or issuing of shares, 63 days. Losses - Section 393P Losses (including foreign losses and foreign invest- ment fund losses) will be directly attributable to the shareholder in the proportion of the shareholder’s effective interest. The losses will be deductible against the shareholder’s other income, but foreign attributed loss and foreign investment fund losses can only be offset against foreign attributed income and foreign investment fund income respectively, as governed by the international regime. In general, no losses can be carried forward by the company as they are attributed to the shareholder. However, no loss will be attributed where the share- holder suffers no, or substantially no, economic or financial loss. In this case the losses will be lost to the company and the shareholder. To be able to elect to be a loss attributing company, the company must have been a qualifying company at all times during the income year. The company must also furnish a notice in writing to the Commis- sioner before the first day of the income year or the date of filing a return for a newly incorporated com- pany. This notice must be executed by each share- holder who is sui juris at the date the notice is fur- nished and no revocation of the loss election is in effect for that year. This election can be revoked by any sui juris share- holder, with effect from the beginning of the next 57 income year. However, where all sui juris sharehold- ers revoke the election, the effective date of revoca- tion is the beginning of the income year in which the notice is furnished to the Commissioner. Attributed Foreign Losses and Foreign Investment Fund Losses - Section 394Q A company can elect to retain these “foreign” losses at the company level and carry them forward in or- der to more readily utilize them against foreign at- tributed income or foreign investment fund income. Where a company prior to becoming a LAQC had carried forward foreign losses or foreign investment fund losses, the losses will continue to be carried forward by the company notwithstanding the revo- cation of election. Ceasing to be a LAQC - Section 393R Once a company ceases to be a LAQC it also ceases to be a qualifying company from the beginning of the next income year. However, the company can reapply to be a qualifying company and pay another QCET. Transitional Period - Section 393S Summary • companies have until 31 March 1993 by which to elect to be qualifying companies and take advan- tage of the lower QCET rate; • payment of QCET will typically be due by 7 Feb- ruary 1994; • QCET in the transitional period is calculated at the concessional rate of 7.5% on its taxable reserves. • the company will lose 25% of any losses carried forward upon entry into the regime. Transitional period Any election (directors, shareholders, loss attribut- ing and foreign loss elections) made under the pre- vious sections before 31 March 1993 for a company to be a qualifying company in the 1992/93 income year, will be deemed to take effect from the first day of the 1992-93 income year, unless the notice of elec- tion specifies a later income year of application. If such an election is made, the company is subject to the lower QCET rate of 7.5%. The payment of the QCET is governed by section 388(2). This will typi- cally be 7 February 1994. Concessional rate of QCET - Section 393T As a concessional transitional measure, where a company elects under section 393S to become a quali- fying company, a rate of 7.5 % will apply. The amount of QCET payable will be the lesser of the amount calculated under s393K(2) or the amount calculated under the transitional formula. However, tax at the full company rate is payable on the excess of exempt dividends received over divi- dends paid during the period from November 1990 until the date of election to the extent those dividends do not carry credits. This is to prevent companies paying exempt dividend income prior to 1 April 1992 to a company which will make the election to become a qualifying company, thereby taking advantage of the concessional QCET rate. On entry into the regime, a company must also can- cel 25% of its losses. This is equivalent to forfeiting a tax benefit of around 7.5% QCET. QCET under this transitional period is calculated as follows: QCET =(a - b - c - e) x .075 + (e x d) d wherea, b, c, d have the same meaning as s.393K (see page 52). e = (f + g - g )-( h + i - i ) dd wherefis all dividends received by the company (excluding imputation and dividend withholding payment credits) exempt during the period from 30 November 1990 until the first day of the company’s 1992-93 income year (the relevant pe- riod); g is all credits attached to dividends in item f; h is all dividends (excluding credits) paid by the company in the relevant period; iis all credits attached to dividends in item h; Essentially item “e” is the amount of unimputed ex- empt dividends received, less unimputed exempt dividends paid by the company during the relevant period. 58 Example 5: Determination of QCET in the transitional period Revisiting the earlier example, the company’s balance sheet (QC Co) is as follows.

This Bulletin deals with the remaining issues included in that Act, some of which were added via a Sup- plementary Order Paper. These issues are: • the Interim Depreciation regime; • the adoption of the Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee’s interim report; • An amendment to section 56A to provide for Cyclone Val donations; • Minor changes to section 197C (energy trading operators), and to section 55 of the GST Act; • Local Authority taxation changes. A further amendment act, the Real Estate Agents Amendment Act 1992, has made major changes to the treatment of real estate salespersons. The tax consequences of this change are discussed in detail in this bulletin. 3 Depreciation Changes Introduction The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 intro- duces new provisions into the Income Tax Act to deal with changes to depreciation announced by the Gov- ernment late last year. Background On 16 December 1991 the Government announced the application of a 25% loading to the current rates of depreciation allowed for: • New depreciable assets (excluding buildings) • Imported second hand assets (excluding motor- cars) used in New Zealand for the first time • Primary sector land improvements • Bloodstock used for horsebreeding. The 25% loading generally applies to these assets where they are acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive), and first used on or before 31 March 1994. The loading is designed to bring New Zealand depre- ciation rates more into line with rates available in other countries. From 1 April 1993 a new deprecia- tion regime will be put in place once the review of Inland Revenue's current depreciation rates is com- pleted. On 16 December 1991 the Government also an- nounced changes to the taxation treatment of fruit trees and vines. This will allow orchardists to write off the residual value of their trees when they are scrapped. A new section 108A has been introduced into the Income Tax Act to provide for the 25% loading on ordinary depreciation rates for qualifying assets and qualifying capital improvements. The ordinary rates of depreciation are those allowed by the Commis- sioner under section 108 of the Act and include those rates allowed which are not contained in the pub- lished schedule. The loading also applies to rates of depreciation for plant and machinery, which include a supplementary shift allowance allowed under sec- tion 113A of the Act. To qualify for the loading, assets have to meet the definition of “new asset” or “new New Zealand as- set” and satisfy timing rules for the dates of acquisi- tion and use. To qualify for the loading, capital improvements to assets must meet the definition of “capital improve- ment” and satisfy the timing rules. Calculation of the Loading The loading amounts to 25% of the ordinary depre- ciation rate. Common rates will increase as follows: CurrentLoaded Rate (%) Rate (%)with 25% increase 33.8 56.3 67.5 1012.5 12.515.6 1518.8 2025.0 2531.3 33.341.7 5062.5 Qualifying Assets There are two types of asset which qualify for the 25% loading: New Assets These are assets which have never been used be- fore, either in New Zealand or elsewhere. Assets which have been held as part of trading stock but which have not been used are considered new as- sets. Buildings have been specifically excluded from the definition of new assets and are not eligi- ble for the loading. New NZ Assets These are assets which have never been used in New Zealand or which have never been used in the production of New Zealand assessable income. In most cases this will mean assets which have been imported into New Zealand for the first time. It will also mean that assets previously used by an overseas branch of a New Zealand resident com- pany will not qualify for the loading. Buildings and motorcars have been specifically excluded from the definition of new New Zealand assets and are not eligible for the loading. Qualifying Capital Improvements In some cases depreciable assets will be subject to repairs or alterations which increase their capital value. Such capital expenditure is added to their written down tax book value and depreciated. Capital improvements may qualify for the loading. Improvements to buildings will not qualify for the loading, but improvements to other depreciable as- sets, including motorcars, will qualify provided that the timing rules are satisfied. Part 1 : General Depreciable Assets 4 Timing Rules For a qualifying asset (a “new asset” or a “new New Zealand asset”) to be eligible for the loading, its ac- quisition and use must satisfy the timing rules. Simi- lar timing rules must be satisfied for qualifying capi- tal improvements. Qualifying Assets Generally an asset must have been acquired be- tween 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclu- sive), and be used on or before 31 March 1994. Where an asset was the subject of a binding con- tract for purchase before 16 December 1991, or was a new asset under construction before 16 Decem- ber 1991, it will not qualify for the loading even though it may have been first used before 31 March 1994. Where an asset is subject to a binding con- tract on 31 March 1993 and has yet to be used it will generally qualify for the loading if it is used on or before 31 March 1994. Where a new asset is under construction at 31 March 1993 it must be completed and used on or before 31 March 1994 to qualify for the loading. Qualifying Capital Improvements In general expenditure incurred in making a capi- tal improvement to an asset will qualify for the loading where that expenditure was incurred be- tween 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclu- sive), provided that the improved asset is used on or before 31 March 1994. If a capital improvement was the subject of a bind- ing contract before 16 December 1991 or was un- der construction before 16 December 1991 it will not qualify for the loading. Where a capital improvement is the subject of a binding contract on 31 March 1993 and the im- proved asset has yet to be used it will generally qualify for the loading if it is used on or before 31 March 1994. Where a capital improvement is still being made at 31 March 1993 it must be completed and the im- proved asset used on or before 31 March 1994 to qualify for the loading. Timing Rule Exceptions There are two exceptions to the timing rules: Transfers of assets from trading stock to capital stock Where a firm had acquired or had begun to con- struct a new asset as trading stock prior to 16 De- cember 1991 it will qualify for the loading if it is used by that firm as capital stock on or before 31 March 1994 Assets used by previously exempt persons Where an income tax exempt entity acquired or constructed a qualifying asset or made a qualify- ing improvement and subsequently becomes tax- able that entity may qualify for the loading. To do so it must have satisfied the timing rules. This will generally mean that the asset will have been ac- quired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive) and have been used on or before 31 March 1994. Ownership Rules Where a qualifying asset or an asset which has a qualifying improvement is sold or transferred to another person the loading will generally be lost. The new owner will be limited to claiming the ordinary rates of depreciation. There is an exception to this rule where an asset is transferred under a matrimo- nial agreement. In this case the transferee can con- tinue to claim the loading. There is a further exemption for assets which are transferred between companies in the same wholly owned group. This covers companies which have 100% common voting interests at the time the asset was transferred. In principle a partner owns a proportionate share of each partnership asset. Where a partnership dis- solves or where there is a change in composition of a partnership of a proportion of the partnership as- sets. This will mean that new owners of the asset will not be eligible for the loading in respect of their shares. Other Points Section 108A(7) contains an anti-avoidance provision to deal with arrangements which attempt to obtain a loading where it was not intended that it be avail- able. Subject to the rules outlined above, the depreciation loading is treated in the same way as ordinary depre- ciation. • Section 117 applies to the loading in the same way as ordinary depreciation. • The Commissioner’s rules relating to part year use of assets and balance date changes also apply to the loading. Application Dates The depreciation loading will generally apply to qualifying assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive) and used on or before 31 March 1994. 5 Aquaculture Sections 18, 19 and 20 amend sections 128A, 128B and 128C of the Income Tax Act by providing that qualifying expenditure on items listed in the Thir- teenth Schedule to the Act may be depreciated at the rate specified in the schedule, increased by the 25% loading. To qualify for the 25% loading expenditure must be: • Incurred by the taxpayer between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive) other than sub- ject to a binding contract entered into before 16 December 1991 and first used in that period; or • Incurred by the taxpayer between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994 pursuant to a binding contract entered into between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive). This rule does not apply to existing improvements acquired when a taxpayer purchases land. However, there are two exceptions to this rule. The 25% load- ing will apply where the vendor would have been entitled to the loading and the assets where acquired: • By a taxpayer in accordance with a matrimonial agreement; or • By a company in a wholly owned group from an- other company in that wholly owned group and the land is acquired before 1 April 1993 then those land improvements continue to qualify for the 25% loading. Sections 18, 19 and 20 apply to the tax on income derived in the 1991-92 income year and subsequent years. Write-Off of Book Value of Trees and Vines As well as providing for the 25% interim loading on items of expenditure listed in Part I of the Thirteenth Schedule, section 18 of the Amendment Act also in- troduces a new section 128A(4A). This subsection provides that trees or vines that are not planted pri- marily for timber production may have their book value written off where they have ceased to exist or have ceased to be used in the production of assess- able income. This section applies to the tax on income derived in the 1991-92 income year and subsequent income years. However, a proviso to subsection (4A) pro- vides that trees or vines that ceased to be used in the production of assessable income before 16 December 1991 cannot have their residual book value written off under subsection (4A). Note that the Government originally announced that the treatment of trees and vines would be consistent with the treatment of plant under section 108. The current treatment differs from that announcement because any gain on sale of trees or vines is not clawed back via section 117 of the Act. Part 2: 25% Loading on Land used for Farming, Forestry or Section 14 of the Amendment Act provides that: • Stallions and mares may qualify for the new in- terim depreciation regime; and • Stallions may be depreciated on a diminishing value basis should the owner so wish. Section 14(1) of the Amendment Act provides for a new definition of the term “specified write-down”. The specified write-down is the amount by which the value of a stallion or mare declines in an income year. The specified write-down is now- • for a stallion to which subsection (1A) of section 86H applies, the specified write-down calculated in accordance with that subsection • for any other stallion, an amount equal to 20% of the cost price of the stallion • for any broodmare, an amount calculated in ac- cordance with the following formula: x x y 15 - z where: x is either 1.25, for a broodmare to which para- graphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1A) of this sec- tion apply (see below), or for any other mare, 1; and y is the cost price of the broodmare; and z is 12 or the age in years of the mare when it first becomes eligible to be written down in value (being a number that is 11 or less). Section (1) of the Amendment Act inserts a new sec- tion (1A) into section 86H of the principal Act. This new subsection provides that where any bloodstock is: • First used for breeding purposes in New Zealand between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (in- clusive); or • First used for breeding purposes in New Zealand between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994 where the bloodstock was acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993; or Part 3: 25% Loading On Bloodstock 6 • Between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994 where the bloodstock was acquired after 31 March 1993 but subject to a binding contract entered into between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993; and The value of the bloodstock has not been taken into account by any other person at the end of any ear- lier income year, except: • By a person from whom the taxpayer acquired the bloodstock in accordance with a matrimonial agreement; or • By a company, in a wholly owned group of com- panies, from whom the taxpayer (also being a com- pany in that wholly owned group of companies) acquired the bloodstock before 1 April 1993, then the specified write-down in relation to a stallion shall be: • 25 percent of the cost price of the stallion; or • 37.5 percent of the diminished value of the stallion where the taxpayer elects this option in the return of income for the first income year in which the stallion is used for breeding purposes. The 16 December 1991 announcement stated that stallions and mares not used for breeding purposes before 16 December 1991 would qualify for the in- terim loading. This legislation does not apply the 25% interim loading to bloodstock owned by one taxpayer but not used for breeding purposes by that taxpayer and sold, after 16 December 1991, to a per- son who then commences to use that bloodstock. Legislation will be included in a future Taxation Re- form Bill to provide for the correct application of the policy announcement in this case. Livestock Valuation Sections 2, 85A and 86 and Twelfth Schedule Introduction Sections 11 to 13 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 give effect to the interim recommenda- tions of the Livestock Valuation Consultative Com- mittee. Background On 4 March 1992 the Livestock Valuation Consulta- tive Committee reported to the Government recom- mending that legislation be introduced with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1991 to provide: •that farmers may move from the trading stock scheme to the cost/market/replacement option for the 1992 income year without prior notice to Inland Revenue; •that farmers entering the herd scheme after 1 April 1991 should not be required to move all of a type of livestock into the herd scheme, but instead may choose to leave out immature and male livestock retained for meat production; •that the classification of cattle as one type of live- stock be amended to provide for two types of cat- tle livestock, namely dairy and beef. •the option for the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to cap the current trading stock values at the lesser of the standard values applying for the 1991 income year or the standard values calculated for the 1992 income year. The merits of capping the values is currently being considered by the Com- mittee and the Government. The Government accepted their recommendations and legislation was introduced by Supplementary Order Paper to give effect to those listed above. The Committee also considered that Inland Revenue should introduce some form of simplified self as- sessed cost regime to apply from the 1991-92 income year. They are currently determining the detail of such a regime. Movement from Trading Stock Scheme Section 12(4) of the Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 in- serts a new subparagraph in section 85A(3)(d)(i) to provide unrestricted movement from the trading stock scheme to the cost/market/replacement option (as provided by section 86B of the Act). This option to move from the trading stock scheme to section 86B applies only to the 1991-92 income year. It does not apply to any subsequent income year. Section 12(3) of the Amendment Act makes a number of minor consequential changes as a result of this amendment. Inclusion of Livestock within Herd Scheme Section 2 of the Amendment Act inserts a new defi- nition of herd livestock. The definition provides that herd livestock is: (a) any animal of the classes set out in column (3) to the Twelfth Schedule of the Act which is used by the taxpayer or any other person primarily for the purposes of the production of progeny or wool or velvet or fibre or primarily for any combination of those purposes; or (b) an animal of any class of livestock that the tax- payer has elected, in accordance with section 85A(2C) of the Act to treat as herd livestock. 7 At the same time the Twelfth Schedule has been amended to remove immature classes of livestock from the third column (herd livestock classes). This means that herd livestock now comprises, at a mini- mum, the “core” herd, namely mature breeding animals. If the farmer wishes to include more classes of animals such as ewe hoggets then the farmer may elect to add that class of livestock within the defini- tion. Note that the Twelfth Schedule has been amended to remove immature classes of livestock from the Third column. This amendment applies to the 1991-92 income year and subsequent income years. Election to include Livestock within Herd Scheme Section 12(2) of the Amendment Act inserts section 85A(2C) into the Income Tax Act. The subsection provides that a farmer may elect to include within the scheme any of those classes of livestock listed in col- umn (2) of the Twelfth Schedule. Such an election must be made in writing and furnished with the re- turn of income for the first income year to which the election is to apply. Where a return of income is be- ing filed under E-file it is not possible for the notice to be filed at the same time as the electronic return, so the Commissioner will accept an election posted within a few days of the return being filed. The election allows the farmer to include within the definition those animals which are of a core herd live- stock class but which are not used for the production of progeny or wool and so forth. For example, ris- ing 2 year heifers which were intended for breeding but did not mate are excluded by the second part of paragraph (a) of the definition. A farmer who wishes to include these heifers in the herd scheme can sim- ply elect to do so at the end of the income year. This election is outlined in the new section 85A(2C), which is explained below. The election ceases to apply where the type of live- stock to which that class of livestock belongs leaves the herd scheme, for example, if a farmer elects to include ewe hoggets within the herd scheme and then subsequently removes sheep from the herd scheme. If the farmer should in the future wish to move sheep back into the herd scheme the herd live- stock definition will have reverted back to the core classes, which do not include ewe hoggets. This means that a farmer is not bound by the earlier elec- tion to include ewe hoggets and in effect starts with a clean sheet. In this example the farmer decides to include ewe hoggets within the herd scheme so elects to do so. As discussed below, sections 85A(2A) and (2B) have been repealed. However, to avoid confusion, the replacement provisions were enacted as section 85A(2C). Section 12(1) of the Amendment Act is consequential to the new section 85A(2C). This subsection effec- tively amends section 86A(2)(b) to provide that where a farmer has a type of livestock in the herd scheme all classes of herd livestock of that type of livestock must be included in the herd scheme. This section provides the link between the farmer choos- ing which classes of animals are herd livestock, and that choice resulting in animals being valued in ac- cordance with the herd scheme. These amendments apply to the 1991-92 income year and subsequent income years. Treatment of Existing Election Provisions - Section 85A(2A) A consequence of this new definition is that the pro- visions relating to the inclusion of livestock within the herd scheme have been made more logical. Farm- ers now elect to include classes of livestock within the scheme rather than electing to exclude classes of live- stock. Section 12(2) of the Amendment Act repealed section 85A(2A), which provided that existing farmers with a type of livestock in the herd scheme could exclude immature classes of that type of livestock from the then definition of herd livestock. Section 12(2) of the Amendment Act then inserts a new section 85A(2D). This subsection deems a farmer to have elected to include an immature class of a type of livestock in the herd scheme, in accordance with the new section 86A(2C), where: • The farmer elected pursuant to subsection 85A(2A), as formerly in force, not to include a class of im- mature livestock in the herd scheme; and •The farmer has revoked that election; and •Livestock of that type to which the class belongs are valued under the herd scheme in the 1991-92 in- come year. Where a farmer originally chose to include immature classes of livestock within the herd scheme by sim- ply not making an election under section 85A(2A) to exclude immature livestock, that farmer must now elect to include that immature livestock under the new section 85A(2C) if that stock is to continue to be valued under the herd scheme. An election to in- clude that immature stock must be furnished: •With the return of income for the 1991-92 income year; or •Where a taxpayer's return has been furnished for the 1991-92 income year, at any time before 7 July 1992. Those farmers who entered a type of livestock in the herd scheme in the 1989-90 income year or the 1990- 91 income year did not have the option to exclude immature classes of livestock from the herd scheme. 8 In effect, they were given a different treatment from those farmers with stock already in the herd scheme. These farmers have been given the option to remove those immature classes of livestock from the herd scheme should they so wish. This effectively places them in the same position as existing farmers. Where a farmer chose to include an immature class of livestock within the herd scheme by simply not making an election under section 85A(2A) to exclude immature livestock, that farmer must now elect to include that immature livestock under the new sec- tion 85A(2C) if that stock is to continue to be valued under the herd scheme. An election to include that immature stock must be furnished: •With the return of income for the 1991-92 income year; or •Where a taxpayer’s return has been furnished for the 1991-92 income year before 7 July 1992, at any time before 7 July 1992. Treatment of Existing Election Provisions - Section 85A(2B) Section 12(2) also repeals section 85A(2B), which allowed farmers who had a type of livestock in the herd scheme to exclude classes of male non-breed- ing animals of that type from the scheme. As this re- peal takes effect from 1 April 1991, the section is re- pealed without ever applying. Any taxpayer who has furnished an election under section 85A(2B) must re-submit an election under section 85A. This further election must be furnished: •With the return of income for the 1991-92 income year; or •Where a taxpayer’s return has been furnished for the 1991-92 income year before 7 July 1992, at any time before 7 July 1992. Separation of Cattle into Two Separate Types The Income Tax Act previously defined both dairy cattle and beef cattle as the same type of livestock, namely cattle. This treatment may be considered inappropriate because a dairy cattle operation can be a totally separate enterprise from a beef cattle opera- tion, in terms of both its management and the rea- sons a farmer holds such cattle. Thus the Income Tax Act has been amended to treat cattle as two separate types. A farmer who has both dairy cattle and beef cattle will make separate elections and will not be compelled to value them under the same scheme. In summary, there is no longer a type of livestock known as cattle; it has been replaced by beef cattle and dairy cattle. This change is simply achieved by amending the Twelfth Schedule to omit from column (1) the refer- ence to cattle and insert references to beef cattle and dairy cattle. However, giving effect to this change requires a number of minor consequential amendments. A new section 85A(2E) is inserted into the Act. This new section provides that farmers who elected to include cattle within the herd scheme are deemed to have elected to include dairy cattle and beef cattle in the herd scheme where appropriate. Inclusion of Beef Cattle in Herd Scheme Section 85A(2E)(a) provides that where a taxpayer elected that cattle be valued under the herd scheme in the 1990-91 income year or earlier, the taxpayer’s beef cattle shall be deemed to be included in the herd scheme. This occurs where the taxpayer: • At any time during the 1991-92 income year or any of the 2 immediately preceding income years de- rived income from beef cattle; and •Has not since elected to value cattle under the trad- ing stock scheme or the cost/market/replacement options, other than as a result of: •An election in the 1991-92 income year to value the cattle under another scheme; or •An election under sections 85A(2A) or (2B) to value cattle, which is herd livestock, under the trading stock scheme or the cost/market/ replacement option. (The taxpayer exercised the option to exclude immature classes of live- stock from the herd scheme). This amendment applies to the 1991-92 income year and subsequent income years. Inclusion of Dairy Cattle in Herd Scheme Section 85A(2E)(b) is identical to section 85A(2E)(a) except that it applies to dairy cattle. It provides that where a taxpayer elected that cattle be valued under the herd scheme in the 1990-91 income year or ear- lier, the taxpayer’s dairy cattle shall be deemed to be included in the herd scheme. This amendment applies to the 1991-92 income year and subsequent income years. Treatment of Taxpayers who elected to remove Cattle from the Herd Scheme and value them under another scheme in the 1991-92 Income Year With the change from cattle to beef cattle and dairy cattle, any election to remove cattle from the herd scheme in the 1991-2 income year may no longer be 9 appropriate. Taxpayers who made such an election have the option to move both beef and dairy cattle from the herd scheme, to move solely beef cattle from the scheme or solely dairy cattle from the scheme. Section 85A(2E)(c) provides that a taxpayer who elected to value cattle (currently in the herd scheme) under the trading stock scheme or the cost/market/ replacement option, may revoke that election so far as it relates to beef cattle, dairy cattle, and both beef and dairy cattle. The notice of revocation must be furnished within the time allowed under the extension of time arrange- ments provided by section 17 of the Act. Note that this is a different furnishing requirement from that applying to taxpayers electing to include classes of livestock within the herd scheme. In the small number of cases where a taxpayer has already fur- nished a return a notice will be accepted up to 7 July 1992. It is worth noting that a taxpayer who elected to move cattle to the trading stock scheme may choose which cattle type, if any, moves to the trading stock scheme but cannot change options and move cattle to the cost/market/replacement option. Provision for Freezing of Trading Stock Values The Committee recommended to Government that provision be made, for the 1992 income year only, for the Governor-General to have the authority by Order in Council to set the trading stock standard values on a type by type basis, at the lesser of the standard values applying to the 1991 income year and those calculated for the 1992 income year. The recommendation to amend the legislation to provide this option was made because at the time the Committee made its report, insufficient information was available to assess whether an extension to the current cap on standard values was warranted. The Government therefore decided to put in place legis- lation to enable the values to be capped if necessary, rather than make an uninformed decision when the legislative opportunity existed. Section 13 of the amendment Act inserts a new para- graph (d) into the definition of the term “standard value”. This new paragraph provides that the stand- ard value applying to a class of livestock in the 1991- 92 income year is: •that calculated under the definition as normal; or •the lesser of the “normal” value and the standard value applying in the 1990-91 income year, where the Governor-General issues an Order in Council before 17 May 1992. Note that this is different from the Committee’s rec- ommendation of providing authority to cap the val- ues on a type by type basis. However, it is intended that any capping will be exercised for a type rather than an individual class. The need for urgency in this area is recognised. It is currently intended that any announcement of the capping of the values will occur as soon as possible. Note that this is different from the Committee’s rec- ommendation of providing authority to cap the val- ues on a type by type basis. However, it is intended that any capping will be exercised in relation to a type rather than an individual class of livestock. Cyclone Val Donations recognised Amendment to section 56A Introduction Section 8 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 amends section 56A of the Income Tax Act to provide that donations made to authorised Cyclone Val relief efforts will entitle donors to rebates (or de- ductions, if they are public companies). Background Two coordinated relief efforts were established in response to the devastation inflicted on Western Sa- moa by Cyclone Val in December 1991. The first was operated by the Council for Interna- tional Development. In conjunction with the ANZ Bank a system was established whereby donations could be made by making deposits into an account, known as the Cyclone Val Relief Fund, at any branch of the ANZ Bank. The second relief effort was known as “Channel 2 Cyclone Aid for Samoa”. This was a telethon-type event where donations were made to an account administered by Television New Zealand, who transferred the funds to the Council for International Development. Key Issues The amendment to section 56A will entitle donors to tax rebates (or to deductions under section 147, if they are public companies). To be eligible, donations must have been made to either the Cyclone Val Relief Appeal Fund or to Chan- nel 2 Cyclone Aid for Samoa. The donation must be evidenced by a receipt. In the case of Cyclone Val Relief Appeal Fund that receipt will be in the form of an ANZ Bank deposit slip butt stamped with the 10 name of the appeal. In the case of Channel 2 Cyclone Aid for Samoa conventional receipts were issued, marked “Channel 2 Aid for Samoa Appeal”. The rebate available is the lesser of 33 1/3 % of the donation or $500. The deduction available to public companies (for the gifts in an income year to any one donee) is limited to the greater of 1% of the compa- ny’s assessable income, or $4,000. The total deduc- tion for the year is limited to the greater of $1,000 or 5% of the company’s assessable income. Application Date This amendment applies from 1 April 1991. Energy Trading Operators Section 197C As described in TIB Vol 3 No 7, section 25 of the In- come Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 substituted new company grouping and loss offsetting provi- sions in the Income Tax Act. Section 29 of the Amendment Act consequentially amends the group company references in section 197C of the Income Tax Act, which relates to energy trading operators, so these references conform with the new company grouping and loss offsetting pro- visions. Goods and Services Tax Act Section 55 As described in TIB Vol 3 No 7, section 25 of the In- come Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 substituted new company grouping and loss offsetting provi- sions in the Income Tax Act. Section 65 of the Amendment Act consequentially amends the group of companies provision (section 55) in the Goods and Services Tax Act so it conforms with the new company grouping provisions in the Income Tax Act. Local Authority Taxation Introduction Two anti-avoidance amendments relating to the taxa- tion of local authorities have been implemented. Section 64 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 inserts a look-through provision in the local au- thority trading enterprise (LATE) definition con- tained in the Local Government Act 1974 (LGA). This will ensure that any entity under the control of a local authority is in fact covered by the LATE defi- nition. Section 2(5) of the Amendment Act aligns the Income Tax Act definition of “local authority” with that contained in the LGA. Background From 1 November 1989, local authorities which were previously exempt from all income tax (other than on income received in trust), have had to pay tax on all income derived from LATEs. LATEs themselves are taxed depending on their nature, i.e., on the same basis as companies, trusts, etc. The definition of a LATE is contained in section 594B of the LGA. One of the statutory purposes of local government is the “operation of trading undertak- ings on a competitively neutral basis”. Key Issues The amendments will help to carry out the intention of the current local authority tax legislation. This intention is to make local authorities liable for tax on income from the trading activities of entities under their control, thereby ensuring that these activities operate on a competitively neutral basis. The former LATE definition in the LGA contained a major loophole; subsidiaries of LATEs did not come within the LATE definition, even though they were still under the effective control of a local authority. The absence of a look-through provision in the LATE definition meant that any second tier or further tier company or organisation did not come within the LATE definition. As local authorities are not liable for tax on income derived from non-LATE entities, a local authority could gain a tax advantage by structuring its affairs to circumvent the former LATE definition. For ex- ample, the local authority could interpose a holding company between itself and its trading enterprises. While a non-LATE entity is still taxed in its own right according to its nature, a local authority could effec- tively extract tax free income from a non-LATE en- tity by charging the non-LATE for high rentals, management fee charges and the like. 11 Although the cost of the high rentals and manage- ment fees was deductible to a non-LATE entity un- der the control of a local authority, the correspond- ing receipt derived by the local authority was not assessable because of the continued application of the local authority tax exemption for income from non- LATE sources. Local authorities could therefore pre- viously maximise the tax free income they derived from non-LATE entities while at the same time mini- mising the taxable income of these entities. The above tax avoidance avenue is not available for LATEs as section 61(2A) of the Income Tax Act makes local authorities liable for tax on all income (not just dividends) derived from LATEs. Section 64 of the Amendment Act inserts a look- through provision in the LATE definition to ensure that second tier and further tier subsidiaries of first tier LATEs also come within the LATE definition. A local authority is therefore liable for tax on all income it derives from such second tier and further tier sub- sidiaries. The previous definition of “local authority” in the Income Tax Act was very wide and gave rise to sev- eral tax avoidance opportunities. The LGA local authority definition, in contrast, is more specific and finite and would be unlikely in itself to give rise to any tax avoidance opportunities. Section 2(5) of the Amendment Act aligns the local authority definition in section 2 of the Income Tax Act with that contained in the LGA. A LATE itself is also now defined, by reference to the LGA definition, in section 2 of the Income Tax Act. Application Date These local authority taxation amendments apply from 1 April 1992. Real Estate Salespersons now treated as Self-Employed Introduction The Real Estate Agents Amendment Act 1992 was assented to on 23 March 1992. This legislation amends both the employment law and revenue law consequences of the July 1990 de- cision of the Court of Appeal in Challenge Realty Lim- ited and Ors. v C.I.R. This item is concerned solely with the principal rev- enue consequences of the Amendment Act. Background The effect of the decision in Challenge Realty was that real estate salespersons were required to be treated as employees for all purposes. For the purpose of the deduction of expenses under the Income Tax Act 1976, this change applied from 1 April 1989. Section 105 (2) of that Act denies all deductions for expenses incurred in gaining or producing “income from employment”. That term is defined as includ- ing income from “salary or wages”. The term “sal- ary or wages” is itself defined as including “commis- sion, or other remuneration of any kind,”. The Court of Appeal decision applied the general law tests to determine the existence of an employer/em- ployee relationship between real estate licensee and salesperson Key Issues The Real Estate Agents Amendment Act 1992 amends the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 to insert section 51A. The employment and revenue law pro- visions of this new section apply only if either: (a) before 20 March 1992 the parties had expressly or by implication agreed that the relationship be- tween them should be that of employer and inde- pendent contractor; or, (b) on or after 20 March 1992, the parties expressly agreed that the relationship between them shall be that of employer and independent contractor. It is a question of fact in every case whether such an agreement exists. The employment and revenue pro- visions of the section are inapplicable unless such an agreement exists. While some licensees and their salespersons may have entered into written contracts before 20 March 1992, many may not have. Where deductions for expenses are claimed, from 1 April 1992 the Commissioner will wish to see a written agreement expressly acknowledging the em- ployer/independent contractor relationship. Revenue Law Consequences Where an employer/independent contractor rela- tionship has been expressly acknowledged, there will be two revenue law consequences of the amend- ment. • from 1 April 1991, salespersons will be recognised as independent contractors and thus permitted, under the Income Tax Act 1976, deductions for expenses incurred in deriving their income as real estate salespersons. • from 1 April 1992, those salespersons who are ei- ther required to register for GST (i.e. who estimate their gross commissions will exceed $30,000 in the 12 months from that date) or who elect to register for GST will be permitted to do so. Tax Invoices Those salespersons who register for GST will be re- quired to invoice all income due to them from their 12 licensee and to retain and maintain the usual records of all expenses incurred in producing that income. Because the Real Estate Agents Act permits a sales- person to work for one licensee only, and because commissions will continue to be received by the li- censee prior to payment of the salesperson’s portion; Inland Revenue anticipates that many licensees and their salespersons will prefer that tax invoices are issued by the licensee as recipient of the service rather than the salesperson as supplier of that service. The attention of salespersons is accordingly drawn to section 24 (2) of the GST Act. That section permits tax invoices to be issued by the recipient (licensee) in respect of services supplied by the supplier (salesper- son) subject to the following conditions: • the Commissioner has granted prior approval for the issue of such documents, • the tax invoice created must be provided to the salesperson and a copy retained by the licensee, • the licensee and the salesperson must agree that the salesperson shall not issue a tax invoice for those services, • the words “buyer created invoice- IRD approved” appear prominently on the document. Currently, Inland Revenue is considering whether or not to grant a blanket approval for the issue of such tax invoices by licensees. We will announce a deci- sion shortly. In addition, all buyer created invoices must contain the same particulars as all other tax invoices, namely: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place, • the name and registration number of the salesper- son, • the name and address of the licensee, • the date upon which the tax invoice is issued, • a description of the services supplied, • the value of the services supplied, •either a statement of the GST charged, or a state- ment that the total amount charged includes GST. Adjustments The attention of salespersons and their tax advisors is also drawn to the provisions of section 21 (5) of the GST Act. That section provides that where goods acquired by a person (after 1 October 1986) other than for the purpose of making taxable supplies are sub- sequently applied in any taxable period for the pur- pose of making taxable supplies, a deduction from that person’s output tax may be made of an amount equal to the tax fraction of that part of the lesser of- (a) the cost of those goods and services, including any tax charged on them; (b) the open market value of the supply of those goods and services. The adjustment to be made is a “one off” adjustment. This means that in the taxable period in which the asset (car etc) is first applied by the salesperson for the purpose of the taxable activity, the salesperson may make a “one-off” adjustment based on the lesser of “cost” or “open market value”. The salesperson then makes “on-going” adjustments under section 21(1) for private use. Example 1 R.E. salesperson purchased a car in 1987 for $30,000 for use in the salesperson’s business. The car is now valued at $12,000 and is still used in the business. In the taxable period in which the salesperson registers for GST, there is a “one-off” deemed supply pursuant to section 21 (5). The value of that supply is $12,000. Therefore, the salesper- son will receive an input tax credit of 1/9 of $12,000 ($1,333.33). Three points however should be noted: 1. The “one-off” adjustment may be made by the salesperson only if the asset is used more than 50% in the taxable activity (as a real estate sales- person). If this test is not met, then period by period adjustments under section 21 (5) are re- quired. 2. The asset is no longer a “private asset” as it has been introduced into the taxable activity. It is therefore an asset of the taxable activity and any subsequent disposal of the asset is “in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity” and is subject to GST. 3. Because the asset has become an asset of the “tax- able activity” any non-taxable use of the asset (private or exempt) means that there is a deemed supply pursuant to section 21(1). Further adjust- ments under section 21(1) are required. Those adjustments are made on a “period by period” basis and either the “depreciation rate” or “24% rule” (see para. 7.2.4 GST Guide) should be used to value the supply. 13 Example 2 R.E. salesperson with a 2 month taxable period. After claiming the one-off section 21(5) adjust- ment, uses the car 20% for private use. A sec- tion 21(1) adjustment for that taxable period should be made. $12,000 x 13.33% x 20% 6 = $53.32 (value of the deemed supply) That amount is divided by 1/9 ($5.92) and $5.92 is entered in box 6 of the GST return as an out- put tax adjustment. Depreciation In the income year commencing 1 April 1991, depre- ciation will be calculated on the cost price of capital assets used in the salesperson’s business as such. Because real estate salespersons are specifically ex- empted from the provisions of the GST Act until 1 April 1992, for the 1991 income year depreciation should be calculated on the GST inclusive price. For income years commencing on or after 1 April 1992, those salespersons required, or electing, to register for GST should calculate depreciation on the GST exclusive cost of the asset where the asset is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Where an asset used in the salesperson’s business was acquired before 1 October 1986, the book value for depreciation purposes will be actual cost to the salesperson. The book values at 1 April 1991 and 1 April 1992, for depreciation purposes, should be calculated as if the salesperson had been able to claim deductions for depreciation in each year since the date of purchase. Example 3 R.E. salesperson purchased a motor vehicle for use in his employment as a real estate salesper- son on 1 April 1990. The purchase price was $25,000, GST inclusive. The vehicle, which is used 100% in that activity, has an open market value of $16,000 at 1 April 1992. To calculate book value at 1 April 1991 and the depreciation deductions for the 1992 and 1993 income years: cost price at 1 April 199025,000 less 20% depreciation 5,000 book value at 1 April 199120,000 less 20% depreciation DV 4,000 16,000 The book value at 1 April 1991 is $20,000 and the depreciation deduction, at 100% business use, for the 1992 income year is $4000.00 To calculate book value at 1 April 1992 and the depreciation deduction for the 1993 income year, assuming GST registration and open market value of $16,000 at 1 April 1992: book value at 1 April 199216,000 less 1/9th GST input deduction 1,777 book value for dep'n purposes14,223 for GST registered salesperson at 1 April 1992 less 20% depreciation DV 2,844 book value at 1 April 199311,379 Book value at 1 April 1992 is $14,223 and the de- preciation deduction for the 1993 year, assum- ing 100% business use and retention of vehicle for whole year, is $2,844.00. Note: The basis of motor-vehicle depreciation ap- proved by the Commissioner pursuant to section 108 is 20% of DV. Record Keeping The following points summarise record keeping ob- ligations arising as a result of this amendment in the law: • only expenses necessarily incurred in deriving a salesperson’s income are deductible; • documentary evidence, typically the originals of invoices, accounts and bank statements must be retained by the salesperson and held available for inspection (if requested) by Inland Revenue; • both expenses deductions and GST “input ex- penses” may be disallowed if not supported by such documentary evidence. These requirements apply for both expenses deduc- tions under the Income Tax Act and GST returns under the GST Act. Accident Rehabilitation Compensation and Insurance Act Neither the levies payable pursuant to the Accident Compensation Act 1982 nor those payable pursuant to the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 ( its successor ) in respect of real estate salesper- sons will be affected by the Real Estate Agents Amendment Act 1992. Licensees are required to pay the employers pre- mium on the salaries or wages of their office staff and those salespersons who do not contract as independ- ent contractors; with those employees also paying the earners' premium. Independent contractors will pay the employer pre- mium in their capacity as self-employed, together with the earners' premium for non-work accidents. The earner premium and the employer premium will 14 be calculated on assessable income (income after expenses) and both will be assessed and paid through the salesperson's annual tax return. The earner pre- mium applies from 1 April 1992, and the employer premium comes into force on 1 July 1992, and ap- plies to returns filed for the 1992/93 income year after this date. Withholding Tax Payments of commission to salespersons, irrespec- tive of whether they are independent contractors or remain as employees paid on a commission-only basis, remain subject to the Income Tax (Withhold- ing Payments) Regulations 1979. Under those regu- lations, licensees are required to deduct tax at a 20 percent rate when paying a commission to the salesperson. For a GST registered salesperson, this deduction is calculated on the GST exclusive amount of the commission. Application Dates Subject to the conditions outlined elsewhere in this item, deductions for expenses incurred in deriving income as a real estate salesperson may be claimed in income years commencing 1 April 1991, and there- after. Again, subject to the conditions outlined elsewhere in this item, real estate salespersons will be entitled or required, as the case may be, to register for GST from 1 April 1992. Those obliged to register have two months, rather than the usual 21 days, from that date in which to register before becoming subject to any penalties for that failure or for failing to file GST returns. Recent Disclosure Exemption issued by the Commissioner - International Tax Regime Introduction Under the International Tax regime, taxpayers must disclose interests they held (e.g. by way of shares or units) at any time during an income year in a foreign company or foreign investment fund. This disclosure is required by section 245W and must be made by completing Part A of an IR 4G or IR 4H form, as ap- propriate. A current disclosure exemption has recently been made under section 245W(2), resulting from recent legislative amendments outlined on page 10 of TIB Volume 3 No.6. The exemption applies to the income year commenc- ing 1 April 1991. It is reproduced at the end of this article. Scope of Exemption Broadly, the exemption removes the requirement to disclose the following categories of interests, for the 1992 income year: 1. an interest held in a foreign investment fund; 2. an interest held in a foreign company which is not an “income interest of 10% or greater”; 3. an interest held in a foreign company which is resident at all times, in a country or territory not listed in the schedule of Low Tax Jurisdictions contained in the Seventeenth Schedule to the Act, provided that; (i) an election has not been made under s.245Y(2); and (ii) an “income interest of 10% or greater” is not held in any underlying foreign company to which the exemption does not otherwise ap- ply. Explanation and Examples Income Interest of 10% or Greater (Categories 2 & 3(ii)) When determining whether or not an interest in a foreign company is an “income interest of 10% or greater”, the following interests must be taken into account: • income interests held directly in that foreign com- pany and indirectly through any interposed foreign company. • income interests held by associated persons (not being CFCs), as defined by s.245B. Example The disclosure exemption would not apply to an in- come interest held in a Cayman Islands company by a husband and wife (associated under s.245B(d)) of 5% each as: (i) their combined income interest is 10%, being an “income interest of 10% or greater”; and (ii) Cayman Islands is listed on the Seventeenth Schedule. 15 Example - Categories 1 and 2 Mr A held a nominal interest of 1% of the share capital in a Hong Kong public company in the year ended 31 March 1992. This interest would not have to be disclosed as an interest in a foreign investment fund (on Part A of an IR 4H form), as category 1 (out- lined above) applies. This interest would also not have to be dis- closed as an interest in a foreign company (on Part A of an IR 4G form), as category 2 (out- lined above) applies. Example - Category 3(i) NZ Ltd held a 30% shareholding in K Ltd, a Dutch company. NZ Ltd also held a 15% shareholding in S Ltd, a Spanish CFC for which an election has been made under section 245Y(2) (to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1988). The interests held by NZ Ltd in both K Ltd and S Ltd are precluded from the scope of the dis- closure exemptions by category 3(i) (outlined above). The interests in both companies must therefore be disclosed on Part A of separate IR 4G forms. (Part B of the IR 4G form must also be com- pleted by NZ Ltd in relation to the interest it held in S Ltd. This would also apply to NZ Ltd’s interest in K Ltd if that company is a CFC, as NZ Ltd held an "income interest of 10% or greater". Category 3(ii) This category applies when there is a chain of foreign companies. It ensures that the disclosure exemption will not apply to an interest held in any foreign com- pany interposed between the taxpayer and any un- derlying foreign company which is not exempted from the requirement to disclose. Example - Category 3(ii) NZ Ltd held at all times during the 1992 in- come year a 50% income interest in B Ltd, resi- dent in Australia. B Ltd held at all times a 50% income interest in HK Ltd (resident in Hong Kong). NZ Ltd has not made an election un- der s.245Y(2). The exemption does not apply to the interest held by NZ Ltd in HK Ltd, as: (i) the interest is an income interest of 25% (50% x 50%), being an “income interest of 10% or greater”; and (ii)Hong Kong is listed on the Seventeenth Schedule. Therefore NZ Ltd would have to complete Part A of an IR 4G form in relation to its 50% control interest in HK Ltd. (NZ Ltd would also have to complete Part B of that form to attribute income from HK Ltd in relation to its 25% income interest, as that interest is an "in- come interest of 10% or greater".) As the exemption does not apply to NZ Ltd’s interest in the underlying company HK Ltd, the exemption does not preclude disclosure of NZ Ltd’s interest in B Ltd. Therefore, NZ Ltd would also have to com- plete Part A of a separate IR 4G form in rela- tion to its 50% interest held in B Ltd. Summary For the 1992 income year, an interest held in a for- eign investment fund will not have to be disclosed. An interest held in a foreign company will not gen- erally have to be disclosed for that year, where that interest is not an “income interest of 10% or greater”, or where there is no requirement to attribute foreign income or loss under the CFC regime in relation to that company and any underlying foreign company. Persons not required to comply with Section 245W of the Income Tax Act 1976 This Exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption D3” 1. Reference This exemption is made pursuant to section 245W(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. It details interests in foreign companies and foreign investment funds in relation to which any person is not required to com- ply with section 245W of the Income Tax Act 1976 for the income year commencing 1 April 1991. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise re- quires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section 2 or Part IVA of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Exemption Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company of a type specified be- 16 low, or an interest in a foreign investment fund, in the income year commencing 1 April 1991, shall not be required to comply with section 245W(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 in respect of that foreign com- pany or foreign investment fund and that income year. 1. The foreign company is a foreign company in which the interest held by that person during any accounting period (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section 245A of the Income Tax Act 1976, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. 2. The foreign company was at all times, during any accounting period (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), resident in a country or territory that is not specified in the Seventeenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976; and (a) the person has not made an election in terms of section 245Y(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976; and (b) the person did not hold at any time during that income year an interest in any underlying for- eign company, which would constitute for that accounting period an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section 245A of the Income Tax Act 1976, as if that under- lying foreign company was a controlled for- eign company to which Parts 2 and 2(a) of this exemption does not apply. This exemption is made by me acting under del- egated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 11 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974. This Exemption is signed on the 5th day of April 1992. Joy Hames Director - Taxpayer Audit Due Dates Reminder April 30 GST return and payment for period ended 31 March 1992 due.

Unfortunately, the last line of the article was missed off when it was printed. The last paragraph should read: An interest held in a foreign company will not generally have to be disclosed for that year, where that interest is not an “income interest of 10% or greater”, or where there is no requirement to attribute foreign income or loss under the CFC regime in relation to that company and any underlying foreign company. 2 1992 Average Market Values of Specified Livestock Under the authority of section 86D of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act) the Governor-General, by Order in Council, has announced the average market values of specified livestock for the 1991-1992 income year. The values to be used for the standard values scheme and the herd scheme for the income year are listed below under the various classes of specified livestock, together with the trigger price for high price livestock. Note: For the 1992 income year the standard values are set at the lesser of the values applying last year (the lesser of the 1990 and 1991 standard values) and the values calculated for the 1992 year. This further “capping” of the standard values was made possible by an amendment to section 86 of the Act, and was part of the interim measures recommended to Government by the Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee.

Since then, Inland Revenue has received enquiries on what constitutes holiday pay, and how the new provisions apply in practice. This item outlines the treatment of accrued mon- etary remuneration and our interpretation of holiday pay. Background The Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1991 changed the tax treatment of the accrual and payment of monetary remuneration. In reconciling the deductibility of monetary remuneration with the date the expense is actually incurred, the new provisions specify a set period after the end of the income year by when remuneration must be paid out if a deduction is to be allowed for that income year. This period is 63 days for employees, but remuneration for shareholder-employees must be paid out before the 31 March date that is the last possible date to which an extension of time for filing may be granted. This gives 6 to 18 months, depending on the company’s balance date. Where the time limit is not met, the monetary remunera- tion is deductible in the year in which it is paid.

These provisions take effect for the 1990/91 in- come year for monetary remuneration other than holiday pay payable to employees. For holiday pay payable to employees, the provisions take effect in the 1991/92 income year. Interpretation of Holiday Pay Inland Revenue interprets “holiday pay” as pay- ment in relation to holidays as expressed as an employee’s minimum entitlement under section 7A and section 11 of the Holidays Act 1981, and any payment for holidays provided for in an Employment Contract that are of a similar nature as those provided for in the Holidays Act. Thus, holidays are of two kinds: statutory holidays and annual leave. Section 7A of the Holidays Act covers statutory holidays. They are: Anniversary day, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year’s Day and the follow- ing day, Labour day, Waitangi Day, Good Friday and Easter Monday, Anzac Day, and Queen’s Birthday Observance. Section 11 of the Holidays Act provides for a minimum of 3 weeks’ annual leave. Any other holiday leave provided for in an Employment Contract that is of the same nature as that pro- vided for in section 11 of the Holidays Act is also included. This means any further annual leave over and above the 3 weeks’ statutory minimum is included as holiday pay. If an industry or company provides for a certain day of the year as a holiday, such as Accountant’s holiday or Bank holiday or Company Anniversary, payment for this day is included as holiday pay. Holiday pay does not include long service leave, retirement leave, sick leave, or any other accruing entitlements in respect to employee remuneration. Calculating the Deductible Portion With annual leave, the calculation is straightfor- ward; • For employees, the company can deduct any holiday pay incurred in the income year which has been taken and paid, or paid out in lieu of leave, in that year or within 63 days. • For shareholder-employees, the company can deduct any holiday pay incurred in the income year which has been taken (paid out) in that income year or before the relevant 31 March. The calculation for monetary remuneration in general is exactly the same. With statutory holidays, the company can claim a deduction if: • an employee or shareholder employee does not work on the statutory holiday and receives payment for that day; or • an employee has worked on a statutory holiday and has been granted a holiday on another day in return, and this day is taken and paid out in the same income year, or within 63 days of the end of the income year (or, for shareholder- employees, by the relevant 31 March date). Note that for factory workers, section 25 of the Holidays Act provides for payment for a statutory holiday to employees whose employment is terminated within the fortnight prior to that statutory holiday. Such payments are calculated in accordance with section 25 of the Holidays Act. They constitute holiday pay and are deductible if paid in the income year, or if the income year includes part of the fortnight prior to the statutory holiday and payment is made within 63 days. Deductions where Conditions not met Where the 63 days or the 31 March date conditions are not met, and holiday pay (or monetary remu- neration in general) is paid out after the time limit, it is deductible in the next income year in which the conditions are met. Ordering Requirements There will already be substantial “stocks” of accrued holiday pay for which companies have previously been allowed a deduction. The legisla- tion does not specify what ordering system should be used for accrued holiday pay. In accordance with the principle from Clayton’s Case; Devaynes v. Noble (1816) 35 ER 781, the crediting of holidays taken against holiday leave entitlements will be deemed to be paid out on a first-in-first-out basis. An employer must use up the existing “stock” for an employee before they can credit leave against newly accruing leave entitlements. The same first-in-first-out rules apply to all accru- als of monetary remuneration. 7 Example 1: X is an employee of QRS Company Ltd. QRS has a 31 March balance date. X is entitled to four weeks’ annual leave each year. As at 1 April 1991, QRS Ltd has accrued holiday pay of two weeks for X. X takes three weeks annual holiday leave in January 1992 and a further two weeks annual holiday leave in May to coincide with the school holidays. X takes no further annual holiday leave that year. Treatment: By the start of the company’s 1992 income year, holiday pay equivalent to two weeks’ wages has already accrued for X. The first two weeks of holiday pay paid to X in January 1992 must be credited against the accrued holiday pay. The third week paid to X in January is deductible by QRS Ltd for the 1992 income year as it falls inside the income year for which the holiday pay entitlements have accrued. The two weeks paid out in May is also deductible for the income year as it is paid out within 63 days of the end of the income year. This leaves X with one week’s unused holiday entitlement which becomes deductible by QRS Ltd in the income year in which it is paid out. Example 2: IJK Company Ltd has a 30 September balance date. It accrues a shareholder-employee remu- neration of $150,000 in its financial statements to 30 September 1991 (i.e., the 1991 income year). The shareholder-employee is credited with $110,000 on 28 February 1992, and the remaining $40,000 is credited on 30 April 1992. Treatment: In this case, the key date is 31 March 1992. That is the last date for payment of the shareholder- employee remuneration for the 1991 income year if a deduction is to be allowed for that year. Thus, IJK Ltd may deduct the $110,000 credited on 28 February in the 1991 income year, but the remaining $40,000 credited on 30 April 1992 must be deducted in the 1992 income year. Under section 75(3), the shareholder-employee will be deemed to have derived the $110,000 in the same income year as IJK is allowed a deduction.The $110,000 must therefore be included in the shareholder's 1991 return. Application Dates The provisions for monetary remuneration other than holiday pay take effect from the 1990/91 income year. Those applying to holiday pay take effect from the 1991/92 income year. Balance Date Policy Introduction This article sets out Inland Revenue's policy on balance dates for income tax purposes. Taxpayers may adopt a balance date other than 31 March (a "non-standard balance date") where: • the nature of their business makes a 31 March balance date inappropriate; or • a subsidiary wishes to align its balance date with its parent company; or • an estate wishes to adopt the deceased's date of death; or • a shareholder-employee wants the same balance date as the company. This item sets out the criteria which we will follow when we receive a request for a non-standard balance date. Current Practice Section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 defines "income year" to mean the "year" in which the income is derived. This means a year commencing on 1 April and ending on the following 31 March. Returns of income must therefore cover the year ended 31 March. However, section 15 allows a taxpayer (with the consent of the Commissioner) to elect to furnish a return of income for the year ending on the date of the annual balance of the accounts. In these cases the income derived during the accounting year is deemed to be derived for tax purposes during the income year ending on the 31 March nearest to the taxpayer’s balance date. All balance dates from 1 April to 30 September inclusive in the same calendar year relate to the 8 previous 31 March, and all balance dates from 1 October to 30 March inclusive relate to the following 31 March. Examples: Accounting YearCorresponding Income Year 31 October 199131 March 1992 28 February 199231 March 1992 30 June 199231 March 1992 30 September 199231 March 1992 Currently, a small number of recognised industry non-standard balance dates are approved. We have completed a review of our policy, and there are more circumstances in which we will approve a non-standard balance date. These are set out below. The Circumstances 1. The nature of the business makes a 31 March balance date inappropriate. We will grant a non-standard balance date where it would help a business that is operating in an environment in which 31 March is not the most appropriate balance date. Some businesses have a "natural" end to their income year such as the end of a growing period, the end of a seasonally busy period, or the time in the annual business cycle in which the majority of income and their relevant costs can be brought to account. Examples of busi- nesses which could have "natural" income years not ending on 31 March include manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers, professionals, the tourism industry, farmers, horticulturists, and service related industries. Without limiting the range of businesses that may have non-standard balance dates, these balance dates are commonly recognised: Apiarists- 30 Nov or 31 Dec Education/Childcare related services- 31 December Farmers, cattle- 31 May dairy- 31 May sheep- 30 June Fishing Industries- 30 September Horse Breeders- 31 July Meat Processing and Export- 31 August to 1 October Orchardists, Pipfruit- 31 March to 30 June Kiwifruit- 31 March to 30 June Seed dressers- 30 November Tobacco growers- 31 July 2. The date coincides with the balance date of a parent company, except where the change would result in a significant deferral of income. 3. For continuing estates, the date coincides with the date of death of the deceased taxpayer. 4. For shareholder employees, the date coincides with the balance date of the company in which they are major shareholders and from which they derive their main source of income. If they are major shareholders in more than one company, their balance date should be aligned to the balance date of the company which provides their main source of income. If no main source of income can be identified, the choice of which company’s balance date to align with should be the taxpayer’s. Information We Need An application for a non-standard balance date must be in writing, and must fully state the rea- sons for the application. We need the following information before we can consider a request for a non-standard balance date: 1. Full name of the entity seeking the balance date 2. Name of the tax agent 3. Full details of the reasons why a non-standard balance date should be approved 4. If the request is because a 31 March balance date is inappropriate for the taxpayer's particular business, we will also need: • If the business is already in operation: - details of cash flows - details of stock patterns - details of customer demand - details of seasonal patterns - other evidence showing that financial information prepared to the proposed balance date will be more appropriate to the entity than information prepared to 31 March. • If the business is a new business we will need predictions of the factors set out above. If there is an industry balance date commonly recognised (as listed above), this will be strong evidence that a request for a similar balance date would be approved. 5. Whether the entity is associated with any other entities, and if so, the nature of the relationship and the balance dates of the other entities. 6. Any other reasons for requesting the balance date other than those already stated. 9 Unacceptable reasons for a Non- Standard Balance Date The anniversary date of the commencement of the business is not a valid reason for a non-standard balance date. We will not accept an application for a non-stand- ard balance date if it is for reasons of tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take undue advantage of any tax incentive or concession. Reference: HO 10.B.2.1 New Record Retention Period Introduction In TIB Volume Three, No.6 of April 1992 and in a letter to practitioners, we stated that the new standard record retention period was now seven years. We also said that the Commissioner could extend this period by up to three years for taxpay- ers who are being or have been audited or investi- gated, or for taxpayers whom we are considering for an audit or an investigation. We have been asked to clarify the position for back year records already being held, and for taxpayers whom we are considering for an audit or investi- gation. Retention Period As from 1 April 1992, taxpayers are not required to retain records for activities earlier than year ended 31 March 1985, i.e. the seven year period will apply immediately. Non Standard Balance Dates For non standard balance dates, the seven year period runs in line with the balance date. For example: A taxpayer has an early balance date, e.g. 30 No- vember 1984. This relates to the period ended 31 March 1985 and the seven year period runs to 30 November 1991. A taxpayer has a late balance date, e.g. 30 June 1985. This relates to the period ended 31 March 1985 and the seven year period runs until 30 June 1992. Audit/Investigations Where we are considering a taxpayer for an audit or investigation, we will administer the new legislation on the basis that if we have not advised a taxpayer in writing that records must be kept beyond the seven year period for an audit or investigation, then the records may be destroyed. Accrual Determinations Recently Signed by the Commissioner The Commissioner signed these two accrual determinations on 28 May 1992: Determination G17B: Deferred Prop- erty Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Currency This determination rescinds and replaces Determi- nation G17A: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denomi- nated in New Zealand Currency, which the Commis- sioner signed on the 9th day of February 1990. This determination differs from Determination G17A: (a) by expanding the scope of the determination to ensure the acquisition price, for the purposes of the base price adjustment, must be determined in all circumstances; (b) by making it clear that if all the amounts pay- able - and the dates on which those amounts are payable - are known at the first balance date after the transfer date, the yield to maturity method must be applied to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred during the term of the deferred property settlement; (c) by providing a method of calculating income derived or expenditure incurred during the term of a deferred property settlement where the amounts payable or the dates on which those amounts are payable are not known with certainty at the first balance date after the transfer date; and (d) In the use of the specified rate. This determina- tion uses the method prescribed in Determina- tion G23: Specified Rate. Determination G17A used the market yield ascertained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. This determination is made pursuant to sections 64E(1)(a), 64E(1)(f), and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 10 Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement This determination applies where a financial arrangement is subsequently varied, but not to the extent that the financial arrangement matures or is fully remitted. The variation may have been contemplated or anticipated in the original financial arrangement, such as an exercisable option. The determination requires an adjustment to be made in the year of variation. This adjustment results in the total income or expenditure at the end of the year of variation to be equal to what it would have been had the timing and details of the variation(s) been known at the date of issue or acquisition. The determination’s methodology is similar to that used in: i) section 64D(4) of the Act where a taxpayer ceases to be a non cash basis holder; or ii) section 64C(2A) of the Act where a taxpayer may opt to calculate income or expenditure by straight line method. This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Both of these determinations are reproduced in Appendix A to this TIB. Earner and Employer Premiums Introduced Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 Introduction The Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act (ARCI Act) 1992 was assented to on Wednesday 1 April 1992. It introduces a new premium on earners, and replaces both the old self-employed levy and the employer levy with an employer premium. The earner premium applies from 1 April 1992. The employer premium comes into force on 1 July 1992 and applies for the 1992/93 income year. Inland Revenue collects the premiums on behalf of ACC (AR & CI Corporation) Earner Premium - Section 114, ARCI Act 1992 All employees, self employed taxpayers and people receiving withholding payments will pay the earner premium on their employment or self employed income, at the rate of 70 cents per $100 earned (0.7%). The maximum income on which the ACC (AR & CI Corporation) will pay out compensation is 80 percent of $76,648. Therefore the maximum amount of earner premium that can be paid on the combined income is $536.53 (0.7% x $76,648). This premium is levied on income received on or after 1 April 1992. It will fund the cost of non-work related accidents suffered on or after 1 July 1992. Employees • All employees pay the earner premium on all salary or wages and extra emoluments they receive, excluding: -Income tested benefits, veterans’ pension, national superannuation, or living alone payments; -Any student allowance as defined in section 303 of the Education Act 1989; -Any excessive salary assigned to a relative of a partner or shareholder under sections 97 or 190 of the Income Tax Act; -Any amount of excessive remuneration paid to a shareholder employee under regulation 10 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Com- pensation Insurance (Earnings Definitions) Regulations 1992. -Any amounts paid to a spouse of an em- ployee under regulation 11 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance (earnings definitions) Regulations 1992, where no deduction is allowed for the amounts paid under the Income Tax Act. Employers will deduct the premium from employ- ees’ wages along with PAYE tax deductions. To reduce the impact on employers, the new premium has been included in the new PAYE tables. Em- ployers will not have to separate out the earner premium each pay day. As with income tax, the employer is acting as agent for the Inland Revenue Department (ulti- mately the ACC) in the collection of earner pre- mium. This means the employer cannot claim a GST input tax credit for the earner premium deducted from employees. At the end of the income year employers must show the amount of earner premium deducted on 11 their employees' IR 12 PAYE deduction certificates. This involves a simple calculation in the space provided on the certificate. The rules for paying and collecting earner premium are the same as those applying to tax deductions. The IR 68 Employer PAYE Reconciliation State- ment also requires employers to separate out the earner premium amount from the total deductions, so it can be transferred to the ACC. Self Employed People All self-employed taxpayers and people who receive withholding payments will be assessed for earner premium on their “earnings other than as an employee”. This is defined as being their net assessable income, apart from employment in- come, that they derive from sources which: • are dependent on their personal exertions; and • would cease if they suffered an incapacity. This condition ensures that passive income like interest and dividends are not subject to the premium, since they continue regardless of any incapacity the recipient may suffer. These people will calculate their earner premium when they file their tax returns at the end of the income year. It will be due for payment on the same date as any income tax is due and payable. For taxpayers with a 31 March balance date, this will generally be 7 February of the following year. Self-employed people and those receiving with- holding payments who work for an average of 30 hours or more a week must also pay a minimum employer premium. For those who are 20 years of age or over and whose total liable earnings are less than $12,740 per annum, the minimum premium is $79.27 (GST exclusive), reduced by the earner premium payable on their earnings as employees; For people under 20 years of age whose total liable earnings are less than $10,190, the minimum premium is $63.41 (GST exclusive), reduced by the amount of the premium they pay on their earnings as employees. Employer Premium - Sections 101 to 104, ARCI Act 1992 The current self-employed levy and employer levy will be known as the employer premium. This premium is imposed to cover the cost of work related accidents. It will be experience rated to encourage employers to provide safe working conditions for their staff. Employers will pay the employer premium on the total amount of salaries and wages they pay to their employees. Self-employed taxpayers and recipients of withholding payments will pay earner premium on the total amount of their “earnings other than as an employee” (defined above), after deducting their expenses. For employers, the employer premium is assessed on the IR 68 Employer PAYE Reconciliation State- ment, and payment is due on 31 May. The premium is set at a basic rate to reflect the safety level of the particular industry involved. Later, employers will have their basic rate in- creased or decreased to reflect the number of claims for work accidents their employees make (experience rating). This will be handled by ACC separately from Inland Revenue systems. For self-employed people, the current rules for minimum part time and full time levies will operate for the 1993 year. This means that there will be two different sets of rules and income levels for the earner premium and employer premium. Taxation of Compensation - Sections 2 and 61, Income Tax Act 1976 Amendments to the Income Tax Act ensure the following forms of income provided under the ARCI Act are subject to income tax: • compensation for loss of earnings under sec- tions 38 and 39; • increase in weekly earnings for earners in full time employment under section 43; • vocational rehabilitation allowance under sec- tion 25; • compensation for loss of potential earnings capacity under sections 45 and 46; • weekly compensation payable to a dependent spouse under section 58; • weekly compensation payable to dependent children under section 59; • weekly compensation payable to other depend- ants under section 60. (References are to sections of the ARCI Act 1992) The new compensation payments which are taxable are also included in assessable income for Family Support and Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credit purposes. References in the Income Tax Act to earnings related compensation payable under the Accident Compensation Act 1982 have been amended to incorporate references to compensation payable under the ARCI Act. 12 The provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to exempt income enable income expressly exempted from income tax under any other Act to be exempt from income tax in terms of the Income Tax Act (section 61(50) refers). Section 76 of the ARCI Act exempts the following forms of income from income tax: • any independence allowance payable under section 54; • any survivor’s grant payable under section 56; • any funeral grant payable under section 55; • any payment under the ARCI Act or regulations made under that Act to an injured person for rehabilitation. Premiums Deemed to be Income Tax for Collection and Penalty Purposes Section 115(2) of the ARCI Act provides that Part XI of the Income Tax Act shall apply with all necessary modifications to: • earnings as an employee; • earner premium payable as if the premium were tax deductions made on account of income tax; • any employee under the ARCI Act as if such employee were an employee in terms of Part XI of the Income Tax Act; • any employer under the ARCI Act as if such employer were an employer in terms of Part XI of the Income Tax Act. Every employer and employee shall comply with Part XI to the extent to which Part XI applies to them by virtue of section 115(2) of the ARCI Act 1992 Penalties for Offences - Section 115(5) to (10), ARCI Act 1992 In relation to earner premium an offence is com- mitted against the ARCI Act where: • an employer fails to make a deduction of pre- mium; • an employer fails to make payment of the deduc- tion; • anyone gives false information or misleads the corporation; • anyone causes any employer to refrain from making a deduction; • anyone obtains or attempts to obtain a benefit from the amount of any premium deducted. Anyone convicted of one of these offences will be liable for: • a fine of up to $15,000 on the first occasion for each offence; and • a fine of up to $25,000 on the second and subse- quent occasions for each offence. Anyone who knowingly permits the deducted earner premium to be used for a purpose other than payment to Inland Revenue as agent for the Corporation will be liable for: • a prison term of up to 12 months or a fine of up to $15,000 on the first occasion for each offence ; and • a prison term of up to 12 months or a fine of up to $25,000 on the second and subsequent occa- sion for each offence. No-one will be convicted of an offence under section 115 of the ARCI Act where they have been convicted of an offence under section 368(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976, and if the premium was deemed to be a tax deduction, the premium would have come under the same offence. Inland Revenue will impose and collect these penalties. Penal Premium Employee Earner Premium Deductions - Section 115(11) to (13) and section 119, ARCI Act 1992 Where employers: • fail wholly or in part to make a deduction of earner premium; or • knowingly apply or permit to be applied, the amount of any earner premium deduction to purpose other than the payment to Inland Revenue as agent for the Corporation, they may be charged with penal premium of an amount up to treble the deficient premium. Inland Revenue will assess and collect the premium as if it were penal tax under sections 420-426 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Employers will not be charged penal premium where they have deducted earner premium and have not paid it to Inland Revenue, but can show that this failure to pay was due to illness, accident or circumstances beyond their control. Other Premiums - Section 119, ARCI Act 1992. Anyone who evades, attempts to evade or does or omits to do anything with intent to evade the payment of employer premium may be charged penal premium. 13 Penalty for Non-Payment or Late Payment - Section 115(14) to (16) and 118, ARCI Act 1992 Employers who: • fail to make a deduction of earner premium; or • fail to pay the deduction to Inland Revenue as agent for the Corporation; or • are liable to pay an amount to Inland Revenue as agent for the Corporation, but fail to do so, may (without conviction) be charged a penalty of 10 percent on the amount of the earner premium that remains outstanding after the due date. Inland Revenue will impose and collect this penalty, which compounds at the rate of 10 percent at 6 monthly intervals. This penalty is in addition to any other penalty. Late payment penalty will also be imposed on any outstanding employer premium and earner pre- mium payable on earnings other than as an em- ployee at the same rate. Recovery of Earner Premium from Assets of Employer - Section 115(17), ARCI Act 1992 Where an employer makes an earner premium deduction and fails to pay the deduction to the Corporation or agent of the Corporation, the deduction shall rank equally with tax deductions as a charge against the employer's assets. Private Domestic Workers - Section 115(18), ARCI Act 1992 Employers of private domestic workers do not have to deduct PAYE or earner premium deduc- tions from payments to them. Instead, private domestic workers deduct their own PAYE and earner premium and pay the deductions to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. At the end of the income year Inland Revenue completes the IR 68 Employer PAYE Reconciliation Statement and gives a copy to the private domestic worker. Private domestic workers calculate their employer premium in their IR 3 returns, and pay it with their end-of-year tax. Deducting Premium from Payments due to Defaulters - Section 130, ARCI Act 1992 Where anyone has defaulted in paying any pre- mium or penalty, the Corporation may issue any other person who owes money to the defaulter with a deduction notice. This notice will require the person making the payment to pay an amount specified in the notice to the Corporation rather than to the defaulter. The Corporation will also issue a copy of the notice to the defaulter. If the Corporation issues a deduction notice to someone who owes money to the defaulter, the person receiving the notice commits an offence under the ARCI Act if they fail to pay the amount specified in the notice to the Corporation. Anyone convicted of this offence may be liable for a fine of up to $500. ACC Access to Accounts and Books - Section 129, ARCI Act 1992 The Corporation shall have access to books and accounts of employers and earners who have earnings other than as employees, so it can ascer- tain the accuracy of their statements of earnings. Small Balance Write-Off - Section 132, ARCI Act 1992 If the amount of the premium payable is $5 or less, earners and employers will not have to pay the premium and no penalty will be levied on this amount. Child Rebate - Section 115(20), ARCI Act 1992 Where employers, acting in accordance with Inland Revenue rulings, have not made any tax deduction from salary or wages paid to a child because the child qualifies for the child rebate under section 50A of the Income Tax Act, they will not have to make an earner premium deduction. Consequential Amendments to the Revenue Acts Payment of Tax Deductions to the Com- missioner - Section 353(1), Income Tax Act 1976 Amendments to this section require employers to show the amount of the total deductions (the combination of earner premium deductions and PAYE deductions) on the IR 12 deduction certifi- cate and the IR 68 Employer PAYE Reconciliation Statement. This section now includes definitions of “earner premium deductions” and “total deductions”. 14 Year in which Accident Compensation Levy, Earner Premium and Employer Premium are Deductible - Section 140A, Income Tax Act 1976 This section deals with the timing of the deduction allowed under section 104 for premiums paid by employers and self employed taxpayers. The employer premium and the premiums paid by self employed taxpayers are deductible in the year in which they become due and payable by the tax- payer. Transitional Tax Allowance Rebate - Section 50C, Income Tax Act 1976 Anyone who would have been working if they had not suffered a personal injury (for which they are receiving earnings related compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 1982) may claim the transitional tax allowance rebate. This section is amended so people can claim the rebate where they are receiving compensation under the ARCI Act. Amendments to GST Act There are two consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The definition of the term “supply” in section 5(13) of the GST Act is amended to ensure that indem- nity payments for loss of earnings paid out under the ARCI Act are not subject to GST. The input tax provisions of the GST Act (section 20(3)(v)) are also amended so that no input tax credit is allowed for indemnity for loss of earnings paid under the ARCI Act 1992. Amendments to Inland Revenue Department Act The Inland Revenue Department Act has been amended so that it refers to the new ARCI Act and Corporation, and to the new forms of taxable compensation provided by the ARCI Act. Summary This statement sets out the Commissioner's policy on interest deductibility under section 106(1)(h)(i) and (ia), and provides examples of its application. It also contains an analysis of the leading cases on interest deductibility underlying the policy. The Commissioner will allow an interest deduction if the interest has sufficient nexus with the income earning process. This depends on whether the borrowed capital is used in gaining or producing assessable income in the period in which the deduction is claimed, or in the future. The new policy broadens the scope of interest deductions available to taxpayers. The Commis- sioner will not deny an interest deduction simply because the taxpayer also makes a capital gain or loss in a given income year. Introduction and Application This statement outlines the Commissioner’s inter- pretation of section 106(h)(1)(i) and (ia). It replaces the statement entitled “Deductibility of Interest” in Public Information Bulletin No. 163 of May 1987. That earlier statement dealt with section 106(1)(h)(i); the previous interest deduct- ibility provision. This new policy will apply to all cases from the date of release of this statement, including the cases presently under review. The Commissioner’s current policy on section 106(1)(h)(ii) is in PIB No. 178 (February 1989). We will consider any request to reopen an assess- ment on this point in terms of the Commissioner’s policy on reopening assessments (see PIB No. 123 of January 1984). This statement contains - • a brief history of the interest deductibility provi- sion • a statement of the Commissioner’s current policy on the deductibility of interest • examples of application of the policy • a discussion on the case law underlying the policy statement Interest Deductibility Section 106(1)(h)(i) and (ia), Income Tax Act 1976 15 Background Section 106(1)(h) sets out the three current tests for the deductibility of interest. It provides that no deduction shall be made for interest, except so far as the Commissioner is satisfied that - (a) it is payable in gaining or producing the assess- able income for any income year; or (b) it is necessarily payable in carrying on a busi- ness for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (c) it is payable by one company in a group of companies on money borrowed to acquire shares in another company in that group of companies. The present section is similar to section 104, and resulted from an amendment to the Act in 1987. The Commissioner views the treatment of interest deductions as unchanged despite the change in the language of the section. The leading cases on the deductibility of interest on borrowed capital have all related to the previ- ous form of section 106(1)(h). In particular, the decisions in CIR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7184, Eggers v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5153 and Pacific Rendezvous v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5146 applied the previous words of the section. Public Trustee v C of T \[1938\] NZLR 436 considered section 80(1)(h) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923, an analogous earlier provision. Policy Section 106(1)(h)(i) Section 106(1)(h)(i) allows an interest deduction in so far as the interest is payable in gaining or producing assessable income. The Commissioner will consider the use of the capital for which the interest is paid to determine whether there is sufficient nexus between the interest and the gaining or producing of assessable income to meet the test for deductibility. The interest will be deductible where: (i) the related capital is used in the period the deduction is claimed to produce assessable income in any income year; and (ii) no identifiable part of that capital is used for the whole or part of that period in other ways (such as private or domestic use, or a use that produces exempt income). The interest will not be fully deductible if part of the capital is used for a private or domestic use or a use that is incapable of producing assessable income in the period the deduction is claimed or in the future. In this case only the portion of the interest relating to the income producing use will be deductible. See the "Apportionment" section below for more information about this. The onus is on the taxpayer to establish the degree to which the capital is used in the period in ques- tion in the production of assessable income. The taxpayer must show the factual basis of the claim. If that onus is discharged, the entire amount of interest is deductible. Whether the taxpayer’s evidence discharges that onus is a matter of degree and a question of fact. Section 106(1)(h)(ia) Section 106(1)(h)(ia) allows an interest deduction in so far as the interest expenditure is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. This subsection only applies to taxpayers in busi- ness. They, as well as people who are not carrying on business, may also claim some deductions under section 106(1)(h)(i). The inclusion of the second subparagraph allows further deductions for taxpayers in business, since it covers expendi- ture that may not be demonstrable as gaining or producing assessable income. Whether income must be produced in year interest deduction claimed Income does not have to be produced in the same income year in which the deduction is claimed under section 106(1)(h)(i) or (ia). However, income must be expected. Whether the income is expected is a subjective assessment of the intention of the taxpayer based on the particular circumstances of each case. Deductibility of interest incurred to retain assets producing assessable income Interest is deductible if a taxpayer establishes that the capital was borrowed to meet involuntary expenditure to retain assets used in producing assessable income. However, if the capital was borrowed for purposes quite alien from the income producing asset (such as meeting personal obliga- tions), the interest will not be deductible. Where the interest expenditure is incurred to retain some assets which produce assessable income and some which do not, it will have to be apportioned. The onus is on the taxpayer to establish that the interest is deductible, and what proportion of it is deductible. 16 Expenditure under the accrual rules Expenditure under financial arrangements is deemed to be interest. However, certain financial arrangements which give rise to deemed interest expenditure do not have any underlying capital (e.g., interest rate swaps). In these situations use of borrowed capital cannot determine whether the interest is deductible. Whether the interest is deductible in this situation is a matter of degree and a question of fact. The focus of the enquiry is on whether there is suffi- cient relationship between the expenditure and the income earning process of the taxpayer claiming the deduction (see CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61236). Apportionment Section 106(1)(h) contemplates apportionment of interest where there are competing uses. The Commissioner bases his approach to apportion- ment of interest on judicially developed guidelines. The circumstances of each case will determine how much of the interest expenditure is deductible. There is no precise judicial formula, but case law establishes that the apportionment method must be fair and not arbitrary (see Banks and Buckley and Young Ltd v CIR \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485; (1978) 3 NZTC 61271). For example, actual use of the item during the period the interest has been payable, or the availability of the item for business use could be the basis for apportionment. In some cases the competing advantages from the interest expenditure are intangible, and cannot be easily measured. The taxpayer must provide sufficient evidence to establish how much of the total interest expenditure is deductible. If the taxpayer fails to discharge this onus, none of the expenditure will be deductible. Examples The following examples illustrate the application of this policy. Example 1 An individual borrows $10,000 at 10% p.a. to finance a purchase of shares in a company. No dividend is paid in the 5 income years follow- ing the purchase of the shares. The taxpayer pays interest on the loan in each of the five income years. Is the interest deductible? Application: The individual can deduct the interest in full in each of the 5 income years because the capital is used in each year in gaining or producing assessable income. Even though the company paid no dividends, the interest will be deductible provided the com- pany has no restriction in its articles of associa- tion preventing the payment of dividends in the future. The interest is deductible as long as the shares are expected to earn assessable income. There is no requirement that assessable income be produced in the year the interest deduction is claimed. The interest is deductible under section 106(1)(h)(i); it cannot be deducted under section 106(1)(h)(ia) as the taxpayer is not in business. Example 2 A taxpayer borrows a substantial amount of money, and uses it to buy a house for invest- ment as part of a retirement plan. The house is rented at a market rental, but the interest exceeds the rental income earned. Can the taxpayer deduct the interest? Application: The interest is fully deductible under section 106(1)(h)(i) in every year the property is let or is available for letting. The taxpayer’s possible intention to make a capital gain from the house does not affect the deduct- ibility. The interest deduction is not limited to the amount of income earned. Section 106(1)(h)(ia) cannot apply as the tax- payer is not in business. Example 3 In a particular income year a self-employed taxpayer uses part of her home as an office in connection with her business. She has a mort- gage on the house. Is the interest on the mort- gage deductible in that income year? Application: There are two competing uses present - a private use and an income-earning use. The interest is deductible to the extent it is payable in gaining or producing assessable income. There must therefore be an apportion- ment between the two uses. In this situation the Commissioner would generally accept the apportionment on a floor area basis. The deduction is available under section 106(1)(h)(i) and 106(1)(h)(ia). 17 Example 4 A New Zealand importer of sport shoes buys US shoes to sell in New Zealand. The importer pays for the shoes in US$, and then hedges the obligation to pay US$ by a forward foreign exchange contract. This contract later results in a foreign exchange loss. Application: The exchange loss is deemed to be interest. This expenditure is deductible under section 106(1)(h)(i) and section 106(1)(h)(ia) as it has sufficient nexus with the taxpayer's income earning process (i.e., the selling of shoes). Example 5 Company A, which is in business, has insuffi- cient funds to pay its tax. Rather than realize assets which produce assessable income, it borrows money to make the payment. Is the interest on the money borrowed to meet the company’s tax obligations deductible? Application: The interest is fully deductible since it is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or produc- ing assessable income. The interest is payable in preserving assets required for the business of the taxpayer. In terms of the principles in Public Trustee there is sufficient nexus with the income earning process to satisfy the test for deductibility under section 106(1)(h)(ia). Example 6 (A) An individual who is not in business has an end of year tax liability. He borrows to pay the tax. His assets are a house and a car. Is the interest deductible? Application: The interest is not deductible because there is no nexus with the gaining or producing of assessable income. (B) The same taxpayer has investments in government stock. Rather than realize the investments he borrows to meet the tax ex- penditure. Is the interest deductible? Application: The interest is deductible under section 106(1)(h)(i) to the extent that it is payable in meeting an involuntary tax expendi- ture and preserving income producing assets. To the extent that the interest is paid to pre- serve non-income producing assets it will not be deductible. Apportionment of the interest will depend on the facts of each case. In this case the interest is not deductible under section 106(1)(h)(ia) because the taxpayer is not in business. Example 7 A taxpayer decides to buy a house to live in. She could finance the purchase by realising her income producing investments, but instead she decides to borrow to finance the purchase. Is the interest on the borrowed money deduct- ible? Application: The interest is not deductible as it does not satisfy the test in section 106(1)(h)(i). The interest payable is not used in gaining or producing assessable income. The expenditure is of a private or domestic nature and prohib- ited from deduction under section 106(1)(j). Example 8 A sole trader borrows to buy a luxury car for personal use rather than realize his business assets to meet the cost of the car. Is the interest deductible? Application: The interest is not deductible as it does not satisfy the tests in section 106(1)(h)(i) or (ia). There is no nexus with the income earning process. The interest is not payable in gaining or producing assessable income, nor is it necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assess- able income. The expenditure is of a private or domestic nature and prohibited from deduc- tion under section 106(1)(j). Example 9 A partnership borrows money to purchase an existing partner’s interest in the partnership. Is the interest deductible? Application: The interest is deductible because the capital is borrowed to replace capital which is used in carrying on the partnership's busi- ness. The interest is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income, and is therefore deductible under section 106(1)(h)(ia). Example 10 A company which is in business borrows money to repay a loan from a shareholder. Is the interest deductible? 18 Application: If the loan is used to replace capital which was used in the company's assessable income earning activity, the interest will be deductible under section 106(1)(h)(ia). The test for deductibility is satisfied as the interest is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or produc- ing assessable income. Scope of these Examples A general similarity with the examples will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each individual case will depend on its own facts, and the Commissioner may challenge deductibility of interest in some cases. For example, interest borrowed to purchase shares in a company which is precluded by its articles of association from paying dividends will not be deductible. The capital in that situation cannot fairly be said to be used to produce assessable income. The Commissioner will publish other examples on interest deductibility to supplement the guidelines in this statement. Appendix Appendix B to this TIB sets out in some detail the Commissioner’s interpretation of several leading cases on interest deductibility on which this statement is based. FBT - Prescribed Rate of Interest for Quarter commencing 1 April 1992 The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest loans has been lowered to 10.30 percent for the quarter which commenced on 1 April 1992. The rate for this quarter had previously been set at 10.50 percent, but there have been a small number of reductions in rate which have taken effect during this quarter. The new figure of 10.30 percent reflects the current average first mortgage interest rate from all major lenders. The new rate will continue to apply for the quarter commencing 1 July 1992 and subsequent quarters until further amended. As usual, we will be reviewing the rate again in August to check whether it still reflects the market rates during that quarter. Recent announcements by some banks may mean a further reduction at that time. The rate was changed by Amendment No. 13 to the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Regulations 1985, which was made by Order in Council on 25 May 1992. We have again made use of the 1991 amendment which allows the prescribed rate to be reduced during the quarter.

Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) (1) This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G17A: Discounted value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Cur- rency made by the Commissioner on 9 Febru- ary 1990. This determination differs from Determination G17A: (a) by expanding the scope of the determina- tion to ensure the acquisition price, for the purposes of the base price adjustment, must be determined in all circumstances; (b) making it clear that if all the amounts Payable and the dates on which those amounts are Payable are known at the first balance date after the Transfer Date, the yield to maturity method must be applied to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred during the term of the Deferred Property Settlement; (c) providing a method of calculating income derived or expenditure incurred during the term of a Deferred Property Settlement where the amounts Payable or the dates on which those amounts are Payable are not known with certainty at the first balance date after the Transfer Date; and (d) in the use of the Specified Rate. This deter- mination uses the method prescribed in Determination G23: Specified Rate. Determi- nation G17A used the market yield ascer- tained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. (2) In this determination an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or a specified option, where Payment in full is not made at the time at which the first right in the Speci- fied Property is to be transferred, will be called a “Deferred Property Settlement”. (3) This determination does not apply - (a) To short term agreements for the sale and purchase of property; or (b) To short term options; or (c) To private or domestic agreements for the sale and purchase of property; or (d) To deferred property settlements where any amount Payable is denominated in foreign currency; or (e) To deferred property settlements where the total deposits and other amounts Payable more than 31 days prior to the Transfer Date exceed 20% of the total purchase price. (4) Short term agreements for the sale and pur- chase of property and short term options are agreements or options under which settlement is required within - (a) 93 days of entry into the contract in the case of real property; or (b) 63 days of entry into the contract in the case of other property. Such short term agree- ments or options are excepted from the accruals provisions of the Act. A private or domestic agreement for the sale and pur- chase of property as defined in section 64B(1) is also an excepted financial arrange- ment. (5) For all deferred property settlements, a core acquisition price must be determined as at the date on which the first right in the property is transferred; for ease of reference, this date is called the “Transfer Date” in this determina- tion. Sections 64BA(2) and(3) of the Act define “acquisition price” in terms of the “core acquisition price”, which is itself defined in section 64BA(1). In section 64BA(1)(c)(i) an amount “w” is defined as the lowest price that the buyer and seller would have agreed upon for the property on the basis of Payment in full at the time at which the first right in the Specified Property is to be transferred. If there is no such lowest price, then paragraph (c)(ii) provides that “w” shall be “the discounted 3 value of the amounts Payable for the Specified Property as determined pursuant to a determi- nation made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. (6) As indicated in subclause 1(1) above, this determination requires the discounted value of the amounts Payable to be calculated at an interest rate ascertained in accordance with Determination G23: Specified Rate, as at the Transfer Date of the Specified Property. The Specified Rate is the market yield applying to Bank Bills of a similar term to the Credit Term; if the Credit Term is longer than twelve months the market yield on New Zealand Government Securities must be used. (7) The amounts Payable are then discounted to the Transfer Date, using the yield so ascer- tained and the present value calculation Method A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. The sum of the discounted amounts and any deposit or other amounts Paid on or before the Transfer Date is the amount of “w” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. (8) The core acquisition price is used to determine the acquisition price of a Deferred Property Settlement in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. (9) Once the acquisition price is known, income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a Deferred Property Settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the Specified Property was equal to the amount of the core acquisition price using the yield to maturity method, which could be that determined in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, or an alternative method producing a result which is not materially different. (10)For the purposes of determining the income derived or expenditure incurred of a Deferred Property Settlement the yield to maturity method (or an alternative method producing not materially different results) will not apply: (a) Where in relation to the Deferred Property Settlement any amount Payable or the date on which any amount is Payable is not known at the first balance date after Trans- fer Date; or (b) Where the Credit Term of the Deferred Property Settlement is not known at the date of entry into the Deferred Property Settlement. (11)Where the yield to maturity method can not be applied as the amounts Payable or the dates on which those amounts are Payable are not known, the “best estimate method” of deter- mining income derived or expenditure in- curred is to be used. The method requires each party to the arrangement to estimate the unknown variables (the Credit Term or the amounts Payable or dates on which amounts are Payable) in relation to the Deferred Prop- erty Settlement. The estimates should be fair and reasonable given the facts known in relation to the arrangement. The discounted value of the amounts estimated may be used as the basis for a yield to maturity accrual to determine income derived or expenditure incurred over the term of the Deferred Prop- erty Settlement. (12)If estimates of the credit term of cash flows or the dates on which amounts are Payable change an adjustment must be made using the method specified in Determination G26: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrange- ment in the income year in which the change occurs. That method requires an adjustment to be made in the year the estimates change. The effect of the adjustment is that the total income or expenditure up to the end of the year in which the estimates change is equal to what it would have been had the timing and exact details of the new estimates been known at the first balance date after the Transfer Date. The adjustment must be made on the basis of fair and reasonable re-estimates of the un- known variables, which re-estimates are required to be undertaken by the parties for these purposes at the end of any year when actual cashflows and/or factual circumstances have rendered the original estimate (or previ- ous re-estimate) no longer fair and reasonable. (13)Where any party to a Deferred Property Settlement fails to undertake any such esti- mate or re-estimate or to communicate such estimate or re-estimate to the Commissioner in the income tax return for the relevant year, or where any party adopts an estimate or re- estimate which is in the Commissioner’s opinion not or no longer fair and reasonable, 4 the Commissioner shall determine his own estimates and the method below shall be applied. Such estimates or re-estimates by the Commissioner may also be subject to change, so as to reflect different actual cashflows and/ or factual circumstances, in the manner contemplated in subclause 1(12) and this subclause 1(13) of this determination. (14)When settlement takes place the acquisition price should be recalculated using the dis- counting provisions of this determination for the purposes of the base price adjustment. 2. Reference (1) This determination is made pursuant to sections 64E(1)(a), 64E(1)(f), and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. (2) Determination G17A: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to a Deferred Property Settlement Denominated in New Zealand Currency is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this determination is signed. 3. Scope of Determination (1) This determination shall apply to any deferred property settlement in relation to which a person is a holder or issuer, but shall not apply - (a) To any Deferred Property Settlement where any amount Payable (other than the prop- erty that is the subject of the Deferred Property Settlement) is not denominated in New Zealand dollars; or (b) To any Deferred Property Settlement where more than 20% of the amount Payable is required to be Paid more than 31 days prior to the Transfer Date. 4. Principle (1) The discounted value of amounts Payable for the Specified Property is calculated as at the Transfer Date using - (a) The Specified Rate; and (b) Present value calculation Method A pro- vided in subclause 6(2) of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (2) The discounted value of the amounts Payable for the Specified Property enables the acquisi- tion price for a Deferred Property Settlement to be ascertained for the purposes of determin- ing income derived or expenditure incurred in any period and the base price adjustment. (3) Where any amounts Payable or the dates on which any amounts are Payable are not known with certainty reasonable estimates of the unknown variables must be made to enable an estimate of income derived or expenditure incurred in any income year. 5. Interpretation (1) In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires - Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “the Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Bank Bill” means an order to Pay, denomi- nated in New Zealand currency and drawn upon and accepted by a person who is a registered bank for the purposes of the Re- serve Bank Act, 1989: “Credit Term” means the period commencing on the day after the Transfer Date and ending on the day on which the Final Payment is required to be made: “Deferred Property Settlement” means an agreement for the sale and purchase of prop- erty or a specified option under which any amount is Payable after the date on which the first right in the Specified Property is trans- ferred: “Final Payment” in relation to a Deferred Property Settlement means the last Payment required to be made by the issuer of a De- ferred Property Settlement under the agree- ment, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total value of con- sideration required to be given by the issuer under the financial arrangement: “Paid”, in relation to any amount Paid to or Paid by any person, includes distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interests of or on behalf of or to the order of the person; and, in relation to any amount, “Pay”, “Payable” and “Payment” have corresponding meanings: “Specified Property” in relation to a Deferred Property Settlement means the property that is the subject of the Deferred Property Settle- ment: 5 “Specified Rate” at any date shall be calcu- lated pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate: “Transfer Date” in relation to a Deferred Property Settlement means the day on which the first right in the Specified Property is transferred. (2) Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commis- sioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. (3) For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6. Method Calculating the Acquisition Price for the Base Price Adjustment (1) For the purposes of subparagraph (ii) of the definition of “w” in section 64BA(1)(c) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts Payable for the Specified Property in relation to any person shall be calculated by sum- ming - (a) Every amount Payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the Specified Property on or before the Transfer Date; and (b) The present value as at the Transfer Date of amounts Payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the Specified Property after the Transfer Date. Where the amounts Payable and the dates those amounts are Payable are not known at the first balance date after the Transfer Date, the acquisition price shall be calculated for the purposes of the base price adjustment when the finan- cial arrangement matures. (2) For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at the Transfer Date of the amounts Payable shall be calculated, subject to subclause (3) of this clause, using Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (3) For the purposes of subclause (2) of this clause the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts Payable is required to be calculated shall be the Specified Rate deter- mined as at the Transfer Date of the Specified Property and according to Determination G23: Specified Rate. (4) The present value of the amounts Payable together with any deposit or amounts Paid on or before the Transfer Date is the amount “w” to be used to calculate the core acquisition price in accordance with section 64BA(1) of the Act. (5) The core acquisition price is used to determine the acquisition price of a Deferred Property Settlement in accordance with section 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. The acquisition price used will be used as variable “b” of the base price adjustment. Calculating the Present Value of the Amounts Payable for the Purposes of Determining Income Derived or Ex- penditure Incurred During the Term of a Deferred Property Settlement (6) Where the amounts Payable and the dates on which those amounts are Payable are known by the first balance date after the Transfer Date, the income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a Deferred Property Settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the Specified Property were equal to the core acquisition price calculated in accordance with the Act and subclauses (1) to (5) of this clause, using the yield to maturity method or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (7) Where the amounts Payable and the dates on which those amounts are Payable are not known by the first balance date after the Transfer Date, fair and reasonable estimates of the amounts Payable and the dates on which those amounts are Payable are to be used for the purposes of calculating the core acquisi- tion price. The income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a Deferred Property Settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the Specified Property were equal to the core acquisition price calculated in accordance with the Act and subclauses (1) to (5) of this clause, using the yield to maturity method or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 6 (8) If estimates of the credit term or amounts Payable or receivable or the dates on which amounts are Payable or receivable change, an adjustment must be made using the method specified in Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement in the income year in which the change occurs. That method requires an adjustment to be made in the year the estimates change. The effect of the adjustment is that the total income or expenditure up to the end of the year in which the estimates change is equal to what it would have been had the timing and exact details of the new estimates been known at the first balance date after the Transfer Date. (9) Where any party to a Deferred Property Settlement fails to undertake any such esti- mate or re-estimate or to communicate such estimate or re-estimate to the Commissioner in the income tax return for the relevant year, or where any party adopts an estimate or re- estimate which is in the Commissioner’s opinion not or no longer fair and reasonable, the Commissioner may determine his own estimates or re-estimates and the method used in this determination shall be applied. Such estimates or re-estimates by the Commissioner may also be subject to change, so as to reflect different actual cashflows and/or factual circumstances, in the manner contemplated in subclause 6(8) and this subclause 6(9) of this determination. 7. Examples (1) A commercial property is sold for $1,500,000 under a sale and purchase agreement, subject to certain planning consents being obtained. A deposit of $150,000 is Paid on 20 December 1988, when the agreement is entered into. The balance of $1,350,000 is Payable in two equal instalments due 3 and 6 months after the date of possession. Under the agreement, possession passes to the purchaser on the date the sale becomes uncon- ditional; the purchaser has no other prior rights. The purchaser’s balance date is 31 March. On 3 March 1989 the planning consents are obtained and the sale becomes unconditional. The Credit Term of the agreement (3 March 1989 to 4 September 1989) is 185 days (or 2 quarters). As this is under twelve months the yield on Bank Bills must be ascertained. The yield on Bank Bills of a similar term to the Credit Term ascertained on 20 December 1988 pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate, is 13.2%. In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer” for purposes of the accruals regime. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 3 March 1989 (“the speci- fied date”) as follows - R = 13.2% (the Specified Rate) N = 4(since the Payments are at quarterly intervals) F = R 100 x N = 0.03300 At 3 June 1989: A = 0 B = $675,000 (Payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder on 4 September 1989) C = 0(Payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer) thus the present value at 3 June 1989 = A + B - C 1 + F = $653,437 At 3 March 1989: A = $653,437, B = $675,000, C = 0 therefore the present value at 3 March 1989 = A + B - C 1 + F = $1,285,999 To this must be added the $150,000 deposit, giving a total present value of $1,435,999 which is the item “w” used in calculating the core acquisition price. For the purposes of recognising the expendi- ture incurred in the1989 and 1990 income year Determination G3 is used (alternatively, G11A could be used), where - R = 13.2% N = 4 F = 0.0330 The expenditure incurred for the first 3 months is - $1,285,999 x 0.0330 = $42,437.96 7 This expenditure is allocated to the 1989 income year in accordance with Determination G1A - 1989 income year - 28 days = $12,915.90 On the maturity of the financial arrangement, in the 1990 income year, a base price adjust- ment is calculated to arrive at the expenditure deemed to be incurred. Base Price Adjustment = a - (b + c) where - a = all consideration Paid = $1,500,000 b = the acquisition price = $1,435,999 c = expenditure incurred in previous income years = $12,915.90 bpa = $51,085.10 which is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the 1990 income year. As this is a positive amount it is deemed to be income derived by the holder in that income year. (2) An agreement for the sale and purchase of a rural property (which is to be subdivided) was entered into on 10 September 1990. The terms of the agreement are: Price: $525,000 (including the deposit) Deposit: $25,000 Paid on 10 September 1990 Possession: 1 February 1991 Settlement: On the later of 1 August 1991 or 14 days after deposit of the subdivi- sion plan in the land office The lowest price, at the time the agreement for the sale and purchase of property was entered into on the basis of Payment in full on the date the property is transferred, has not been agreed between the parties. This determination requires the buyer and seller to make a fair and reasonable estimate of the anticipated settlement date in order to calculate income or expenditure accruing at balance date. The acquisition price for the purposes of the base price adjustments will be recalculated if the facts change from those which are esti- mated. It would be appropriate in this case to expect settlement on 1 August 1991, the last day for settlement under the terms of the agreement for the sale and purchase of property. The appropriate calculations to determine income derived or expenditure incurred for the purchaser are shown below. The purchaser has a 31 March balance date and is the “is- suer” for purposes of the accruals legislation. The Credit Term of the agreement (1 February 1991 to 1 August 1991) is 181 days. As this is under twelve months the yield on bank bills must be ascertained in order to discount the purchase price. The yield on bank bills of a similar term to the Credit Term on 20 December 1988 pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate, is 11.5%. Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calcu- late the present value as at 1 February 1991 (“the specified date”) as follows- R = 11.5% (the Specified Rate) N = 2 (since the Payments are at half yearly intervals) F = R 100 x N = 0.0575 At 1 February 1991: A = 0 B = $500,000 (Payable by the issuer or receiv- able by the holder, estimated to occur on 1 August 1991) C = 0 (Payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer) whence present value at 1 February 1991 = A + B - C 1 + F = $472,813 To this must be added the $25,000 deposit, giving a total present value of $497,813. This amount is used as the basis for an accrual calculation. For the purposes of recognising the expendi- ture incurred in the 1991 and 1992 income years, Determination G3 or Determination G11A or an alternative method producing not materially different results may be used. (Note: As there is only one period of less than a year and no discount or premium a yield to maturity accrual method will produce the same result as spreading the difference be- tween the present value and the total amount Payable on a daily basis over the term of the arrangement). 8 The amount allocated to each day in the period is: $(525,000 - 497,813) = $150.20 181 There are 58 days between 1 February and 31 March therefore expenditure incurred in the 1991 financial year is: $150.20 x 58 = $8,711.60 If settlement occurs as expected on 1 August 1991, a base price adjustment is calculated to determine income derived or expenditure incurred. The acquisition price for the pur- poses of the base price adjustment will be as calculated above. Base Price Adjustment = a - (b + c) where: a = all consideration Paid = $525,000 b = the acquisition price = $497,813 c = expenditure incurred in previous income years = $8,711.60 bpa = $18,475.40, which is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the 1992 income year. If, however, the settlement date differs from 1 August 1991, the acquisition price for the purposes of the base price adjustment should be recalculated using the method provided in this determination. (3) The assets of a company are sold on a deferred Payment basis for a price which is in part to be determined by the profitability of the com- pany over the next 36 months. The terms of the arrangement are as follows: Price: $1,300,000 plus 10% of profits for the next three years Deposit: $100,000 Paid on 10 September 1990 Possession: 1 February 1991 Settlement: Half-yearly instalments of $200,000 on 1 August and 1 February plus 10% of profits on 1 February each year. The cashflows in relation to the arrangement, including the profits forecast (based on previ- ous company data and forecast trends in the business, costs, capital expenditures, etc.) by the buyer, are: DateAmountProfitTotal Deposit100,000100,000 1/8/91200,000200,000 1/2/92200,00025,000225,000 1/8/92200,000200,000 1/2/93200,00030,000230,000 1/8/93200,000200,000 1/2/94200,00040,000240,000 The buyer and the seller were unable to agree on a lowest price which is why the percentage of profits option was adopted. An interest element has been capitalised into the cost of sale. The seller (holder) is obliged to return accrual income associated with the transaction. The buyer (issuer) will seek a deduction for accrual expenditure incurred. As the lowest price was not agreed the discounted value method applies. This example looks at the calculations made by the buyer. The Credit Term of the agreement (1 February 1991 to 1 February 1994) is 1,096 days (or 6 half year periods). As this is over twelve months the yield on New Zealand Govern- ment Stock of a similar term must be ascer- tained. The yield on Government Stock of a term similar to the Credit Term on 1 February 1991 pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate is 10.0%. In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer”. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 1 February 1991 (the “specified date”) as follows: R = 10.0% (the Specified Rate) N = 2 (since the Payments are at half- yearly intervals) F= R 100 x N = 0.05 At 1 August 1993: A =0 B = $200,000 + (0.10 x $400,000) (Payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder as at 1 February 1994) C = 0 (Payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer) 9 CumulativeCumulative Discounted Discounted CashflowsCashflows at Periodat Period Expenditure CashflowsEndBeginningIncurred (y)(z)(y - z) 1/2/95(240,000) 240,000 228,571 11,429 1/8/94(200,000) 428,571 408,162 20,409 1/2/94(230,000) 638,162 607,773 30,389 1/8/93(200,000) 807,773 769,308 38,465 1/2/93(225,000) 994,308 946,960 47,348 1/8/92(200,000) 1,146,960 1,092,343 54,617 1/2/921,192,345 (100,000) 202,657 The yield to maturity rate (note that it is assumed no fees or other Payments are made in relation to the financial arrangement) is 10.0%.

However for the purposes of calculating the amount deemed to be income derived or expenditure incurred in the final income year, it is necessary to apply section 64F of the Act - the base price adjustment. On 1 February 1993 the profits of the company are $500,000. The buyer therefore Pays $50,000 to the purchaser. The buyer’s forecast of future Payments remains as originally esti- therefore the present value at 1 February 1991 = A + B - C 1 + F = $228,571 At 1 February 1993: A = $228,571 B = $200,000 C = 0 therefore the present value at 1 February 1991 = A + B - C 1 + F = $408,163 It will be found that the present value of the cashflows, by continuing to discount as shown above and in accordance with Determination G10B, is $1,192,343 (which figure is arrived at as demonstrated in the table below). This amount is the value of the property for the purposes of a yield to maturity accrual.

In default of any such estimate or re-estimate, the Commissioner may adopt or substitute his own estimates. Thus, if the cashflows change from estimates in the 1994 year to an extent that the re- estimates are no longer fair and reasonable, the method in Determination G25 may again be used to calculate expenditure incurred. This determination is signed by me on the 28th day of May in the year 1992. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue 11 This determination may be cited as “Determina- tion G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement”. 1. Explanation (1) A financial arrangement may be varied for many reasons. It may be varied by mutual agreement between the parties, by operation of the terms of the arrangement (such as an option), or by a partial remission of debt. One way of effecting a change is by terminating the existing financial arrangement and issuing a new one. That situation is straight forward and does not need a specific determination. A base price adjustment is calculated and in- come or expenditure under the new financial arrangement is calculated using the yield to maturity method or an appropriate alterna- tive. (2) This determination applies where the varia- tion is effected by changes to the original financial arrangement. Such changes may have been contemplated or anticipated in the original financial arrangement, for example: (a) where there are options in the financial arrangement exercisable by either party, or (b) where the original financial arrangement contains an intent that it will be altered in certain prescribed ways (or at the agree- ment of the parties) on the happening of some event. In both these cases, at the date of acquisition, an accrual method can not be applied that will last unaltered until the maturity or other sale of the financial arrangement. This determina- tion applies in such cases, even though the financial arrangement may set out quite clearly how it is to be altered. The determina- tion does not apply where the terms of the financial arrangement are unequivocal as to the nature, time and amount of the changes made. (3) At the most basic level, a variation will in- volve a change to the cash flows or the dates upon which they are payable. (4) The method requires an adjustment to be made in the year of variation. The effect of the variation is that the total income or expendi- ture up to the end of the year of variation is equal to what it would have been had the timing and exact details of the variations been known at the date of issue or acquisition. (5) The method is similar to that used in section 64D(4) of the Act where a taxpayer becomes a cash basis holder. It is also similar to section 64C(2B) that gives a method of changing to the straight line method of accounting for financial arrange- ments from another method used. (6) This determination does not apply to variable rate financial arrangements, where the only variation is a change in the index, price, or rate (these will be dealt with by a subsequent determination entitled Variable Rate Financial Arrangements). It does apply where a variation occurs that does not result from a change in the indicator rate. For example when the amount of principal is varied without a corresponding payment or the margin above the indicator rate is varied. 2. References This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Scope of Determination This determination applies to any financial ar- rangement where the amounts payable, or the dates on which they are payable, are varied after the date of issue or acquisition, but it does not apply: (a) To a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement (as defined in this determination) under which the only variation is a change in the economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or prices, or banking rates or general commercial rates, or (b) Where the variation is effected by the maturity or other termination of the financial arrange- ment and the issue of a new financial arrange- ment, or (c) Where the variation is made according to the terms of the financial arrangement, which terms are unequivocal as to the nature, time and amount of the changes made. Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement 12 4. Principle The adjustment in this determination is made in the year of variation. The result is that the total accumulated income or expenditure up to the end of the year of variation is equal to that that would have applied had the changes been known at the date of issue or acquisition. 5. Interpretation (1) In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires: Expressions used have the same meaning as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M; the “Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976; “Variable Rate Financial Arrangement” means a financial arrangement under which: (a) the interest rate is determined by a fixed relationship to economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or prices, or banking or general commercial rates; or (b) the interest rate is set periodically by reference to market interest rates. (2) Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commis- sioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. (3) For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters. However, the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning differ- ent from that given by its definition. 6. Method (1) In the income year in which a financial ar- rangement is varied, a person who is the issuer or holder of the financial arrangement shall include, in calculating assessable income for the income year, an amount in respect of the financial arrangement calculated in ac- cordance with the following formula: a - b - c + d, where: ais the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrange- ment was acquired or issued; bis the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrange- ment was acquired or issued; cis the sum of all amounts treated as income derived of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year; and dis the sum of all amounts treated as ex- penditure incurred of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previ- ous income year. The amount so calculated shall: (a) Where it is a positive amount, be deemed to be income derived by the holder or the issuer as the case may be: (b) Where it is a negative amount, be deemed to be expenditure incurred by the holder or issuer as the case may be: Provided that expenditure incurred by the holder, in the year in which the financial arrangement is varied, using this method shall not exceed total income derived by the holder in previous income years. (2) In income years after the income year in which the financial arrangement is varied, income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred shall be calculated using the terms of the financial arrangement as varied and the provisions of the Act. 7. Examples (1)Example A (a straight line method) A New Zealand taxpayer issues (borrows) $8,800 on 10 July 1991 for 3 years with interest at 10% pa payable half-yearly in arrears. The loan is made by issuing $10,000 of notes at a discount. There are no fees. The issuer is a New Zealand taxpayer eligible to use the straight line method (Determination G24), and chooses to do so. The issuer has a balance date of 31 March. 13 The total finance charges are: + 10,000 principal payable + 3,000 interest payable -8,800 principal received + 4,200 Since the principal outstanding is fixed throughout, and all time units are of the same length, Method A of Determination G24: Straight Line Method was used to calculate expenditure incurred. Accordingly, an amount of 4,200/6 = 700 would be expenditure incurred in each half year period. On 10 July 1993, in consideration of the issu- er’s circumstances, the holder agrees to forgive the 5th and 6th interest payments but not the principal amount due. The treatment of the loan in the 1994 and following years is set out below. If the actual cashflows had been known at the outset, namely: 10 July 1991+ 8,800 principal received 10 January 1992 -500 interest 10 July 1992-500 interest 10 January 1993 -500 interest 10 July 1993-500 interest 10 July 1994- 10,000 principal paid - 3,200 expenditure incurred then Method B of Determination G24: Straight Line Method would have applied because the length of the periods between payments are unequal. Under that method the Total Finance Charges of $3,200 would be spread over the term of the loan in proportion to the principal outstanding and length of each period. Using the formula in Method B of Determination G24, expenditure of $533.33 would have been incurred for each period. Then using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis, (on a 365 day basis) the position of the lender before and after the variation would be as follows: Year EndingExpenditure IncurredActual 31 MarchExpenditure Original (1)Changed (2)Incurred 19921,0167741,016 19931,400 (3)1,0671,400 19941,4001,067492 (4) 1995384292292 Totals4,2003,2003,200 (1) Expenditure calculated using Method A of Determination G24: Straight Line Method. (2) Expenditure calculated using Method B of Determination G24: Straight Line Method. (3) The number of actual days was used to arrive at the 1992 figure (a broken period plus a leap year), whilst the annual pay- ments were used for the 1993 and 1994 years. (4) Expenditure calculated using this determi- nation where: a = 0 b = 774 + 1,067 + 1,067 = 2,908 c = 0 d = 1,016 + 1,400 = 2,416 so a - b - c + d = - 492 which being a nega- tive amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the year. In the 1995 income year the expenditure incurred would be calculated using the base price adjustment in section 64F where: a = all consideration paid = 12,000 b = acquisition price = 8,800 c = expenditure incurred in previous years = 2,908 so a - (b + c) = 292, which because it is a positive amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred in terms of section 64F(4)(b)(i). (2) Example B (a zero coupon loan) On 15 April 1991 a 5 year zero coupon bond with a face value of $1,000,000 is issued for $500,000. The lender is a New Zealand tax- payer who balances on 31 March, and uses the yield to maturity method of accounting for financial arrangements. By mutual agreement the debt is varied on 15 April 1993: the borrower repays $250,000, and the face value of the bond is reduced to $600,000. The original yield to maturity is 14.870% pa, so that the income of the lender (the holder) would be as follows: YearOpeningAccrual IncomeClosing Principal EndingPrincipal(1)Outstanding 15 AprilOutstanding 1992500,00074,350574,350 1993574,35085,406659,756 1994659,75698,106757,862 1995757,862112,694870,556 1996870,556129,4440 500,000 14 (1) Calculated using the yield to maturity method and a rate of 14.870%.

In the 1997 income year the income derived would be calculated using the base price adjustment in section 64F where: a = all consideration paid to the person = 850,000 b = acquisition price = 500,000 c = income derived in previous income years = 346,935 a - (b + c) = 3,065 which is a positive amount therefore in terms of section 64F(4)(a)(i) it is deemed to be income derived by the holder (lender). This determination is signed by me on the 28th day of May in the year 1992. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue 15 Appendix B: Interest Deductibility - Leading Cases Section 106(1)(h)(i) and (ia), Income Tax Act 1976 This appendix sets out in some detail the Commis- sioner’s interpretation on several of the leading cases on interest deductibility which form the basis of the statement. The change in wording of Section 106(1)(h) All the previous cases on the deductibility of interest on borrowed capital related to section 106(1)(h)(i) in its old form. Interest under that section was deductible in so far as the Commis- sioner was satisfied that it was paid on capital employed in the production of assessable income. The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1987 enacted the current form of section 106(1)(h) with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1985. The amendment aligned the tests of deduct- ibility in section 104 and 106(1)(h) so that any deemed interest under the accrual rules could satisfy the test for deductibility. This applied particularly to deemed interest from financial arrangements where there is no underlying principal (such as interest rate swaps). The amendment was not intended to change the existing law, but to extend it to include this category of interest. In Pacific Rendezvous, the Court of Appeal stated that the test in section 104 is no more restrictive than the test in the (then) section 106(1)(h). The Court of Appeal added that the considerations under both the provisions would be the same. Implicit in this view is that the result under either test would be the same. The Commissioner views the current law on interest deductibility on borrowed capital as governed by the principles laid down in Public Trustee, Pacific Rendezvous, Eggers and Brierley. Each of these cases is outlined below. The Case Law on Interest Deductibility on Borrowed Capital Public Trustee The Public Trustee case involved the trustee of an estate that consisted partly of assets producing assessable income but principally of assets pro- ducing non-assessable income. The trustee did not have sufficient cash to meet the death duties. Rather than realise assets producing assessable income, the trustee borrowed money to meet the duties. The issue before the court was whether the interest on the borrowed capital was deductible. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the capital was employed in the production of both assessable and non-assessable income. Further, the amount of the interest deduction was a matter for the Commissioner. Apportionment of interest was not an issue in this case as the parties had agreed on a method. This case is examined in more detail under "Deductibility of Interest Incurred to Retain Assets Producing Assessable Income" below. Pacific Rendezvous The next case was Pacific Rendezvous. It involved capital borrowed to expand a motel business by adding additional units. The question was whether the interest on the capital was deductible. The taxpayer acknowledged that the dominant purpose of the borrowing was to increase the capital value of the motel before selling it, al- though the completed units were rented out until the business was sold, and did produce assessable income. The Court of Appeal held that all the capital was used in the production of assessable income and the interest was fully deductible. The court ap- proved the use of the capital as the appropriate test to determine the deductibility of the interest. Eggers The Eggers case involved capital borrowed to acquire a property which was to be farmed. The farm property was leased during development and pending substantial farming operations. The Court of Appeal held that the leasing of the land was part of a wider income earning process. The court concluded that the borrowed capital was fully committed to the income earning proc- ess and there was no other use to which the land could be put. This meant the interest expenditure was fully deductible. The court also considered the further issue of whether assessable income needed to be produced in the same income year in which the deduction was claimed. The court held that there was no such requirement and that the term “assessable income” used in section 106(1)(h) meant the assessable income of the taxpayer generally. 16 Brierley The Brierley case is the most recent Court of Appeal decision on this issue. It is clear that the Court saw the decision as an application of the principles set out in the earlier cases of Public Trustee, Pacific Rendezvous and Eggers. These are the facts: The taxpayer borrowed money to subscribe for shares in BIL cash issues. In the income tax re- turns for the years ended 31 March 1978 to 1981, the taxpayer claimed a deduction for the interest on the money borrowed to acquire the shares. The taxpayer received assessable dividend income from BIL shares in the 1979 income year only. In all other material income years the taxpayer received only non-taxable distributions from the BIL shares. The Commissioner’s assessments apportioned the interest in the ratio of taxable dividends derived to the sum of taxable dividends plus cash distributions from capital sources in the relevant income years. The Taxation Review Authority allowed the deduction in full. The Commissioner appealed. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and held that: (i) the interest was fully deductible as the capital was used in the production of assessable income in the material income years or future income years, and no identifiable part of the capital was used for the whole or part of the year in other ways; (ii) the taxpayer's purpose in incurring the ex- penditure was not the test to be applied in determining whether the interest expenditure was deductible; (iii) the taxpayer does not have to earn assessable income in the period to deduct the interest. The term “assessable income” as used in the section meant assessable income of the tax- payer generally rather than income in a particular accounting period; and (iv) section 106(1)(h) provided a test for deduct- ibility of interest independent of section 104. Note: in the earlier case of Pacific Rendezvous Richardson J in his judgment did recognize that in some circumstances the income derived from the capital on which the interest is paid is so modest, if not inconsequential, that it might well have a bearing on the question of whether the funds can fairly be characterized as being employed in the production of assessable income. His Honour suggested that Harley v CIR; Jenkins v CIR \[1971\] NZLR 482 may have been such a case. Deductibility of Interest Incurred to Retain Assets producing Assessable Income The leading case on the deductibility of interest where the borrowed capital is indirectly used in the production of assessable income (for example, capital borrowed to retain assets producing assessable income) is Public Trustee. The facts of the case are outlined under "Public Trustee" above. The issue was whether the interest on capital borrowed to pay death duties by the trustee of an estate was deductible. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that part of the interest was deductible because the capital was used to produce assessable income. Their Honours could see no distinction between interest on capital used to acquire assets for producing assessable income (which is clearly deductible) and interest on capital borrowed to retain such assets. The court added that the amount of the interest that could be deducted was for the Com- missioner to determine, since the capital was employed to produce both assessable and non- assessable income. The court recognised that there should be apportionment of interest in this type of situation. In the leading judgment of the court, Myers C.J. acknowledged that the debt had to be incurred for the purpose of maintaining the income of the estate and preventing its reduction if the interest was to be deductible. If the debt was incurred for a purpose wholly unconnected with the produc- tion of the assessable income of the estate, then by inference the interest would not have been de- ductible. His Honour also distinguished between voluntary and involuntary expenditure. He held that interest on capital borrowed to meet death duties was deductible because the death duties were an involuntary expenditure that the trustee was compelled to pay. That case establishes that interest is deductible to the extent that the taxpayer establishes that capital has been borrowed to meet involuntary expendi- ture to retain assets producing assessable income. However, if the capital is borrowed for purposes quite alien to the income producing asset (such as to meet a personal obligation), the interest would not be deductible. Where the interest expenditure is also incurred to retain assets which do not produce assessable income, the interest will have to be apportioned. Only the interest which relates to retaining the assets which produce assessable income will be deductible. 17 For example, if a taxpayer who owns a farm borrows to meet obligations under a Matrimonial Property Act settlement instead of selling assets which produce assessable income to raise the funds, the interest on the borrowed capital will be deductible. The taxpayer must make the payment under statute, and in terms of Public Trustee the interest has sufficient nexus to the income produc- ing activity. If the interest is payable in preserving an asset which is used both for a private and domestic use (e.g., a homestead on the farm in which the taxpayer resides), and an income producing use, the interest must be apportioned. This is consist- ent with the decision in Public Trustee which accepted that interest is only deductible to the extent it is used in the production of assessable income. This view is not precluded by the more recent decision in Williams v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5078. In that case the taxpayer was allowed an interest deduction in full on capital borrowed to meet a Matrimonial Property Act settlement. However, the issue of apportionment was not addressed by the court as it was not raised in the case. The Public Trustee case considered a provision in the same form as the previous section 106(1)(h)(i). The principles in that case are applicable to section 106(1)(h)(i). and 106(1)(h)(ia). The tests under both subparagraphs applying Public Trustee will be the same. Interest will be deductible under either subparagraph to the extent the taxpayer establishes that the capital is used to meet an involuntary expenditure in order to preserve an asset producing assessable income. The onus will always be on the taxpayer to estab- lish that the interest is deductible and what proportion of it is deductible. If there is no factual basis for the claim the interest is not deductible.

Corrections
-----------

The _Increasing electronic filing_ item published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 30 No 5 contained an error on page 36 in the _Key features_ section.  
  
The text reads:  

"An investment income payer who does provide their investment income information to the Commissioner electronically is subject to a penalty of $250, due and payable 30 days after the end of the month in which the payer was required to provide the information to the Commissioner electronically".

It should read:  

"An investment income payer who does **not** provide their investment income information to the Commissioner electronically is subject to a penalty of $250, due and payable 30 days after the end of the month in which the payer was required to provide the information to the Commissioner electronically."

* * *

The _Measures to encourage provision of IRD numbers_ item, published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 30 No 5, contained an error on page 34 under the heading _Joint investors IRD numbers_.  
  
This section should have also included the following line:

"This does not apply to a joint investment made through an intermediary that is a company, trust or partnership. These investments should be treated as made by a single investor. A custodian may also adopt this treatment."

Example 9 published in the _Simplifying tax administration – individuals income tax_ item on page 14 is incorrect.  
  
**Example 9**  
  
Lauren, Olivia and Ruairi have a brother called Jeff who also works at the accounting firm and earns salary and wages. On 1 April 2018, Jeff also commences a start-up technology venture, which he operates in his own capacity. Although Jeff is only working on his venture part time, it is successful and he earns an additional $200,000 for the 2018–19 tax year.  
  
Inland Revenue reviews Jeff’s income information at the end of the 2018–19 tax year and, based on the information held for Jeff, the Commissioner is satisfied that the information contained in his pre-populated account correctly and completely records Jeff’s income for that tax year. Inland Revenue therefore finalises Jeff’s pre-populated account and it becomes an assessment on 15 May 2019.  
  
New section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual, or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual, may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Although Jeff clearly has “other income” that he needs to provide, he has been treated as a qualifying individual and therefore has until his terminal tax date (7 February 2020) to provide any additional information and amend his tax position for the year.  
  
Jeff logs into myIR on 1 February 2020 and updates his tax position to include an additional $200,000 in income and finalises his account for the tax year. Although this is treated as a new assessment for the purposes of section 22G(3), Jeff is liable to pay provisional tax as he derived untaxed income during the tax year which caused him to have residual income tax (RIT) of more than $2,500 at year-end.  
  
Because of his level of untaxed income, Jeff’s RIT exceeds $60,000 and therefore he does not qualify for the provisional tax safe harbour in section 120KE.  
  
As Jeff does not meet the definition of a natural person with an initial provisional tax liability (as he continues to derive income from employment), he can use the interest concession rules in section 120KBB. This means that Jeff’s RIT will be due and payable on the date of his last instalment of provisional tax for that year (being 7 May 2019 for Jeff as he has a standard 31 March balance date)as he was not liable to make any provisional tax payments during the year (because his RIT for the prior year was less than $2,500).  
  
As Jeff did not pay his current year RIT amount on the 7 May 2019, he is subject to UOMI on the outstanding RIT from the day after that date.

The flowchart in _QB 19/03: Provisional tax – impact on employees who receive one-off amounts of income without tax deducted_ on page 13 is incorrect.  
  
Where the flowchart asks "Is your residual income tax less than $60,000", the arrow to "No use-of-money interest if residual income tax paid by terminal tax date" should be **Yes**.

It also introduces ring fencing of rental losses and expands the care and management powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. It also contains smaller policy changes and a number of technical changes to ensure the tax rules work as intended. 2 Social Assistance Legislation (Budget 2019 Welfare Package) Amendment Act 2019 The Budget 2019 Welfare Package was designed to increase the incomes of low-income individuals and families and to support a sustained reduction in child poverty. It contains a number of improvements to the child support regime. 103 Binding rulings BR Pub 19/03: Income tax – employer issued crypto-assets provided to an employee This Ruling follows on from two Public Rulings that were issued recently: BR Pub 19/01: Income tax – salary and wages paid in crypto-assets and BR Pub 19/02: Income tax – bonuses paid in crypto-assets. It considers how FBT applies where cryptocurrency issued by an employer is provided to an employee. 105 Operational position Commissioner’s Operational Position - New section HC 27(6) – treatment of a beneficiary as a settlor in certain circumstances This operational position addresses new section HC 27(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the position the CIR will take until the section comes into effect on 1 April 2020. 113 Legal decisions – case notes High Court considers whether a geothermal turbine hall is a building for depreciation purposes under the Income Tax Act 2007 Mercury challenged the 2012 – 2015 income years to determine whether the turbine halls at its Kawerau and Nga Awa Purua geothermal powerstations (“powerstations”) were buildings and therefore subject to a depreciation rate of 0%. Mercury asserted that the turbine halls were to be treated as part of the gantry cranes which are situated within the turbine halls, and therefore were depreciable at a rate of 9.6%. The Court found in favour of the Commissioner. 114 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 1 N E W L E G I S L AT I O N This section of the TIB covers new legislation, changes to legislation including general and remedial amendments, and Orders in Council. NEW LEGISLATION GST on low-value imported goods Sections 2, 4B, 8(3)(ab), 8(4B), 8(4E), 8(4F), 8BB, 10(7C), 10(7D), 10(7E), 10B, 10C, 11(1)(jb), 11A(1D), 12(1B), 12(1C), 12B, 20(3)(dd), 20(3L), 20(4C), 20(4D), 24BAB, 24BAC, 25AA, 25(1)(aab), 25(1)(bb), 26AA, 51(1B), 60(1A), 60(1C), 60C, 60D, 60E, 60F, 60G, 77(3), 77(4), 77(5), 85C 1. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 amends the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 by applying goods and services tax (GST) to “distantly taxable” goods supplied by non- resident merchants, operators of marketplaces and redeliverers to consumers in New Zealand. 2. “Distantly taxable” goods are generally imported goods valued at or below NZ$1,000 (such as books, clothing, cosmetics, shoes, sporting equipment and small electronic items) that are imported from offshore merchants by consumers in New Zealand. The new rules will require non-resident merchants, operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers (referred to collectively as “suppliers”) to register and return GST on these supplies if they exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in total over a 12-month period. 3. The new rules apply from 1 December 2019 and non-resident suppliers will be able to apply to be registered from 1 September 2019, with the registration taking effect from 1 December 2019. The registration form and information about registering for GST will be located on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: non-resident GST). For general enquiries, or to apply for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) to exercise various discretions included in the rules, email info.lvg@ird.govt.nz. 4. The new legislation is broadly consistent with the GST rules that have applied to supplies of remote services since 1 October 2016. A special report from May 2016 contains detailed guidance on the GST on remote services rules and is available online at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-sr-gst-cross-border-supplies/overview. 5. Legislation references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) unless stated otherwise. Background 6. In principle, GST should apply to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand, as this ensures that the system is fair, efficient and simple. Under the current rules, however, GST is not typically collected on imported goods below the customs de minimis of NZ$60 of duty owing (this typically equates to a parcel with a value of NZ$400 if GST is the only applicable duty). 7. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased goods from offshore suppliers, and online shopping did not exist. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported goods under the de minimis outweighed the benefits of taxation. 8. The growth of e-commerce means the volume of imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. Many are concerned that the current tax settings place New Zealand suppliers of low-value goods at a competitive disadvantage relative to offshore suppliers. The non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods has also resulted in a growing gap in New Zealand’s GST revenue base (estimated to be around NZ$130 million in 2017–18). 9. The new rules are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and from a GST perspective create a level playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of low-value goods. The effect will be to reduce the extent to which differences in GST treatment distort consumers’ purchasing decisions. 10. On 1 July 2018 Australia introduced rules requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST on their supplies of low- value imported goods to Australian consumers. The amendments broadly follow Australia’s recently introduced rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 2 NEW LEGISLATION Key features Scope of the new GST rules 11. From 1 December 2019, GST will apply to “distantly taxable goods” – generally low-value imported goods supplied by non- resident merchants to New Zealand consumers. The new rules will require non-resident merchants, operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to register and return GST on these supplies if the supplies in aggregate exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. 12. The new rules apply GST to a wide range of “distantly taxable” goods, 1 consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system. “Distantly taxable” goods are generally defined as goods that: • individually have a value of NZ$1,000 or less; • are outside New Zealand at the time of supply; • are supplied by a non-resident; and • are delivered to New Zealand. 13. Suppliers may have the option to also charge GST on their supplies of goods valued over NZ$1,000 to consumers in New Zealand. 14. The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) will continue to collect GST, as well as other duties and cost recovery charges, on consignments with a total value in excess of NZ$1,000. Distantly taxable goods supplied to GST-registered businesses 15. Non-resident suppliers will not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices. 16. A rule requires non-resident suppliers to presume that a New Zealand customer is not a GST-registered business unless the customer has provided their GST registration number or New Zealand Business Number, or otherwise notified the supplier of their status as a GST-registered business. 17. The Commissioner can also prescribe or agree to an alternative method of determining whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. The Commissioner will consider the following matters as an indication that the goods are generally only supplied to registered businesses: • The nature of the supply (for example, a product that would only ever be purchased by a business for the purpose of carrying on its taxable activity). • The value of the supply (for example, the supply is of a value that would be expected to be received only by a GST- registered person in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity, such as a supply of a very large quantity of low- value goods). • The terms and conditions related to the provision of the goods (for example, whether the supply is of goods that may be licensed for use by a GST-registered person). 18. When a GST-registered recipient is inadvertently charged GST, they will have to seek a refund from the non-resident supplier. The non-resident supplier may make an adjustment in their GST return when it is apparent that a mistake has been made. Alternatively, if the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less, a non-resident supplier will have the option to provide a tax invoice to the purchaser to allow them to claim a deduction, rather than refunding the GST charged and making an adjustment in their GST return. Special rules for certain businesses Electronic marketplaces 19. When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of an online marketplace may be required to register and return GST on supplies of distantly taxable goods made through the marketplace, instead of the underlying supplier. 20. The rules require the operator of an “electronic marketplace”, rather than the non-resident underlying supplier, to register and return GST. An “electronic marketplace” is a marketplace operated by electronic means through which a person (the underlying supplier) makes a supply of remote services by electronic means, or a supply of distantly taxable goods, through another person (the operator of the marketplace) to a third person (the recipient). 21. Operators of “non-electronic marketplaces” may also register and return GST on behalf of their underlying suppliers, but this requires an agreement with the Commissioner. 1 Goods that are already exempt (such as supplies of fine metal) retain their current treatment under the new rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION Redeliverers 22. In some situations, a “redeliverer” may be used to deliver or assist in the delivery of goods to New Zealand, as opposed to the merchant who sold the goods or an operator of a marketplace. When this occurs, the redeliverer may be required to register and return GST on the goods. 23. A redeliverer is required to return GST when, under an arrangement with the recipient, the redeliverer does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. New Zealand agents 24. An amendment to an existing agency rule provides agents acting for non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods the ability to agree with the supplier to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply. Preventing double taxation 25. Special rules apply to prevent double taxation from arising on distantly taxable goods imported into New Zealand with a combined value in excess of NZ$1,000. Since Customs will collect GST and other duties on consignments valued above NZ$1,000, suppliers are required to take reasonable steps to ensure tax information is included on relevant import documents in order for Customs to identify these goods at the border. The following information should be included on import documents: • The name and registration number of the supplier. • Which particular goods in the consignment GST has already been collected on. • Which particular goods in the consignment GST has not been collected on. 26. Suppliers would also need to provide a receipt to consumers if they have charged the consumer GST on some or all of the goods in the transaction. 2 This receipt can then be used as evidence to Customs that GST has already been charged on the goods. The information required to be included on the receipt consists of: • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the date of the supply; • the date of issue of the receipt (if different from the date of the supply); • a description of the goods supplied; • the consideration for the supply and the amount of GST included; • which goods GST has been charged on; and • information indicating the goods for which the amount of GST charged is zero. 27. A special non-double taxation rule also allows a deduction against the supplier’s liability for New Zealand GST to the extent that the same supply is subject to consumption tax in another jurisdiction. Vouchers 28. The GST rules for vouchers have been amended to clarify that the seller of a face value voucher 3 may treat GST as applying on the redemption of the voucher, if the voucher is (or could be) redeemed for remote services or distantly taxable goods. 29. A further amendment clarifies that if GST is payable on the redemption of a voucher, the person redeeming the voucher for goods and services is liable for GST. Converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars 30. Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods will be able to choose from a range of exchange rates when converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars. 2 The requirement to provide a receipt applies even if the combined value of the goods supplied in the transaction is below NZ$1,000. One reason for this is that goods sold in a foreign currency could have a value of NZ$1,000 or less at the time of supply (so the supplier charges GST) and a value above NZ$1,000 at the time the goods are imported, due to exchange rate movements. 3 A face value voucher entitles the holder to use the voucher to purchase goods and services up to a set monetary value. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 4 NEW LEGISLATION Currency conversion to determine whether GST applies to a supply of goods 31. For the purpose of determining whether goods are individually valued at or below NZ$1,000 (and, therefore, whether GST should be returned), a supplier may use any one of the following exchange rates: • the rate published by Customs; • the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) rate, or a reference rate published by another central bank; • an exchange rate provided by a foreign exchange organisation or foreign exchange data vendor. 32. Other than the requirement that a supplier’s chosen exchange rate be used consistently (discussed later at \[230\]), there are no restrictions on the specific type of exchange rate (sell NZD, buy NZD, or midpoint rate) that suppliers may use for converting foreign currency amounts. This means that suppliers can choose a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate when converting foreign currency amounts to establish whether GST applies (as well as for the purpose of calculating the amount of GST required to be returned in New Zealand dollars). Currency conversion when determining the amount of GST payable 33. When converting to New Zealand dollars for determining the amount of GST required to be returned, the supplier can use the conversion rate at: • the time of supply; • the end of each taxable period; • the time of filing the return (or at the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date); or • another time as agreed with the Commissioner. 34. Once the supplier chooses a method other than expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at the time of supply, they may not change their method for a period of 24 months, unless they agree otherwise with the Commissioner. Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of distantly taxable goods returns the GST) 35. To ensure that supplies of distantly taxable goods acquired by GST-registered businesses for a purpose other than making taxable supplies are taxed, the reverse charge has been extended. The reverse charge requires the GST-registered business to return the GST if the percentage intended or actual taxable use of the services is less than 95 percent of the total use. Administration of the non-resident registration system Registration 36. The new rules will require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on distantly taxable goods supplied to consumers if these supplies exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. Some New Zealand- resident businesses will also be required to return GST on distantly taxable goods that they are deemed to supply. 37. Non-resident suppliers are able to use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. 38. Non-resident suppliers may apply to be registered from 1 September 2019 (an application form will be available on that date) with the registration coming into force on 1 December 2019. The registration form will be located on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: non-resident GST). The application form will ask for the applicant’s name, contact details, country of residence (including any existing tax identification numbers), a description of the business activity and website address. 39. If a supplier (whether resident or non-resident) is already registered for GST because they make taxable supplies under existing GST rules, they do not need to register separately for any distantly taxable goods they supply. Instead, these suppliers should continue to file their usual GST returns and include their supplies of distantly taxable goods. Filing GST returns 40. Applicants who indicate on the registration form that they will only return GST and not claim expenses will file a simplified “pay only” GST return. The simplified return would only include fields relevant to returning GST, such as the amount of supplies to New Zealand customers and the amount of GST required to be returned. 41. For the period from 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2020, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods that become liable to be registered between 1 December and 31 December 2019 will have a taxable period of four months. After this transitional period, these suppliers will have mandatory quarterly taxable periods beginning on 1 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 5 NEW LEGISLATION 42. A GST return must be provided setting out the tax payable for the taxable period by the 28th of the month following the end of the taxable period. 4 The end of each taxable period is the last day of the month at the end of the taxable period. The quarterly taxable periods end on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December. 43. Applicants who indicate that they intend to return GST and claim GST may be asked to provide further information about their business during the registration process to better confirm their identity. These applicants will be required to file a full GST return. 44. Both types of GST return will be able to be filed online using Inland Revenue’s myIR. For GST payments, myIR displays payment options available to registrants, and provides links and instructions on how to make payments. Information on how to file returns online and make payments will be available to non-resident suppliers when they apply to register for New Zealand GST. Methods for electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to determine GST treatment of supplies 45. As discussed above at \[19\] to \[23\], in certain circumstances the special rules applying to electronic marketplaces and redeliverers would, for GST purposes, treat these businesses as suppliers of distantly taxable goods. This means electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers will need to rely on information provided by merchants or by customers to determine the GST treatment of these supplies. 46. The new legislation includes some default rules (based on objective proxies) that electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers can use to determine how much GST they are required to return on distantly taxable goods. The new rules also provide the Commissioner with discretion to prescribe or agree to alternative methods for electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers to determine if they are treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods and the amount of GST payable. 47. This is intended to minimise compliance costs in situations where it may not be possible to precisely determine the GST treatment of a supply due to insufficient commercially available information. Consumers and underlying suppliers providing false or misleading information 48. The Commissioner will have the discretion to require a person to register and pay the GST if that person provides false or misleading information about themselves resulting in an underpayment of GST, if the GST amount involved is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. 49. Existing “knowledge offences” rules may also apply when a person (being a consumer, or an underlying supplier selling goods through a marketplace) deliberately supplies incorrect information to a supplier by misrepresenting themselves as a GST-registered business or as a resident of another country. This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to NZ$25,000 for a first-time offence, or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. Optional rules aimed at reducing costs for suppliers Claiming GST deductions for New Zealand expenses 50. An amendment to a pre-existing deduction rule will allow non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and/or remote services to claim GST deductions for New Zealand expenses. Deductions are available regardless of whether the relevant business inputs are used for (or available for use in) making supplies to consumers in New Zealand. This is only available to those suppliers that have registered under the standard registration system as a “pay and claim” registrant. Option to charge GST on high-value goods 51. Suppliers of distantly taxable goods may elect to charge GST on goods valued above NZ$1,000 (“high-value goods”) if those goods are supplied to consumers in New Zealand. This option is available if at least 75 percent of the total value of goods that they supply to customers in New Zealand in the 12-month period starting on the date the election is intended to be effective for are individually valued at NZ$1,000 or less. 52. Alternatively, a supplier will be able to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods to consumers if the Commissioner considers that allowing the supplier to do so will not result in a risk to the integrity of the tax system. Option to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses 53. If certain conditions are met, a non-resident supplier is able to choose to charge GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a GST-registered business and proactively issue the recipient with a tax invoice. This applies when: • the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less; and 4 The exceptions to this being when the month following the end of the taxable period is December (in which case the filing and payment due date is 15 January) or April (filing and payment due date of 7 May). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 6 NEW LEGISLATION • the supplier reasonably expects that in the 12 months after the supply is made, more than 50 percent of their supplies to customers in New Zealand will be to persons that are not registered for GST. 54. If a non-resident supplier opts to charge GST on a supply to a GST-registered business they are able to issue a single document that qualifies both as a full tax invoice and as a receipt that the recipient may provide to Customs to prevent any double taxation. Transitional rule for fixed-term contracts entered into before 1 December 55. A transitional provision is provided in the new rules for fixed-term contracts entered into before 1 December 2019 and when the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement. 56. The transitional provision allows suppliers to treat periodic payments under the contract as not being successive supplies, and therefore, payments made after 1 December 2019 are not subject to GST. This transitional rule only applies for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into, whichever is earlier. Application date 57. The new GST rules come into force on 1 December 2019. Detailed analysis Key terms 58. There are a number of terms that have a specific meaning in respect of these new rules. 59. Supplier – The term “supplier” is used to refer to the person who is the supplier of the goods for GST purposes (that is, required to return and pay GST on the supply to Inland Revenue). The supplier will be the merchant unless another person (such as an electronic marketplace operator, redeliverer or agent) is treated as the supplier of the goods under a specific provision. 60. Merchant – The term “merchant” is used to refer to the person who actually supplies the goods. A merchant may sell independently – for example, via their own website or by mail order – or they may sell their goods on a marketplace. 61. Marketplace – Refers to a third-party medium that allows consumers and merchants to interact to facilitate the sale and purchase of goods or services. The definitions of “marketplace” and “electronic marketplace” are discussed at \[134\]. 62. Redeliverer – Refers to a person who delivers goods (or arranges or assists delivery) to New Zealand under an arrangement with the recipient of the goods, and does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; or • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. 63. Consignment – The term “consignment” generally means a single package or parcel of imported goods. However, in some instances, Customs will treat two or more packages arriving on the same day, from the same consignor (supplier) and addressed to the same consignee (importer or recipient) as one consignment. 64. De minimis – Refers to the threshold below which Customs will not collect GST and other duty on a consignment of imported goods. From 1 December 2019, imported consignments valued at NZ$1,000 or less will not have GST and other duty collected at the border (unless a specific exception to the de minimis applies, such as for alcohol and tobacco). 65. Customs value – Refers to the value of imported goods as determined under Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018. This is the valuation that Customs uses when determining whether a consignment of imported goods is above the de minimis, and therefore whether Customs collects duty on the goods. 66. Estimated customs value – Refers to the value of an item of goods as determined in accordance with new section 10B of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, discussed later at \[83\]. This valuation (which approximates the customs value of an individual item of goods) is used for the purposes of determining whether a given item of goods is valued at NZ$1,000 or less, and therefore whether GST is required to be charged on the supply of the item. 67. Value of supply – Refers to the (GST-exclusive) value of a supply of goods and services. This is the valuation used for the purpose of calculating the amount of GST, and is determined by reference to the amount of consideration for the supply of goods and services (generally the total price or amount paid by the recipient of the supply of goods and services). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 7 NEW LEGISLATION Scope of the new GST rules (Sections 2, 4B, 8(3)(ab), 10(7E), 10B, 51(1B) and 77(5)) Place of supply rules 68. The GST Act imposes GST on goods and services supplied in New Zealand. The Act adopts a broad set of rules to determine whether a good or service is considered to be supplied in New Zealand in the first instance. The place of supply rules are accompanied by a range of exclusions that determine whether the supply is zero-rated or exempt rather than taxed at the normal 15% rate. 69. If a non-resident person supplies goods, the starting point is that the supply will be treated as having been made outside New Zealand, and therefore not subject to GST. However, under section 8(3)(a), goods are treated as having been supplied in New Zealand if the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply. Section 8(4) provides that if a supply is made to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on its taxable activity, the goods are considered to be supplied outside New Zealand, and therefore are not subject to GST, unless the parties agree that GST will apply. Distantly taxable goods supplied by non-residents 70. New section 8(3)(ab) has been inserted into the place of supply rules, which treats supplies of “distantly taxable goods” (as defined) supplied by a non-resident to a person providing a delivery address in New Zealand as a supply made in New Zealand, and therefore subject to GST. 71. Like section 8(4), new section 8(4E) provides that if distantly taxable goods are supplied to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on its taxable activity, the goods are treated as having been supplied outside New Zealand. The goods are therefore not subject to GST, unless the non-resident supplier chooses to treat the goods as being supplied in New Zealand. More information on this option is provided later at \[310\] to \[317\]. Distantly taxable goods supplied by New Zealand residents 72. Goods treated as having been supplied by a New Zealand-resident person, such as an electronic marketplace operator, redeliverer or agent domiciled in New Zealand, would be treated as supplied in New Zealand by existing section 8(2). This treatment would apply even if the goods are supplied to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on its taxable activity. 73. A comprehensive explanation of the special rules applying to electronic marketplaces, redeliverers and New Zealand- resident agents is provided later, with each section beginning at \[133\], \[167\] and \[182\], respectively. Exempt and zero-rated supplies 74. Supplies of goods that are already exempt from GST (such as supplies of fine metal), or zero-rated under a specific rule, would retain that treatment under the new rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 8 NEW LEGISLATION Summary of the new place of supply rules for non-resident suppliers of goods IN CONFIDENCE Are the goods distantly taxable goods?

Under the GST Act, “goods” are defined as all kinds of real or personal property; but do not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system. 76. New section 4B sets out that “distantly taxable goods” would generally be defined as goods that: • are supplied by a non-resident; • are outside New Zealand at the time of supply; • are delivered to a place in New Zealand by the supplier, or the supplier arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • are low-value goods (that is, individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less). 77. As discussed later, the definition of distantly taxable goods also includes goods treated by section 60C, 60D or 60E as being supplied by a marketplace operator or redeliverer, regardless of the residency of the marketplace operator or redeliverer. 78. Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and tobacco products that are exempted from regulations made under section 406(1) of the Customs and Excise Act 2018 are not distantly taxable goods. At present, Customs collects GST and other duty including excise-equivalent taxes on these goods. This will not change. Goods outside New Zealand at the time of supply 79. A non-resident merchant supplying low-value goods that are delivered to an address in New Zealand will be considered to have made a supply of distantly taxable goods if the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply. 80. The time of supply for distantly taxable goods will be determined by the general rule in section 9(1), which sets out that the time of supply is the earlier of any payment being received by the supplier or an invoice being issued by the supplier. In the case of goods purchased online by consumers, this will generally be the same as the time the consumer purchases the goods. 81. If either a redeliverer or an operator of a marketplace is treated by section 60C, 60D or 60E as the supplier of the goods, the location of the goods at the time of supply will not be relevant for determining if the goods are distantly taxable goods. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 9 NEW LEGISLATION Any goods that are treated by one of those sections as having been supplied by a marketplace operator or a redeliverer will be distantly taxable goods, regardless of where the goods are located at the time of supply. 5 Goods individually having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less 82. In order for an “item of goods” to be distantly taxable, it must have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. Suppliers will be required to determine a reasonable estimate of the item’s customs value using information available to them at the time of supply (new section 10B(3)). 83. For the sole purpose of determining whether an item is an item of distantly taxable goods (and, therefore, whether GST is charged on the supply of the item), section 10B(2) provides that the value of an item will be the amount of consideration 6 , less any amounts included in the consideration for: • GST charged on the supply of the item under section 8; • any duty payable by the supplier under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 7 ; and • the cost of transport and insurance of the item between leaving its country of export and being delivered in New Zealand. Any amounts charged for transport and insurance of the item which relate to domestic transport and insurance within the country of export should not be subtracted from the amount of consideration. Suppliers may make a reasonable estimate of the amount relating to transport and insurance within the country of export for this purpose. 84. This is broadly consistent with the valuation that Customs will use (the “customs value”) when determining if a consignment of imported goods is above or below the NZ$1,000 de minimis. However, as explained below at \[93\] to \[95\], the approximation of the customs value outlined above is different to the valuation that is used for calculating the amount of GST required to be returned on distantly taxable goods. 85. Note that “an item of goods” may be a single good or multiple goods, depending on how the “item” is presented for sale. For example, an item of goods could be one pair of socks or a pack of ten pairs of socks. Example 1 – high value item shipped in two different boxes for assembly by the recipient Kathryn, a consumer in New Zealand, buys a bicycle from a merchant in China for NZ$1,200 (excluding GST and delivery). For ease of packaging and handling and to minimise the risk of damage in transit, the bicycle parts are shipped to Kathryn in two separate boxes to be assembled when Kathryn receives the packages. It is clear from the advertisement on the Chinese merchant’s website that the nature of what is being supplied is a single item of goods (being an unassembled bicycle) and not multiple items. On this basis, the Chinese merchant does not charge Kathryn GST on the supply of the bicycle, as the bicycle is not considered distantly taxable (the estimated customs value of the bicycle is NZ$1,200, exceeding the de minimis of NZ$1,000.) The two boxes arrive in New Zealand on the same flight and are treated by Customs as a single consignment. Assuming that the customs value of the consignment is above NZ$1,000 at the time of importation, Customs will charge Kathryn GST, along with the Import Entry Transaction Fee and Biosecurity System Entry Levy and any other duties. Example 2 – learn to play electric guitar starter pack Jared decides that he wants to learn to play guitar and orders a ‘learn to play electric guitar starter pack’ from an online music retailer based in Japan for NZ$1,500 (excluding GST and delivery). The starter pack has everything that Jared needs to get started, including a lead, strap, tuner, guitar bag, amplifier, picks, whammy bar and an instructional DVD. It is clear from the advertisement on the Japanese merchant’s website that what is being offered for sale is a package for a single price of NZ$1,500. Although Jared provides a delivery address in New Zealand at the online checkout, he is not charged GST because the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply and the goods are not distantly taxable goods (as the estimated customs value of the item, being the starter pack, is NZ$1,500). 5 While not necessarily likely, it is possible that the time of supply for imported goods could be after the goods are already in New Zealand. As discussed later, goods that are not imported but are actually sourced from within New Zealand are distantly taxable goods if they are supplied through a marketplace by a non-resident merchant and the marketplace operator is treated by section 60C or 60D as the supplier. 6 “Consideration” is a term commonly used in contract law to refer to what a party to a contract agrees to provide under the contract. In the case of a supply of goods and services by a business to a consumer, the consideration for the supply will typically be a sum of money that the consumer pays to the supplier in order to receive the goods and services. 7 A merchant may include an amount in the price of an item to cover any duty payable under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 if it is selling goods on a delivered-duty-paid basis (that is, will pay the customs duties to Customs on behalf of the recipient). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 10 NEW LEGISLATION 86. Under the rules for electronic marketplaces and “approved” marketplaces, some distantly taxable goods may not actually be imported into New Zealand by the recipient, but may instead be sourced from within New Zealand. 8 This would occur when a non-resident uses an electronic marketplace to sell low-value goods that are already in New Zealand to a customer providing a New Zealand delivery address. In this situation, the value of an item of goods would be the amount of consideration the item is sold for, less any amounts included in the consideration for: • GST charged on the supply of the item under section 8; and • the cost of transport and insurance of the item. 9 Currency conversion to determine the estimated customs value 87. To determine whether an item has an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less, currency conversion to New Zealand dollars may be required if the item is sold in a currency other than New Zealand dollars. 10 Currency conversion for this purpose will only be necessary if: • it is unclear whether an item of goods that is sold in another currency has an estimated customs value exceeding NZ$1,000; and • the supplier has not elected to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods (discussed later at \[292\]). 88. Under new section 77(5), a supplier may convert foreign currency amounts into New Zealand dollars using either: • the spot exchange rate for the foreign currency applying at the time of supply; or • a currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 89. The currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner is set out later at \[226\] to \[231\]. Which goods would be included in a supply of distantly taxable goods? 90. In some cases, a single transaction will involve one or more items that each have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less and, at the same time, one or more other items that each have an estimated customs value exceeding NZ$1,000. In this situation, section 4B(2) splits the transaction into two separate supplies: • a supply of distantly taxable goods, consisting of all the goods that are low-value goods (that is, individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less); and • a second supply consisting of the remaining goods supplied in the transaction. 91. The supplier can however elect to treat its supplies of high-value goods as distantly taxable, in which case there will generally be a single supply of distantly taxable goods. In this situation, section 4B(2) will only split the supply into two separate supplies if some of the goods are not distantly taxable goods because they are alcoholic beverages, tobacco or tobacco products (or, if a non-resident merchant is the supplier for GST purposes, because some of the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply). 92. Further explanation of the special rules allowing suppliers to treat their supplies of high-value goods to consumers as distantly taxable goods is provided later at \[292\] to \[309\]. Example 3 – separate supplies of distantly taxable and non-distantly taxable goods bought in the same transaction Brenda decides to treat herself by buying a new television and home entertainment system. She orders a 50” flat screen television for NZ$800 (excluding GST and delivery), as well as a stereo/home entertainment system for NZ$1,100 from the catalogue of an Australian-based mail order company. The Australian merchant charges Brenda GST on the television but not on the stereo/home entertainment system. This is because the estimated customs value of the television is less than NZ$1,000 (NZ$800) – meaning that the supply of the television is a taxable supply of distantly taxable goods. However, the estimated customs value of the stereo/home entertainment system is above NZ$1,000 (NZ$1,100) and, therefore, the stereo/home entertainment system is not supplied as a taxable supply because the item is outside New Zealand at the time of supply and is not an item of distantly taxable goods. 8 This is because whether the marketplace operator is treated as the supplier is based solely on the residency status of the merchant. This is to avoid further compliance costs for marketplace operators in determining whether the goods are already in New Zealand or will be shipped from outside New Zealand. 9 There will be no customs duty payable as the goods are sourced from within New Zealand, rather than being imported. 10 As the estimated customs value is worked out by using a reasonable estimate at the time of supply, the date or time of supply will be the date or time of the currency conversion (if required). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 11 NEW LEGISLATION Calculating GST on distantly taxable goods 93. To calculate the amount of GST on distantly taxable goods, suppliers need to determine the value of the supply. It should be noted that the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods is not the same as the estimated customs value of distantly taxable goods (as the estimated customs value is only used for the purpose of determining whether a given item is distantly taxable). 94. Instead, the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods is determined by the amount of consideration for the supply (section 10(2)) 11 , which – unlike the estimated customs value – will typically include amounts paid by the recipient for related services such as freight and insurance. 95. The amount of GST required to be returned on a supply of distantly taxable goods is 15% of the value of the supply. For goods that are priced inclusive of GST, the amount of GST that should be returned will be equal to the amount of consideration for the supply multiplied by 3 ÷ 23. An example of how this applies is provided in Example 4 below. Treatment of amounts paid by the recipient for delivery and other related services 96. Under ordinary GST principles, the amount of consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods will typically include amounts paid by the recipient for services relating to the goods, such as delivery and insurance. This is because these services are generally either: • ancillary or integral to the supply of the goods (such as in the case of freight and insurance); or • merely incidental to the goods, or are a means of better enjoying the goods. 97. Where this is the case, the services will typically form part of the supply of distantly taxable goods, even if a separate fee is charged for the services. This applies even if the services would be zero-rated if they were supplied separately – for example, international transportation of goods (including ancillary activities such as handling) and insurance associated with the international transportation are zero-rated. 12 98. However, in limited situations, it is possible that there may be a separate zero-rated supply if the recipient contracts separately for the supply of these services. 99. To avoid doubt and ensure consistent treatment, new section 10(7E) provides that the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods includes the amount of consideration for a supply of related services to the recipient of the distantly taxable goods if: • the consideration for the related services is determined by reference to the items included in the supply of distantly taxable goods; 13 • the supply of related services is made, arranged or facilitated by the supplier of the distantly taxable goods (or by the underlying supplier, if the supplier for GST purposes is a marketplace operator); • the supply of related services is directly in connection with the distantly taxable goods or is of insurance of the goods; 14 • the supply of related services would be zero-rated in the absence of this rule; and • the supply of related services and the supply of distantly taxable goods do not form a single supply. 100. This means that amounts paid by the recipient for a separate zero-rated supply (such as international transportation that is contractually supplied to the recipient by a third party) may still be included as part of the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods that is subject to GST at the rate of 15%. 11 Section 10(2)(a) provides that, to the extent that the consideration for a supply of goods and services is in money, the value of the supply with the addition of GST is equal to the amount of consideration in money. To the extent that the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods is not in money, section 10(2)(b) provides that the value of the supply with the addition of GST is equal to the open market value of the non-monetary consideration. 12 For more information on when multiple goods and services supplied in a single transaction will form a single supply or multiple supplies, see the Interpretation Statement, IS 18/04 Goods and Services Tax – Single supply or multiple supplies, available at www.ird.govt.nz/resources/2/2/229901d1-77a8-410e-a005-933a9904455e/is1804.pdf. 13 For example, this means that a subscription where a consumer is paying for the transport of many supplies of goods over a period of time is excluded from the scope of the rule. 14 The “directly in connection with” wording is intended to apply broadly to services that have a direct physical intervention with the goods, including (but not limited to) transportation and handling of the goods. For example, services such as gift-wrapping would meet the “directly in connection with” test. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 12 NEW LEGISLATION Example 4 – calculating amount of output tax based on GST-inclusive price Wendy purchases a fascinator from Wild Hats, an e-commerce business based in Australia that ships novelty party hats from its warehouse in Melbourne. Wild Hats is registered for GST in New Zealand. The price of the fascinator is NZ$23 including GST if any. To get the hat to her address in New Zealand, Wendy also pays a shipping fee of NZ$11.50 (also inclusive of GST). Therefore, the total amount paid by Wendy including GST is NZ$34.50. The amount of GST returned on the supply by Wild Hats is NZ$4.50 (NZ$34.50 × 3/23 = NZ$4.50). This includes the NZ$1.50 of GST included in the shipping fee. Example 5 – calculating amount of output tax based on GST-exclusive price Chris buys a new suit from a non-resident merchant based in Hong Kong for NZ$900 plus GST if any. The merchant charges Chris an additional NZ$50 plus GST if any for delivery to New Zealand. The merchant charges Chris NZ$142.50 of GST (NZ$950 × 15% = NZ$142.50). The full amount paid by Chris is therefore NZ$1,092.50 (NZ$950 + NZ$142.50 in GST). Example 6 – application of section 10(7E) to separate zero-rated supply of international transport Jan, a consumer in New Zealand, purchases a fishing rod from an American merchant on the A Co. marketplace for NZ$20 (excluding GST). The merchant does not provide shipping to addresses outside the United States. However, to make goods on its marketplace available to a global market, A Co. allows customers outside the United States to purchase shipping to the destination country from a freight forwarder. Using the A Co. marketplace, Jan purchases shipping of the fishing rod to her home in New Zealand for NZ$10 excluding GST. Under the rules applying to electronic marketplaces, A Co. is treated as making the supply of the fishing rod to Jan, meaning that A Co. is responsible for GST on the supply of the fishing rod. However, neither A Co. nor the American merchant supply the shipping to Jan, as the contract for the supply is between the freight forwarder and Jan. This means that the supply of shipping is separate to the supply of the fishing rod. Consequently, the supply of shipping is zero-rated under the rules applying to international transportation. However, section 10(7E) treats the shipping fee as part of the consideration for a taxable supply of distantly taxable goods because: • the shipping fee is determined by reference to the supply of the fishing rod to Jan; • the shipping was purchased by Jan through the A Co. marketplace, which is sufficient to meet the test that either A Co. or the American merchant facilitated the supply of the shipping; • the shipping is supplied directly in connection with distantly taxable goods, as it involves the physical handling and transport of the fishing rod; • in the absence of section 10(7E), the shipping would be zero-rated as a supply of international transportation services; and • the supply of shipping and the supply of distantly taxable goods do not form a single supply (as mentioned above, the supply of shipping is a separate supply to the supply of the fishing rod). This means that A Co. is required to return GST of NZ$4.50, made up of NZ$3 in GST on the fishing rod (NZ$20 × 15% = NZ$3) and NZ$1.50 in GST on the shipping (NZ$10 × 15% = NZ$1.50). Apportionment of GST on freight and insurance charges 101. In some situations, a consumer may purchase goods that are distantly taxable goods as well as goods that are not distantly taxable goods in a single transaction. In this situation, the consumer may be charged a single delivery fee for the transportation of all the goods. Where this is the case, apportionment of GST on the amount paid for transportation will usually be required. 102. The supplier may use any fair and reasonable method of apportioning GST on delivery charges. For example, apportionment based on the weight of the distantly taxable goods relative to the weight of other goods would be a fair and reasonable apportionment method, as would apportionment based on the value of the goods. If feasible, it would be in the supplier’s interest to use the same method for apportioning GST on delivery charges at the point of sale as that used to apportion delivery charges for customs purposes. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 13 NEW LEGISLATION 103. However, apportionment of GST on a single delivery charge relating to both distantly taxable goods and other goods will not be required if: • the delivery services are a separate zero-rated supply; and • section 10(7E) does not apply to treat the amount of consideration relating to delivery services as part of the consideration for the supply of distantly taxable goods (so GST will not apply at all to the amount paid for delivery). Example 7 – apportionment of delivery fee relating to distantly taxable and non-distantly taxable goods based on value Scott purchases a gold watch for NZ$1,100 along with two shirts at NZ$40 each (all priced excluding GST) from a merchant in Germany for delivery to his address in New Zealand. The shirts are both distantly taxable goods – each of these items has an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less – so the German merchant (who is registered for GST in New Zealand) is required to return GST on each of these items. However, the watch is not distantly taxable, as it has an estimated customs value above NZ$1,000 (NZ$1,100), so the German merchant is not required to return GST on the watch. The merchant charges Scott an NZ$30 fee for the transportation of all the goods purchased and ships the goods to Scott in a single package. The merchant apportions the GST on the transportation fee based on the value of the respective items in the package. The apportionment ratio used by the merchant is 6.78% ((40 + 40) ÷ (40 + 40 + 1,100) = 0.06779). The merchant charges Scott NZ$12.31 in GST, comprising NZ$12 in GST on the distantly taxable goods ((NZ$40 + NZ$40) × 15% = NZ$12) and NZ$0.31 in GST on the transportation fee (NZ$30 × 6.78% × 15% = NZ$0.31). Example 8 – apportionment of delivery fee relating to distantly taxable and non-distantly taxable goods based on weight Aroha purchases a number of items (all priced excluding GST) from a merchant in the United States (US) for delivery to her address in New Zealand: • two shirts at NZ$50 each; • a ball dress at NZ$300; and • a wedding dress at NZ$1,200. The shirts and ball dress are all distantly taxable goods, so the US merchant (who is registered for GST in New Zealand) is required to return GST on each of these items. However, the wedding dress is not, so the US merchant is not required to return GST on the wedding dress. The US merchant charges Aroha an NZ$80 fee for the transportation of all the goods purchased and ships the goods to Aroha in a single package. The US merchant apportions the GST on the transportation fee based on the weight of the respective items in the package. The combined weight of the distantly taxable goods is 2kg, and the wedding dress also weighs 2kg (half the weight of the package). The US merchant charges Aroha NZ$66 of GST, comprising NZ$60 in GST on the distantly taxable goods ((NZ$50 + NZ$50 + NZ$300) × 15% = NZ$60) and NZ$6 in GST on the transportation fee (NZ$80 ÷ 2 × 15% = NZ$6). Special valuation rule for supplies treated as made by redeliverers 104. New section 10(7C) contains a special rule for determining the amount of output tax (GST payable) on a supply of distantly taxable goods treated by section 60E as being made by a redeliverer. The special rule is explained later at \[177\]. Discounts, returns and refunds 105. Section 25(1) provides a list of situations where a GST-registered supplier may return too much or too little GST as a result of either a mistake, subsequent alteration to, or cancellation of the supply. This list includes the following events: • The supply of goods and services has been cancelled. • The nature of the supply of goods and services had been fundamentally varied or altered. • The previously agreed consideration for the supply of goods and services has been altered, for instance through the offer of a discount. • The goods and services or part of the goods and services have been returned to the supplier. 106. In the situation where a merchant has returned too much or too little GST as the result of an event referred to in section 25(1) (such as the events listed above), section 25(2) provides that the merchant may make an adjustment in its GST return when it is apparent that too much or too little output tax has been returned. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 14 NEW LEGISLATION Example 9 – goods returned to merchant Aroha from the previous example decides that the ball dress she bought is too small. The US merchant agrees to provide Aroha with a full refund of the price of the dress if Aroha returns it. The US merchant receives the returned dress and refunds the GST-inclusive amount paid for the dress of NZ$345 (NZ$300 + NZ$45 in GST). By the time that the US merchant received the returned dress, they had already filed their GST return for the taxable period in which the supply to Aroha was made. The US merchant is entitled to make a reduction of NZ$45 in their output tax in the GST return for the current taxable period. 107. A special valuation rule applies in the specific situation where an operator of a marketplace (who is treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods or remote services by section 60C or 60D) provides a discount to the recipient of the supply. This rule is explained later at \[161\]. GST registration threshold 108. As a result of the changes to the place of supply rules, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods will be required to register for GST if the total value of supplies in New Zealand exceeds NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. This is equivalent to the existing registration threshold for resident suppliers, as well as non-resident suppliers of remote services. 109. As these suppliers will be subject to the rules contained in section 51, non-resident suppliers will be required to register if: • the total value of their supplies in New Zealand in the past 12 months exceeded NZ$60,000 (unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that their supplies in the next 12 months will not exceed this threshold); or • the total value of their supplies in New Zealand in the next 12 months is expected to exceed NZ$60,000. 110. The total value of supplies in New Zealand by a non-resident includes the following: • the total value of supplies of distantly taxable goods 15 to consumers, including amounts charged for services such as delivery and insurance; • the total value of supplies to consumers of goods that are located in New Zealand at the time of supply (not including any distantly taxable goods); • the total value of supplies to consumers of services physically performed in New Zealand; and • the total value of remote services supplied to consumers (not including any services physically performed in New Zealand). 111. As goods and services supplied by a non-resident to a New Zealand GST-registered business are generally treated as not being supplied in New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST), these supplies will not count towards the registration threshold. 112. If a non-resident makes supplies of distantly taxable goods to consumers and their total supplies in New Zealand fall below the NZ$60,000 threshold, they will be able to voluntarily register for GST. Example 10 – non-resident supplier below the registration threshold Jersey Co., a non-resident company based in the United States, sells clothing to customers across the world. Jersey Co. also makes and supplies businesses with staff uniforms. Each year, Jersey Co. makes supplies valued at NZ$50,000 to New Zealand customers who are not GST-registered. It makes supplies valued at NZ$20,000 to New Zealand GST-registered customers. Jersey Co. is not required to register and return GST on any of its supplies in New Zealand, as it has not exceeded the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. 113. Section 51(1B) allows non-resident suppliers to use a “fair and reasonable” method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. This includes converting amounts to New Zealand currency as at the time of supply, using the current exchange rate at the time of testing the threshold, or using an average exchange rate over the period. Any of these methods would be regarded as fair and reasonable as long as they were used on a consistent basis. 15 “Distantly taxable goods” in this specific context being just those items that individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 15 NEW LEGISLATION Example 11 – non-resident supplier above registration threshold Tool Warehouse, a non-resident company, supplies power tools to New Zealand businesses and individual consumers. Over the past two years, Tool Warehouse has supplied NZ$10,000 of power tools that each individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less, each month, to New Zealand individual consumers and this is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Tool Warehouse will be expected to register for New Zealand GST from 1 December 2019 as it is reasonably expected that their supplies in New Zealand to individual consumers will exceed NZ$60,000 in the 12 months following 1 December 2019 (the date the new rules apply from). Effect of the new legislation on suppliers’ residency and income tax obligations 114. Although these amendments treat certain goods supplied by non-residents as “supplied in New Zealand”, there is no intention that this will affect whether a supplier is a resident of New Zealand for GST or income tax purposes, or whether a supplier has a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. 115. The GST Act largely adopts the Income Tax Act 2007’s definition of “resident”. Solely for GST purposes, a person is also considered to be a resident of New Zealand to the extent that the person carries on a taxable activity or other activity in New Zealand, and has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. The amendments do not affect the extent to which a person carries on an activity in New Zealand, despite making certain supplies taxable for GST purposes. 116. Double tax agreements (DTAs) primarily deal with whether a resident of one country is subject to income tax on income derived in another country. The concept of “permanent establishment” is used in DTAs between New Zealand and other countries. Under DTAs, a company that does not have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand will have no New Zealand income tax. The fact that a supplier is registered for New Zealand GST under the new rules should not affect whether or not they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand for DTA purposes, or the application of the definition of resident used for GST purposes. Distantly taxable goods supplied to GST-registered businesses (Sections 8(4E), 8BB, 20(4C), (4D), 24 and 25(1)(aab) to (abb)) 117. New section 8(4E) applies to supplies of distantly taxable goods by non-residents to GST-registered businesses and treats these as being made outside New Zealand (not subject to GST). However, as discussed later at \[310\] to \[317\], a limited exception will in certain circumstances allow a non-resident supplier to treat these supplies as being made in New Zealand (subject to GST). Example 12 – business-to-business exclusion Consider Tool Warehouse in the previous example. If the New Zealand businesses that Tool Warehouse sells power tools to are not registered for GST, the power tools that each individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less will be subject to GST under section 8(3)(ab), as these power tools are distantly taxable goods that are supplied to a person providing a delivery address in New Zealand who is not a GST-registered business. If the New Zealand business customers are registered for GST, then under section 8(4E) the power tools will be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand. 118. Section 8BB(1) requires non-resident suppliers to treat distantly taxable goods as being supplied to a consumer who is not GST-registered, unless the recipient notifies the supplier that they are GST-registered or provides their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number. GST-registered recipients of distantly taxable goods should not identify themselves as a GST-registered business, or provide their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number, if they intend to use the goods wholly for non-taxable purposes. 119. It may not be practical for all suppliers to ask for evidence that a customer is GST-registered. Therefore, to provide flexibility, section 8BB(3) allows the Commissioner to prescribe or agree an alternative method to determine whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. Section 8BB(4) outlines the factors that the Commissioner will consider when exercising the discretion: • The nature of the supply (for example, a product that would only ever be purchased by a business for the purpose of carrying on its taxable activity). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 16 NEW LEGISLATION • The value of the supply (for example, the supply is of a value that would be expected to be received only by a GST- registered person in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity, such as a supply of a very large quantity of low- value goods). • The terms and conditions related to the provision of the goods (for example, whether the supply is of goods and services that may be leased or licensed for use by a GST-registered person). 120. Suppliers who have already agreed an alternative method with the Commissioner for supplies of remote services may want to use the same method to determine whether supplies of distantly taxable goods are to GST-registered businesses. In this situation, the supplier should apply to the Commissioner to agree an alternative method for their supplies of distantly taxable goods. This could be as simple as requesting the Commissioner’s approval for them to use their existing method for distantly taxable goods. Example 13 – alternative method of determining supplies are to a GST-registered business Discount Crazy is a non-resident that supplies a wide range of products to New Zealand businesses and individual consumers. Factors such as the quantity or volume of goods purchased in a single transaction and the overall value of the transaction mean that in some cases it is quite clear that low-value items are being purchased in bulk by a business and not an individual consumer. Businesses that purchase goods in bulk are likely to be GST-registered businesses. Discount Crazy has a large number of customers and it is impractical to ask for evidence to identify their customers as GST-registered. Discount Crazy is able to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to use an alternative method for identifying whether their customers are GST-registered persons. Evidence such as the nature of the supplies, licensing terms and other conditions could be used, as well as a sample of their customer base that supports the likelihood that future customers will be GST-registered. GST inadvertently charged to a GST-registered recipient 121. There may be instances when a non-resident supplier inadvertently treats a GST-registered business as an individual consumer and therefore charges the business GST. In this situation, the GST-registered recipient should seek a refund from the non-resident supplier and not claim an input tax deduction for the inadvertently charged GST (see the deduction prohibition in section 20(4C)). There is, however, an exception to the deduction prohibition for supplies valued at NZ$1,000 or less 16 if the supplier has provided the recipient with a full tax invoice (discussed below). 122. Amendments to section 25(1) will allow a supplier to make adjustments to its output tax in the return in which it is apparent that the mistake has been made. This applies if the supply is treated as made in New Zealand (subject to GST) when in fact it should not have been treated as a taxable supply (see section 25(1)(aab)). 123. Note that an adjustment will be required only if the non-resident supplier has already filed a return and has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax as a result of the mistake (see existing section 25(1)(e)). If the mistake becomes apparent before the relevant return has been filed, the mistake can be rectified before the return is filed. 124. Since non-resident suppliers are not required to provide a tax invoice under the amendment to section 24(5), they do not have to issue a credit note under section 25(4). However, if a non-resident supplier opts to charge GST on business-to- business supplies and provide a tax invoice under the special rule in new section 8(4F) (discussed later at \[310\] to \[317\]), the supplier will be required to issue a credit note if the amount of consideration for the supply is subsequently reduced or if the supply is cancelled. Supplies of NZ$1,000 or less 125. An exception to the above rules applies when the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less at the time of supply. In this situation, when the supplier inadvertently charges a GST-registered business GST, the supplier can choose to provide a tax invoice to the GST-registered business. This option is intended to be a compliance cost-saving measure for non-resident suppliers in relation to low-value supplies, when the compliance cost of issuing a refund may exceed the cost of issuing a tax invoice. Note that if the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice, it must be a full tax invoice, even if the payment for the supply (including GST) is less than NZ$50 (see the amendments to section 24(4)). 126. The tax invoice must be a full invoice as set out in section 24(3), and therefore must contain the following particulars: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient; 16 Meaning that the value of the overall supply is NZ$1,000 or less (as opposed to all of the items in the supply each having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 17 NEW LEGISLATION • the date upon which the tax invoice is issued; • a description of the goods and services supplied; • the quantity of the goods and services supplied; • and either: –the total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or –where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in relation to the tax. 127. The exception to the deduction prohibition in section 20(4C) (discussed above) allows the GST-registered business purchasing the goods to claim an input tax deduction under the normal deduction provisions to the extent to which the goods are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. 128. If the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice: • the supplier is not required to make an adjustment to correct the amount of GST shown on the invoice (see section 25(1)(aab)(ii)); and • the supplier and recipient are treated as having agreed that the supply is made in New Zealand (and therefore subject to GST) under section 8(4). 17 129. These provisions turn a supply that should not have been taxed into a supply that is taxed at the standard rate of 15%. In this situation, the correct amount of GST is returned by the supplier and therefore an adjustment to the supplier’s GST return, under section 25, is not required. 17 Note that the reference in section 24(5D) to the supplier and recipient being treated as agreeing that section 8(4) will not apply to the supply is incorrect (as section 8(4) would not apply in the first place if the supply is of distantly taxable goods). Officials will seek to correct this error in a future omnibus tax bill. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 18 NEW LEGISLATION 130.

The GST-registered recipient is able to claim an input tax deduction The non-resident supplier w ill n ot m ake an adjustment The supplier must make an adjustment of tax payable in the period when the incorrect treatment becomes apparent No AB Special rules for certain businesses (Sections 2, 10(7C), 10(7D), 11(1)(jb), 11A(1D), 26AA, 60(1A), 60(1C), 60C, 60D and 60E) 131. GST is normally payable by the merchant who sells the goods or services. However, the GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods may be payable by either an operator of a marketplace, the merchant who sold the goods, a “redeliverer” who brings the goods to New Zealand, or a New Zealand resident acting on behalf of a non-resident principal. 132. To determine who is liable to return the GST, the new legislation establishes the following hierarchy: • if an operator of a marketplace is liable to return the GST on a supply, the merchant will not be responsible for the G ST; 18 • if an operator of a marketplace or the merchant is liable to return the GST on a supply, a redeliverer will not be responsible for the GST; and • if a New Zealand-resident agent makes supplies of distantly taxable goods on behalf of a non-resident principal, the agent will be responsible for the GST instead of the principal if the agent and principal have an agreement to this effect. 18 As discussed later, a limited exception to this may apply in the situation where an operator of an electronic marketplace is provided with incorrect or misleading information by the merchant, which leads the marketplace operator to conclude that it is not responsible for GST on the supply (or otherwise results in the marketplace operator underpaying GST to Inland Revenue). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 19 NEW LEGISLATION Marketplaces 133. A marketplace is a medium that allows consumers and merchants to interact to facilitate the sale and purchase of goods or services. When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of an electronic marketplace instead of the merchant (referred to as the “underlying supplier”) may be required to register and return GST on supplies made through the marketplace. Under the new rules, electronic marketplaces are required to register and return GST, and non-electronic marketplaces can register subject to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s approval. 134. The definition of “marketplace” in section 2 means an electronic marketplace or a marketplace approved under section 60D as a supplier of remote services or distantly taxable goods. An electronic marketplace is further defined under section 2 as requiring the following: • The marketplace enables underlying suppliers to supply goods or remote services through the marketplace to customers. • The marketplace is operated by electronic means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace. • Supplies of remote services made through the marketplace must be made by electronic means, but this requirement does not apply to supplies of tangible goods made through the marketplace. 135. Providers that solely process payments are excluded from the definition of “electronic marketplace” as these providers merely facilitate the exchange of money between the supplier and consumer, rather than the sale and purchase of the goods or services. 136. Section 2 defines an “underlying supplier” as the person that would be the supplier of the goods and services in the absence of the marketplace rules. Given that a marketplace is at the top of the hierarchy of collection entities (with a redeliverer only being responsible for GST if neither a marketplace operator nor the merchant who sold the goods is liable to return the GST), the “underlying supplier” would be the merchant who sold the goods. Electronic marketplace rule 137. Section 60C has been amended so that it treats the operator of an electronic marketplace as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity when: • the goods are supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier; • the operator of the electronic marketplace or the underlying supplier makes, arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • the goods individually have estimated customs values of NZ$1,000 or less. 138. However, the operator of the electronic marketplace will not be considered to have made the supply if they do not control any of the key elements of the supply, and the liability of the underlying supplier is made clear in the documentation relating to the transaction. Accordingly, under section 60C, an operator of an electronic marketplace would not be treated as the supplier if all the following conditions are satisfied: • the electronic marketplace does not authorise the charge to the recipient, or make or authorise the delivery of the supply, or directly or indirectly set any of the terms and conditions under which the supply is made; • the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; and • the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed that the underlying supplier is liable for GST. 139. If they are treated as making the supply, the operator of the electronic marketplace will be responsible for returning GST. The operator of the electronic marketplace will include these supplies in their turnover for the purpose of determining whether the registration threshold is exceeded and, if it is exceeded, will be liable for the GST. The operator would also make any adjustments arising from the supply, for example, when incorrectly charged GST is refunded to a GST-registered business. Meaning of “authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient” 140. The meaning of “authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient” is broad, covering the situation where the marketplace authorises the charge on behalf of the merchant or as a processing agent for the merchant. However, as mentioned earlier, providers that only process payments are excluded from the definition of “electronic marketplace”. 141. An electronic marketplace would authorise the charge to the recipient if it communicates the liability to pay to the customer, or otherwise influences whether or when the customer pays for the supply. This may be done by initiating the process through which the recipient is charged and includes situations where the marketplace connects the recipient to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 20 NEW LEGISLATION a third-party payment processor who receives the marketplace operator’s instruction. To authorise the charge, it is not necessary for the marketplace operator to collect or receive the payment, or that it is involved in each of the steps in the payment authorisation process. Example 14 – marketplace that authorises the charge to the recipient When using the A Co. marketplace to purchase goods, Virginia chooses to pay using Pay Global, a third party payment processor. A Co. connects Virginia to Pay Global’s website, and provides data to Pay Global that allows them to process the payment. A Co. authorises the charge to Virginia. This is because it has communicated Virginia’s liability to pay for the goods. Example 15 – marketplace that does not authorise the charge Thomas is an underlying supplier who sells goods using the E-Z Trades marketplace. His profile advertises the fact that he has an active account on Pay Global, a third party payment processor. Thomas uses the messaging function to provide customers with his account details. E-Z Trades does not communicate the customer’s liability to pay, or influence whether or at what time the customer pays for the supply. It does not authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient. Meaning of “make or authorise the delivery of the supply to the recipient” 142. An electronic marketplace makes or authorises the delivery of the supply to the recipient if the operator of the marketplace itself delivers the goods, or if the marketplace sends approval to commence delivery or instructs the underlying supplier or a third party to make the delivery. Example 16 – marketplace that authorises delivery Consider Virginia and A Co. in Example 14. Once A Co. receives confirmation from Pay Global that payment was made, A Co. notifies the underlying supplier, and provides delivery instructions. A Co. authorises the delivery of the supply to Virginia. Example 17 – marketplace that does not authorise delivery Sports Stuff is an underlying supplier selling sporting gear through Persimmon’s website. Steve contacts Sports Stuff through Persimmon’s messaging service and buys a set of shin guards. Sports Stuff, and not Persimmon, authorises delivery of the item, given the arrangements for the order and delivery of the goods are made directly with Sports Stuff. Meaning of “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” 143. The meaning of “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” is very broad. This concept looks beyond the formal contractual relationship to the influence exercised by the marketplace operator. The marketplace operator does not need to have any direct involvement in determining the contractual arrangements between underlying suppliers and buyers using the marketplace in order to be responsible for GST on supplies. 144. A requirement for underlying suppliers to comply with the marketplace’s listing policies will in many cases mean that the marketplace does (at least indirectly) set a term or condition under which the supply is made, meaning that the marketplace operator will be responsible for GST on the supply. However, this may not be true in all cases and will depend on what the marketplace’s specific listing policies are. 145. For example, a requirement in a contract between the marketplace operator and the underlying supplier that goods sold on the marketplace must comply with New Zealand laws and regulations will not in itself mean that the marketplace “directly or indirectly sets a term or condition under which the supply is made”. This is because the “directly or indirectly” test is a proxy for the level of control or influence the marketplace operator has over the sale and any post-sales processes, such as returns, refunds and customer complaints. A mere requirement that listings comply with New Zealand’s regulatory requirements or, for example, that listings do not contain offensive language is not sufficient to meet this test. 146. However, there are several marketplace listing policies that will meet this test, including: • the offer, acceptance, payment for the goods or delivery information is to be communicated through the marketplace; • the underlying supplier must accept one or more specific payment methods, or shipping or delivery methods to be used in fulfilling the sale; • the marketplace operator provides the types of packaging to be used by the underlying supplier; Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 21 NEW LEGISLATION • underlying suppliers will match the prices of goods which are sold cheaper elsewhere (price match guarantee); • the marketplace operator has the right to withhold the buyer’s payment from the underlying supplier until the buyer confirms they are satisfied with the product; • use of the marketplace’s grievance or dispute management procedures for underlying suppliers and buyers; • the marketplace operator has the right to set the price for which goods are sold, such as by offering a discount through a customer loyalty programme; • underlying suppliers are required to meet particular performance requirements, such as those relating to the quality of the goods or requiring them to maintain a particular customer rating to sell products on the marketplace; or • underlying suppliers are required to display a rating based on stipulated behaviours relating to that underlying supplier’s conduct on the marketplace. 147. In practice this means there will be very limited circumstances where an electronic marketplace operator will not be responsible for GST on sales made by a non-resident underlying supplier though the marketplace. Example 18 – marketplace that directly or indirectly sets any of the terms and conditions Tangerine (an electronic marketplace) offers features and imposes requirements on underlying suppliers and buyers, each of which mean that it directly or indirectly sets some of the terms and conditions under which the supplies through it are made. Tangerine: • requires underlying suppliers to conclude the transaction through its marketplace, and prohibits them from directly transacting with buyers outside of its marketplace. This ensures that Tangerine can collect the correct fee amount, which is based on the value of the sale; • requires underlying suppliers to accept at least one of the specific payment methods listed on its website; and • provides a rating of the underlying supplier’s performance on the platform, using ratings from buyers. This rating system influences the underlying supplier’s conduct when selling items through Tangerine. Example 19 – marketplace that does not directly or indirectly set any of the terms and conditions XYZ Marketplace Co. (XYZ) operates an electronic marketplace. However, the only requirements that it places on merchants and buyers using its website are that restricted or prohibited items (such as firearms) cannot be listed for sale, and that listings and other communications between merchants and buyers cannot contain offensive language. XYZ does not directly or indirectly set any of the terms or conditions under which the supply is made. Priority rule where multiple electronic marketplaces are involved in a supply 148. Where multiple electronic marketplaces are liable for GST on a single supply of distantly taxable goods or remote services, a priority rule in section 60C(3) provides that the first operator that authorises a charge or receives payment for the supply is treated as the supplier. If none of the marketplaces involved meet this requirement, the first operator that authorises delivery would be treated as the supplier. Approved marketplace rule 149. Amended section 60D allows non-electronic marketplaces for goods to register as a marketplace subject to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s approval. The operator, and not the underlying supplier, would then be treated as making the supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 150. New section 60D(2)(c) sets out that an approved marketplace for goods will be treated as making a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity in circumstances where: • the Commissioner approves an application made by the operator of the marketplace under subsection (2); • the goods are supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier; • the operator of the marketplace or the underlying supplier makes, arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • the goods individually have estimated customs values of NZ$1,000 or less (if the marketplace operator has not elected to charge GST on high-value goods – discussed later). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 22 NEW LEGISLATION 151. When exercising this discretion to approve a marketplace under section 60D, subsection (3) provides that the Commissioner may take the following into account: • whether the marketplace is best placed to determine whether the recipient of the supply of goods is a registered person; and • whether the number of non-resident underlying suppliers selling low-value goods through the marketplace means that return requirements are better satisfied by the marketplace rather than the individual underlying suppliers. Residency of underlying suppliers 152. As mentioned above, a marketplace operator will only be treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods if the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident. This is in contrast with the existing marketplace rules for remote services, which (as illustrated in Table 1) apply to supplies made by both resident and non-resident underlying suppliers. 153. The marketplace rules for goods do not require the marketplace operator to distinguish between goods that are outside New Zealand at the time of supply versus those that are already in New Zealand. This is because all goods that are treated by section 60C or 60D as supplied by a marketplace operator are included in the definition of “distantly taxable goods”, regardless of where the goods are situated at the time of supply. 154. Below is a summary of the differences between the GST rules applying to goods individually valued at NZ$1,000 or less (“low-value goods”) and remote services before and after 1 December 2019, in the situation where those low-value goods or remote services are supplied over a marketplace by a non-resident underlying supplier. Table 1: Pre-1 December 2019 treatment of different types of supplies and application of the marketplace rules to these supplies from 1 December 2019 Remote servicesLow-value goods in New Zealand at the time of supply Low-value goods outside New Zealand at the time of supply Previous treatmentMarketplace operator is the supplier for GST purposes. Underlying supplier is responsible for GST. Supply not subject to GST. New treatmentNo change.Marketplace operator is the supplier for GST purposes. Marketplace operator is the supplier for GST purposes. 155. The existing treatment of remote services supplied through non-resident electronic marketplaces will continue to apply. This means that the non-resident marketplace operator is responsible for returning GST on these supplies, regardless of whether the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident or a non-resident. Specific rule for underlying suppliers 156. Non-resident underlying suppliers that sell goods and/or remote services over marketplaces may already be registered for GST under existing rules. It is also possible that some non-resident underlying suppliers may become liable to register in their own right under the new rules for distantly taxable goods if they also make non-marketplace supplies to consumers in New Zealand (for instance, through their own website or mail order). 157. Some of these underlying suppliers may incur GST on inputs purchased from New Zealand businesses for making supplies to customers in New Zealand. Amended section 60(1C) ensures that such underlying suppliers (whether they are non- resident, or resident in New Zealand) can claim input tax deductions for their expenses in making supplies through electronic marketplaces. 158. The provision allows the underlying supplier to treat the supply as two separate supplies – a supply of goods or remote services from the underlying supplier to the operator of the marketplace, and a supply of those same goods or services from the operator to the recipient. The first supply to the marketplace operator is zero-rated under either section 11A(1)(jc) or new section 11(1)(jb), thus enabling the underlying supplier to recover the GST costs incurred in making the supply. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 23 NEW LEGISLATION Example 20 – zero-rated supply of remote services from underlying supplier to marketplace operator Games Pty Ltd., an Australian app developer that is registered for GST in New Zealand, contracts with App Store Co., an operator of an app store, to distribute its smartphone games. App Store Co. collects payments from customers and authorises delivery of the app. App Store Co. is treated as the supplier under section 60C, and is therefore responsible for GST on the supply. If, as a result of section 60C, App Store Co. makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of remote services that are made through its marketplace to New Zealand-resident consumers. Even though section 60C means App Store Co. is treated as the supplier of the app, Games Pty Ltd. can treat its supply of the app as a zero-rated supply to App Store Co. (as a separate supply to the supply that App Store Co. is treated as making). This will allow Games Pty Ltd. to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies of the app through App Store Co. Example 21 – zero-rated supply of distantly taxable goods from underlying supplier to marketplace operator Page Turners, a US-based book seller that is registered for GST in New Zealand, uses Books Marketplace, an electronic marketplace, to advertise and sell its books to customers in New Zealand. Books Marketplace sets some terms and conditions and collects payments from customers. Books Marketplace is treated as the supplier under section 60C, and is therefore responsible for GST on the supply. If, as a result of section 60C, Books Marketplace makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of goods that are made through its marketplace to customers with a delivery address in New Zealand. Even though Books Marketplace is treated as the supplier, under section 60(1C) Page Turners can treat its supply as a zero- rated supply to Books Marketplace (as a separate supply to the supply that Books Marketplace is treated as making). This will allow Page Turners to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies of books through Books Marketplace. Repeal of residency rule for marketplace operators 159. Sections 60C(1)(b) and 60D(1)(b), which restrict the application of the marketplace rules to marketplaces operated by non- residents, have been repealed. This means that, from 1 December 2019, the marketplace rules for distantly taxable goods and remote services will apply to marketplaces operated by residents, in addition to those operated by non-residents. 19 Example 22 – supply of distantly taxable goods through New Zealand-resident marketplace Frances, a non-resident merchant, sells some books to Anna over an online marketplace. The entity which operates the online marketplace, NZ Marketplace, is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. Because the books each individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less, are to be delivered to an address in New Zealand and the underlying supplier of the books (Frances) is a non-resident, NZ Marketplace is treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods under section 60C. This means that NZ Marketplace (instead of Frances) is required to return GST on the supply to Anna. The same outcome would also apply if NZ Marketplace was a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. However, if Frances was a New Zealand resident, NZ Marketplace would not be responsible for GST on the supply to Anna. Discounts provided by marketplace operators 160. New section 10(7D) contains a special valuation rule to deal with the situation where an operator of a marketplace provides discounts for remote services or distantly taxable goods that it is treated as supplying under section 60C or 60D. 161. Section 10(7D) provides that where an operator of a marketplace is deemed to make a supply of remote services or distantly taxable goods to a recipient who accepts an offer of a discount by the operator, the supply is made for the discounted price. This means that the amount of GST that the marketplace operator would be required to return on the supply would be 3/23 of the total GST-inclusive amount paid by the recipient. 19 An implication of this is that the electronic marketplace rules will technically apply in the situation where a resident underlying supplier makes a supply of remote services through a resident marketplace, thus having the unintended effect of affecting some domestic commercial arrangements that are already covered by existing agency rules. Officials will seek to correct this in a future omnibus tax bill, so that a New Zealand-resident operator of an electronic marketplace will only be treated by section 60C as making a supply of remote services if the underlying supplier is a non-resident. The application date of the planned amendment would be 1 December 2019. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 24 NEW LEGISLATION Example 23 – marketplace provides discount for distantly taxable goods sold by underlying supplier Trev, a non-resident supplier, sells a rugby league jersey to Mali, a consumer in New Zealand. The jersey is listed on the A Co. marketplace for NZ$50 plus GST if any with free shipping. The GST-inclusive price of the jersey is therefore NZ$57.50 (NZ$50 + NZ$7.50 in GST). A Co. offers a discount of NZ$5 on the price of the jersey, which Mali accepts at the checkout before paying for the goods. The final (GST-inclusive) price paid by Mali is therefore NZ$52.50. However, A Co. pays for the discount, so Trev still receives the GST-exclusive price of NZ$50. A Co. is required to calculate the amount of GST on the price paid by Mali (NZ$52.50). A Co. returns NZ$6.85 in GST on the supply (being 3 ÷ 23 × NZ$52.50). Bad debt deduction rule 162. An operator of a marketplace may collect GST on a supply it is deemed to make in one of two ways: • The marketplace operator arranges for the payment from the customer to be split when the payment is processed, with the amount of GST and the marketplace’s facilitation fee or commission remitted to the operator, and the sale price (net of GST and the amount of the marketplace’s fee or commission on the sale) remitted to the underlying supplier of the goods or services. • The customer may pay the underlying supplier directly, and the marketplace operator collects the GST along with its fee or commission from the underlying supplier. 163. In the second scenario, the marketplace operator may at times be unable to collect the GST from the underlying supplier. To prevent marketplace operators in this situation from being liable for GST that they are unable to collect, new section 26AA will allow them to claim a bad debt deduction if: • the underlying supplier fails to pass on the GST paid to them for the supply; and • the operator of the marketplace has written off all amounts for the supply as a bad debt, including its fee or commission on the sale. 164. Section 26AA(1) specifies that the rule would apply to a marketplace operator that is treated by section 60C or 60D as making a taxable supply of goods or services if the underlying supplier of the goods is not an associated person, and the marketplace operator: • charges the underlying supplier a fee for making the supply through the marketplace; • accounts for GST on the supply and files a return for the taxable period during which the supply was made; • has an agreement with the underlying supplier under which the underlying supplier is required to pay, from the consideration the underlying supplier receives from the customer, an amount that includes the GST on the supply that the marketplace operator has accounted for; and • the marketplace operator writes off as a bad debt the entire amount that the underlying supplier is required to pay (along with the entire amount of the marketplace’s fee, if not already included in this amount). 165. Section 26AA(2) provides that the marketplace operator may deduct input tax (or account for a reduction in its output tax, if the marketplace has registered under the simplified “pay only” system, discussed at \[40\]) equal to the amount of GST charged on the supply. 166. In the situation where the marketplace operator recovers an amount of the bad debt that was written off in an earlier taxable period, section 26AA(3) will require the operator to account for an amount of output tax that is a fraction of the amount of the input tax deduction (or output tax reduction) claimed earlier. This fraction would be calculated by dividing the amount recovered by the total amount written off. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 25 NEW LEGISLATION Example 24 – marketplace writes off amount owed by underlying supplier as a bad debt Derek, a consumer in New Zealand, purchases a vinyl record listed on the A Co. online marketplace from Retro Audio, a non- resident supplier. The price of the record, including shipping (but excluding GST) is NZ$40. At the online checkout, Derek provides an address in New Zealand for the goods to be delivered. Consequently, A Co. is deemed to be the supplier of the vinyl record for GST purposes. The supply of the record is a supply of distantly taxable goods subject to GST at the rate of 15%. The GST-inclusive price of the record is therefore NZ$46 (NZ$40 + NZ$6 in GST). Instead of paying by a method that would provide A Co. with some control over the processing of the payment (such as by credit card), Derek opts to pay Retro Audio directly by internet banking transfer. A Co. has an agreement with Retro Audio that if a customer pays Retro Audio directly, Retro Audio is required to pay A Co. the amount of GST on the sale, along with A Co.’s commission of five percent on the total sale price. The amount of the debt that Retro Audio owes A Co. is therefore NZ$8.30 (NZ$6 in GST, plus commission of NZ$46 × 5% = NZ$2.30). Retro Audio defaults in paying the debt to A Co, so A Co. writes off the full amount of NZ$8.30 as a bad debt. As A Co. returned the NZ$6 in GST on the supply to Inland Revenue in a previous GST return, A Co. is entitled to claim a bad debt deduction of NZ$6 in its GST return. If A Co. subsequently recovered any of the debt in a later taxable period, it would be required to return output tax in its GST return for that taxable period, to the extent of the amount of the recovery. For example, if A Co. managed to collect NZ$4.15 from Retro Audio, the fraction given by section 26AA(3) would be 4.15 ÷ 8.30 = ½. A Co. would therefore be required to return NZ$3 in output tax (½ × NZ$6 = NZ$3). If, instead of writing off the full amount as a bad debt, A Co. only wrote off a fraction of the amount as a bad debt, A Co. would not be able to claim a bad debt deduction in relation to the supply. Redeliverers 167. Some non-resident merchants do not provide shipping of goods to New Zealand. New Zealand consumers can, however, use a redeliverer to ship or arrange the shipment of goods to New Zealand. 168. A redeliverer may be a person that provides a “mailbox” service, meaning that they provide the use of an overseas delivery address for consumers purchasing goods from offshore suppliers. These types of redeliverers would receive or collect the goods from the overseas address and deliver the goods to the consumer’s address in New Zealand, or arrange the collection and delivery of the goods to the customer in New Zealand. 169. In some instances, the definition of “redeliverer” may also cover a person that provides personal shopping services to consumers in New Zealand. 170. When consumers use a redeliverer, it is likely that the merchant (or both the merchant and the marketplace operator, if the supply is made through a marketplace) is unaware of the goods’ ultimate destination, and therefore cannot be expected to return GST on the supply. The new rules therefore require redeliverers to collect and return GST in this situation. Definition of “redeliverer” 171. The definition of “redeliverer” requires that the person who is acting as a redeliverer has an arrangement with the recipient of the goods. Under this arrangement, the person either delivers the goods to New Zealand, or arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to New Zealand, and does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; or • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. 172. Personal shoppers that re-sell goods to consumers in New Zealand (as opposed to purchasing goods as an agent of the customer) are not covered by the redeliverer rules as they are considered to be merchants. Redeliverer rule 173. New section 60E sets out that a person acting as a redeliverer will be treated as supplying distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity if all the following conditions are satisfied: • no operator of a marketplace is treated as the supplier of the goods; • the merchant who sold the goods does not deliver, nor arrange or assist the delivery of the goods to New Zealand; and Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 26 NEW LEGISLATION • when the redeliverer is treated as the supplier of the goods, the goods that the redeliverer is treated as supplying are distantly taxable goods (meaning that the goods individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less 20 or, as discussed later at \[292\] to \[309\], the redeliverer has elected under new section 10C to charge GST on items with an estimated customs value above NZ$1,000). 174. This means that a redeliverer will only be treated as the supplier if neither the merchant, nor an operator of a marketplace, delivers or assists in delivering the goods to New Zealand. If either does deliver or assist in delivering the goods to New Zealand, one of these entities will be responsible for GST on the supply instead of the redeliverer. This is consistent with the policy intent that the redeliverer provisions apply in limited circumstances, where the other entities are unaware that the goods will be sent to New Zealand. Priority rule where multiple redeliverers are involved 175. In some circumstances, more than one person may meet the definition of a redeliverer in relation to a single supply of distantly taxable goods. This would occur when more than one redeliverer is involved in an arrangement to deliver goods to a place in New Zealand. For example, one entity acting as a redeliverer may contract with another entity to purchase the goods as an agent of the consumer. 176. Section 60E(2) contains a priority rule to deal with the situation where multiple redeliverers may be liable for GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a consumer in New Zealand. Under this provision, the redeliverer that first enters into an arrangement with the recipient of the goods is treated as making the supply. If no such arrangement exists, the first redeliverer to enter into an arrangement with any other person acting on the recipient’s behalf is treated as the supplier and therefore responsible for GST. Special valuation rule for redeliverers’ deemed supplies of goods 177. New section 10(7C) is a special valuation rule for supplies of goods treated by section 60E as being made by a redeliverer. Section 10(7C) provides that the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods by a redeliverer equals the consideration paid by the recipient for the goods before the addition of GST. 178. This rule means that the amount of GST on the supply of goods that the redeliverer would be required to return is equal to 15% of the price paid by the recipient to the supplier for the goods. This recognises that the price charged by the supplier of the goods did not include GST. Amendment to zero-rating rules for international transportation services 179. Under the existing rules in section 11A(1) of the GST Act, the supply of international transportation and associated insurance services is zero-rated, as are services that are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. This generally means that services provided by redeliverers (which would largely consist of international transportation and handling, storage and logistics provided in relation to goods that are located offshore, or the arranging or facilitation thereof) are effectively not taxed, as the supply of these services would typically be subject to GST at the rate of 0% under existing rules. 180. New section 11A(1D) provides an exception to this general rule. Section 11A(1D) sets out that paragraphs (a), (c), (cb), (d) and (f) in section 11A(1) do not apply to a supply of services provided by a GST-registered redeliverer if those services are provided in relation to distantly taxable goods that are treated as being supplied by the redeliverer. This means that the redeliverer’s services would be taxed in the same way as the goods the redeliverer brings or assists in bringing to New Zealand (as any transportation or associated facilitation services provided by the redeliverer would be taxed at the rate of 15% if they are supplied in connection with a supply by the redeliverer of distantly taxable goods). 181. The value of a supply of distantly taxable goods and related transport and facilitation services by a redeliverer will therefore be equal to: • the consideration paid by the recipient for the distantly taxable goods before the addition of GST (meaning that the amount of GST on the goods is 15% of the price paid by the recipient for the goods, including any additional charges by the merchant for transport and insurance); plus • the consideration for the supply of the redeliverer’s services with the addition of GST (meaning that the amount of GST on the supply of the redeliverer’s services is 3/23 of the GST-inclusive price paid by the recipient). 20 In the situation where some of the goods in the transaction have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less while other goods in the transaction are valued above NZ$1,000, the supply would be treated as two separate supplies in the manner described at \[90\] if the redeliverer has not made an election to treat items valued above NZ$1,000 as distantly taxable goods. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 27 NEW LEGISLATION Example 25 – redeliverer providing a mailbox service Matt, a consumer in New Zealand, contracts a redeliverer called C Co. to pick up a laptop bag from a UK address that C Co. provided to Matt and deliver it to his home address in Wellington. Matt paid NZ$40 for the bag including the amount charged by the merchant for shipping from its retail store in London to C Co.’s UK address. When arranging for the goods to be redelivered to his Wellington address, Matt tells C Co. that he paid NZ$40 for the goods. C Co. charges NZ$15 plus GST if any for its services as redeliverer in bringing the goods to New Zealand. As the estimated customs value of the laptop bag is less than NZ$1,000, the laptop bag is considered distantly taxable. C Co. charges Matt NZ$23.25, comprising: • NZ$6 in GST, which is 15% of the NZ$40 Matt paid the UK supplier for the goods; • NZ$15 for C Co.’s redelivery services; and • NZ$2.25 in GST, which is 15% of C Co.’s GST-exclusive fee for its services. C Co. returns NZ$8.25 in GST to Inland Revenue when it files its GST return. Example 26 – redeliverer providing a personal shopping service Marie is a redeliverer who regularly purchases clothes as an agent for Carolyn. Marie facilitates the delivery of the goods into New Zealand by arranging for a freight company to deliver the clothes to Carolyn’s address in Oamaru. The USA merchants that sell the clothes have no role in bringing the goods to New Zealand. Carolyn paid NZ$720 for a dress that Marie purchased as her agent. This included NZ$20 for the cost of shipping from the USA merchants to Marie’s address overseas. Marie charged Carolyn NZ$40 (exclusive of GST) for her services as a redeliverer in bringing the dress to New Zealand. As the estimated customs value of the dress is less than NZ$1,000 (being NZ$720), the dress is an item of distantly taxable goods. Marie is registered for GST and determines the supply is a taxable supply. Marie charges Carolyn NZ$874, made up of: • NZ$720 to reimburse Marie for the purchase of the dress (including the NZ$20 charge for delivery to Marie’s USA address); • NZ$108 in GST, which is 15% of the NZ$720 Carolyn paid for the dress; • NZ$40 for Marie’s facilitation and delivery services; and • NZ$6 in GST, which is 15% of Marie’s NZ$40 GST-exclusive fee for her services. Marie returns NZ$114 in GST to Inland Revenue when she files her GST return. New Zealand-resident agents 182. Amended section 60(1A) and 60(1AB) allows New Zealand-resident agents acting for non-residents that supply distantly taxable goods to consumers to agree with the non-resident principal to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by them. 183. If this option is exercised, the agent would be required to register and return GST on the supplies of distantly taxable goods. Since the agent is a New Zealand resident they would be treated as any other resident supplier of goods and services and, therefore, would be required to return GST on both supplies to New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. Example 27 – New Zealand-resident agent treated as making supply of distantly taxable goods Agent Co., a New Zealand resident, sells low-value imported goods to consumers in New Zealand on behalf of Principal Co., a non-resident merchant. Agent Co. and Principal Co. agree that Agent Co. will be treated as making the supplies of distantly taxable goods. Assuming the supplies made by Agent Co. exceed the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, Agent Co. is now required to register and return GST on behalf of Principal Co. in relation to supplies to both New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 28 NEW LEGISLATION Preventing double taxation (Sections 12(1B), (1C), 12B, 20(3)(dd), 24BAB, 24BAC and 25(1)(bb)) Changes to the customs de minimis 184. To simplify border processes and reduce the risk of potential double taxation occurring under the new legislation applying to distantly taxable goods, the Government is proposing changes to the Customs and Excise Regulations 1996. The changes consist of: • increasing the de minimis (the threshold below which GST and other duties are not collected by Customs at the border) from NZ$60 of duty owing to a consignment with a customs value over NZ$1,000; and • removing the Import Entry Transaction Fee (IETF) and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy (BSEL) from consignments with a customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 185. This means that from 1 December 2019, Customs will collect GST and other duties, as well as the IETF and associated BSEL on imported consignments valued above NZ$1,000, but will not collect these charges on consignments valued at or below NZ$1,000. 21 186. However, requiring merchants, marketplaces and redeliverers to collect GST on imported goods individually having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less – while Customs collects GST on consignments valued over NZ$1,000 – nonetheless creates the potential for double taxation to occur in some situations. For example, a single consignment could be valued over NZ$1,000, but contain an item or items that, individually, have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 187. Double taxation could also potentially arise if goods are sold in a foreign currency and the exchange rate used by the supplier at the time of supply to determine whether the goods are distantly taxable goods differs from that used by the customs broker when completing the import entry. Rules and processes, including requirements for suppliers to provide certain information about GST, are therefore required to prevent double taxation, as well as relieve double taxation in the rare event that it occurs. This section explains how these rules and processes will operate. Exception to the collection of GST on importation 188. Under new section 12(1B) and (1C), Customs will not collect GST on items imported in consignments with a combined value over NZ$1,000 if GST has been charged on the item at the point of sale – provided that Customs is notified that GST has already been paid. Customs will still collect other duty, such as tariff duty, and the IETF and associated BSEL on consignments over NZ$1,000 if GST has already been charged on all the goods in the consignment at the point of sale, including GST applying to the tariff duty, IETF and BSEL. 189. Section 12(1B) sets out that for Customs’ purposes of collecting GST on imported goods at the border, the value of distantly taxable goods does not include the following: • the value of the goods determined in accordance with Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018; • the amount paid or payable for transport of the goods to New Zealand and associated insurance; and • the amount of levy paid or payable on goods under the Climate Change Response Act 2002. 190. This means that if GST was charged on an item at the point of sale, Customs will not collect GST again on the value of the item or on the amount charged for freight and insurance, but will collect GST on any tariff duty applying to the item if the item is imported in a consignment valued over NZ$1,000. 191. In order for Customs to identify whether GST has already been charged on an item, the information available to Customs at the time the goods are imported needs to sufficiently identify the items in the consignment on which tax was charged at the point of sale, as well as the name and GST registration number of the registered person who is responsible for returning GST on the supply to Inland Revenue. 21 As mentioned earlier, consignments containing alcohol and tobacco products are not subject to the de minimis, so Customs will continue to collect GST and excise taxes on these products regardless of their value. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 29 NEW LEGISLATION Example 28 – consignment of distantly taxable goods with total value above NZ$1,000 Jason purchases a phone for NZ$900 and noise cancelling headphones for NZ$200 (excluding GST) from Kim’s Phone Warehouse, a GST-registered non-resident supplier. As both items individually have an estimated customs value below NZ$1,000, Kim’s Phone Warehouse treats the goods as distantly taxable and charges Jason GST on both the phone and the headphones. The phone and headphones are sent to Jason in a single package with a customs value of NZ$1,100. As the consignment is over NZ$1,000, Customs will stop the consignment for revenue collection and collect the Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy (total fees of NZ$55.71). However, provided that evidence is made available to Customs in the approved form that GST was already collected by Kim’s Phone Warehouse on both the phone and the headphones, Customs will not collect GST on either of the two items in the consignment. Example 29 – distantly taxable goods subject to tariff duty imported in consignment over NZ$1,000 Fi purchases two designer label dresses from Snazzy Dresses, a non-resident merchant offering free shipping for orders over NZ$1,000. One dress is priced at NZ$400 while the other is priced at NZ$1,100 (plus GST if any). Snazzy Dresses is registered for GST and charges GST on the supply of the NZ$400 dress to Fi (as the supply of the NZ$400 dress is a taxable supply of distantly taxable goods, but the NZ$1,100 dress is not an item of distantly taxable goods). The dresses are sent to Fi in a single package with a customs value of NZ$1,500. As the consignment is over NZ$1,000, Customs will stop the consignment for revenue collection and collect the Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy of NZ$55.71. Evidence is made available to Customs in the approved form that GST was already collected by Snazzy Dresses on the NZ$400 dress, so Customs only collects GST on the NZ$1,100 dress of NZ$165 (NZ$1,100 × 15% = NZ$165). However, because both dresses are subject to tariff duty of 5%, Customs will also collect tariff duty (including GST applying to the tariff duty) on both dresses. The amount of the tariff duty excluding GST is NZ$75 (NZ$1,500 × 5% = NZ$75) and the amount of GST applying to the tariff duty is NZ$11.25 (NZ$75 × 15% = NZ$11.25). The total amount that Fi will pay to Customs is NZ$306.96 (NZ$55.71 in cost recovery charges + NZ$165 in GST on the NZ$1,100 dress + NZ$75 in tariff duty excluding GST + NZ$11.25 in GST on the tariff duty). Example 30 – difference in exchange rate used by supplier and that used by Customs Fi later purchases a 60” ultra-high definition television for AU$950 from Earl’s Electronics, a non-resident merchant. At the time of sale, Earl’s Electronics estimates that the customs value of the television is NZ$998.41, based on a “buy NZD” exchange rate of AU$0.9515 / NZ$1. As the estimated customs value at the time of supply is below NZ$1,000, Earl’s Electronics charges Fi GST at the point of sale. When completing the import documentation, the customs broker converts the AU$950 figure to New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate published by Customs of AU$0.9307 / NZ$1. Based on this exchange rate, the customs broker calculates the customs value to be NZ$1,020.74 and enters this as the value in the import entry. As the customs value of the consignment is above NZ$1,000, Fi is required to pay the Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy of NZ$55.71. However, as evidence was made available to Customs in the approved form that GST was already collected by Earl’s Electronics, Customs will not collect GST. Receipt requirement 192. New section 24BAB requires suppliers to issue receipts for supplies of distantly taxable goods if the supplier has charged GST at the rate of 15% on the supply. The purpose of this requirement is to provide the recipient of the supply with a document that they can provide to Customs as evidence that GST was charged at the point of sale, so that Customs does not collect GST again when the goods are imported into New Zealand. 193. The requirement to provide a receipt is not the sole mechanism for preventing double taxation under the new rules. Rather, it serves as a back-up safeguard against double taxation in the situation where the primary mechanism (discussed below at \[203\] to \[210\]) either fails or, in some cases, may not be feasible under current systems. Particulars required to be included in the receipt 194. Unless alternative particulars are agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, section 24BAB requires that the receipt contains the following: • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the date of the supply; Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 30 NEW LEGISLATION • the date of issue of the receipt (if different from the date of the supply); • a description of the goods supplied; • the consideration for the supply and the amount of tax included; • information indicating the items for which tax has been charged; and • information indicating the items that have not had tax charged. 22 195. If GST has been charged on all of the goods included on the receipt, the last two requirements can be met by including the total GST-inclusive price and stating that this price includes GST (or alternatively by including the amount of GST for each of the goods). However, if GST was charged on only some of the goods supplied, these requirements can be met by including the amount of GST for each of the goods. 196. The amounts shown on the receipt are not required to be in New Zealand dollars. Option to issue a document that meets the requirements of both a receipt and a full tax invoice 197. Under the special rule in new section 8(4F) (explained later at \[310\] to \[317\]), some non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods may opt to proactively issue a full tax invoice for all supplies of distantly taxable goods that they make, regardless of whether the customer is a private consumer or a GST-registered business using the goods in its taxable activity. 198. The benefit of this is the non-resident supplier can issue a single document to its New Zealand customers that meets the requirements of both a full tax invoice and a receipt required to be issued to a consumer for a supply of distantly taxable goods, provided the conditions of section 8(4F) (including the requirement that the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less) are met. 199. The requirements of a full tax invoice are broadly similar to those set out in section 24BAB(2) for a receipt required to be issued to a consumer for a supply of distantly taxable goods – the main differences being the requirements for a tax invoice to include the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place, the name and address of the recipient and the quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied. 200. The table below sets out the respective requirements of a full tax invoice under section 24(3) and of a section 24BAB receipt. Section 24BAB receipt Tax invoice Words “tax invoice”NoYe s Name of the supplierYe sYe s Registration number of the supplierYe sYe s Name and address of the recipientNoYe s Date of supplyYe sNo Date of issueYe sYe s Description of goodsYe sYe s Quantity or volume of goods suppliedNoYe s Amount of considerationYe sYe s Amount of tax includedYes – but see footnote 22 Yes – unless the total amount of tax is 3/23 of the consideration, in which case a statement that the consideration includes a charge in respect of tax is sufficient Indication of which items had GST chargedYe sNo 10-day requirement for issue of receipt 201. Section 24BAB requires that a receipt (or combined tax invoice and receipt) as described above is issued to the recipient at the time of supply. However, if the supplier has not issued a receipt at the time of supply and the recipient requests a receipt, the supplier would be required to issue one within 10 business days after the request. 202. Under new section 143A(1)(fb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a supplier who knowingly fails to issue a GST receipt within ten business days of such a request commits a knowledge offence, for which penalties (both civil and criminal) may apply. 22 Officials will seek to include an amendment in a future taxation bill so that the supplier is not required to state the amount of tax included on the receipt, as this requirement does not appear to be necessary given the last two requirements in this list. The suggested amendment would be retrospective to 1 December 2019. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 31 NEW LEGISLATION GST information to be included on import documents 203. In addition to the requirement outlined above to issue GST receipts, new section 24BAC requires suppliers of distantly taxable goods to take reasonable steps to ensure that relevant GST information is available to Customs at the time of importation of the goods. 204. That information consists of: • the name and registration number of the supplier; • information indicating which items in the consignment have had GST charged at the point of sale at the rate of 15%, if applicable; and • information indicating the items in the consignment for which the amount of GST is zero. 205. If GST was not charged on some items in the transaction, these items must be identified to meet the above requirements. This would allow the new rules in section 12 that prevent double taxation to operate effectively, as GST on importation will only be “switched off ” if GST has been charged on the item at the point of sale. What “reasonable steps” means for merchants and marketplaces that fulfil orders, and redeliverers 206. For non-mail items (goods brought to New Zealand through the freight channel), a supplier who is either the merchant that sold the goods, a redeliverer, or an operator of a marketplace undertaking the fulfilment 23 of the order from the customer, would meet the requirement to take reasonable steps by: • providing the GST information listed above to the transporter or customs broker in the country of export (one way that the supplier could do this is by including the receipt or tax invoice for the goods in the commercial documentation provided to the transporter or customs broker); and • asking the transporter or customs broker in the country of export to make sure the information is provided to the transporter or customs broker in New Zealand that will complete the import documentation on behalf of the importer. What “reasonable steps” means for marketplaces that do not fulfil orders 207. The “reasonable steps” requirement differs somewhat for an operator of a marketplace who is treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the situation where the order is fulfilled by the underlying supplier. In this situation, the marketplace operator would meet the reasonable steps requirement by including GST information on commercial documentation and instructing the underlying supplier to pass this information through the logistics chain on their behalf. As above, this requirement would only apply in relation to non-mail items. Role of transporters and customs brokers 208. The transporter or customs broker completing the import documentation would report the GST information provided by the supplier or merchant into the Trade Single Window. Transporters and customs brokers only need to report this information into the Trade Single Window if it is provided to them. If this information is not provided, they are not required to take extra steps to source this information and will still be able to report the goods into the Trade Single Window for customs clearance. 209. A field for the supplier’s GST registration number will be added into the Trade Single Window. The required format of the number is nine digits as a single string without separators. 210. The information about which goods have and have not had GST charged at the point of sale will be reported into the Trade Single Window by way of a “GST paid” indicator. The format of this indicator is a “Yes” (Y) or “No” (N) response. Goods brought to New Zealand by international post 211. Current systems may not fully accommodate the transmission of information relating to goods delivered to New Zealand by international post. Therefore, issuing the customer a receipt (as required under section 24BAB) will be sufficient in the meantime to meet the reasonable steps requirement. 24 23 “Fulfilment” of an order is used here in reference to the party (merchant or marketplace operator) that ships or arranges the shipping of the goods to the customer. 24 What will constitute reasonable steps in relation to mail items might change in the future, owing to the increased availability of electronic advance data in the international postal network that is expected to occur over the next few years. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 32 NEW LEGISLATION 212. In the situation where the value of the consignment is over NZ$1,000, the consumer should hire a customs broker to complete the import documentation and arrange the clearance of the goods. To ensure that GST is not paid twice on the same goods, the consumer should provide their receipt to the customs broker as evidence that GST was charged at the point of sale. 25 Penalties for knowingly failing to take reasonable steps 213. Under new section 143A(1)(fc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a supplier would commit a knowledge offence if they knowingly fail to take reasonable steps to ensure that tax information is available to Customs at the time the goods are imported. Administrative penalties under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 may also apply in relation to an error or omission in an import entry that has been lodged with Customs. Refunds when double taxation occurs 214. Where the relevant GST information is not available to Customs, GST will be collected on importation by Customs on the entire value of a consignment over NZ$1,000 (as determined in accordance with existing section 12(2)). If some or all the goods in the consignment have already had GST charged at the point of sale, the consumer will need to request a refund of the GST from the supplier. 215. If a consumer requests a refund of the GST charged by the supplier, and the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient or some other confirmation that GST was paid on importation, the supplier will be required to issue a refund of the GST that was charged on the supply (new section 12B). If the supplier complies with this requirement, new section 25(1)(bb) allows the supplier to subtract the amount of GST refunded from its output tax (GST payable) in its GST return. Mistakes where GST has been incorrectly charged on a supply 216. New sections 12B and 25(1)(bb) would also apply in the situation where a supplier has incorrectly charged GST on a supply of imported goods that is not a supply of distantly taxable goods (for example, because the goods individually have estimated customs values above NZ$1,000). This means that a supplier in this situation will be required to refund the GST they charged if the recipient has requested a GST refund and the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient (or some other confirmation that GST was paid on the importation of the goods). 217. As above, the supplier will only be entitled to make the adjustment under section 25(1)(bb) if: • they have reimbursed the recipient for the GST charged; and • the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient or other confirmation that GST was paid to Customs on importation. Non-double taxation rule 218. New section 20(3)(dd) prevents double taxation from arising on supplies of distantly taxable goods by allowing a deduction that offsets the supplier’s liability for GST in New Zealand, to the extent that the supply is subject to a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. 219. Section 20(3)(dd) provides a deduction for the New Zealand GST charged when: • there is a supply of distantly taxable goods to a person in New Zealand who is not a GST-registered person; and • the supplier has, in relation to the supply, incurred liability for, returned and paid a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. 220. The deduction is limited to the GST paid on the supply in New Zealand (15%) and to the extent tax is returned and paid in the other country. 25 This recommendation also applies in the situation where GST information required to be provided by the supplier in relation to goods imported by freight has not been passed on to the person completing the import documentation. In other words – assuming the consumer was charged GST by the supplier and obtained a receipt – the consumer should provide their receipt to the carrier or customs broker when they are contacted by the carrier or broker to arrange clearance of the goods to avoid paying GST twice. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 33 NEW LEGISLATION Example 31 – non-double taxation rule in section 20(3)(dd) Mike, a consumer in New Zealand imports some shirts from a supplier based in Country A, who ships the goods from its warehouse in Country A. The supplier is registered for VAT in Country A and is also registered for GST in New Zealand. In order for the supplier to charge Country A’s VAT at a rate of zero percent on the supply to Mike, VAT legislation in Country A requires the supplier to export the goods within 21 days of the date of the supply. The supplier does not manage to export the goods within this timeframe and is therefore required to charge Country A’s VAT at the rate of 20%. In addition, the goods are all distantly taxable goods, so the supplier is also required to charge New Zealand GST at the rate of 15% on the supply. The non-double taxation rule in section 20(3)(dd) allows the supplier to make an input tax deduction up to the amount of New Zealand GST returned on the supply (15%) if the supplier has returned and paid VAT to Country A. If Country A’s VAT rate was instead 10%, the supplier would only be entitled to an input tax deduction of 10%. Vouchers (Section 5(11G)) 221. In the situation where a face value token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for distantly taxable goods or remote services, new section 5(11G)(a) clarifies that the supplier of the token, stamp or voucher may treat the supply of goods and services that the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for as the relevant supply for GST purposes. This means that the seller of a face value voucher would have the option of treating GST as applying on the redemption of the voucher, if the voucher is (or could be) redeemed for remote services or distantly taxable goods. This option to treat the supply as arising on the redemption of the voucher would apply regardless of whether the issuer or seller of the voucher is a different person to the supplier of the goods and services that the voucher is redeemed for. 222. The introductory wording of section 5(11G) has been amended to clarify that if GST is payable on the redemption of a voucher, the party redeeming the voucher for goods and services (or treated as making the supply of goods and services) is responsible for returning the GST. Example 32 – seller of voucher opts to use redemption basis Wendy purchases a voucher with a face value of NZ$50 from A Co. as a gift for her son Karl who lives in Dunedin, New Zealand. The voucher can be redeemed with any merchant on the A Co. marketplace. A Co. chooses to treat the supply for GST purposes as arising on the redemption of the voucher (instead of the sale of the voucher). This means that GST will apply when Karl redeems the voucher for goods and services, and not on the sale or issue of the voucher itself. Karl redeems the voucher with a non-resident merchant on the A Co. marketplace by purchasing NZ$50 worth of distantly taxable goods. Because A Co is treated by section 60C as the supplier of the goods, it is required to return NZ$6.52 in GST (3 ÷ 23 × NZ$50 = NZ$6.52) on the redemption of the voucher. If A Co. was not treated as the supplier, the underlying supplier would (if registered for GST or required to register for GST) instead be required to return GST on the supply. Converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars (Sections 77(2), (3) and (5)) 223. Generally, the GST Act requires all amounts to be expressed in New Zealand currency at the time of supply. This means that if a supply is paid for in a foreign currency, the value of the supply must be expressed as the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. 224. Section 77(2) has been amended to provide non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods with the option of expressing amounts in a foreign currency at the time of supply. Currency conversion to determine whether GST applies 225. In accordance with new section 77(5), suppliers of distantly taxable goods may use the spot exchange rate applying at the time of supply, or a currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when determining the value of goods under section 10B. The method approved by the Commissioner for this purpose is set out below. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 34 NEW LEGISLATION 226. Under the approved method, a supplier may use any one of the following exchange rates: • the rate published by the New Zealand Customs Service; • the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) rate, or a reference rate published by another central bank; 26 • an exchange rate provided by a foreign exchange organisation 27 or foreign exchange data vendor. 227. “Exchange rate” for these purposes means the unit of foreign currency per New Zealand dollar, which has been published within 30 calendar days of the conversion time. If a rate other than the most recently published rate is used, the practice for sourcing the rate must be consistent. 228. Other than the requirement that a supplier’s chosen exchange rate be used consistently (discussed below), there are no restrictions on the specific type of exchange rate (sell NZD, buy NZD, or midpoint rate) that suppliers may use for converting foreign currency amounts. This means that suppliers would have a choice of using a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate when converting foreign currency amounts to establish whether GST applies. Currency conversion formula 229. In working out the estimated customs value of goods, suppliers can convert foreign currency to New Zealand dollars using the following formula: (Amount expressed in a foreign currency) ÷ (the supplier’s chosen exchange rate on the conversion day) Sourcing exchange rates and updating business systems 230. A supplier may adopt a practice of updating their business systems with the particular rate they have chosen from the source data according to a schedule set by them. This schedule must be consistent in terms of the frequency and time of setting the rate. The maximum period permitted under such a schedule is 30 calendar days. A supplier cannot test and select a more favourable exchange rate at other times, or decide not to accept the published rate at the scheduled time of setting. 231. A supplier may only change their exchange rate or their schedule for sourcing and updating the exchange rate in their systems if they have sound commercial reasons for doing so. For instance, if a supplier changes the exchange rate they use with the purpose of affecting whether goods are distantly taxable, the supplier will not have used the rate consistently and, accordingly, will not have followed the currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner. However, different exchange rates may be used for distinct parts of the supplier’s business, provided the exchange rate chosen for each respective part of the business is used consistently within that part. Example 33 – supplier using exchange rate published by New Zealand Customs Pilko’s Phones & Electronics (Pilko) is a non-resident merchant that supplies consumer electronics such as tablets and mobile phones. It prices goods in USD. Pilko is registered for GST in New Zealand under the rules applying to supplies of distantly taxable goods. To determine the estimated customs value of an item at the time of sale, Pilko has its point of sale systems set up to convert USD to NZD using the exchange rate published by the New Zealand Customs Service. Customs publishes its exchange rates fortnightly, 11 calendar days in advance of when they come into effect. Pilko has a practice of sourcing the most recently published exchange rate and updating the exchange rate in its point of sale systems seven days after the exchange rate was published on the Customs website. This currency conversion method is Commissioner-approved. The schedule set by Pilko for sourcing the exchange rate and updating its systems is consistent in terms of its frequency and time of setting the rate. The time between setting the previous rate and updating the rate is 14 calendar days (within the 30-day maximum). Under Pilko’s schedule, the maximum possible length of time between the publication date and the time of conversion is 21 calendar days. This is within the 30-day maximum. 26 “Another central bank” refers to a central bank or monetary authority outside New Zealand that exercises functions that correspond with, or are similar to, the RBNZ. This would include organisations such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. 27 A “foreign exchange organisation” means an organisation that provides exchange rates publicly. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 35 NEW LEGISLATION Example 34 – supplier using midpoint exchange rate published by retail bank Witte Fashion Co. (Witte) is a non-resident merchant that supplies high-end clothing. It prices goods in AUD. Witte is registered for GST in New Zealand under the rules applying to supplies of distantly taxable goods. To determine the estimated customs value of an item at the time of sale, Witte has its point of sale systems set up to convert AUD (being the currency the goods Witte sells are priced in) to NZD using a mid-point rate published by a bank. The bank publishes the close-of-trading foreign exchange rates from the previous day each morning (except for Saturdays and Sundays). Witte has a practice of sourcing the most recently published exchange rate and updating the exchange rate in its point of sale systems once every four weeks on a Tuesday. This currency conversion method is Commissioner-approved. The schedule set by Witte for sourcing the exchange rate and updating its systems is consistent in terms of its frequency and time of setting the rate, and the time between setting the previous rate and updating the rate is 28 calendar days (within the 30-day maximum). Under Witte’s schedule, the maximum possible length of time between the publication date and the time of conversion is 28 calendar days. This is within the 30-day maximum. Example 35 – currency conversion to determine whether goods are distantly taxable Consider Witte Fashion Co. (Witte) in the previous example. Witte sells a suit valued at AU$880 to Gordon, plus AU$50 for shipping to Gordon’s address in Wellington, New Zealand. At the time of the sale, the midpoint exchange rate used in Witte’s systems for estimating the customs value of items sold is AU$0.9270 to NZ$1. Based on this, Witte determines that the estimated customs value of the suit in New Zealand dollars is NZ$949.30 (AU$880 / AU$0.9270 = NZ$949.30). As the estimated customs value is less than NZ$1,000, the suit is distantly taxable. Witte charges Gordon GST of AU$139.50 (AU$930 × 15%). Currency conversion when determining the amount of GST payable 232. When converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars to determine the amount of GST required to be returned, section 77(3) provides that a supplier can use the conversion rate applying on either: • the last day of the relevant taxable period; • the date the supplier files their return for the relevant period (or the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date); or • another date as agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 233. If the supplier elects to use an option other than expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at the time of supply, they may not change their method for a period of 24 months, unless they agree otherwise with the Commissioner. Example 36 – currency conversion to determine amount of GST to be returned in New Zealand dollars Consider Witte Fashion Co. (Witte) again. At the time of preparing its GST return, Witte determines that the total amount of GST it charged for the most recent taxable period is AU$9,000. Witte has elected to use the exchange rate applying on the date that it files its GST return to determine the amount of GST to be returned to Inland Revenue in New Zealand dollars. The exchange rate applying on the date that Witte files its return is AU$0.9294 / NZ$1. The amount of GST returned by Witte in its GST return is NZ$9,683.67 (AU$9,000 / AU$0.9294 = NZ$9,683.67). Witte must use this method for 24 months. It must convert GST from AUD to NZD on the date it files each GST return (or the due date if a return is filed late). Methods for electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to determine GST treatment of supplies (Sections 60F and 60G) 234. As discussed earlier at \[137\] and \[173\], new sections 60C and 60E treat operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers as supplying goods that are actually sold by third party merchants, but only if the goods are destined for a delivery address in New Zealand, and – in the specific case of marketplace operators – if the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 36 NEW LEGISLATION 235. In some situations, an electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer may not have the precise information that is required to determine the GST treatment of a supply of goods, as this information may only be available to the underlying supplier and/or the recipient. In these situations, the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer will need to rely on information collected from the underlying supplier or the recipient to determine the GST treatment of these supplies. 236. New section 60G sets out a range of methods for redeliverers and operators of electronic marketplaces to use when determining if they are the supplier of distantly taxable goods under section 60C, and/or the amount of GST required to be returned on a supply of distantly taxable goods. These methods (which are all based on information that may be commercially available to redeliverers or operators of electronic marketplaces) are explained below. Electronic marketplaces – methods for determining residency of underlying suppliers 237. An operator of an electronic marketplace that does not know the residency of an underlying supplier 28 is required by section 60G(3) to treat the underlying supplier as a non-resident, unless the marketplace operator has any of the following: • information that the underlying supplier is a company that is incorporated in New Zealand or has its centre of management in New Zealand (see section 60G(3)(b)(i)); • a New Zealand business number for the underlying supplier (see section 60G(3)(b)(ii)); or • at least two of any of the following items of information that support the conclusion that the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident (see section 60G(3)(b)(iii) and (6)): –an address of a physical location for the underlying supplier, such as a mailing or billing address; –a New Zealand GST registration number for the underlying supplier; –bank details (including the account the underlying supplier uses for making payments, or the billing address held by the bank, or the account to which the marketplace operator makes payments of amounts owed to the underlying supplier); –the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the underlying supplier or another geolocation method; –the mobile country code of the international mobile subscriber identity stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the underlying supplier; –the location of the underlying supplier’s fixed land line; –the location from where the goods are shipped; or –other commercially relevant information. 238. It might be the case that neither of the first two proxies indicate that the underlying supplier is resident in New Zealand, but the evidence under the third proxy is mixed (that is, the marketplace operator has more than one set of information listed under section 60G(6), where one set indicates that the underlying supplier is resident in New Zealand and the other set indicates that the underlying supplier is a non-resident). In this situation, the marketplace operator is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Which specific items of evidence are considered to be more reliable will depend on the circumstances. 28 In some cases, a marketplace operator may already know with absolute certainty the residency status of an underlying supplier, or may otherwise have good reasons to consider that the underlying supplier is very unlikely to be a tax resident of New Zealand. In such cases, the marketplace operator will not need to take steps to determine the underlying supplier’s residency status. For example, some marketplaces may only list goods offered for sale by merchants based in a particular geographic region. In other cases, the underlying supplier may be a related entity of the marketplace operator, or there may be publicly available information about the underlying supplier from which a clear conclusion about the tax residency status of the underlying supplier can be drawn (for example, the underlying supplier is a company that was incorporated in New Zealand, and therefore will be a New Zealand resident under the GST Act). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 37 NEW LEGISLATION Example 37 – methods for determining residency of underlying supplier Gardening Tools Co. sells a pair of gardening gloves to Maraina over the A Co. marketplace. Maraina provides a New Zealand delivery address at the checkout. A Co. does not have any information that would suggest that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. The mailing and billing address, IP address and bank details that A Co. has for Gardening Tools Co. all suggest that Gardening Tools Co. is resident in the United States. A Co. also has information that the goods are shipped from China. Without there being any information that would lead A Co. to conclude that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand tax resident using any of the three proxies listed under section 60G(3), A Co. is required to treat Gardening Tools Co. as a non- resident (meaning that A Co. is responsible for returning GST on supplies made on its marketplace by Gardening Tools Co. to consumers in New Zealand, including the supply of gardening gloves to Maraina). If A Co. had either a New Zealand business number for Gardening Tools Co. or information that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand-incorporated company, A Co. would be required to treat Gardening Tools Co. as a New Zealand resident (meaning that A Co. would not be responsible for returning GST on supplies made by Gardening Tools Co). Alternatively, if Gardening Tools Co. had at least two pieces of non-contradictory information listed under section 60G(6) (such as a mailing or billing address or bank details) indicating that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand resident, and did not have two or more pieces of information leading to the opposite conclusion and which are considered to be more reliable, A Co. would be required to treat Gardening Tools Co. as a New Zealand resident. Exception to electronic marketplace rule for underlying suppliers that are both resident and non-resident 239. New section 60C(2C) contains a limited exception to the electronic marketplace rule in section 60C. Section 60C(2C) provides that an operator of an electronic marketplace will not be treated as the supplier of goods sold by a non-resident underlying supplier if all the following conditions are met: • the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident for income tax purposes that has a branch in New Zealand; • the operator of the marketplace treats the underlying supplier as a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply (meaning that the operator does not return GST on the supply); and • in treating the underlying supplier as a New Zealand resident, the operator of the marketplace relies on a method for determining the underlying supplier’s residency that is set out in section 60G, or on an alternative method agreed with or prescribed by the Commissioner under section 60G(7) (discussed at \[248\]). 240. This exception ensures that the underlying supplier is liable for GST where the marketplace operator has used a section 60G method to determine that it is not the supplier of the goods for GST purposes. Example 38 – non-resident underlying supplier with New Zealand branch treated by marketplace as resident Clothes ‘N’ Stuff Pty Ltd is an Australian-incorporated company that is non-resident for income tax purposes. It sells goods in New Zealand through its retail outlet in Auckland. Because it has a retail outlet in Auckland through which it carries on a taxable activity, Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is treated as a New Zealand resident for GST purposes to the extent of the activity carried on through the Auckland retail outlet and accordingly is registered for GST in New Zealand. Clothes ‘N’ Stuff also sells goods to customers in Australia and New Zealand through the A Co. online marketplace. In most cases the goods are shipped directly from a warehouse in Sydney, but in some cases goods sold to a New Zealand customer may instead be sourced from the retail outlet in Auckland in order to provide faster delivery times. A Co. has on record a New Zealand GST registration number for Clothes ‘N’ Stuff, as well as the physical address of the Auckland retail outlet and the fixed landline number for the Auckland retail outlet. On the basis of the information that it holds and in accordance with the requirements in section 60G, A Co. determines that Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is a New Zealand resident for GST purposes. A Co. therefore does not collect and return GST on Clothes ‘N’ Stuff ’s supplies to consumers in New Zealand. Although Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is likely to be a non-resident in relation to most of the supplies it makes through the A Co. marketplace (insofar as this sales activity is unrelated to the Auckland retail outlet), the liability for New Zealand GST on any supplies of distantly taxable goods to consumers in New Zealand would remain with Clothes ‘N’ Stuff. This is because section 60C would not apply to treat A Co. as the supplier of the goods (owing to the exception in section 60C(2C)). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 38 NEW LEGISLATION Electronic marketplaces – proxies for determining if delivery address is in New Zealand 241. While it is expected that operators of electronic marketplaces will generally have information about the delivery address for a supply of goods, there may be some instances where the recipient of the goods does not provide the delivery address through the marketplace but instead communicates with the underlying supplier through another medium. In this situation, the best that an operator of an electronic marketplace may be able to do is to rely on proxies for determining the country or territory that the recipient’s delivery address is most likely to be in, based on the information that it does have. 242. Under section 60G(4) and (6), an electronic marketplace operator that does not know the address to which the goods are to be delivered is required to determine whether a supply of goods is made to the recipient at a place in New Zealand on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence (similar to the rule in section 60G(3)(b)(iii) for determining the residency of an underlying supplier and in section 8B(2) for remote services). 243. Section 60G(6) provides a list of indicators that can be used for these purposes: • an address of a physical location for the recipient, such as a mailing or billing address; • bank details (including the account the recipient uses for making payments, or the billing address held by the bank, or the account to which the marketplace operator makes payments of amounts owed to the recipient, if applicable); • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the recipient or another geolocation method; • the mobile country code of the international mobile subscriber identity stored on the SIM card used by the recipient; • the location of the recipient’s fixed land line; • other commercially relevant information. 244. Electronic marketplace operators can use one or more pieces of other commercially relevant information to determine whether a person is located in New Zealand, rather than using the specific indicators listed. This information may include the recipient’s trading history (such as a previous billing address) or the product purchased if it is linked to a geographic location (for example, some vouchers may only be used in a particular country). Information provided by a third party, such as by a payment service provider, may also be used. 245. Section 60G(4)(a)(ii) contains a tie-breaker rule to address the situation where the marketplace operator has more than one set of evidence that meets this test, where one set supports the conclusion that the recipient is located in New Zealand and the other supports the opposite conclusion. In this situation, the marketplace operator is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Example 39 – method for determining location of recipient Dave purchases a GPS from an Australian merchant over the Electronic Marketplace Co platform. Dave has not provided his delivery address to the merchant through the Electronic Marketplace Co platform, but instead provided his delivery address to the merchant via email. Electronic Marketplace Co collects two pieces of evidence that support the conclusion that Dave is located in New Zealand – his credit card information and the records of his delivery addresses from his purchase history on Electronic Marketplace Co over the past year. Electronic Marketplace Co also has two pieces of evidence that suggest Dave is located in the United States – his IP address and a landline phone number (the latter of which has not been updated in Dave’s trader profile since 2016). Section 60G(3) requires Electronic Marketplace Co to use the set of evidence that is more reliable to determine whether GST applies in New Zealand. Electronic Marketplace Co has implemented system rules that give priority to its customers’ transaction history and credit card information, as these indicators are more reliable in the context of their business. On this basis, Electronic Marketplace Co charges New Zealand GST on the supply. Redeliverers – default method for determining estimated customs value of goods 246. Section 60G(5) contains a default rule for redeliverers to determine the estimated customs value of goods that they bring or assist in bringing to New Zealand. The default rule applies to a redeliverer who is not responsible for the purchase of goods that it brings or assists in bringing to New Zealand in its capacity as a redeliverer. This rule requires the redeliverer to: • prior to the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand, obtain a declaration from the recipient of the amount paid for the goods; and • obtain a receipt or invoice issued by the merchant or other confirmation by the merchant of the amount paid for the goods. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 39 NEW LEGISLATION 247. The second requirement above is not intended to require the redeliverer to have any interaction with the merchant who sold the goods. If the merchant has included an invoice in the package in which the goods were shipped to the redeliverer, checking the amount of consideration shown on the invoice against the amount declared by the recipient would be sufficient to satisfy the second requirement. Similarly, this requirement would also be met if the redeliverer requires the recipient to provide the receipt or invoice issued by the merchant. Commissioner discretion to agree or prescribe alternative methods 248. In some instances, a redeliverer or an operator of an electronic marketplace may not have sufficient commercially available information to apply the default methods described above. In other cases, another potential method for determining the GST treatment which is not covered by the default rules may be more reliable than the default method, or may reduce compliance costs without resulting in a material under- or overpayment of GST. 249. To provide more flexibility, new section 60G(7) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe or agree to methods for marketplace operators and redeliverers to make conclusions relevant to whether they are treated by section 60C or 60E as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, and/or determine the amount of GST payable. 250. An agreement with the Commissioner under section 60G(7) may cover requirements for the amount of information that the marketplace operator or redeliverer is required to obtain, as well as methods for checking the accuracy of the information and the conclusions drawn from the information. 251. Allowing the Commissioner to prescribe or agree on alternative methods minimises compliance costs for marketplace operators and redeliverers while also assuring Inland Revenue that the methods used to determine the GST treatment of supplies broadly achieve the correct result. The intention is not that marketplace operators and redeliverers should have to collect extra information beyond what is already commercially available to them under their existing business processes. To the extent possible, an agreed or prescribed method should instead be based on information that is already collected by the person under existing commercial arrangements, and/or on processes that are to some extent already part of the person’s existing business practices. Information that should be included in an application for an alternative method 252. Section 60G(8) allows the Commissioner to take the following factors into account when exercising the discretion: • Commercially relevant information that is available to the marketplace operator or redeliverer and the reliability of this information. • Compliance costs of the marketplace operator or redeliverer in complying with the requirements of the default method. • The existing mechanisms the marketplace operator or redeliverer has to prevent and address situations where incorrect information is provided. 253. Ideally, an application for an agreed method would briefly cover all the points listed above, along with an explanation of why the proposed method is fair and reasonable. Specifically, the application would ideally outline how the proposed method reflects the outcome that would be reached under the default method – or, if the alternative method is being proposed because it is considered more reliable than the default method, why it is more reliable than the default method. 254. For example, a redeliverer may wish to rely on the value declared by the recipient rather than being required in all cases to obtain an invoice or receipt issued by the merchant to confirm the value of the goods. In this case, the application for an agreed method would ideally include some analysis showing that the outcome reached by relying on the value declared by the recipient is not materially different from the outcome that would be obtained if documentation issued by the merchant was instead used to confirm the value. 255. Alternatively, an application by a redeliverer might propose some mechanisms for preventing and (to the extent feasible) correcting any mistakes arising from undervaluation by consumers. What can feasibly be done in terms of discouraging or identifying undervaluation will be dependent on the redeliverer’s business processes, which would be taken into account by the Commissioner when considering the proposed method. Liability for GST if person has relied on a section 60G method 256. Under new section 60F, a marketplace operator or redeliverer that has relied on a default method set out in section 60G (or that has a safe harbour agreement with the Commissioner under section 60G(7)), cannot be held liable for GST that should have been returned if they have underpaid GST to Inland Revenue solely as a result of relying on incorrect or misleading information provided by another party. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 40 NEW LEGISLATION 257. Section 60F applies when a redeliverer or an operator of an electronic marketplace returns a deficient amount of output tax for a taxable period as a consequence of relying on inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information provided by the recipient of a supply of goods or by the merchant or underlying supplier of the goods. 258. In this situation, section 60F(2) provides that the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer has a reduction in its total output tax allocated to the relevant taxable period that is equal to the amount of the deficiency, provided that the requirements of section 60G are met. 259. This means that in the situation where the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer has relied on information provided by a third party and discovers there is a shortfall in the amount of output tax returned, the marketplace operator or redeliverer would not be liable to account for the output tax shortfall – provided that the reliance on information provided by a third party was in good faith and on reasonable grounds (see section 60G(1)(c)) and, if applicable, is consistent with a method prescribed in the legislation or agreed with the Commissioner. Example 40 – agreed method for determining residency of underlying suppliers A Co. is a marketplace operator, whose underlying suppliers may be resident in New Zealand or in other countries. A Co. agrees with the Commissioner on the method it will use to determine the residency of underlying suppliers, based on the information that is commercially available. As part of the agreement, A Co. has governance mechanisms to prevent mistakes, which include: • deploying technology to detect when underlying suppliers provide incorrect information relevant to their residency; • educating underlying suppliers on the consequences of providing incorrect information (which include tax penalties that may apply); • taking actions to remove the underlying supplier from its marketplace where incorrect information has been provided, if necessary; and • in agreed circumstances where a significant amount of tax is at stake, providing information to the Commissioner about underlying suppliers that have provided incorrect information, to allow the Commissioner to use her powers to collect GST from the underlying supplier. This agreement means that A Co. can rely on certain information to support conclusions that it is not responsible for GST on a supply because the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident. If it is later discovered that the underlying supplier is not a New Zealand resident, A Co. will not be exposed to additional GST liability (as the amount of the output tax reduction given under section 60F(2) would offset the amount of output tax that should have been returned). Example 41 – agreement allowing redeliverer to rely on value declared by recipient Redeliverer Co. is a redeliverer which provides a US postal address to consumers in New Zealand and brings goods from US merchants to New Zealand. The US merchant is unaware that the consumer has engaged Redeliverer Co to bring the goods to New Zealand. Redeliverer Co charges a facilitation fee to the consumer based on the weight and size of the parcel. The receipt issued by the US merchant to the recipient is generally not a piece of information that is commercially available to Redeliverer Co, unless it asks for proof of the value of the goods because the recipient is also purchasing insurance. Rather than changing its systems to require a receipt to be submitted, Redeliverer Co agrees with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that it can use the amount declared by the customer to determine how much GST to collect from the consumer, provided that it puts certain governance mechanisms in place to prevent mistakes. Such mechanisms may include the following: • Warning recipients about the consequences of undervaluing goods, including penalties that may apply under the tax legislation and under the Customs and Excise legislation. • Using the value on a receipt from the merchant if this is commercially available (for example, where it is included with the goods when they arrive at Redeliverer Co’s warehouse in the US or when provided by the recipient if they buy insurance). • Taking a random sample of goods regularly to identify any undervaluation, and correct it if possible. • In agreed circumstances where a significant amount of tax is at stake, providing information to the Commissioner about consumers that have underdeclared values, to allow the Commissioner to use her powers to collect GST from the consumer. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 41 NEW LEGISLATION Reliance on other types of information resulting in underpayment of GST 260. In some cases, information that a marketplace operator or redeliverer might use to determine the GST treatment of a supply of goods may be completely unrelated to the residency of an underlying supplier and the delivery address for the supply (if the supply is made through an electronic marketplace) or the amount paid by the recipient for the goods (if the goods are brought to New Zealand by a redeliverer). 261. In situations where reliance on such information results in the marketplace operator or redeliverer underpaying GST, the marketplace operator or redeliverer will be relieved from the liability to return and pay the output tax that should have been paid if the reliance on information provided by the third party was in good faith and on reasonable grounds. Example 42 – misclassification of item by underlying supplier resulting in treatment as exempt supply An item of gold jewellery is listed for sale on the A Co. marketplace. On the basis of the classification of the item by the underlying supplier, A Co. is led to believe that the item is fine metal as defined in section 2(1), and concludes that the supply of the item is exempt from GST. However, it turns out that the item is not fine metal, and therefore GST should have been returned on the supply. Section 60F applies to relieve A Co. from being required to return output tax on the supply, provided that A Co. has relied on the information in good faith and on reasonable grounds (meaning that A Co. did not know that the information relied on was incorrect, nor could have reasonably been expected to know the information was incorrect). Generally speaking, a marketplace operator that does not actually have the goods could not reasonably be expected to know if the classification of an item of gold jewellery by an underlying supplier as “fine metal” is incorrect. However, if a marketplace operator was aware that a particular underlying supplier had a history of misclassifying items for sale, then this may affect whether the marketplace operator had relied on the information on reasonable grounds. Example 43 – reliance on information by marketplace operator not on reasonable grounds DG Book Supplies, a non-resident supplier, sells some university textbooks to Jan (a consumer providing a New Zealand delivery address) over the A Co. marketplace. DG tells A Co. that supplies of educational books are zero-rated for New Zealand GST purposes, which A Co. relies on when determining the GST treatment of the supply to Jan. It is later discovered that the supply to Jan should have been treated as standard-rated (subject to GST at the rate of 15%) and that, as a consequence of relying on the incorrect information provided by DG, A Co. has underpaid GST to Inland Revenue. A Co. does not have a reduction in its output tax under section 60F(2), as it should have known that the information provided by DG was not reliable. A Co. is therefore required to return and pay 3/23 of the consideration for the supply as output tax to Inland Revenue. Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of remote services) (Sections 8(4B), 20(4D) and 25AA) 262. An amendment to the reverse charge rule in section 8(4B) will require GST-registered recipients of distantly taxable goods (that are treated by section 8(4E) as not being supplies in New Zealand) to return output tax if the percentage of intended or actual taxable use of the goods is less than 95 percent of the total use. 263. The amendment also extends the reverse charge to business-to-business supplies of goods that are in New Zealand at the time of supply (which are treated by section 8(4) as not being supplied in New Zealand). 29 Example 44 – application of reverse charge to distantly taxable goods Melissa is a self-employed project manager who is registered for GST. She purchases a phone from a non-resident supplier for NZ$400. At the time of purchase, she identifies herself as a GST-registered person and therefore is not charged GST. She uses the phone fifty percent for her taxable project management services and fifty percent for private use. Under the reverse charge, Melissa is treated as making a taxable supply to herself of NZ$400 at the 15% rate. She must return output tax of NZ$60 (NZ$400 × 15%). If Melissa’s taxable use of the phone had been 95 percent or more, she would not have been required to apply the reverse charge. 29 As this amendment has been inadvertently drafted too widely, officials will seek to include a retrospective amendment in a future taxation bill so that the reverse charge (as it applies to goods) only applies to goods imported by the recipient of the supply in a consignment valued below NZ$1,000, where the recipient did not pay GST to Customs nor to the supplier. A savings provision to protect tax positions taken on the basis of the amendment would be optional for taxpayers to apply. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 42 NEW LEGISLATION 264. An exception (amended section 20(4D)) to the prohibition on input tax deductions in section 20(4C) allows a recipient of distantly taxable goods, that is required to return output tax under the reverse charge, to claim a deduction of input tax (GST paid on goods and services purchased) to the extent that the goods are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Example 45 – input tax on goods subject to the reverse charge Consider Example 44 where Melissa acquires a phone from a non-resident supplier for NZ$400. Melissa can claim an input tax deduction for the portion of her total use of the phone that is for taxable purposes (fifty percent). The amount of the input tax deduction is NZ$30 (NZ$60 of GST × fifty percent). Her net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of NZ$30 (NZ$60 output tax minus NZ$30 input tax). Reverse charge for supplies of NZ$1,000 or less 265. There may be instances when a GST-registered recipient applies the reverse charge and the non-resident supplier also inadvertently charges the recipient GST. In this situation, GST would be returned twice on a single supply (by the non-resident supplier and the GST-registered recipient). This issue will likely be resolved if the non-resident supplier subsequently refunds the GST charged to the GST-registered recipient and makes an adjustment under section 25 as described previously. Note that an adjustment may still be necessary under section 25AA(1)(a)(iii) to ensure the correct amount of tax is accounted for under the reverse charge in section 8(4B). 266. To ensure the correct amount of tax is paid in the alternative scenario where the supplier provides a tax invoice under section 24(5B), existing section 25AA would allow the GST-registered recipient to correct the amount of output tax returned and input tax deductions claimed. The recipient would then be able to claim, in the normal manner, a deduction for the portion of the GST that was charged by the non-resident supplier, to the extent that the goods are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Example 46 – supplier inadvertently charges GST on supply to registered person and recipient applies the reverse charge Consider the earlier example again, where Melissa has applied the reverse charge under section 8(4B). However, she subsequently finds out that the price for the phone included GST at the standard rate of 15% (3 ÷ 23 × NZ$400 = NZ$52.17). Melissa contacts the non-resident supplier and requests a refund for the incorrectly charged GST. Instead of providing a refund, the supplier issues Melissa with a full tax invoice, since the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less. The tax invoice enables Melissa to claim an input tax deduction to the extent the phone is used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies, which means she can deduct NZ$26.09. The non-resident supplier is also not required to make any adjustments under section 25. Under section 25AA(1)(a)(v), Melissa makes an adjustment in the return for the taxable period in which it is discovered that a mistake has been made to correct the amount of output tax and input tax deductions claimed as a result of applying the reverse charge in section 8(4B). Melissa claims a deduction under section 20(3) for the output tax that she accounted for (NZ$60 – section 25AA(2)) and returns output tax for the input tax deduction she claimed earlier (NZ$30 – section 25AA(3)). Administration of the supplier registration system (Sections 5(27), (28), 15(7), 51B(7), 51B(8) and 75(3F) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Sections 24BA(1B) and 143A(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Taxable periods 267. Under amended section 15(6), non-resident suppliers that only supply distantly taxable goods and/or remote services will have calendar quarterly taxable periods (1 April to 30 June, 1 July to 30 September, 1 October to 31 December, and 1 January to 31 March). This is intended to align with these suppliers’ filing obligations in other jurisdictions. 268. However, for the period beginning 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2020, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods will have a taxable period of four months (see new section 15(7)). This initial four-month taxable period will apply to non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods that become liable to register for GST in the period 1 December to 31 December 2019 – including non-residents who also supply remote services to New Zealand-resident consumers but did not register for GST before 1 December 2019 due to being below the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 43 NEW LEGISLATION 269. Section 15E(2) provides that a supplier may apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to have an alternative taxable period end date. Under this provision, the Commissioner may approve an end date that is not more than seven days before or after the last day of a month. Example 47 – alternative taxable period end date Retro Audio is registered for GST as a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods and, from 1 April 2020, will be required to have quarterly taxable periods. Retro Audio does an accounting cut off on 29 March, 28 June, 28 September and 30 December. These accounting periods are all quarters but do not end on the last day of the typical calendar quarter, and it would be expensive for Retro Audio to re-run periods outside of this accounting cycle. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue approves Retro Audio to have an initial four-month taxable period of 1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020, and from 30 March 2020, the following quarterly taxable periods on an ongoing basis: • 30 March to 28 June; • 29 June to 28 September; • 29 September to 30 December; and • 31 December to 29 March. Holding records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English 270. Currently, a GST-registered person must apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for authorisation to keep records at a place outside New Zealand or in a language other than English. Amended section 75(3F) provides an automatic exception to this requirement for non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods or remote services that are subject to GST under either section 8(3)(ab) or (c). Exception from the bank account requirement 271. Section 24BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 generally requires an offshore person to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number. However, subsection (1B) provides an exception to this requirement for a non-resident supplier who requires an IRD number solely because they are a non-resident supplier of goods and services. Consumers and underlying suppliers providing false or misleading information 272. Sections 5(27), 5(28), 51B(7) and 51B(8) provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with discretion to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged, when: • the person (being the recipient of the supply or a non-resident underlying supplier) knowingly provides altered, false or misleading information which has resulted in GST being underpaid; and • the amount of GST is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. 273. In the situation where a consumer provides false or misleading information that results in an underpayment of GST, section 5(27) only applies if the consumer made the misrepresentation with the purpose of avoiding being charged GST or to reduce the amount of GST charged. 274. In addition to the situations where a consumer makes a misrepresentation to a non-resident merchant, marketplace operator or redeliverer, or where a non-resident underlying supplier makes a misrepresentation to a non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace, the provisions cover the situation where a consumer or a non-resident underlying supplier deliberately provides false, altered or misleading information to a New Zealand-resident resident agent, redeliverer or marketplace operator. 275. In cases where discretion is exercised by the Commissioner to require the consumer or underlying supplier to register and pay the GST shortfall, section 5(27)(b)(iii) and (28) set out that the consumer or underlying supplier would be treated as making a supply charged with GST at the rate of 15%. Under amended section 51B, the person is treated as being registered from the date on which the first supply the discretion is exercised for is made (see subsections (7) and (8)). 276. The existing “knowledge offences” also apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information for the purpose of avoiding GST by misrepresenting themselves as a registered business or as a resident of another country (section 143A(1)(c) and (g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to NZ$25,000 for a first-time offence or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 44 NEW LEGISLATION Example 48 – consumer makes misrepresentation that they are registered for GST Luke purchases a number of distantly taxable goods and remote services online, including clothing, nutritional supplements, online dating services, music and movie content. Luke is not registered for GST. To avoid paying GST, Luke continually informs suppliers he is GST registered and provides suppliers with a false GST registration number. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to register Luke from the time the first supply of goods was made or the services were physically performed (whichever is earlier), and requires him to pay the GST that was not charged, plus penalties and interest. 277. Section 5(27)(a) has been amended so that it may apply in the situation where a consumer purchasing a remote service deliberately provides false, altered or misleading information pertaining to his or her location or residency status to avoid being charged GST. Under the former drafting of section 5(27)(a), the provision only applied in the situation where a consumer made a misrepresentation that they were registered for GST in order to avoid having GST charged. 278. If a customer has provided incorrect or misleading information to access content that is geographically restricted, and this consequentially results in GST not being charged, the reverse charge rule in section 5(27) and the existing knowledge offences would not be expected to apply. However, in cases where it is clear that the person made the misrepresentation to avoid being charged GST, the amendment to section 5(27)(a) means that the Commissioner will be able to exercise her discretion to require the person to pay GST if the amount of GST at stake is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. 279. Where distantly taxable goods are treated by section 60C or 60E as having been supplied by an electronic marketplace operator or a redeliverer, the Commissioner’s discretion to require the underlying supplier or the consumer to pay the GST shortfall will only apply if the marketplace operator or redeliverer used a method set out in section 60G or a method agreed with or prescribed by the Commissioner under section 60G(7). 280. This is intended to ensure there is a clear hierarchy where the marketplace operator or redeliverer is the supplier for GST purposes, and therefore incentivises the person to take reasonable precautions to prevent an incorrect GST treatment from arising. 281. Unlike section 5(27), new section 5(28) (which applies to an underlying supplier providing incorrect or misleading information to an operator of an electronic marketplace) does not require the incorrect information to have been provided for the purpose of avoiding GST applying to the supply. This is because the underlying supplier’s intention may be difficult to establish in practice. Example 49 – non-resident underlying supplier makes misrepresentation that they are resident in New Zealand Jave Dordan, a non-resident underlying supplier on the NZ Marketplace website, deliberately provides false information about himself (including using a VPN to fake a New Zealand IP address, providing a false mailing address in New Zealand and falsely stating that the goods are shipped from New Zealand) with the intention of misleading potential customers in New Zealand. The fact that NZ Marketplace will not charge GST on the supply as a result of Jave’s deception is not Jave’s primary objective in making the misrepresentations, but is merely a secondary benefit from Jave’s perspective. After a crackdown on non-resident underlying suppliers misrepresenting themselves as New Zealand businesses, NZ Marketplace discovers that Jave is not a New Zealand tax resident but is in fact a non-resident. As NZ Marketplace previously had no knowledge of Jave’s residency status and had relied in good faith on the information provided by Jave in accordance with the methods prescribed in section 60G(3) to determine Jave’s residency status, NZ Marketplace will not be liable to return GST on supplies made by Jave to consumers in New Zealand prior to Jave’s dishonesty being discovered. NZ Marketplace has an agreement with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that it will provide the Commissioner with the details of underlying suppliers that misrepresent their location or residency status resulting in a significant amount of tax being underpaid. NZ Marketplace provides Inland Revenue with information about Jave, including the value and volume of sales made by Jave on NZ Marketplace. As Jave has deliberately misrepresented his residency status over a long period of time, resulting in a substantial amount of GST due not being returned to Inland Revenue, the Commissioner registers Jave for GST, makes an assessment of the GST due and requires Jave to pay the GST that should have been returned. The fact that Jave did not make the misrepresentations with the purpose of avoiding having GST charged on his sales has no impact on the Commissioner’s ability to apply her discretion. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 45 NEW LEGISLATION Optional rules aimed at reducing costs for suppliers (Sections 8(4F), 10C, 20(3L), 20(3LB) and 85C) Claiming GST deductions for New Zealand expenses 282. Special rules applying to non-resident businesses that do not make any supplies in New Zealand were introduced in 2014 to allow these businesses to claim refunds of GST incurred on business expenses. For the purposes of claiming input tax (GST on purchases), a deduction rule in section 20(3L) allows non-resident businesses registered under section 54B to claim back input tax relating to their worldwide taxable activity (for example, GST incurred in sending employees to a conference in New Zealand). 283. Section 20(3L) has been amended to allow non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and remote services to claim back New Zealand GST incurred on business expenses. 284. Amended section 20(3L) provides that a non-resident person who is registered under section 54B or who is a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods or remote services may deduct input tax to the extent to which the relevant goods and services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies, treating all the supplies made by the person as if they were made and received in New Zealand \[emphasis added\]. 285. This means non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and remote services that have registered under the standard GST registration system as a “pay and claim” registrant will be able to deduct GST they have paid on business inputs sourced from New Zealand suppliers, without being required to “trace” the use of these inputs to making taxable supplies to consumers in New Zealand. 286. This will generally enable these suppliers to deduct GST incurred on inputs used in making supplies to other non-residents or to GST-registered New Zealand businesses. However, input tax cannot be deducted to the extent that the relevant inputs are applied to a private (rather than business) use or are used in making supplies that would be exempt if those supplies were made and received in New Zealand (such as supplies of financial services). 287. A special “attribution rule” will apply in the situation where a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods or remote services imports goods into New Zealand for delivery to another person in New Zealand and pays GST to Customs on the importation of the goods. In this situation, amended section 20(3LB) provides that subsection (3LC) will treat the recipient of the goods as having paid the import GST to Customs, and the non-resident supplier as not having paid the GST to Customs. This prevents the non-resident supplier from being able to make an input tax deduction for the GST paid to Customs. 288. The attribution rule will only apply in the situation where the goods are delivered to a person in New Zealand other than the supplier. If the supplier is the person in New Zealand who receives the goods and is not delivering the goods to another person in New Zealand, the supplier will be able to make an input tax deduction for the GST paid to Customs. Example 50 – application of the attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC) where the non-resident supplier pays the import GST Gordon buys an NZ$1,200 bicycle from Moving Parts, a non-resident bicycle and cycling accessories shop that is registered for GST in New Zealand under the rules for distantly taxable goods. Moving Parts supply the bicycle to Gordon on delivered- duty-paid terms, so that they pay the GST to Customs on Gordon’s behalf. Under the attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC), Moving Parts is not able to claim an input tax deduction for the import GST paid to Customs. 289. The attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC) aims to prevent non-taxation, which would arise if a non-resident making a non-taxable supply of imported goods to a consumer in New Zealand claimed an input tax deduction for the GST paid on importation of the goods to Customs. The following example illustrates this scenario. Example 51 – non-taxation where non-resident supplies high-value imported goods to consumer and pays the import GST Consider the scenario in the previous example, except this time assume that the attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC) does not exist. The supply of the bicycle by Moving Parts to Gordon is not a taxable supply, as the bicycle is outside New Zealand at the time of supply and is not an item of distantly taxable goods (because the estimated customs value of the bicycle is NZ$1,200 and Moving Parts has not made the election to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods, discussed later). Gordon paid NZ$50 to Moving Parts for freight and insurance of the bicycle. Moving Parts pays import GST to Customs of NZ$187.50 (15% of the full landed value of the goods, being NZ$1,250). Moving Parts claims an input tax deduction in its GST return of NZ$187.50 for the import GST under section 20(3L), resulting in non-taxation of a supply to a consumer in New Zealand. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 46 NEW LEGISLATION 290. Section 11A(1)(x) – which has applied since the start of the GST on remote services rules in October 2016 – currently allows non-resident suppliers to zero-rate their supplies of remote services to GST-registered New Zealand businesses. This allows non-resident remote services suppliers to claim back GST on inputs used for making supplies to GST-registered businesses. 291. Section 11A(1)(x) has been retained as a legacy provision, so that non-resident suppliers of remote services who are accustomed to zero-rating these supplies and wish to continue what they are doing at present may do so. However, if they wish to, non-resident suppliers of remote services can use the input tax deduction rule in section 20(3L) as an alternative to zero-rating their business-to-business supplies of remote services. Option to charge GST on high-value goods 292. Distinguishing between low-value goods (items individually having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less) and high-value goods (items with an estimated customs value above NZ$1,000) may create complexity for suppliers. To minimise compliance costs, suppliers who are required under the new rules to charge GST on low-value goods supplied to consumers in New Zealand will be able to elect to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable if certain conditions are met. These requirements are outlined below. 293. New section 10C provides that a supplier (referred to in the section as the “electing supplier”) may elect to treat goods that individually have an estimated customs value exceeding NZ$1,000 as distantly taxable goods if all the following conditions are met: • the Commissioner has not before the date the election is made by the supplier cancelled a previous election by the supplier to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable goods (see subsection (1)(a)); • the supplier notifies the Commissioner of the election before the start of the first taxable period that it is intended to be effective for (see subsection (1)(b)); and • at the time of the election, there are reasonable grounds for believing that 75 percent or more of the total value of distantly taxable goods that the supplier will supply in the 12-month period, starting on the first day that the supplier intends the election to be effective for, will consist of items having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less (see subsection (2)(a)). 294. The “reasonable grounds” test described above implicitly requires an electing supplier to firstly assume that it will have made an effective election for the initial year – meaning that for the purposes of determining whether the 75 percent threshold is met, the supplier should include high-value goods supplied to customers in New Zealand (both consumers and GST-registered businesses) in the “total value of distantly taxable goods supplied by the electing supplier to places in New Zealand”. 295. Having made the above starting assumption, the test then requires the electing supplier to determine whether it is reasonable to believe that the total value of its low-value goods supplied to customers in New Zealand during the 12-month period will be at least 75 percent of the total value of the distantly taxable goods that it will supply in the initial year. 296. The reasonable grounds requirement referred to above means different things for different types of electing suppliers: • For an electing supplier who is a merchant, or an electing supplier who is a redeliverer treated by section 60E as the supplier of low-value goods that it brings to New Zealand: The reasonable grounds requirement means the electing supplier has a reasonable belief that 75 percent or more of the total value of goods that it will bring (or assist in bringing) to New Zealand in the initial year of the election will consist of items that individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. • For an electing supplier who is an operator of a marketplace (and who is treated by either of sections 60C or 60D as the supplier of low-value goods sold through its marketplace by non-resident underlying suppliers): The reasonable grounds requirement above means the marketplace operator has a reasonable belief that 75 percent or more of the total value of goods that would be purchased on the marketplace in the initial year of the election, and supplied by non-resident underlying suppliers to customers in New Zealand, will consist of items that individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 297. In either case, the electing supplier should not include alcohol or tobacco products for the purposes of assessing whether the 75 percent test is met. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 47 NEW LEGISLATION Example 52 – merchant making election under self-assessed 75 percent test Big Ben’s Bikes, an online British bike, bike parts and bike accessories store, sells and ships goods from its warehouse in London to customers around the world. Big Ben’s Bikes wishes to treat its high value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers as distantly taxable from the start of their first taxable period, being 1 December 2019. Big Ben’s Bikes sold £78,000 worth of low-value imported goods to customers in New Zealand in the year 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. Big Ben’s Bikes also sold £22,000 worth of high-value imported goods to New Zealand customers in that year. Therefore, 78 percent of the total value of goods that Big Ben’s Bikes sold to customers in New Zealand that year consisted of goods individually valued at or below NZ$1,000. This percentage is typical of Big Ben’s Bikes’ annual sales to New Zealand customers (in previous years, Big Ben’s Bikes’ sales of goods valued at or below NZ$1,000 as a proportion of its total sales to New Zealand customers have been within the range of 76 percent to 80 percent). Based on this historical information and without any information to suggest that this percentage is likely to be less than 75 percent for the 12-month period beginning 1 December 2019, it is reasonable to assume that Big Ben’s Bikes meets the 75 percent test. On this basis, Big Ben’s Bikes self-assesses that it is eligible to make the election and notifies Inland Revenue that they will be charging GST on supplies of high-value goods under the self-assessed test. Example 53 – marketplace operator making election under self-assessed 75 percent test A Co. is an operator of an electronic marketplace who wishes to make the election to charge GST on high-value goods supplied by non-residents through its marketplace. Data from previous years shows that, low-value goods make up well over 80 percent of the total value of goods sold by non-resident underlying suppliers on the A Co. marketplace to customers in New Zealand (including goods that are shipped from a location within New Zealand if A Co. has determined that the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident). A Co. has no reason to expect that this percentage will drop below 75 percent for the period 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020. On this basis, A Co. determines that they are eligible to make the election and notifies Inland Revenue that they will be charging GST on supplies of high-value goods under the self-assessed test. Example 54 – redeliverer making election under self-assessed 75 percent test Redeliverer Co. wishes to make the election under section 10C to charge GST on the high-value goods they bring to New Zealand from overseas. Based on data from previous years, Redeliverer Co. estimates that approximately 90 percent of the value of the goods that they brought to New Zealand in a typical year (including any amounts for freight and insurance charged by the overseas merchant) consisted of low-value goods. Redeliverer Co. has a reasonable expectation that they will easily exceed the 75 percent threshold for the 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020 year. Redeliverer Co determines that they are eligible to make the election and notifies Inland Revenue that they will be charging GST on high-value goods under the self-assessed test. 298. Suppliers making the election under the self-assessed test will need to notify Inland Revenue. Operators of marketplaces that decide to charge GST on their supplies of high-value goods will also need to let their underlying suppliers know (as some non-resident underlying suppliers might already be returning GST on their sales if the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply). 299. An electing supplier who is a non-resident that is not already registered for GST in New Zealand may notify Inland Revenue of the election by answering “yes” to the question in the IR994 registration form about whether they intend to make the election to charge GST on high-value goods and meet the 75 percent test. 300. An electing supplier that is already registered for GST (under the ordinary GST rules or under the GST rules applying to remote services) may notify Inland Revenue of the election by emailing info.lvg@ird.govt.nz with “Election” in the subject line of the email. 301. Section 10C(2)(b) provides that the Commissioner may allow a supplier to make an election to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods, even if the self-assessed 75 percent test outlined above is not met. 302. The Commissioner will exercise this discretion if she considers that doing so will not undermine the integrity of the tax system, taking the following factors into account: • whether the electing supplier and any associated persons have a good history of previous compliance with New Zealand tax legislation and the tax laws of countries and territories outside New Zealand; Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 48 NEW LEGISLATION • the total value of high-value goods supplied by the electing supplier to New Zealand consumers; and • any other relevant factors. 303. The ability for the Commissioner to allow suppliers to charge GST on high-value goods supplied to consumers recognises that the costs to a supplier in configuring their point-of-sale systems to distinguish between low-value and high-value goods may be disproportionate to any potential revenue risk from allowing the supplier to charge GST on high-value goods (effectively replacing the collection of GST on these goods by Customs), even if the 75 percent test is not met. 304. In this situation, the Commissioner may be satisfied that it is appropriate to allow the supplier to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods to consumers if the supplier has a good tax compliance history. Alternatively, if the supplier does not have a tax compliance history that the Commissioner is aware of, the Commissioner may be satisfied that it is appropriate to exercise the discretion if the value of the supplier’s sales of high-value imported goods to consumers in New Zealand is not significant. 305. In practice, there will be a general presumption in favour of exercising the discretion unless there is information available to Inland Revenue which suggests that allowing a particular supplier to charge GST on its high-value goods may result in a revenue risk. Example 55 – exercise of Commissioner’s discretion Dapper Menswear is a non-resident supplier of designer European menswear. Dapper Menswear wishes to treat their supplies of high-value goods to consumers in New Zealand as distantly taxable, and intends that this election be effective from the start of their first taxable period, being 1 December 2019. Dapper Menswear undertakes some analysis of the composition of their sales to customers in New Zealand over the past year. They find that they sold NZ$70,000 worth of low-value goods to customers in New Zealand in the past year. They also sold NZ$30,000 worth of high-value goods to New Zealand customers in that year. Therefore, only 70 percent of Dapper Menswear’s supplies of goods in that year were low-value goods. Given that Dapper Menswear expects the composition of its sales to New Zealand customers to be much the same in the period 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020, Dapper Menswear does not have a reasonable expectation that the 75 percent test will be met. Dapper Menswear applies to the Commissioner to be allowed to charge GST on their supplies of high-value goods. In considering the application, the Commissioner looks at whether Dapper Menswear (including any associated entities) has a compliance history for New Zealand tax purposes and finds there is none. However, according to information that the Commissioner has obtained under double tax agreements from overseas jurisdictions that have similar rules, Dapper Menswear has registered for VAT/GST in those other jurisdictions. There is no evidence available to the Commissioner to suggest that Dapper Menswear is not fully compliant with the tax laws in those other jurisdictions, so the Commissioner does not consider that Dapper Menswear poses any significant compliance risk. Further, the total value of supplies of high-value goods made to New Zealand customers annually by Dapper Menswear (approximately NZ$30,000) is relatively small. On this basis, the Commissioner exercises her discretion to allow Dapper Menswear to make the election to charge GST on supplies of high-value goods to consumers. 306. Under section 10C(2), an election to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable is effective from the first day of the initial taxable period that the supplier intends the election to be effective for until the election is cancelled. 307. Cancellation of an election may be initiated upon request by the supplier or, if certain conditions are met, the Commissioner may unilaterally cancel a supplier’s election. 308. If a supplier who has made an election requests that the election be cancelled, new section 10C(5)(a) provides that the Commissioner may cancel the election by notifying the supplier of the date on which the election ends. 309. In the situation where the Commissioner unilaterally cancels an election by a supplier (in cases of non-compliance by the supplier), section 10C(5)(b) provides that the Commissioner is required to: • notify the electing supplier of the date of the proposed cancellation and the reasons for the proposed cancellation; • consider any arguments against the proposed cancellation that are provided by the electing supplier within 30 days from the date of notification, or within a shorter or longer period if the Commissioner considers that period is appropriate in the circumstances; and • notify the supplier of the date on which the election is cancelled. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 49 NEW LEGISLATION Option to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses 310. Under new section 8(4F), a non-resident supplier will be able to elect to treat a supply of distantly taxable goods to a GST- registered business as a supply made in New Zealand, provided that: • at the time of the election, the non-resident supplier reasonably expects that more than 50 percent of the value of the supplies they make to customers in New Zealand during the 12-month period from the election will be made to persons who are not GST-registered; and • the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less. 311. Under new section 24(5BB), a non-resident supplier is required to provide a tax invoice if the supplier has chosen to apply section 8(4F) to the supply so that the supply is treated as made in New Zealand. 30 312. These amendments are aimed at allowing non-resident suppliers to simply charge GST on low-value supplies (regardless of the business-to-consumer or business-to-business nature of the supply) and issue a tax invoice to the customer at the time of supply or shortly after. As discussed earlier at \[197\] to \[200\], non-resident suppliers exercising this option will be able to issue a single document that meets the requirements of both a full tax invoice and a receipt required under section 24BAB to be issued to a consumer for a supply of distantly taxable goods. 313. While non-resident suppliers are able to choose to provide a tax invoice for a supply of distantly taxable goods under section 24(5B) if the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less, this only applies in the situation where GST is inadvertently charged on the supply – meaning that the tax invoice would be issued to the recipient following a request for a tax invoice or a refund of the GST (as opposed to the supplier being able to proactively issue the recipient with a tax invoice in anticipation of the possibility that the recipient may be GST-registered). 314. Therefore, the ability to elect to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses may reduce compliance costs for both non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and New Zealand businesses making low-value purchases from these suppliers, as the GST-registered recipient would be able to use the tax invoice to support an input tax deduction without needing to interact with the supplier any further. 315. Given the amendments allow non-resident suppliers to charge GST on low-value supplies and issue a tax invoice to the customer at the time of supply if they decide that works best for them, there is no requirement for the non-resident supplier to inform Inland Revenue of the election or to keep records that the election was made. The amendments merely validate the supplier’s treatment of a low-value supply in the situation where the supplier has charged GST and proactively issued a tax invoice, and it transpires that the supply was to a GST-registered business using the goods in its taxable activity. 316. Consistent with the rule in section 24(5B), if the value of the supply exceeds NZ$1,000, the non-resident supplier should not issue a tax invoice, and the recipient of the supply will not be entitled to make an input tax deduction. This means that, if the value of the supply is above NZ$1,000, the receipt or invoice issued to the recipient should not include the phrase “tax invoice”. In this situation, the supplier’s only option is to refund the GST charged, if it transpires that GST was charged on a supply to a GST-registered business using the goods and services in its taxable activity. Example 56 – non-resident supplier elects to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses under section 8(4F) Good Books is an online book retailer resident in Hong Kong. Good Books is registered for GST in New Zealand as a supplier of distantly taxable goods to consumers. Good Books’ sales to customers in New Zealand total around NZ$10 million a year, excluding GST, of which it estimates that around NZ$2 million a year are to GST-registered businesses. Based on this historical average of around 80 percent of the value of its sales to New Zealand customers being to persons who are not registered for GST (which Good Books expects will continue going forward), Good Books has a reasonable expectation that more than 50 percent of the value of the sales it will make to customers in New Zealand in the next 12 months will be to customers who are not GST-registered. Good Books sells two books valued at NZ$40 each (excluding GST) to a customer providing a delivery address in New Zealand and charges NZ$20 plus GST for shipping. As the estimated customs value of each item (NZ$40) is less than NZ$1,000, Good Books determines that the supply is of distantly taxable goods and charges GST of NZ$15, based on the value of the supply of NZ$100 (2 books at NZ$40 each + NZ$20 shipping = NZ$100, 15% of NZ$100 = NZ$15). 30 Although the intention is that the tax invoice issued by the supplier should meet the requirements of a full tax invoice, the legislation as enacted does not require this. Officials will seek to include an amendment to section 24(4)(g) in a future tax bill so that a tax invoice issued under new section 24(5BB) is required to be a full tax invoice, consistent with the rule in section 24(5B). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 50 NEW LEGISLATION In the event that the supply is to a GST-registered business, Good Books intends that the goods are treated as supplied in New Zealand under section 8(4F) (subject to GST). Since the value of the supply excluding GST (NZ$100) is less than NZ$1,000, the treatment of the sale as a taxable supply is correct (even if the customer is a GST-registered business, as section 8(4F) will apply in this scenario). Good Books issues the recipient with a receipt at the time of supply containing the following particulars: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place (see section 24(3)(a)); • Good Books’ name and GST registration number (see sections 24(3)(b) and 24BAB(2)(a)); • the name and address of the recipient (see section 24(3)(c)); • the date the receipt was issued (which in this case is the same as the date of supply – see sections 24(3)(d) and 24BAB(2)(b) and (c)); • a description of the goods and services supplied, along with the quantity or volume (see section 24(3)(e) and (f), and section 24BAB(2)(d)); • the consideration for the supply excluding tax (NZ$100), the amount of tax included (NZ$15), and the consideration inclusive of tax (NZ$115) (see sections 24(3)(g)(i) and 24BAB(2)(e); and • information indicating the items for which the amount of tax included is zero or more than zero (in this example, GST was charged on all the items in the supply, so information indicating that tax was included for all the items will suffice – see section 24BAB(2)(f) and (g)). The receipt meets the requirements of section 24(3) for a full tax invoice, so if the recipient of the supply is a GST-registered business intending to use the goods and services purchased for making taxable supplies, they will be able to make an input tax deduction in their GST return. The receipt also meets the requirements of section 24BAB(2) for a receipt required to be issued for the purposes of preventing double taxation on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a consumer. Example 57 – prohibition on issuing a tax invoice for a high-value supply of distantly taxable goods Consider Good Books in the previous example again. Good Books sell 20 items valued at NZ$50 each (excluding GST) to a recipient providing a delivery address in New Zealand and charges NZ$40 plus GST for shipping. As the estimated customs value of each item (NZ$50) is less than NZ$1,000, Good Books determines that the supply is of distantly taxable goods and charges GST of NZ$156, based on the value of the supply of NZ$1,040 (20 books at NZ$50 each + NZ$40 shipping = NZ$1,040, 15% of NZ$1,040 = NZ$156). As the value of the supply excluding GST (NZ$1,040) is over NZ$1,000, Good Books issues a receipt to the recipient with the words “tax invoice” omitted. Because the document is not a valid tax invoice (and because of the deduction prohibition rule for supplies valued over NZ$1,000 in section 20(4C)), the recipient cannot make an input tax deduction even if they are registered for GST and will use the supply in their taxable activity. The recipient is registered for GST and intends to use the goods wholly for making taxable supplies. However, because the document issued by Good Books is not a valid tax invoice (and because of the deduction prohibition rule for high-value supplies of distantly taxable goods by non-residents), the GST-registered recipient contacts Good Books to ask for a refund of the GST. 317. In deciding whether the election to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses might be a useful option, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods may want to consider the following questions: • Is it reasonably likely that at least 50 percent of the value of the sales that you will make to New Zealand customers in the next 12 months will be to customers that are not registered for GST? • In the context of your business, is it likely that any given sale of goods to a customer in New Zealand will always have a value below NZ$1,000 (excluding GST)? If not, are your business systems capable of issuing different documentation for supplies valued at NZ$1,000 or less, versus supplies valued above NZ$1,000? Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 51 NEW LEGISLATION Transitional rule for fixed-term contracts entered into before 1 December 318. Section 85C contains a new transitional provision similar to the transitional rule under section 85B, which was provided for the introduction of GST on remote services in 2016. The new transitional provision applies: • to contracts for distantly taxable goods that are for a fixed term and entered into before 1 December 2019; and • to periodic payments made under the contract that are treated under section 9(3)(a) as successive supplies; 31 and • if the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement (this covers contracts that are entered into during a month and end a year later at the end of the month); and • if the non-resident supplier elects that the transitional provision applies. 319. The transitional provision allows a non-resident supplier to treat distantly taxable goods provided under the contract as not being successively supplied under section 9(3), and therefore, those payments made after 1 December 2019 would not be subject to GST. This transitional rule would only apply for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into, whichever is earlier. After that time, section 9(3) would usually apply and treat periodic payments as being successive supplies when the payments become due or are received, whichever is earlier. Example 58 – contract for magazine subscription entered into before 1 December 2019 Rosalie purchases a subscription to a Canadian model train collectors’ magazine for a 12-month period on 15 August 2019 and opts to pay the subscription in monthly instalments. The non-resident supplier is able to treat those monthly instalments as not being successively supplied under section 9(3) and, therefore, payments made after 1 December 2019 will not be subject to GST up until the 12-month contract ends. 31 The transitional provision should also apply to periodic payments made under the contract that are treated under section 9(3)(aa) as successive supplies. Officials will seek to correct this cross-referencing error in a future taxation bill. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 52 NEW LEGISLATION Ring-fencing of residential property deductions Subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007 New subpart EL introduces rules to ring-fence deductions for residential properties to income from those properties. To the extent the deductions exceed the income, they cannot be used against income from other sources, such as salary and wages. Instead, the excess deductions will be carried forward for use against residential property income in future years. The residential ring-fencing rules apply from the start of the 2019–20 income year. In addition to the ring-fencing rules, new subpart EL contains former sections DB 18A and DB 18AB in rewritten form (section EL 20). Background Rental property investors can deduct interest and other expenses (other than capital improvements) as these expenses relate to earning taxable rental income. In many cases, these expenses exceed the rental income, so the rental activity is loss-making although the overall investment may still be profitable due to the tax-free capital gains that may be realised on the sale of the property. Most rental property investors hold their property on capital account, so the gains made on sale would not be subject to tax. Before the introduction of these rules, loss-making investors could use the excess deductions from their rental properties to offset their income from other sources (such as salary and wages), thus reducing their income tax liability. The Government considered that this created an uneven playing field between property investors who are buying property in anticipation of capital gains, and home buyers. Investors with loss-making rental properties were able to have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by reduced tax on other income sources, helping them to outbid home buyers. The new residential ring-fencing rules are aimed at making the tax system fairer, and improving housing affordability for owner- occupiers by levelling the playing field between property investors and home buyers. Key features Under the rules in new subpart EL of the Income Tax Act, deductions for residential properties are ring-fenced to income from those properties (including any income on disposal). This effectively means that investors are no longer able to offset residential property losses against their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income), to reduce their tax liability. To the extent the deductions exceed the income, they will be carried forward for use against residential property income in future years. • The rules apply to “residential land”, using the same definition of “residential land” that already exists for the bright-line test. The rules do not apply (provided criteria are met) to: • the taxpayer’s main home; • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules; • property that will be taxed on sale (subject to notification requirements for some taxpayers); • property owned by companies other than close companies; • employee accommodation; and • Government enterprises. The default position is that the rules apply on a portfolio basis, meaning that investors calculate their overall profit or loss across their portfolio. The income from all properties in the portfolio is offset by deductions for all properties. However, investors are able to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they wish. When using the property- by-property approach, each property is looked at separately and deductions for one are not able to offset income from another. If the property-by-property approach is taken, and it transpires that the sale of the property is taxed, any remaining excess deductions are released from the ring-fencing rules and used against the taxpayer’s income from other sources. Residential property deductions are allocated to an income year up to the total of the taxpayer’s “residential income”. This includes residential rental income and net residential land sale income from the property or portfolio (depending on which basis the rules are applied on). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 53 NEW LEGISLATION To the extent the taxpayer’s residential property deductions exceed their “residential income” in a year, they cannot be used as deductions in that year. The excess deductions will instead be carried forward to the next year the taxpayer derives residential income, and added to the taxpayer’s deductions for the property or portfolio in that year. There are rules to prevent interposed entities being used to circumvent the deduction ring-fencing rules. These will apply where a taxpayer has borrowed money to acquire an interest in an entity that is a “residential land-rich entity” for a particular income year. An entity will be residential land-rich if more than 50% of its assets for the income year are residential land. Application dates The residential ring-fencing rules apply from the start of the 2019-20 income year. As section EL 20 is replacing previously existing bright-line provisions, it applies from the relevant dates for the 2-year and 5-year bright-line test, respectively. Detailed analysis Property subject to the rules The rules apply to “residential land”, using the same definition of “residential land” in section YA 1 that already exists for the bright-line test. “Residential land” means: • land that has a dwelling on it; • land there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on; or • bare land that, under the relevant operative district plan rules, may have a dwelling built on it. However, even if one of these criteria is met, land is not residential land if it is: • used predominantly as business premises; or • farmland. The business premises and farmland exclusions from the definition of “residential land” are discussed in detail in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28 No 1 (February 2016, Inland Revenue). Overseas property The definition of “residential land” is not limited to land in New Zealand – it extends to overseas land. This was considered appropriate for the bright-line test, and the same approach is taken for the ring-fencing rules. This is because it would not be equitable for deductions for loss-making overseas residential rental investments to be able to be offset against income in New Zealand, but deductions from loss-making domestic residential rental investments not to be. Property excluded from the rules Main home A taxpayer may use their home in part to earn income, so a portion of their property-related expenses may be deductible. As the focus of the rules is on loss-making rental properties, a taxpayer’s main home is specifically excluded from the scope of the rules. To qualify for the exclusion from the ring-fencing rules (in section EL 9), the property has to be used predominantly as the person’s main home for most of the particular income year. The concept of a “main home” in section EL 9 is the same as for the bright-line test. This means that a person can have only one main home. If a person has more than one house, as with the bright-line test, their main home will be the property they have the greatest connection with. There is detailed guidance in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28 No 1 (February 2016, Inland Revenue) on determining which property a person has the greatest connection with. A significant number of family homes in New Zealand are owned by family trusts. The “main home” exclusion therefore ensures that a home owned by a trust can be regarded as a main home. Like with the bright-line rules, a dwelling owned by a trust is only considered a main home (so not subject to the ring-fencing rules) if it is the main home for a beneficiary of the trust, provided that a principal settlor of the trust does not have a different main home. This restriction ensures that trust ownership cannot be used to claim multiple properties as main homes, and so not subject to the ring-fencing rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 54 NEW LEGISLATION The criteria for the main home exclusion are generally the same as for the main home exclusion from the bright-line test. As such, Inland Revenue guidance on the bright-line main home exclusion is also relevant in determining what constitutes a main home for the purposes of the rental ring-fencing rules. However, in the context of the ring-fencing rules, the period looked at is the particular income year rather than the whole period of ownership. Mixed-use assets The definition of “residential land” includes holiday houses, which may be used privately and also sometimes rented out. Many such properties would be subject to the mixed-use asset rules, which set out a specific formula for calculating deductible expenditure. Notwithstanding the way expenditure is apportioned under those rules, a mixed-use asset can still be loss-making. This is more likely to occur when the income-earning use of the asset is low. Therefore, the mixed-use assets rules quarantine (or ring-fence) deductions in excess of income from a mixed-use asset where the income-earning use of the asset is low. Because the mixed-use asset rules already contain their own quarantine (or ring-fencing) rules, property that is an asset for the purposes of the mixed-use asset rules (defined in section DG 3) is not subject to the residential ring-fencing rules. This exclusion is provided for in section EL 12. Property that will be taxed on sale The ring-fencing rules will not apply to land that will be taxed on sale regardless of when it is sold. This exclusion is provided for in section EL 10. Where land will be taxed on sale, there is not the same concern about some of the deductible expenses relating to untaxed gains, as all economic income from the investment will be taxed. If the land will be taxed on sale under section CB 7 because it is held in a dealing, development, subdivision, or building business, there are no notification requirements for the exclusion to apply. However, if the land will be taxed on sale under another provision (such as if it was acquired with the intention of resale), the exclusion from the ring-fencing rules is only available if the taxpayer: • notifies the Commissioner that the land is held on revenue account; and • is able to separately identify the deductions relating to the land (except in the situation noted below). Where the notification to the Commissioner is required for the exclusion to apply, the notification needs to be made by the date for filing the return of income for the later of: • the income year the land is acquired (for example, if the sale will be taxed under section CB 6); • the income year it becomes known that the land will be taxed on sale regardless of when the sale occurs (for example, if the sale will be taxed under section CB 12 or CB 13); or • the 2019-20 income year (for land that was held at the start of the 2019-20 income year and was on revenue account). The requirement for the taxpayer to be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the land does not apply if all of the taxpayer’s residential land (other than land within the main home, mixed-use asset or employee accommodation exclusions) was or will be subject to tax on sale, and they have notified the Commissioner that the land is on revenue account by the relevant notification date. Property owned by companies other than close companies and Government enterprises The ring-fencing rules do not apply to land owned by companies other than close companies (section EL 11). Close companies are, in general terms, companies with five or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50% – with associated persons being treated as one person. For example, a typical family company. The exclusion for companies other than close companies avoids creating compliance costs for companies that hold residential land incidentally to their business (for example, as sites for future development), where there is not the same mischief of offsetting property losses against labour or other income with the expectation of tax-free capital gains. Similarly, the mischief the ring-fencing rules are aimed at is not present for Government enterprises. As such, the rules do not apply to the Government enterprises listed in schedule 36 of the Income Tax Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 55 NEW LEGISLATION Employee accommodation There is also an exclusion from the rules for residential land that a taxpayer provides to their employees or other workers for accommodation in connection with their employment or service (section EL 13). However, the employee accommodation exclusion in section EL 13 does not apply if the employees or other workers are associated with the owner of the land, unless it is necessary to provide the accommodation due to the nature or remoteness of the owner’s business. Again, the rationale behind this exclusion is to avoid creating compliance costs for businesses where the mischief the ring- fencing rules are seeking to address is not present. Example 1 – Accommodation provided to associated employee Bill is a farm manager. He is provided with accommodation at a house on a nearby property (which is not farmland), given the remote location of the farm and work hours required. Other farm workers are also provided with accommodation in the area. The farming business is owned by a company, which also owns the house Bill is provided with and the other residential land with the accommodation for employees and contractors. Bill and the company are associated persons. The accommodation is provided to the workers in connection with their employment or service. The land with the accommodation provided to the non-associated workers is therefore within the employee accommodation exclusion (section EL 13(1)). Because Bill is associated with the company, there is a further requirement for the exclusion for employee accommodation to apply. This is that it is necessary to provide the accommodation due to the nature or remoteness of the business carried on by the company. That requirement is met because of the work hours required and the remote location of the farm. Income residential property deductions can be used against Residential property deductions are allocated to a particular income year up to the total of the taxpayer’s “residential income” for that year. If the default portfolio basis is used, this includes: (a) residential rental income from the portfolio; (b) net income from the sale of residential land in the portfolio; (c) depreciation recovery income in relation to the portfolio; and (d) net income from residential land that is outside the rules because it is held on revenue account. If the property-by-property basis is used, “residential income” referred to in (a) to (c) above includes only amounts from the particular property. To the extent the taxpayer’s residential property deductions exceed their “residential income”, they cannot be used as a deduction for that year. The excess deductions will instead be carried forward to the next year the taxpayer derives residential income, and added to the taxpayer’s deductions for the property or portfolio in that year. What if the taxpayer is in an overall loss position, but has made a profit from their residential property? If a taxpayer has made an overall loss in a particular income year but has made a profit on the residential rental activity, any ring- fenced residential property deductions they have from prior years would be able to be used against those profits. This is because the deductions are used against residential income, not the taxpayer’s overall net income. This will have the effect of reducing the amount of deductions that are ring-fenced. Portfolio or property-by-property basis Applying the rules on a portfolio basis The default position under section EL 4 is that the ring-fencing rules apply on a portfolio basis. Under this approach, investors calculate their overall profit or loss across all the properties in their portfolio. The income from all properties in the portfolio is offset by deductions for all properties. Example 2 – Applying the rules on the default portfolio basis Minerva owns two residential rental properties. She applies the ring-fencing rules on the default portfolio basis. In the 2019- 20 income year, one property returned gross rental income of $20,000 and deductions for that property were $12,000. The second property returned $25,000 gross rental income and deductions for that property were $30,000. In her tax return, Minerva will include $45,000 gross rental income. She can use all $42,000 of the deductions for the portfolio in that year; none of the deductions are ring-fenced. Minerva will have net rental income of $3,000 from the portfolio. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 56 NEW LEGISLATION Applying the rules on a property-by-property basis Alternatively, taxpayers can elect to apply the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis (section EL 6). This approach can be elected for one or more of the taxpayer’s residential rental properties, even if they own other properties which are part of a portfolio. When using the property-by-property approach, each property is looked at separately and deductions for one are not able to be offset against income from another. However, if this approach is taken, and it transpires that the sale of the property is taxed (for example, under the bright-line test), any remaining excess deductions are released from the ring-fencing rules and used against the taxpayer’s income from other sources. The election is made by the taxpayer taking a tax position in their return that reflects deductions for the particular property only being used against income from that property. Expenditure to which any deductions relate must relate solely to the particular property. So if, for example, there is some expenditure that related to more than one property (eg, interest on a loan used for two properties) the property-by-property basis could not be used. To apply the rules on a property-by-property basis, a taxpayer needs to take a tax position consistent with this approach in their return of income for the income year in which the property becomes their residential rental property (or, for property held at the start of the 2019-20 income year, in their return for that year). The election remains in effect so long as the taxpayer continues to take a position in their tax returns that is consistent with applying the rules on a property-by-property basis. If the taxpayer changes their tax position, the property becomes a portfolio basis property from that year. The position a taxpayer takes in their return may be the same on both a portfolio or property-by-property approach – for example, if all of the taxpayer’s properties are profitable, or if they are all non-profitable. However, if a taxpayer has had more than one property that could comprise a portfolio, and the sale of a particular property is taxed, any remaining unused excess deductions for the property would only be released from the ring-fencing rules if the taxpayer has determined the deductions allowed for the property in each year based on income, expenditure and losses that related solely to the property. The returns for all years would need to be consistent with this – for example in any year there was a mix of profitable and non-profitable properties, or if there was any expenditure that did not solely relate to the property. Example 3 – Applying the rules on a property-by-property basis Riley owns three residential rental properties. He applies the ring-fencing rules on the default portfolio basis for two of the properties (A and B). He elects to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis for the third property (C). Riley decided to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis for property C because he was associated with a land developer when he acquired property C, so if he ends up selling it within 10 years the sale will be taxed. In the 2019-20 income year, the portfolio properties (A and B) returned combined gross rental income of $50,000. Deductions for those properties totalled $45,000. Property C returned gross rental income of $20,000, and deductible expenses for that property totalled $23,000. In his 2019-20 income tax return, Riley includes net rental income of $5,000 from the two portfolio properties (A and B). He can use $20,000 of the deductions for property C. The remaining $3,000 of deductions from property C cannot be used against the income from the portfolio properties (A and B) or against any other income Riley has. The $3,000 of excess deductions from property C are carried forward to the next income year and added to the deductions for property C in that year. If property C ends up being taxed on sale, the net profit or loss for that specific property would be known, and any ring- fenced deductions in excess of the net income from the sale will be released and used against any other income Riley has. What basis is used when the property is owned by a look-through company (LTC) or a partnership? LTC s If the residential property is owned by an LTC, whatever basis the LTC has applied the ring-fencing rules on in filing its return will flow through to and be binding on the shareholders (section HB 1(6)). So if an LTC applied the rules on a portfolio basis and the portfolio was loss-making overall, any shareholder who directly held other residential property subject to the ring-fencing rules would be able to use their share of the deductions that flow through from the LTC against their total residential income. This would include their residential income from the LTC and any other residential income they derive. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 57 NEW LEGISLATION If an LTC applies the rules on a property-by-property basis, the shareholders have to also take that approach in their returns. This would mean, for example, that if residential deductions for the property exceeded the residential income from the property, the shareholder could only use their share of the deductions up to their share of the income from the property. Their excess deductions would not be able to be used against residential income from another property (eg, one they own directly). Partnerships This is not the case for partners in partnerships, as there is no provision equivalent to section HB 1(6) for partnerships. If a partnership has filed a partnership return applying the rules on a particular basis, the partners do not necessarily need to apply the rules on that same basis. And different partners in the partnership may potentially apply the ring-fencing rules on different bases in respect of their share of the residential income and deductions. The position each partner takes in their tax return will either be consistent with them applying the rules on a property-by-property basis, therefore meeting the election requirement in section EL 6(4), or it will not, which would mean the property would become included in a portfolio for them (section EL 6(5)). However, any partner applying the rules on a property-by-property basis must have determined the deductions for the property able to be used in each year based only on income, expenditure and losses that related solely to the property. If, for example, the partnership had two residential properties with intermingled expenses that related to both the properties, none of the partners could apply the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis for the partnership properties. Use of ring-fenced deductions when properties are sold Sale of an individual basis property There may still be unused ring-fenced deductions for a rental property after it is sold. In some circumstances these may be released from the ring-fencing rules (or unfenced), meaning they can then be used against the taxpayer’s income from any source. If a taxpayer sells a property to which they have applied the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis and the sale is not taxed, the unused deductions would remain ring-fenced. They would be carried forward to any future year in which the taxpayer derives residential income from another property, at which point they would be treated as transferred to that property. However, if the sale of the property was taxed, any remaining unused excess deductions (if not already completely used to offset the taxable income from the sale) will be unfenced (section EL 7(2)). This means the excess deductions are no longer subject to the ring-fencing rules, and will offset any income the taxpayer has from other sources in the year of the sale. If the taxpayer does not have other income, or not enough to fully utilise the deductions, they will have an overall net loss, which will be carried forward and used against any future income. That said, if there have been unused deductions transferred to the property from a previous rental property, the amount that is unfenced will be reduced by the amount of the transferred deductions (section EL 8(2) and (3)). Example 4 – Taxed sale of individual basis property Nikita has three residential rental properties – two in a portfolio (properties A and B), and one which he applies the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis for (property C). He also has salary income of $70,000. Property C has accumulated ring-fenced deductions of $80,000. Nikita decides to sell property C. The sale is taxed, and gives rise to a net gain of $60,000. Nikita uses $60,000 of the ring-fenced deductions against the net sale income from property C. Because Nikita has applied the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis for this property, the remaining excess deductions of $20,000 are unfenced and used against Nikita’s salary income. Sale of all properties in a portfolio Similarly, if all of the properties that have been in a taxpayer’s residential portfolio are sold, there may potentially still be unused ring-fenced deductions. If the sale of each of the properties that were in the portfolio was taxed, any remaining excess (if not already completely used to offset the taxable income from the sales) would be unfenced and therefore available to offset income from other sources. If any of the properties that were in the portfolio were not taxed on sale, the remaining excess deductions would remain ring-fenced. They would be carried forward to any future year in which the taxpayer derives residential income from another property, at which point they would be treated as transferred to that new rental property. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 58 NEW LEGISLATION Note that the composition of a portfolio can change, with properties within it being bought and sold. A portfolio includes all residential properties a taxpayer has included in their portfolio from the beginning of the income year in which they first acquire a property that was in the portfolio until the end of the income year in which they dispose of the last of the properties included in that portfolio. Example 5 – The composition of a portfolio changing as properties are bought and sold Kate and David have bought and sold the following residential investment properties, and have not elected to apply the ring- fencing rules on a property-by-property basis for any of them: Year 1 – Own property A and property B. Year 2 – Sell property B in May. Buy property C in August. Year 6 – Sell property A in September, buy property D in December. Year 10 – Sell properties C and D. Year 11 – Buy properties E and F. Properties A, B, C and D are all part of the same portfolio. It does not matter that they were not all held at the same time. There was a portfolio of properties from Year 1 until the end of Year 10, although the composition of the portfolio changed over that time. Any excess deductions remaining after the sale of properties C and D will not be unfenced unless all of the properties in the portfolio were taxed on sale. Properties E and F are part of a new portfolio, as when they were purchased Kate and David no longer owned any of the properties that had been part of the first portfolio. Example 6 – Treatment of ring-fenced deductions on disposal of all properties in a portfolio Jairus owns a portfolio of two residential properties; he has not previously owned other residential properties. In the 2019-20 income year, he sells both of his properties for a total net taxable gain of $10,000. He also has gross rental income of $20,000 from the properties in that year, rental deductions for the properties of $35,000, and a salary of $70,000. Jairus has a total of $30,000 “residential income” from the portfolio for the year (the rental income and the net taxable gain from the sale of the properties). He can use $30,000 of the rental deductions against his residential income. Because the sales of both properties in the portfolio were taxed, the remaining $5,000 of rental deductions are unfenced and can be used against Jairus’ salary income. If the sale of only one of the properties had been taxed, any excess deductions would remain ring-fenced. The excess would not be able to be used against Jairus’ salary income, but would have to be carried forward to be used against any future residential income Jairus has. Application of the rules to close companies The ring-fencing rules apply to close companies – in general terms, these are companies with five or fewer natural persons whose total voting interests are more than 50%, with associated persons being treated as one person. The continuity rules For close companies, unused excess deductions under the ring-fencing rules are subject to the existing shareholder continuity rules for companies, with the unused excess being treated as if it were an unused tax loss component. If the shareholder continuity requirements are breached, the amount of unused excess deductions that are allocated to the relevant income year may be restricted (section EL 14). Transfers between companies in wholly-owned groups Section EL 15 allows for some or all ring-fenced deductions to be transferred between companies in a wholly-owned group. The ability to transfer ring-fenced deductions is limited to companies in the same wholly-owned group, as the economic ownership is the same in that situation. Transferred deductions remain ring-fenced, so can only be used against “residential income” derived by the transferee company. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 59 NEW LEGISLATION Interposed entities The issue Without rules to deal with interposed entities, some taxpayers could get around the ring-fencing rules by interposing an entity (for example, a company) to separate a loan (and interest deductions) from the residential rental property, so the interest deductions would not be subject to ring-fencing. For example, a taxpayer could borrow money to buy shares in a company, which uses those funds to buy a residential investment property. Because the interest on the borrowings formally relates to the individual’s investment in shares in the company, not to the acquisition of a residential rental property, in the absence of the interposed entity rules the individual would have been able to claim deductions for the interest even if the rental property was loss-making taking into account those deductions, and offset those deductions against income from other sources. Sections EL 16 to EL 19 are aimed at ensuring this mechanism cannot be used to get around the ring-fencing rules, which would undermine their credibility, neutrality, and fairness. The interposed entity rules The interposed entity rules apply to interest expenditure on borrowings to acquire an interest in an entity, if, for a particular income year the entity is a “residential land-rich entity”. An entity will be a “residential land-rich entity” where at the end of the year over 50% of its assets by value are residential land, whether owned directly or indirectly. The interposed entity rules can apply where the entity is a close company, LTC or partnership. They can also apply to trustees of a trust if more than 50% of the trust’s assets are residential land. The interposed entity rule for trusts is intended to cover off the possibility of someone borrowing to acquire a beneficial interest in a fixed trust that is not a unit trust – something not likely to occur often. The 50% “residential land-rich entity” threshold takes into account all residential properties, not just those within the scope of the ring-fencing rules. This ensures that the interposed entity rules apply even if, for example, the main home is held in the same entity as a rental property (which would often be worth less than the main home). Where the land-rich threshold is met, the interest on the borrowings will only be deductible in that year to the extent allowed under the interposed entity rules. Under the rules, the amount of the interest expenditure that can be deducted in the year is calculated by reference to two factors: • the level of the entity’s capital that has been used to acquire residential property; and • the person’s “share of net residential income”. Having regard to the level of the entity’s capital that has been used to acquire residential property in effect allocates the interest expenditure between the residential property and other investments of the entity. For example, if a residential land-rich company has $2,000,000 of capital and a residential property it purchased for $1,000,000, 50% of the interest expenditure in relation to shareholder’s investment in the entity may potentially be subject to ring-fencing. Having regard to the person’s “share of net residential income” reflects the proportion of the total interests in the entity or property that the person has. For example, if a person who has borrowed to invest in a residential land-rich entity has 50% of the shares in the entity, they can only deduct the interest expenditure up to a maximum of 50% of the net residential income the company has. For non-transparent entities, the person’s “share of net residential income” is based on the person’s interest (eg, a shareholder’s voting interest in a company) and the entity’s net residential income. For transparent entities (LTCs and partnerships), the person’s “share of net residential income” is the person’s residential income for the income year from property held in the entity (or a particular property, if the entity has applied the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 60 NEW LEGISLATION Example 7 – The interposed entity rules More than fifty percent of Company X’s assets are residential property, so Company X is a “residential land-rich entity”. 95.24% of Company X’s capital ($1,000,000 ÷ $1,050,000) was used to acquire residential rental property (this is the “applied capital percentage” in the formula in section EL 17(1)). The “applied capital percentage” is multiplied by the interest expenditure of $45,000 Alex incurred for the year for the borrowings, under the formula in section EL 17(1). The amount calculated under that formula is therefore $42,858 (95.24% × $45,000 interest). Alex’s voting interest in Company X is one hundred percent, as she has 100% of the shareholder decision-making rights for Company X. That interest is multiplied by Company X’s net residential income ($40,000), under the formula in section EL 17(3). The amount calculated under that formula is therefore $40,000 (100% × $40,000). Alex’s interest deduction for the income year is limited under the interposed entity rules. To the extent the amount calculated under the formula in section EL 17(1) exceeds the amount calculated under the formula in section EL 17(3), the deduction is suspended for the income year. The suspended amount is carried forward to the next year and added to the amount of Alex’s interest expenditure in relation to her investment in the entity for that future year. This means that $2,858 of Alex’s interest expenditure is suspended as a deduction for the year ($42,858 – $40,000 = $2,858). For the current income year, Alex can therefore deduct $42,142 of the interest expenditure ($45,000 total interest expenditure minus $2,858 suspended deduction). The $2,858 deduction that is suspended for the year is carried forward and added to Alex’s interest expenditure for the next year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 61 NEW LEGISLATION Detailed examples The examples below provide more detailed guidance on how the rules apply in a range of situations. Example 8 – Individual owns a portfolio of residential rental properties Emilia is employed as a computer programmer and earns $85,000 a year. She owns three residential rental properties. She has not elected to apply the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis for any of them. The rules apply to the properties on a portfolio basis. Year 1 – Excess deductions to be carried forward Residential income and deductions In the 2019-20 income year, Emilia carried out some repairs on one of the properties. She derived $50,000 in rental income in total from the three properties. Her deductible expenses for all the properties totalled $60,000. Emilia’s salary for the year was $85,000. Residential rental deductions that can be claimed for the income year Under section EL 4(2), the amount of deductions for the properties that Emilia can claim for the year is capped at the amount of income she derived from the properties. Emilia can therefore claim $50,000 of her total $60,000 deductions for the income year. Excess deductions carried forward The $10,000 of excess deductions relating to the properties cannot be claimed against Emilia’s salary income. The excess deductions are carried forward to the next year in which Emilia derives residential income. Year 2 – Taxable sale of a property in the portfolio Residential income and deductions At the end of the 2020-21 income year, Emilia sold one of her properties. The sale of the property is taxable under the bright- line test. Emilia made a net gain of $50,000 from the sale. Emilia derived $90,000 in rental income in total from all of the properties. Residential rental deductions totalled $20,000 for the 2020-21 income year. Emilia also has $10,000 of excess deductions carried forward from the previous income year. Residential rental deductions that can be claimed for the income year Under section EL 4(2), the amount of deductions that Emilia can claim for the 2020-21 income year is capped at the amount of “residential income” she has derived in relation to the portfolio for the year. Emilia’s residential income comprises rental income of $90,000 and $50,000 net income from the taxed property sale. The amount of residential rental deductions that Emilia can claim for the year is therefore capped at $140,000 ($90,000 rents + $50,000 net income from the sale of residential land). Excess deductions carried forward Emilia has $30,000 total residential rental deductions ($10,000 carried forward from the previous income year + $20,000 of deductions for expenses incurred in the current income year). As a result, Emilia does not have any excess residential rental deductions to carry forward to the next income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 62 NEW LEGISLATION Example 9 – LTC owns residential properties and applies the ring-fencing rules on the default portfolio basis Charles and Nikau are 50/50 shareholders in a look-through company (LTC). The LTC owns three residential rental properties. The LTC is applying the ring-fencing rules to the properties on the default portfolio basis. Charles owns another rental property directly. Nikau does not own any other properties. Year 1 – Ring-fenced deductions flow through to the LTC shareholders Residential income and deductions for the portfolio In the 2019-20 income year, the LTC undertook renovations on the properties throughout the year, as the respective tenancies ended. The LTC derived $40,000 in residential income from the portfolio properties and incurred deductible expenses of $75,000 in relation to the portfolio. Residential rental deductions that can be claimed for the income year for the portfolio Under section EL 4(2), the amount of deductions relating to the portfolio that the LTC can allocate in its return to the 2019- 20 income year is capped at the amount of residential income derived from the portfolio. Therefore, the total amount of deductions the LTC can allocate to the year for the portfolio is $40,000. Income, deductions allocated to the year, and ring-fenced deductions flow through to the LTC shareholders The LTC’s tax return would reflect rental income of $40,000, deductions allocated to the 2019-20 income of $40,000, and ring- fenced deductions of $35,000. The income, deductions and ring-fenced deductions are all attributed to Charles and Nikau in proportion to their effective look-through interests. Nikau does not have any other residential income, so his share of the ring-fenced deductions cannot be claimed against any other income he has. His share of the ring-fenced deductions are carried forward to the next year in which he derives residential income. Charles has another rental property, so his share of the ring-fenced deductions from the LTC properties, together with the deductions from his own property, are his total deductions in relation to his portfolio. They can be used against all of his residential income from the portfolio, including from his own property. Year 2 – Shareholders’ ring-fenced deductions from prior year can be used as the portfolio is profitable Residential income and deductions for the portfolio In the 2020-21 income year, the LTC derived $78,000 in residential income from the portfolio properties and incurred deductible expenses of $35,000 for those properties. Residential rental deductions that can be claimed for the income year for the portfolio As the income from the portfolio exceeds the deductions relating to the portfolio, in its return the LTC can allocate all of the deductions to the 2020-21 income year. Income and deductions flow through to the LTC shareholders The LTC’s tax return would reflect rental income of $78,000, and deductions allocated to the 2020-21 income year of $35,000. There are no ring-fenced excess deductions. The income and deductions are attributed to Charles and Nikau in proportion to their effective look-through interests. Nikau’s share of the ring-fenced deductions from the previous year, together with his share of the deductions from the current year, are his total deductions in relation to his portfolio (the LTC properties). They can be used against his residential income from the portfolio for the year (his share of the income from the LTC properties). Charles’ share of the deductions from the LTC properties, together with the deductions from his own property, are his total deductions in relation to his portfolio. They can be used against all of his residential income from his portfolio (which includes the LTC properties and his own property). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 63 NEW LEGISLATION Example 10 – Applying the ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis Gary is a self-employed landscaper. He has two residential rental properties. He has elected to apply the ring-fencing rules to each of the properties on a property-by-property basis. Year 1 – Taxable sale of an individual property and release of excess deductions Residential income and deductions for property A In the 2020-21 income year, Gary decides to undertake some repairs to property A. He commences the repairs after the tenants move out, and the house is not habitable while the repairs are being done. Gary’s rental income from property A was $15,000, and he incurred $40,000 of deductible expenses for the property. While undertaking the repairs Gary discovers there are far more significant issues than he envisaged. He is concerned the property will become a money pit, so decides to cut his losses and sell property A. It sells during the income year. The sale was taxable under the bright-line test. Gary made a net gain of $10,000 from the sale. Residential income and deductions for property B Gary’s rental income from property B was $25,000, and he incurred $30,000 of deductible expenses for the property. Residential rental deductions that can be claimed for the income year for property A As the sale was taxable, the excess deductions that would otherwise be ring-fenced are released from the application of the ring-fencing rules (section EL 7(2)). This means that Gary can use the excess deductions from property A ($15,000) against his income from landscaping. Residential rental deductions that can be claimed for the income year for property B Under section EL 4(2), the amount of deductions for property B that Gary can claim for the year is capped at the amount of income he derived from property B. Gary can therefore claim $25,000 of the total $30,000 deductions for property B for the income year. Excess deductions carried forward in relation to property B This means that Gary will have $5,000 in excess deductions in relation to property B. The excess deductions cannot be used to reduce Gary’s taxable income from his landscaping work. The excess deductions are carried forward to the next year in which Gary derives income from from property B. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 64 NEW LEGISLATION Year 2 – Taxable sale of remaining individual property Residential income and deductions Early in the 2021-22 income year, Gary decides to sell property B and go travelling. Gary’s rental income for the year from property B was $10,000, and he incurred $7,000 of deductible expenses for the property. The sale was not taxable. Gary’s total residential rental deductions for property B are $12,000. This is made up of the $5,000 of excess deductions carried forward from the previous year, and the $7,000 of deductions for expenditure incurred in the current year. Residential rental deductions that can be claimed for the income year Under section EL 4(2), the amount of deductions for property B that Gary can claim for the year is capped at the amount of income he derived from that property. Gary can therefore claim $10,000 of the total $12,000 deductions for property B for the income year. Because the sale of Property B was not taxable the deductions in excess of the income are not released from the ring-fencing rules. Excess deductions carried forward This means that Gary will have $2,000 in excess deductions that must be carried forward to a future income year in which he derives residential income. The excess deductions cannot be used to reduce Gary’s taxable income from his landscaping work. Example 11 – Partners in a partnership own residential properties and apply the ring-fencing rules on different bases Arturo and Marlon are equal partners in a partnership with two residential rental properties. Marlon owns another rental property himself. Arturo does not own any other properties. Residential income and deductions for the properties In the 2019-20 income year, the income derived and deductible expenditure incurred in respect of the partnership properties were as follows: property A property B $30,000 income $8,000 income $20,000 deductions $25,000 deductions Marlon derived $35,000 income from his property (property C), and incurred $20,000 of deductible expenses for the property. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 65 NEW LEGISLATION Arturo’s return Arturo and Marlon are thinking about selling property B, and the sale may be taxed. Arturo therefore wants to apply the ring- fencing rules on a property-by-property basis. This would mean that his share of any remaining unused deductions (if there are any after being used against his share of residential income, including any net land sale income) would be unfenced and able to be used against Arturo’s other income. There are no intermingled expenses for the properties, so Arturo can apply the rules on a property by property basis. For property A, Arturo’s share of the income is $15,000, and his share of deductions is $10,000. He can therefore use all of his deductions for property A against his income from property A, leaving him with net income of $5,000 from property A. For property B, Arturo’s share of the income is $4,000, and his share of deductions is $12,500. As he is applying the rules on a property-by-property basis, the deductions for property B that Arturo can claim for the year are capped at the amount of income from property B. This means that Arturo can use $4,000 of his deductions for property B, with the remaining $8,500 being ring-fenced. Arturo’s 2019-20 return reflects that he has $14,000 of rental deductions allocated to the year ($10,000 for property A + $4,000 for property B), $8,500 of ring-fenced deductions, and $5,000 net rental income. Marlon’s return Marlon is applying the ring-fencing rules on a portfolio basis. This is so he can use his share of the deductions from the partnership properties against his total residential income, which he wants to do as his own property (property C) is profitable. Marlon’s total residential income is $54,000 (his share from property A of $15,000 + his share from property B of $4,000 + the income from property C of $35,000). The total of his deductions for the properties is $42,500 (his share for property A of $10,000 + his share for property B of $12,500 + his deductions for property C of $20,000). Marlon’s 2019-20 return reflects that he has $42,500 of rental deductions allocated to the year, $0 of ring-fenced deductions, and $11,500 net rental income. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 66 NEW LEGISLATION The Commissioner’s care and management role Sections 5B and 6A to 6G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background Generally, tax law is consistent with the policy intent, but in some circumstances, the interpretation of the law when applying ordinary statutory interpretation principles does not accord with original the policy intent. When this happens, it can tie the Commissioner’s and taxpayer’s resources up in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and/or expectations. Amendments have been made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 that provide additional mechanisms, in the form of two new regulation-making powers, that can be used to address issues with tax laws that produce outcomes that are inconsistent with policy intent. All legislative references in this part are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Tax Administration Act). Key features The key features are two new regulation-making powers referred to in the Tax Administration Act as the “remedial powers”: • An Order in Council process which can be used to modify the application of provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts 32 on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. • An administrative power of exemption for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, which enables the Commissioner to provide legislative exemptions from provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. Both powers are subject to certain limitations, safeguards and processes which are intended to ensure the powers are confined to resolving issues with tax laws that produce outcomes that are inconsistent with the policy intent. Application date The amendments apply from 26 June 2019, the date the Bill received the Royal assent. Detailed analysis Amendments that do not relate to the remedial powers New section 5B of the Tax Administration Act designates the chief executive of the Inland Revenue Department as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This provision was previously included in section 6A(1) of the Tax Administration Act. Section 6 imposes an obligation on Ministers and officers of any government agencies having responsibilities under the Inland Revenue Acts to use their best endeavours to maintain the integrity of the tax system at all times (as well as defines “integrity of the tax system”). Section 6A provides that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. It recognises that the Commissioner must collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, having regard to her limited resources, the importance of promoting compliance, and compliance costs incurred by persons. No substantive changes have been made to section 6A beyond removing the provision that designated the chief executive of the Inland Revenue Department as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue which is now in section 5B. Section 6B enables the Governor General to issue directions in relation to the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts to the Commissioner by Order in Council. An Order made under section 6B cannot give directions to the Commissioner that concern the tax affairs of individual persons or the interpretation of tax law. Remedial powers New sections 6C to 6G contain remedial powers which can be used to address obvious errors, ambiguities, or inconsistencies within provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. The remedial powers provide: • A power of modification to the Governor General on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. The Minister of Revenue can recommend an Order in Council be made to modify the application of provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts; and • A power of exemption for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner can grant exemptions, that can be subject to terms and conditions, from provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. 32 The Inland Revenue Acts are listed in Schedule 1 to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and include the Income Tax Act 2007, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and Acts that relate to social policies for which Inland Revenue has administrative responsibility as the Child Support Act 1991, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 67 NEW LEGISLATION The powers can be used, for example, where a drafting error means that a provision within a tax law is inconsistent with intended policy outcomes, or where a gap in the legislation is discovered that creates uncertainty about whether the legislation is consistent with the policy intent. In these situations, the powers could provide a temporary remedy where the law, interpreted using ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, does not align with intended policy outcomes. The use of the powers allows taxpayers to adopt an approach that is consistent with intended policy outcomes before amendments can be made to the relevant provision or provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. The new powers are in addition to the existing care and management powers contained in sections 6 and 6A. Purpose of the remedial powers New section 6C(2) specifies the purpose of the remedial powers. The purpose is to provide flexibility to temporarily remedy or mitigate the effect of a provision (or provisions) of the Inland Revenue Acts by making a modification or granting an exemption where it is reasonably necessary: • due to an “obvious error”; • to give effect to the intended purpose or object of a provision or provisions; • to resolve ambiguities; • to reconcile inconsistencies. Modifications and exemptions have general application unless expressly stated as applying only to a particular class of persons or circumstances. This is intended to ensure that where a modification or an exemption is made, it is available to all those affected by the issue the modification or the exemption is put in place to address. As the effect of modifications and exemptions are that they change the application of primary legislation, an important safeguard on the use of the powers is that where modifications and exemptions are available for a person to apply, it is their decision whether or not to apply them. That is, if a person does not want to apply a modification or an exemption in relation to their circumstances, they can continue to rely on the relevant provision, or provisions, of the Inland Revenue Acts, without the effect of the modification or the exemption. The effect of such a decision also requires the Commissioner to apply the law in relation to the person as if the modification or the exemption did not exist. Modifications made by Order in Council and exemptions granted by the Commissioner New section 6D contains a power for the Governor General to make Orders in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue to modify the application of the Inland Revenue Acts. New section 6E provides the Commissioner with the power to grant exemptions from provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. The power to make modifications and exemptions, being regulations that are legislative instruments, also comes with the power to amend, revoke or replace them. 33 This means that it is possible for modifications and exemptions to be amended, revoked, or replaced if necessary. However, no modification or exemption can have its application extended beyond the three-year time limit (see Period of application for modifications and exemptions). Before the Minister of Revenue recommends an Order in Council under section 6D, or the Commissioner grants an exemption under section 6E the Minister (or the Commissioner) must be satisfied that a modification or an exemption is reasonably necessary to do one or more of the following: • Remedy or mitigate the effect of an obvious error (as defined in section 6G – see Meaning of obvious error) in a provision, or provisions, of the Inland Revenue Acts. • Give effect to the intended purpose or object of a provision, or provisions, of the Inland Revenue Acts, or resolve ambiguity. • Reconcile inconsistencies between provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts, or provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts and an administrative practice of the Commissioner. Once satisfied that a modification or an exemption is reasonably necessary to do one or more of those things, the Minister or the Commissioner must also be satisfied that such a modification or an exemption: • does not materially affect the intended scope or effect of the provisions to which it applies; • is not inconsistent with the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision to which it applies; and • is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address or resolve the issue that gave rise to it. 33 See section 15 of the Interpretation Act 1999. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 68 NEW LEGISLATION These provisions are intended to ensure that modifications and exemptions cannot be used to create new policy settings that are inconsistent with what was intended. These provisions are also intended to ensure that any modification made or exemption granted will be confined to resolving the issue that gave rise to it. In addition to the above matters, and before recommending a modification or exemption, the Minister in the case of a modification, or the Commissioner in the case of an exemption, must also be satisfied that: • using a modification or an exemption is the most appropriate way of resolving the issue at the time; and • making the modification or granting an exemption does not have the effect of extending the period of application of an earlier modification or exemption made under either sections 6D or 6E. The Minister or the Commissioner may consider that a modification is the most appropriate way of resolving the issue at the time if, for example, the matter cannot be resolved through an amendment to the corresponding provision, or provisions, of the Inland Revenue Acts in a timely manner, and there is significant uncertainty about how Inland Revenue will, or could, apply the law in the circumstances. There may be some circumstances where neither the Minister nor the Commissioner considers it appropriate to use the remedial powers to address the issue. Another modification or exemption cannot be used to prolong the period of application of a modification or an exemption which no longer has effect because it has expired (see Period of application for modifications and exemptions). For modifications and exemptions to have ongoing effect beyond the three-year limit, legislation with a corresponding amendment to the relevant provision(s) would need to be passed by Parliament. If applicable, the Minister or the Commissioner must also be satisfied that: • there is a reasonable opportunity for a person to choose not to apply a modification, if the modification is to be expressed as applying unless a person chooses not to apply it (see Applying a modification or an exemption); and • a consultative process has taken place that meets the requirements of section 6F (see Consultative process) unless they consider a case of urgency exists. For exemptions granted by the Commissioner, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the exemption would have no, or negligible, fiscal implications for the Crown. This serves to impose more of a limitation on the Commissioner’s power to grant exemptions relative to the Minister’s power to recommend modifications. Content of modifications A modification made under section 6D: • may be made by stating an alternative means of complying with the provision or provisions to which the modification applies; • provide the Commissioner with a discretionary power to be exercised; • must specify the period for which the modification applies – see Period of application for modification and exemptions; • must set out whether the modification applies on an “opt-in” or “opt-out” basis and set out how a person can choose to apply (or not apply) the modification – see Applying a modification or an exemption; • may be subject to terms and conditions; • may state whether the modification applies generally or is limited to a particular class of persons or circumstances; and • may provide for transitional, savings, and related matters. Content of exemptions An exemption granted under section 6E: • must specify the period for which the exemption applies – see Period of application for modification and exemptions; • must set out whether the exemption applies on an “opt-in” or “opt-out” basis and set out how a person can choose to apply (or not apply) the exemption – see Applying a modification or an exemption; • may state whether the exemption applies generally or is limited to a particular class of persons or circumstances; • may provide for transitional, savings, and related matters; and • may include terms and conditions the Commissioner thinks fit. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 69 NEW LEGISLATION In circumstances where the Commissioner grants an exemption, and subject to any terms and conditions, the effect of this will be that the provision (or provisions) to which the exemption applies will no longer need to be applied (fully or in part) by those to whom the exemption is available (and to the extent that a decision is made by those people to apply the exemption). Applying a modification or an exemption Sections 6D(4) and 6E(5) allow modifications and exemptions to be expressed as: • applying unless the person to whom it is available chooses not to apply it (opt-out); or • applying only if the person to whom it is available chooses to apply it (opt-in). Whether a modification or an exemption will be expressed on an opt-out basis or an opt-in basis will depend on the circumstances that the modification or exemption is put in place to address. For example, a modification or an exemption that relates to a person’s tax position might be expressed as opt-in, and the mechanism for opting in would be taking a tax position that was consistent with the modification or the exemption. Modifications and exemptions may be expressed as opt-out where, for example, the modification or the exemption relates to the application of an Inland Revenue computer system. How the modification or the exemption is expressed will be specified within the modification or the exemption itself. Where a modification or an exemption is expressed on an opt-out basis, before the modification or the exemption takes effect, either the Minister of Revenue (for a modification) or the Commissioner (for an exemption) must be satisfied that people to whom the modification or exemption will be applied to have a reasonable opportunity to choose not to apply the modification or the exemption. Period of application for modifications and exemptions The rules for determining the period of application for modifications and exemptions are included in sections 6D(3) 33 and 6D(4) 34 . No modification or exemption can have prospective application for longer than three complete tax (or income) years, which includes the year in which the modification or the exemption comes into force. Retrospective application is available in relation to: • exemptions as far back as the beginning of the income year corresponding to the tax year in which the exemption comes into force; 36 and • modifications as far back as the fifth income year before the income year corresponding to the tax year in which the modification comes into force. 37 The following diagram shows the maximum applicable period of application for modifications and exemptions. New section 6D(3)(c) permits modifications to have retrospective effect in relation to periods before the enactment of the remedial powers. Similarly, section 6E(4)(c) permits exemptions to be granted in respect of the 2019-20 tax (and income) year, despite the empowering provision only coming into force part way through the 2019-20 tax year. For a modification or an exemption to have application beyond these timeframes, a legislative amendment must be made to the relevant provision (or provisions) of the Inland Revenue Acts by Parliament. 34 For modifications made under section 6D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 35 For exemptions granted under section 6E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 36 See section 6E(4)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 37 See section 6D(3)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 70 NEW LEGISLATION Legislative status of modifications and exemptions Modifications made under section 6D and exemptions granted under section 6E are both legislative instruments and disallowable instruments. This means that certain provisions of the Legislation Act 2012 apply to modifications and exemptions, in particular: • publication requirements – modifications and exemptions will both be published electronically on the www.legislation.govt.nz website, as soon as practicable after having been made; • drafting by the Parliamentary Counsel Office – modifications and exemptions, being legislative instruments, will be drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel Office; and • disallowance procedures – modifications and exemptions are both subject to the disallowance procedures in Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2012. The Regulations Review Committee will also review all modifications and exemptions. For more information, see Standing Orders 319 – 325 in the 2017 Standing Orders of the House of Representatives. As modifications are given effect through an Order in Council, they will also be subject to a Cabinet process of approval before being introduced. Additional publication requirements When a modification is made, or an exemption is granted, the reasons for the modification or the exemption must be included alongside the modification or the exemption itself. 38 In addition to the reasons, an explanation of how the modification or exemption complies with the requirements of section 6D or 6E, as applicable, must also be published. The reasons and explanations will be included within the relevant modification or exemption (within either the Explanatory Note or Statement of reasons) and will also be communicated on Inland Revenue’s website. Consultative process Before the Minister of Revenue recommends a modification, or the Commissioner grants an exemption, a consultative process must take place. The requirements for the consultative process are contained in section 6F. The consultative process must include the distribution of the proposal to persons (or representatives of persons) that it is considered reasonable to consult with for the particular purpose of the modification or the exemption, with an explanation of the way in which the Minister considers the modification complies with the requirements of section 6D, or the Commissioner considers the exemption complies with the requirements of 6E. The period of consultation must last for at least six weeks. This period can be shortened by the Minister in the case of a modification, or the Commissioner in the case of an exemption, if either consider that a case of urgency exists. Meaning of obvious error One of the circumstances in which a modification can be made or an exemption can be granted is to address an “obvious error” within a provision or provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. New section 6G defines what an “obvious error” is for the purposes of subpart 2B as an error that arises in the circumstances where: • the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision is clear; and • the intended purpose or object cannot be carried into effect by the relevant provision; and • the substance of the provision that Parliament would have made, had the error become known, or had the circumstances been allowed for, is clear. Raising matters to be considered for the remedial powers The Inland Revenue website has been updated with information about how to raise issues to be considered for the remedial powers. The website address is: ird.govt.nz/modification-power 38 See sections 6D(6) and 6E(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 71 NEW LEGISLATION Social policy changes STUDENT LOAN DEDUCTIONS FROM WITHHOLDING INCOME Sections 4, 73, 202A and Schedule 2 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Background The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 contains changes to make it easier for borrowers earning schedular, casual agricultural, or election day income to meet their student loan obligations. Currently, borrowers earning these forms of income must make student loan repayments in lump sums at the end of the year, and it can be challenging for borrowers to meet this obligation. By collecting throughout the year, Inland Revenue hopes to reduce or eliminate the large student loan bills that these borrowers face at the end of the year. Key features The Act will allow for student loan deductions to be made from schedular income, casual agricultural employees and election day workers. Borrowers with income using a WT, CAE or EDW tax code will need to add a SL code to these forms of income. Employers will need to make additional deductions from amounts paid to these borrowers. Unlike salary and wage payments, deductions from WT, CAE and EDW income will not be full and final and will need to be squared up at the end of the tax year. Any repayments required at this point should be considerably smaller. If a borrower has expenses that reduce their income, these will be taken into account at the end of the year, and the borrower can apply for a special deduction rate to reduce their deductions. Borrowers on WT codes will be able to take advantage of the repayment threshold. Borrowers on CAE and EDW income will have deductions made at the secondary rate of 12 percent from the first dollar they earn. They will be able to apply for a special deduction rate if they do not have primary employment that would put them above the repayment threshold. Borrowers will be able to apply for relief under the existing provisions in the SLSA such as sections 42, 54 or 148. They could also apply for a tailored tax code for their student loan deductions under section 34. Application date The application date of these changes is 1 April 2020 INTEREST-FREE STUDENT LOANS Sections 134, 135 and 137 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Background Limitations in Inland Revenue’s previous IT system meant that all student loan borrowers would be charged interest and would get it written off if they were New Zealand based. The new system does not face these limitations. Key features The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 has been amended so only overseas-based borrowers are charged interest on their student loans. Instead of being charged interest and having it written off at the end of the tax year, New Zealand-based student loan borrowers will not be charged any interest on their loans. This change will make it easier for borrowers to understand their loan statements and better enacts the interest free student loan policy. Application date 1 April 2020 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 72 NEW LEGISLATION STUDENT LOAN DAY COUNT TEST Sections 22 and 23 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 The act clarifies the application of the day count test and reinstates the tie-breaker provision that was inadvertently removed from the Student Loan Scheme Act when it was rewritten. For borrowers who frequently travel between New Zealand and overseas, the provision clarifies if they are overseas-based or New Zealand-based. Background The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 contain a day count test for determining if a borrower is New Zealand or Overseas-based. To qualify as a New Zealand-based borrower, the borrower must be physically in New Zealand for 183 consecutive days, with absences of no more than an aggregate 31 days in that period, and they must be in New Zealand for the first day of that 183-day period. To become Overseas-based, a borrower must be overseas for 184 consecutive days, with periods in New Zealand totalling no more than 31 days in that period. Like the New Zealand-based test, to become overseas based the 184-day period begins from the first day that they are overseas. In cases where a borrower could qualify for either of these tests the 1992 Act contained a tiebreaker provision that required that they be treated as New Zealand-based in these situations. This provision was not carried over into the rewritten act in 2011. There was no intention to change the law. The amendment restores this act to its previous status. Key features If a day could be included both in the 183-day qualifying period for becoming New Zealand-based and the 184-day period for becoming overseas-based, it is treated as being included in the 183-day period only. Application date The application date of this is 1 April 2012. Example 1 Oliver is overseas-based. He returns to New Zealand for 170 days, before heading overseas for 200 days. He then returns to New Zealand indefinitely. There is a 183-day period following his first day in New Zealand, with less than 31 days overseas. He is New Zealand based for the 170 days that he is in New Zealand, and for a further 13 days after he leaves New Zealand, due to the tiebreaker provision. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 73 NEW LEGISLATION Example 2 Mia is New Zealand-based. She goes overseas for 170 days. She then returns to New Zealand indefinitely. The tiebreaker provision is triggered after they have returned for 183 days, and as a result, the borrower does not become overseas based at any point in the period. Note that Mia will be considered an overseas-based borrower until she has met the 183-day test after she returns to New Zealand. This is because at day 184 she has spent a continuous period of 184 days overseas, with less than 31 days in New Zealand in this time. Example 3 Nikau is initially New Zealand-based. He goes overseas for 170 days. He then returns to New Zealand for 60 days, before returning overseas indefinitely. As the 60-day period in New Zealand does not meet the 183-day test, he is overseas-based from his first day overseas. Example 4 Aria is New Zealand-based. She goes overseas for 20 days then returns to New Zealand for 40 days. After this she goes Overseas for 190 days. She is New Zealand based until the beginning of the second period overseas, as the 40 days in New Zealand exceeds the 31 days needed to interrupt the 184-day test. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 74 NEW LEGISLATION Example 5 Jack is New Zealand-based. He goes overseas for 20 days and returns to New Zealand for 20 days. He then goes overseas for 190 days. He is overseas-based for the entirety of this period as the 20 days in New Zealand is less than the 31 days needed to interrupt the 184-day period overseas for the 184-day test. Example 6 Charlotte is New Zealand-based. She goes overseas for 20 days and returns to New Zealand for 20 days, twice. She becomes overseas-based from the beginning of her second period overseas. This is because she cannot meet the 184-day test beginning from their first period overseas as the total period in New Zealand in the following 184 days exceeds 31 days. They can meet this test from the first day overseas in the second period. DEFINITION OF INCOME FOR STUDENT LOANS AND WORKING FOR FAMILIES Section MB 12B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Schedule 3 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 The definition of “net adjusted income” that is used for student loan purposes and the definition of “family scheme income” that is used for Working for Families tax credits have been more closely aligned. Background One of the factors that determines social policy entitlements is the relevant definition of “income”. The current approach for social policy products, including the Student Loan Scheme, is to use a common definition of “income”, such as the Income Tax Act definition of “net income”, and to make adjustments to include or exclude other specific types of income as appropriate. Changes were made to the Working for Families definition of “family scheme income” in 2011. These changes broadened the definition and were intended to improve the fairness and integrity of Working for Families by, for example, countering arrangements that have the effect of inflating entitlements beyond what people’s true economic circumstances justify. In 2014, similar amendments were made to align the definition of income used for student loan purposes with that used for Working for Families. A number of minor areas were identified where the definitions are not aligned or where wording changes would improve clarity, reduce misunderstanding and prevent structuring. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 75 NEW LEGISLATION Key features For the definition of “family scheme income”, a separate legislative provision has been introduced which includes non-beneficiary income from a trust as family scheme income when a person is not a settlor. For the definition of “net adjusted income”, the following amendments have been made: • For the undistributed income from close companies adjustment, alignment of the voting interest percentage with the percentage used for Working for Families tax credits income. This includes an associated persons test to prevent opportunities to structure shareholdings in close companies to reduce student loan repayment obligations. • Certain contributions to retirement savings schemes are excluded from net income. This brings in a previously approved policy which was not implemented at the time. • An amount of depreciation loss allowed in the 2002–03 or earlier years is excluded from net income. Application dates The amendment to the Income Tax Act applied from 26 June 2019, the date of Royal assent. The changes to the Student Loan Scheme Act will apply from April 2020, the date student loans moves to Inland Revenue’s new system. CHILD SUPPORT (DISCRETION TO GRANT PERMANENT EXEMPTION) Sections 89Y, 89Z, 89ZA, 89ZB and 152A of the Child Support Act 1991 The Child Support Act 1991 has been amended to give Inland Revenue discretion to grant sex offence victims a permanent exemption from paying child support even though there is no convicted offender. Background A person can have a child as a result of being the victim of a sex offence and may be made liable to pay child support for that child. Since 2006, a permanent exemption from paying child support has existed for the parent of a child born as a result of a sex offence. Before these amendments, for the parent to qualify for the exemption, the offender must have been convicted. This strict requirement for an offender to have been identified and convicted meant very few parents qualified for an exemption, despite the reality that an offence occurred. This result was inconsistent with the underlying policy intention which was to ensure that victims of a sex offence should not be held responsible for legal obligations resulting from that offence. Key features Inland Revenue will be able to use discretion to grant an exemption for sex offence victims if satisfied that an offence occurred and the child for whom child support is sought was born as a result of that offence. Inland Revenue can also now use discretion to back date the exemption in situations when it is satisfied this would not negatively impact on a parent or carer, but no earlier than 26 September 2006 when the permanent exemption was introduced. Inland Revenue would be obliged to revoke the exemption in situations when it subsequently becomes aware that the exemption should not have been granted. Application date The amendments apply 27 June 2019, the day after the date of Royal assent. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 76 NEW LEGISLATION ORANGA TAMARIKI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS Sections CW 33 and MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background Oranga Tamariki introduced a new transitions service on 1 July 2019 for young people leaving care. Changes to the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989 support this new service. Under section 386AAG of the Act, Oranga Tamariki can now provide financial assistance to help young people remain with or return to living with their caregiver until the age of 21. Under section 386B of the Act, Oranga Tamariki can provide advice or assistance, including financial assistance, to young people up to the age of 25. Key features Section CW 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to tax exempt payments to the young person or their caregiver under either of the sections in the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989. Under Section 386AAG, Oranga Tamariki may make payments to the young person to make to their caregiver, possibly with some additional contribution from the young person. In this case, both Oranga Tamariki’s payment to the young person and the young person’s payment to the caregiver should be tax exempt. Section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that these payments are not included in family scheme income. The payments should not be taken into account for determining any Working for Families, Child Support or Student Loan entitlements or liabilities. Application date The amendments apply from 1 July 2019 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 77 NEW LEGISLATION Other policy changes KEEPING TAX RECORDS IN TE REO MĀORI Sections 22, 22A, 22B and 26 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 78 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 The Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) have been amended to allow taxpayers to hold tax records in te reo Māori as a matter of right. Obligations remain on taxpayers to produce certain documents in English, such as tax invoices for GST purposes and donation tax receipts that are used by third parties to take a tax position. The changes ensure the operation and effect of the Inland Revenue Acts are aligned with the spirit and intent of Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori Act 2016 Māori Language Act 2016. Key features Taxpayers can choose to hold their tax records in English or te reo Māori. The amendments are directed at internal documents held by taxpayers in compliance with the requirements and obligations of the Tax Administration Act and the GST Act. The amendments affect section 75 of the GST Act and sections 22, 22A, 22B and 26 of the Tax Administration Act. As a result of the changes taxpayers can hold tax records in te reo Māori without first having to seek Inland Revenue’s approval. The changes do not affect, replace, or alter existing taxpayer obligations or disclosures required in respect of tax documents that are relied on by third party taxpayers when taking a tax position. For example: • For the purposes of the GST Act, new section 75(8) requires GST-registered persons that hold tax records in a language other than English to prepare documents that are consistent with the obligations under sections 24, 24BA, and 25 relating to English words that must appear on a tax invoice, or a debit note or credit note, provided by the registered person. • Section 32 of the Tax Administration Act which deals with records held by donee organisations has not been amended as donations receipts are used by donors to establish their entitlement to donation tax credits or tax deductions. The Tax Administration Act and the GST Act do not prevent taxpayers (at their choice) from providing bi-lingual documentation or including other material that complements the statutory requirements. Application date The amendments apply from 26 June 2019.

COLLECTION OF IRD NUMBERS FOR TRANSFERS OF MAIN HOMES Sections 77, 79 and Schedule 1 of the Land Transfer Act 2017 From 1 January 2020 most people who transfer property - including those who are transferring their main home - will need to include their IRD number and any relevant overseas tax residence information on the transfer documentation. The remaining non-notifiable reasons, for which transferees or transferors are not required to include their IRD number, are set out in the Land Transfer (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Exemption Regulations 2015. Information collected on the Land Transfer Tax Statement is provided to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) as part of property transfer documentation and then passed onto Inland Revenue to assist compliance with New Zealand’s property tax rules. Background Before a transfer of land can be registered, the transferor (seller) and transferee (purchaser) must complete a Land Transfer Tax Statement, prescribed under the Land Transfer Act 2017 (LTA). The requirement for all transferors and transferees of property to complete a Land Transfer Tax Statement (LTTS) was introduced in October 2015. Information contained in the LTTS is collected by LINZ as part of the land transfer process and is sent onto the Inland Revenue for use in identifying and enforcing the property tax rules. This information can also be provided to overseas tax authorities by Inland Revenue in accordance with existing information-sharing legislation and international obligations. The content of the LTTS is set out in section 79 of the LTA; it includes the tax details set out below (in relation to either the transferor or transferee): • their IRD number • whether they are treated as a tax resident in a jurisdiction other than New Zealand (without taking into account any double tax agreement) • if they are tax resident in another jurisdiction – the name and country code of that jurisdiction, and their tax identification number for that jurisdiction. The transferor or transferee is not required to include these tax details if the transfer is “non-notifiable”. The current legislation specifies that a transfer was “non-notifiable” if certain main home criteria were met or if another non-notifiable reason applies as set out in regulations. These additional non-notifiable transfers include specific situations where the compliance cost to obtaining the information is likely to be unduly high and the risk of non-compliance is low. The amendments follow a recommendation made by the Government’s Tax Working Group to require the disclosure of IRD numbers on the Land Transfer Tax Statement when the transfer involves a main home. This change will provide ownership information to Inland Revenue for the vast majority of property transfers and assist compliance with the property tax rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 79 NEW LEGISLATION Key features These amendments require all transferors (sellers) and transferees (purchasers) to provide their IRD number and, if applicable, any overseas tax information when they are transferring their main home. This change is achieved by removing the transfer of a main home from qualifying as a “non-notifiable” transfer for the purpose of the Land Transfer Tax Statement. To support this change, the amendments also require natural person or trustee transferors and transferees to provide an indication of whether the property being transferred was or is intended to be their main home (or in the case of the trustee, a main home for a beneficiary of the trust). For a natural person, a “main home transfer” is defined as: • For a transferor – land with a home on it, where the transferor has resided in the home for more than 50 percent of the time during which they owned the land; • For a transferee – land with a home on it, where the transferee intends to reside. For a trustee, a “main home transfer” is defined as: • For a transferor – land with a home on it, where a natural person beneficiary has resided in the home for 50% of the time it was owned by the trust. • For a transferee – land with a home on it, where a natural person beneficiary intends to reside in the home. Minor other amendments to the Land Transfer Act are made to remove the restriction on an offshore person qualifying for a “non-notifiable” reason, and to include transitional provisions to allow transfers entered into before the commencement of the amendments to be completed on the basis of the existing legislative requirements. The framework and wider provisions regarding when a Land Transfer Tax Statement must be completed have not changed. There are existing provisions covering the correction of errors and omissions, information disclosure, retention and offence provisions. Application date The amendments apply from 1 January 2020. As a transitional measure, the existing legislative requirements (as at 31 December 2019) will continue for transfers where agreements are entered into before 1 January 2020 and the instrument for registration is lodged on or before 1 July 2020. Detailed analysis The information disclosure requirements in the LTA for property transfers are amended. The underlying property tax rules which provide for when a property sale may be taxable are contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 and are not affected by these amendments. Removal of the non-notifiable reason when a main home is transferred The amendments remove the ability for transferors or transferees to qualify for a non-notifiable transfer for the transfer of their main home. This means that purchasers and sellers will be required to provide their IRD number and any relevant overseas tax information when they transfer their main homes. Current section 77(2) specifies what constitutes a non-notifiable transfer, including when the transfer of a main home qualifies as a non-notifiable transfer. Section 77(2) is repealed, and section 77(1) is amended to include a definition of a non-notifiable transfer that is, a transfer specified as a non-notifiable transfer in regulations made under the Land Transfer Act 2017. The definition of a “main home” in section 77 is also repealed. These amendments provide that IRD numbers and, if applicable, any overseas tax identification number and country of residence, must be provided for all main home transfers. Main home indicator To support the removal of the non-notifiable reason for main homes, a main home indicator has been introduced. Section 79 is amended to include a main home indicator and includes a definition of a main home transfer for this purpose. Section 79(5) sets out what a main home transfer is for a transferor and for a transferee. Under the property tax rules, in many cases the transfer of an individual’s main home is not taxable. Accordingly, it is useful for Inland Revenue to distinguish between transfers of main homes and other transfers to provide an indication of the likelihood that the transfer may trigger a tax compliance obligation. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 80 NEW LEGISLATION Section 79(5) has been amended to include a new definition of a main home transfer for the purpose of providing this information. The main home transfer is intended to be a simpler test than the current test for when a main home transfer qualifies as a non-notifiable transfer. This reflects the purpose of the main home indicator as differentiating between types of land transfers rather than as determining whether a person must complete the tax details. A main home transfer applies only to transfers which include a home on the land being transferred. Further, a transfer may only be considered a main home transfer if it is transferred by a trustee or a natural person and the relevant criteria are met. The main home transfer test is a broad test which looks at whether the transferor has resided in the home for 50 percent of the time, or the transferee intends to reside in the home. It is important to note that this test does not mirror the tests contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 which determines whether a tax obligation arises when a property is sold. 50 percent test for transferors A main home transfer is defined as a home which a natural person transferor has resided in for more than 50 percent of the period during which the transferor has been an owner of the land or where the home is held by a trust, a beneficiary of the trust has resided in the home for more than 50 percent of the period that the land was property of that trust. This test looks at whether a beneficiary is residing in the home rather than whether a settlor is residing in the home. However, in the case of a property held in a trust, beneficiaries would often include a settlor who is residing in the home. The policy intent behind this question is to provide an indication of whether the property being transferred is a main home. The phrasing of the question is intended to strike a balance between simplicity to answer and accuracy of indicating whether a tax obligation is likely. By using a 50 percent test, the intention is that it should be relatively simple for a transferor to determine whether the transfer is a main home transfer as they only need to know the length of ownership and the time they have lived in the property rules. Where a property held in trust and is transferred by a trustee, the trustee should answer the main home indicator based on their knowledge of the beneficiaries residing in the house. Example 1: Transfer of main home in family trust In August 2000, Madeleine and Ed brought a home on Beach Street to live in with their children and subsequently settled the property in a trust (Madeleine and Ed’s family trust). On 1 March 2020, Mark, as a trustee of Madeleine and Ed’s trust, enters into an agreement to sell the house to Mr and Mrs Green. As trustee, Mark completes a Land Transfer Tax Statement, and completes the tax details section of the form, including the trust’s IRD number. As the transfer includes land with a home on it, Mark also completes the question asking whether the transfer is a main home transfer. As a transferor who is a trustee, Mark looks at whether a beneficiary of Madeleine and Ed’s trust has resided in the home on Beach Street for more than 50% of the time that this trust has owned the property. Madeleine and Ed have lived in the Beach Street house with their children since August 2000. Madeleine, Ed and their children are beneficiaries of the trust. Accordingly, they indicate that the home is a main home. Example 2: Sale of second home Felix owns two houses, one on Land Street and one situated on River Street. In February 2020, Felix sells his River Street property to Marama. Felix bought his River Street property in 1985. In 1998 he bought residential land on Land Street, where he built a new house. In early 2000 Felix moved into the newly built home on Land Street. Felix works out that he has owned the River Street property for 35 years and has lived in it for approximately 15 years. Because he has not lived in the River Street property for greater than 50 percent of the time he has owned it, he does not indicate that it is a main home. Transferee’s intention to reside For transferees, a main home transfer is defined as transfers involving a home where the natural person transferee intends to reside in the home, or when a trustee is the transferee, where a beneficiary of the trust intends to reside in the home. For transferees the answer will depend on their intention at the time of purchase. For example, whether they intend to reside in it as their main home, if it is a second home which is intended to be rented out, or if they intend to use it for some of the year. The use of the word “reside” is intended to convey a stronger connection than simply staying in the property. The definition differentiates between when it is a person’s main home where they live and a property where they spend some of their time. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 81 NEW LEGISLATION In some cases, a person may have multiple intentions as to how they will use the property, particularly over time. If a person intends to rent out the property, with the potential of living in it for a short period of time, for the purpose of the main home indicator, their intention is most likely not to reside in the home. Example 3: Purchase of second home Mr and Mrs Green enter into an agreement to buy the Beach Street house. As transferees they are asked whether they intend to reside in the home to indicate whether the Beach Street house will be their main home. Mr and Mrs Green currently own a house in Piccadilly Lane, they intend to spend the summer holidays with their grandchildren in Beach Street and rent it out throughout the year. They intend to continue to reside in Piccadilly Lane, accordingly they indicate the Beach Street house is not a main home. Transitional provisions Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Land Transfer Act 2017 sets out transitional provisions that are intended to ensure that contracts for transfers that are in place before the commencement date of the legislation (1 January 2020), and are lodged for registration on or before 1 July 2020, are subject to the Land Transfer Tax Statement requirements that were in place before these changes. This means that transfers where agreement is entered into before 1 January 2020 may qualify as a non-notifiable transfer if the main home criteria are met, and the transfer is lodged for registration on or before 1 July 2020. Non-notifiable reasons may be used for transfers involving offshore persons Current rules regarding when a non-notifiable transfer may apply, exclude all transfers by an offshore person. The amendments remove this restriction, repealing the definition of “offshore person” in section 77 of the LTA. This reflects that the restriction was directed at the main home category of non-notifiable transfers and, has negligible relevance to the other categories of non-notifiable transfers. EXTENDING THE TAX EXEMPTION FOR NON-RESIDENT OFFSHORE OIL RIG AND SEISMIC VESSEL OPERATORS Section CW 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Section CW 57 contains a temporary exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators. This exemption was due to expire on 1 January 2020, but has been extended to 31 December 2024. Background Offshore rigs and seismic vessels operated by non-residents are covered by an exemption in section CW 57. These rigs and vessels are used to drill for oil and gas and gather data on potential oil and gas finds. There is a worldwide market in rigs and seismic vessels. No New Zealand company owns offshore rigs or seismic vessels, so any company wishing to explore in New Zealand waters needs to use a rig or seismic vessel provided by a non-resident owner. Section CW 57 was introduced to deal with a problem created by our double tax agreements (DTAs). New Zealand generally taxes non-residents on income that has a source in New Zealand. However, our DTAs provide that non-residents are only taxable on their New Zealand-sourced business profits if they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. Many of our DTAs (such as the New Zealand-United States DTA) have a specific rule providing that a non-resident enterprise involved in exploring for natural resources only has a permanent establishment in New Zealand if they are present for a particular period of time, often 183 days in a year. Once a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, they are taxed on all their New Zealand business profits starting from day one. The issue caused by this DTA provision was that seismic vessels and rigs used in petroleum exploration were leaving New Zealand waters before the 183-day limit was reached so they would not be subject to New Zealand tax. This meant that, in some cases, a rig would leave before 183 days and a different rig was mobilised to complete the exploration programme. This “churning” of rigs increased the cost for companies engaged in exploration and had the potential to delay exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery of oil or gas. A temporary five-year exemption from tax on the income of non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators was introduced in 2004. This exemption was previously rolled over in 2009 and 2014 for a further five years and would have expired on 31 December 2019 if not for the further extension. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 82 NEW LEGISLATION Key features The temporary tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators in section CW 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been extended to 31 December 2024. Application date(s) The exemption takes effect at the expiry of the existing exemption, on 1 January 2020. SECURITISED PRE-1990 FOREST LAND EMISSIONS UNITS Sections CX 54B, DB 17B, EW 5 and EW 52B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to treat certain securitisation transactions involving pre-1990 forest land emissions units according to their economic substance. Background New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) distinguishes between pre-1990 forest land and post-1989 forest land, 1990 being the base year of measurement under the Paris agreementon climate change. The scheme places mandatory deforestation obligations on exotic forests that were first established before 1990, referred to as ‘pre-1990 forests’. This means if pre-1990 landowners choose to deforest, for example when converting forest land to a different use, they face ‘deforestation liabilities’ under the ETS, have to report on emissions and surrender an equivalent amount of New Zealand emission units to the Government. When the ETS was introduced, owners of ‘pre-1990 forests’, were able to apply for a one-off free allocation of New Zealand emissions units. This allocation was intended to recognise the possible impact on land values due to the cost New Zealand’s ETS places on deforesting, and the resulting reduction in land-use flexibility for owners of pre-1990 forests. The Income Tax Act also distinguishes between pre-1990 forestry emissions units and post-1989 forestry emissions units. As a transitional measure, the first disposal of emissions units by taxpayers who received the initial allocation of pre-1990 emission units is generally not treated as income under the Income Tax Act. Subsequent transactions are subject to normal tax treatment on disposal. The special tax treatment for pre-1990 emission units reflects the transitional nature of those units under the ETS, as outlined above. All sales of post-1989 units are taxable. Some long-term owners of pre-1990 forests have been interested in extracting more value from the emissions units they hold, through agreements involving the sale and compulsory buy back of the units. This is a form of “securitisation”. Securitisation involves using a long-term asset as security in return for a payment for up to the asset’s worth that is repayable at a specified later date, usually with interest. The borrower can use the asset for the period but the expectation is that the asset or an asset of an equivalent nature will be returned to the original holder when the monies are paid back. The previous tax rules proved to be an impediment to such transactions because they followed the legal form rather than the economic substance of the transactions. When a taxpayer sells property, such as pre-1990 forest land emission units, with a compulsory obligation to buy the same or equivalent property back, the tax rules were treating the transaction as a disposal with the buyback being a separate purchase. By treating the sale and compulsory buy-back arrangement as a disposal for tax purposes, the benefit of the tax transitional treatment for pre-1990 forest land emissions units was effectively lost as any subsequent sale would be taxable, making such transactions unviable. Economically, the set of transactions is in substance a loan or lease of property. The tax consequences should, therefore, treat it as such by using the difference in net cash flows to measure any income, expenditure or loss arising from the transactions. A netting approach is more consistent with existing tax policy frameworks when economic ownership of the asset is not surrendered. This was the approach used in the tax rules that have been in place since 2006 to enable sales and compulsory buybacks of shares to, in effect, be treated as loans (see the share lending rules 39 ). The new tax rules, therefore, treat securitisation transactions involving pre-1990 forest land emissions units on a similar basis. Overall, these changes are intended to facilitate the monetisation of assets that might otherwise be locked away, so that the assets can generate income for their owners and the underlying beneficiaries. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 83 NEW LEGISLATION Post-1989 New Zealand emission units are treated as revenue account property and transactions involving the sale and compulsory buy-back are taxable in the year of sale and deductible in the year of repurchase. As such, the tax disincentives for these transactions are not as marked. Submissions made to the Finance and Expenditure Committee during the consideration of the legislation suggested that there is also, in principle, a case for extending the new provisions to post-1989 forests. Consideration of other securitised assets has been included in the tax policy work programme. Key features Various sections of the Income Tax Act have been changed to ensure securitisation transactions involving pre-1990 emissions units are treated as a loan for income tax purposes. This is achieved by treating the arrangement as a financial arrangement with an attached excepted financial arrangement under new section EW 5(11B). The excepted financial arrangement is the assignment of the pre-1990 forest land emissions units by the holder to a person who is not an associated person (the lender) and the later (compulsory) assignment of the same or other New Zealand emissions units by the lender to the holder. The amendments, therefore, provide for the following tax treatment: • The sale of the emissions units and the return of the equivalent units is ignored for both parties. Instead, there is a loan between the two parties. The interest flows earned/paid by both parties on the borrowed/lent funds would be taxable/deductible. • If the acquirer of the units on-sells them, any gain or loss on selling the units to a third party would be taxable or deductible according to the ordinary rules that apply to the sales of forest land emissions units. Ignoring the sale transaction in this instance also means that the emissions units retain their one-off tax-free status on disposal. Interest The financial arrangement rules now apply to the “interest” component only. For example, the “interest” paid by the original unitholder is the difference between the amounts they receive from assigning the units and the total amounts they pay the lender under the arrangement. Accordingly, under new section DB 17B, the lender is denied a deduction for the amount they have lent to the original holder of the units as a result of the transfer of the units. Change in value of the collateral Because the same amount of units is being returned, changes in the value of the emissions units are ignored. Under new section CX 54B, the amount that relates to the market value of an emissions unit under a transfer of the excepted financial arrangement is excluded income. Moreover, under section EW 52B(4)(c), the original unit and the returned unit are treated as having a value for the unit holder equal to the cost of the original unit for the unit holder. Sales to third parties Any gain or loss made by the lender from subsequently selling the units to a third party and later purchasing replacement units is taxable. The lender is taxed on all the proceeds from the sale of the units to a third party. The cost base for the units they have sold is zero (see new section EW 52B(4)(d)(ii)). However, similar to the share lending rules, the lender is able to deduct the cost of the replacement units that they acquire in order to meet their obligation to return units to the original holder. Example The lender sells 1,000 units to a third party for $20 per unit. The lender is taxed on $20 per unit as the cost base for the units is $0. The taxable income is $20,000. The lender subsequently purchases 1,000 units for $15 to meet their obligation to return units to the original holder. The lender is allowed a deduction of $15,000. Overall, the lender is taxed on the net gain of $5000 (that is, $20,000 − $0 − $15,000). Preservation of the one-off tax free status of the units Provided the requirements of the arrangement are fulfilled, the original owner of the units is considered to hold the units throughout the arrangement under new section EW 52B(2) and (4). This non-recognition of a disposal by the original owner means that the one-off tax free status of the units on disposal is preserved for the purposes of section CX 51B, because the returned units continue to meet the definition of a “pre-1990 forest land emissions unit”. 39 See Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 18, No.5 (June 2006), pages 86-94. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 84 NEW LEGISLATION When units are not returned by the agreed date Parties that have entered into a securitisation arrangement in good faith are entitled to apply the new provisions on the assumption that the arrangement is fulfilled as agreed. However, if the units are not returned by the date that the parties have agreed, the arrangement is effectively unwound for tax purposes. The consequences of failing to make a timely return are set out in new section EW 52B(5). The original disposal of the units will then be treated as an ordinary disposal on the date the arrangement began. Application date The amendments apply to transactions entered into in the 2018–19 income year, or any subsequent income year, that involve the securitisation of pre-1990 forest land emissions units. EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS Section RD 7B This amendment gives companies offering employee share schemes (ESSs) the option of making an irrevocable election (at the time a share benefit is offered) to withhold tax from the benefit when it is provided to the employee. If made, this irrevocable election creates a statutory obligation on the company to pay the PAYE on the benefit. This statutory obligation will also apply to replacement awards, so an election cannot be revoked by simply issuing a replacement benefit without the withholding obligation. These changes are intended to provide a legislative framework that more clearly allows a company to meet the requirements to adopt equity-settled accounting treatment for the withheld tax under international financial reporting standards (IFRS) (though whether or not it does so will be for the company’s auditors to determine). Background Before 2017, calculating and paying the tax liability for a benefit provided under an ESS was the responsibility of the employee receiving the benefit. Since 2017, employers have been able to elect to withhold and remit PAYE on the benefit to Inland Revenue. If an employer elects to withhold tax on the benefit only when the benefit is provided, they are required under international financial reporting standards (IFRS) to use ‘cash settled’ accounting treatment in relation to the tax portion of the benefit. Any fluctuations in the amount of the tax portion between the time the benefit is offered and the time the shares are provided to the employee must be reflected in the company’s annual accounts, which increases volatility in its financial reports. Companies may prefer ‘equity settled’ accounting treatment, which in general terms allows the initial value of the benefit expected to be provided to the employee (being the expected value of the shares and the tax payment) to be expensed in straight-line fashion over the period until the share is actually given to the employee and the tax is paid. In relation to the tax portion of the benefit, this treatment can only apply if the company has a ‘tax obligation.’ The previous legislation did not create a tax obligation for employers to withhold tax on benefits provided under ESSs until the time the benefit was in fact provided. Key features Section RD 7B now gives an employer the choice to make an irrevocable election to withhold PAYE in relation to a grant made under an ESS, creating a tax obligation to withhold that cannot be revoked. This is in addition to the existing ability to choose to withhold when benefits are provided. Application date(s) The amended section RD 7B applies from the date of Royal Assent of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. BENEFICIARIES AS SETTLORS Section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007 An amendment has been made to the trust rules to ensure that, in certain circumstances where an amount of income is allocated by a trust to a beneficiary but retained by the trust, such beneficiaries do not become settlors. Prior to this amendment, where no interest was paid by the trust to the beneficiary on such amounts, the beneficiary became a settlor of the trust. This was because by transferring value to the trust (via the provision of interest-free funds) the beneficiary met the definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In certain cases, such an outcome was an overreach of this provision. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 85 NEW LEGISLATION Background Beneficiaries of trusts could inadvertently become the settlors of such trusts when the following conditions were met: • Trustees allocated an amount of money (for example, beneficiary income) to a beneficiary. • The money was not paid out to the beneficiary but instead was retained in the beneficiary’s current account with the trust and was used as working capital of the trust. • The beneficiary did not receive interest or other return on the money retained by the trust. Such beneficiaries became settlors in relation to the amount of interest that had not been paid to them, because they “transferred value” to the trust by leaving money in the trust interest-free and, therefore, met the definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Treating such beneficiaries as settlors could have impacted their entitlement to Working for Families, increased their student loan repayment obligations, made them accountable for tax on the trustee income for certain trusts, or inadvertently increased the number of persons associated with the trust. Key features New section HC 27(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ensures that where a beneficiary of a trust has a current account balance that is not greater than $25,000 at the end of the income year, they do not become a settlor of the trust. Also, under the amendment, a safe harbour is provided so that if the prescribed rate of interest is paid by the trust to a beneficiary, such beneficiaries do not become settlors. For consistency with other legislative provisions, the prescribed interest rate is the same as the rate used to determine whether there is a fringe benefit in relation to a low-interest loan provided to an employee. The current prescribed rate is 5.77% per annum. A resolution authorising the payment of interest to such beneficiaries should be passed by the earlier of the date the trust files its return and the last day for filing the return for that income year. Interest on the whole amount has to commence no later than the start of the subsequent income year. Interest payments (which constitute income for tax purposes) can be made by way of a journal entry crediting the beneficiary’s current account with the trust, or be paid out to the beneficiary. Example For the 2020-21 income year, the trustees of the JS Trust allocate $30,000 of beneficiary income to John. The trust retains the money in John’s current account with the trust. John has a student loan, so to ensure John does not become a settlor, the trustees resolve to pay the prescribed rate of interest annually on the whole amount of the credit retained in John’s current account ($30,000) from 1 April 2021. The JS trust has a standard income year and has a tax agent, so is required to file its return by 31 March 2022. The trustee resolution must be made no later than the earlier of the date the return is filed and 31 March 2022. Interest is calculated from 1 April 2021 and must be paid no later than 31 March 2022. John has beneficiary income of $30,000 to include in his 2020-21 tax return and interest income to include in his 2021-22 tax return. $25,000 de minimis Beneficiaries who leave a significant amount in their current accounts with a trust at no or below the market rate of interest are intended to be treated as settlors. The $25,000 de minimis ensures that beneficiaries with relatively modest current account balances should not be treated as settlors. This limit is needed to maintain the integrity of social policies, such as Working for Families and student loans (as the forgone interest on current account balances could affect these entitlements and obligations). Setting the threshold at $25,000 means using the current prescribed rate of interest (5.77%) on a balance of $25,001 would equate to $1,442.55 of interest income per annum. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. This allows trustees of trusts with beneficiaries with current account credits to evaluate their position. The operational position on page 113 covers the treatment of beneficiaries with credits in their current accounts with trusts before 1 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 86 NEW LEGISLATION CO-OPERATIVE COMPANIES: NON-DEDUCTIBLE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS Sections DV 18, OB 78B, OB 82, and OZ 15 The amendments clarify that a co-operative company may elect to make a fully imputed cash distribution of profits attributable to a specific group of shareholders of the company, provided: • the company’s constitution permits distributions to be made to a specific group of members; and • the amount paid to each shareholder is determined in proportion to the level of trading activity between the members and the company. Key features The amendment permits a co-operative company registered under the Cooperative Companies Act 1996 to choose to distribute to a specific group of its shareholders those profits that are attributable only to that group of shareholders as either: • an association rebate (tax deductible); or • a fully imputed cash distribution (non-deductible) which is treated as a dividend. The amendment improves the consistency of the imputation rules with co-operative business practices, such as the use of pool systems to incentivise a higher quality of supply from members. Application date(s) The amendments apply for non-deductible cash distributions made on or after the date of Royal assent. Detailed analysis The amendments improve the consistency of the imputation rules and general tax settings for co-operative companies registered under the Cooperative Companies Act 1996. The amendments provide consistency with both: • cooperative principles included in the Cooperative Companies Act 1996; and • commercial practices in the co-operative sector. Currently, a co-operative company registered under the Cooperative Companies Act 1996 may choose to distribute its profits generated from co-operative activity either as: • a tax-deductible distribution (the association rebate) under section DV 19; or • a non-deductible cash distribution (with imputation credits attached), which is treated as a dividend paid to the shareholder under section OB 78. However, the requirements of section OB 78 has resulted in the provision not being used to make non-deductible cash distributions because it requires the distribution to be made to all shareholders. This has proved to be inconsistent with cooperative business practices relating to groups of shareholders who choose to provide goods to the cooperative company at a minimum standard of quality (product pool). This amendment is mostly relevant to co-operative companies that adopt product pools to incentivise a higher quality of supply from members to the co-operative. Under the terms of such practices, only shareholders choosing to participate in these arrangements can receive profit distributions from these pools (participating members). This is consistent with provisions of the Cooperative Companies Act 1996 that permit distributions to be made to such participating members based on trading transactions between the members and the company. New section OB 78B of the Income Tax Act 2007 aligns the imputation rules more closely with the effect of these provisions in the Cooperative Companies Act 1996. As noted above, members may elect into such a pool system, and only those participating members can receive distributions of such pool profits. Tax payable on these pool profits is economically borne by those participating members. New section OB 78B ensures that the benefit of the related imputation credits from tax paid on those pool profits may be allocated proportionately only to those participating members. Sections DV 18, OB 82, and OZ 15 are updated to include a cross-reference to new section OB 78B. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 87 NEW LEGISLATION PRE-CONSOLIDATION IMPUTATION CREDITS Section 244(4) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 The amendment in section 244 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 (“The ARMTARM Act”) contained incorrect date references. This amendment corrects those dates to ensure the savings provision in section OP 22(4) works as intended for tax positions taken by a consolidated imputation group for the transfer of pre-consolidation imputation credits to the group imputation credit account (“ICA”) for periods ending on or before 1 April 2019. Background Under section OP 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a consolidated imputation group may transfer a pre-consolidation imputation credit from a member company’s ICA to the group ICA if all the following are satisfied: • at any time, a debit entry is made to the group ICA (for example, by attaching imputation credits to a dividend); • the debit entry results in a debit balance in the group ICA; • at the time the debit balance arises, a member company of the group has a pre-consolidation credit balance in its ICA; • the amount transferred from the member company’s ICA to the group ICA does not exceed the debit balance in the group ICA; and • shareholder continuity requirements are met. Submissions were received requesting a review of the policy for the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits. These submissions asked that consideration be given to the comments expressed on the policy for the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits set out in the Discussion Document: Business Tax Policy — 30 July 1991. Section 244(3) of the ARMTARM Act provides a savings provision allowing the Government time to consider the relative priority of this review in terms of the tax policy work programme. The savings provision protects a tax position taken for a period beginning on or after 1 April 2008 and before 1 April 2021 if the amount of a pre-consolidation credit transferred to the group ICA: • exceeds the amount allowed to be transferred under section OP 22; and • does not exceed the debit balance that has arisen in the ICA of the consolidated imputation group. Some consolidated groups have taken tax positions that involve a transfer of pre-consolidation credits in excess of the amount allowed under the savings provision in section 244(3) of the ARMTARM ACT. These excess amounts have resulted in over- distributions of imputation credits, and therefore a liability for further income tax arises (which, when paid, is treated as tax paid by the consolidated imputation group). As these excess distributions would require past years’ ICA returns to be refiled, a transitional provision was enacted in section 244(4) of the ARMTARM Act to minimise compliance and administration obligations for these returns. The transitional provision in section 244(4) of the ARMTARM Act is intended to remove the need to refile past year ICA returns, by allowing the payment of further imputation tax, and the adjustments to the ICA for the overdistribution of imputation credits, to be accumulated and accounted for in the 2019-20 tax year. However, this provision contained incorrect date references, and these are now corrected to ensure the rule works as intended. Key features The due date of payment for further income tax arising from adjustments to past years ICA returns is 7 March 2020. Example: Adjustment for transfer of excess pre-consolidation imputation credit The following example illustrates how the transitional provision in section 244(4) of the ARMTARM Act should apply when a consolidated imputation group has transferred pre-consolidation imputation credits in any period beginning on or after 1 April 2008 and before 1 April 2019. This example is based on the following assumed facts: • Company A and Company B are in a consolidated group, which is also a consolidated imputation group. The opening balance of the group ICA at 1 April 2016 is $1,000. • Company B, another company in the consolidated group, has a pre-consolidation ICA credit balance of $100,000 at 1 April 2016. • The group pays $30,000 of income tax in April 2016; Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 88 NEW LEGISLATION • Company A pays a dividend in September 2016 with $60,000 imputation credits attached; • The group transfers the entire amount of the pre-consolidation credit balance of company B to the Group ICA following the payment of the dividend in September 2016; • The group pays $50,000 of income tax in April 2017; • Company A pays a dividend with $100,000 imputation credits attached in September 2017; • The group pays $60,000 of income tax in April 2018; and • Company A pays a dividend with $61,000 imputation credits attached in September 2018. Section 244(3) of the ARMTARM Act (a savings provision for existing tax positions) protects a tax position taken for the transfer of an amount of a pre-consolidation credit that: • exceeds the amount allowed to be transferred under section OP 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and • does not exceed the amount of the debit entry to the Group ICA that results in the group ICA having a debit balance after the dividend is paid. In this example, the amount transferred from the pre-consolidated credit balance of company B ($100,000) exceeds the amount of the debit entry to the group ICA ($640,000) and therefore section 244(4) of the ARMTARM Act applies. As set out in Table 1 below, section 244(4) requires an adjustment of $40,000 to be made for the 2016-17 tax year for both the group’s ICA and company B’s ICA.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 89 NEW LEGISLATION APPLICATION OF THE COMMON REPORTING STANDARD TO CORPORATE TRUSTEES Sections 104, 105, Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 185O and Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) have been amended to clarify the application of the O E C D ’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS) to a financial institution that is an Investment Entity or Custodial Institution for CRS purposes. Background The CRS is a global standard that was incorporated by reference into New Zealand law in 2017. Incorporation by reference effectively means that the provisions of the CRS and its official OECD commentary themselves have legal effect in New Zealand. Under the CRS, financial institutions must undertake specified due diligence procedures to identify non residents holding (and, in certain circumstances, controlling) financial accounts in New Zealand and report information on those non-residents to Inland Revenue. The reported information is then exchanged with other countries under tax treaties, to assist those jurisdictions in the detection and prevention of offshore tax evasion. The exchanges are reciprocal, meaning that New Zealand also receives information from its tax treaty partners on offshore accounts held (or controlled) by New Zealand residents. After implementation in 2017, an ambiguity was detected in a technical aspect of the CRS. Under the CRS, the definition of financial institution includes a category of Investment Entity which is managed by another entity. With respect to the managing entity, the definition explicitly refers to “the Entity’s gross income ...”. This raises the question of whether the entity needs to be directly remunerated for the definition to be satisfied, or whether indirect remuneration for the entity’s activities/services is also covered (i.e. when another group member receives the remuneration). The issue primarily seems to arise in the case of a managing entity that is a corporate trustee, but it may also apply for other types of managing entity. It could potentially also have relevance for the Custodial Institution category of financial institution. Inland Revenue has always maintained (and stated in its guidance material) that the issue is determined by the nature of the activities/services that the entity performs and that are remunerated, irrespective of which group member actually receives the remuneration for those services (i.e. it is common for a professional firm to invoice a client for services performed by a corporate trustee). This position reflects the clear policy intent and international consensus on the matter and is supported by references in the commentary and in the applicable Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, which underpin the CRS. The OECD has also updated its website to include specific clarification on this point (as a Frequently Asked Question). However, to give certainty to those with CRS obligations in New Zealand and to ensure New Zealand complies with its international obligations, New Zealand’s legislation has also been amended to clarify the point. Key features The inserted clarification states that a reference in a definition to “the Entity’s gross income ...” is to be treated as meaning the total gross income arising for the entity and other entities that is attributable to the entity’s performance of the activities in question. Section 185O and Schedule 2 of the TAA already allowed for New Zealand specific modifications to the CRS. To accommodate clarifications as well as modifications, Schedule 2 has been restructured into two parts and section 185O amended to reflect the new structure. Modifications of the CRS are now located in Part 1 of Schedule 2, and modifications to and clarifications of the CRS Commentary are in Part 2 of Schedule 2. Accordingly, this clarification has been inserted as item 1 of Part 2. Application date(s) These amendments apply retrospectively from 1 July 2017, the original start date for CRS obligations in New Zealand. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 90 NEW LEGISLATION LOSS OF EARNINGS INSURANCE Section CG 5B(2) The amendment clarifies that loss of earnings insurance proceeds are taxable in all circumstances, including when the rights to receive these proceeds are assigned to another person. Background Taxpayers manage risk of business interruption by taking out loss of earnings insurance. When a business experiences a period of economic loss due to an adverse event (for example, an earthquake or fire), it can receive compensation for loss of earnings. Since these proceeds are income of the business, they are subject to income tax. After the Canterbury earthquake in 2011, a question arose about the tax treatment of amounts received from an assignment of the right to receive an insurance claim made under a loss of earnings policy. The policy intent is to tax loss of earnings compensation, irrespective of whether the right to receive the compensation has been assigned to a third party. Key features The amended section CG 5B(2) clarifies that a person who has been assigned the right to receive compensation proceeds, from an interruption or impairment of business activities, will be taxed in the same way that the assignor would have been taxed. Application date(s) This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2011-12 income year. However, it does not apply to a person who, during the period from the beginning of the 2011-12 income year to the date of Royal Assent of this Act, took a tax position relying on the wording of section CG 5B(2) prior to this amendment. GST EXEMPTION FOR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY THAT IS SOLD AFTER BEING SUB-LET FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS Section 14(1)(d) of the GST Act Background Most sales of residential land are not subject to GST as they are either not sold by GST-registered persons or are not part of the GST-registered person’s taxable activity. However, if a GST-registered person is regularly selling residential land, then they may have a taxable activity of selling property and so they may have to apply GST when they sell residential land. An exception to this is when the land has been exclusively used by the GST-registered landowner to provide residential rental accommodation for five or more years. In this case the sale of the land will be exempt from GST under section 14(1)(d) of the GST Act 1985. The original exemption required the land-owner to have rented the dwelling to the ultimate residential tenant. It did not apply to sub-letting arrangements where a GST-registered land-owner has let the property to a housing provider who has sub-let it to tenants for five or more years. This meant that such sub-letting arrangements could be disadvantaged relative to similar arrangements where the property owner had let the property directly to the tenant. This type of sub-letting arrangement has become increasingly common, particularly for social housing providers. Key features The exemption in section 14(1)(d) of the GST Act has been expanded so it also exempts the sale of the residential property by a GST registered person where the property has been sub-let to tenants for five or more years. It achieves this by referring to the existing exemption for supplies of residential accommodation under a sub-leasing arrangement in section 14(1)(cb) of the GST Act. Prior to this amendment the exemption for a sale of a residential property in section 14(1)(d) could only apply where the GST- registered owner of the residential property had directly rented out the property (or the land underneath the property) to a residential tenant for five or more years. Application date The amendment to section 14(1)(d) applies from 26 July 2019. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 91 NEW LEGISLATION Example Homes Co is a GST registered company with a taxable activity of regularly buying and selling land. In 2010, Homes Co purchases land which includes a twenty-five unit residential apartment complex. Homes Co rents ten of the units directly to residential tenants and rents fifteen of the units to a community housing provider who sub-lets the properties to various residential tenants. The supplies made by Homes Co of renting all twenty units are exempt from GST under sections 14(1)(c) and (cb) of the GST Act. In 2020, Homes Co decides to sell the land and all of the units in the residential apartment complex to a GST registered property developer. The sale of the land and the residential apartment units will be exempt under 14(1)(d) as all of the units were exclusively used for 5 or more years to make exempt supplies under section 14(1)(c) or 14(1)(cb). Because the sale of the land by Homes Co is an exempt supply, the zero-rating rule for supplies of land to another GST registered person in section 11(1)(mb) does not apply. This means the GST registered property developer who purchases the land may be able to claim a second-hand goods input tax credit deduction in respect of the tax fraction of their purchase price. The GST registered property developer will return GST when they sell the re-developed properties. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 92 NEW LEGISLATION Remedial amendments GST - CAPITAL RAISING COSTS Section 20H of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Amendments have been made to clarify the scope of the rules allowing GST-registered persons to deduct GST incurred on costs of raising capital. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 inserted section 20H into the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The section allows GST-registered businesses to recover GST on their costs of raising capital to fund a taxable activity and applied from 1 April 2017. Under the rules that applied prior to 1 April 2017, the exempt treatment of financial services posed a problem when businesses that principally made taxable supplies incurred costs to raise capital, such as through the issue of bonds or shares. Examples of such capital raising costs include NZX listing fees, legal fees and costs associated with preparing a product disclosure statement. The GST incurred in relation to these costs was potentially unrecoverable because the provision of equity and debt securities is an exempt supply of financial services. Section 20H allows businesses which principally make taxable supplies to recover the GST incurred on goods and services used to raise capital for their taxable activities. In line with the policy intent, the rules do not apply when a business principally supplies financial services, or if they have elected to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services and a deduction is already available as a result of the business-to-business zero-rating rules. However, there were some minor technical ambiguities and errors in section 20H. Amendments have therefore been made to clarify the scope of the rules to ensure that the policy intent is achieved. Key features The amendments make remedial changes to the rules allowing GST-registered persons to deduct GST incurred on goods and services acquired for capital raising purposes. In particular, the changes: • clarify that the relevant deduction available under the rules is of input tax on supplies of goods and services made to the registered person that are used for the capital raising transaction; • provide that a deduction is available for goods and services acquired by the registered person, to the extent that a deduction would be available under the ordinary rules if the goods and services were used in the person’s usual business activity (instead of being used in the capital raising activity); • clarify that a GST-registered business which intends to principally make taxable supplies but is not currently making any taxable supplies (such as a start-up), or which raises capital in excess of the value of its taxable supplies, can claim deductions for capital raising costs under the rules; • clarify that GST-registered persons are entitled to claim input tax deductions for capital raising costs in situations where the funds raised are used to refinance a taxable activity of the registered person; and • ensure that input tax deductions for capital raising costs are also available in situations where the funds are ultimately used in a taxable activity by a different company in the same group of companies as the company that carried out the capital raising transaction. Application date The amendments apply on and after 1 April 2017, being the date that the GST rules specifically allowing input tax deductions for capital raising costs came into force. A savings provision has been enacted to protect tax positions taken prior to the date of enactment (being 26 June 2019) in cases where taxpayers did not make a deduction of input tax for capital raising costs on the basis of the previous law. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 93 NEW LEGISLATION Detailed analysis Reference to deduction of input tax for the supplies of financial services An amendment to section 20H(1) is proposed to rectify an inaccuracy in the introductory wording that a registered person has “a deduction under section 20(3)(hd) of input tax for the supplies of financial services”. The proposed amendment clarifies that the deduction would be for input tax on supplies made to the registered person (for example, legal services) that are used to make the relevant supplies of financial services (being the raising of debt or equity). Refinancing a taxable activity The introductory words to section 20H(1) referred to an “activity of raising funds that are intended for use by the registered person for expenditure in a taxable activity". Former paragraph (d) of the section also contained a similar phrase. In many cases, the funds that are raised through issuing debt or equity securities will be used to repay existing debt that was incurred to finance a registered person’s taxable activity. It is unclear that repayment of debt would be regarded as “expenditure in a taxable activity”. However, there was no policy intention to distinguish between capital-raisings where funds are used for that purpose and ones where funds are used for other “taxable activity” purposes, such as acquiring new assets. The amendments to paragraphs (a) and (e) clarify that registered persons are entitled to claim input tax deductions for capital raising costs in situations where it is intended that the funds planned to be raised would be used to refinance the registered person’s taxable activity (provided that the other conditions of section 20H(1) are met). “Principally makes taxable supplies” Section 20H(1) required that the registered person principally made taxable supplies in order to be entitled to claim input tax deductions for capital raising costs under the rules. This requirement meant that the law did not technically allow GST-registered businesses to make input tax deductions for capital raising costs in the following situations: • The business intends to make taxable supplies but is not currently making any taxable supplies. This could include start-ups that raise capital in advance of making any taxable supplies. • An established business makes taxable supplies but raises capital in excess of the value of those taxable supplies (meaning that it would not meet the “principally” test). To ensure input tax deductions for capital raising costs can be made in either of the two situations described above, the introductory wording of section 20H(1) has been amended. The provision now refers to a registered person who “is, or intends to be, principally making supplies that would be taxable supplies in the absence of the supplying of the financial services \[made to raise capital\]”. Capital raising undertaken by different group company to that which uses the funds Where a capital raising transaction is carried out by a treasury company or a holding company, it may be another group company (such as the trading company) that ultimately uses the funds in a taxable activity (or to refinance a taxable activity). The wording of amended paragraphs (a), (c) and (e) ensures that input tax deductions are available to the company that ultimately uses the funds (or to the representative member if the group of companies has group-registered under section 55) in such situations where the capital raising transaction is carried out by another group company. Apportionment of input tax deductions Where a registered person carries on both taxable and exempt activities, the intention has always been that the amount of deduction claimed should be apportioned based on the extent to which the registered person makes taxable supplies as a proportion of their total supplies (excluding the capital raising supplies). However, this intended apportionment rule was not explicit in section 20H. New section 20H(1B) codifies this apportionment rule to make it explicit that registered persons that have an exempt activity (as well as a taxable activity) and who intend to use the funds raised for both activities are required to apportion input tax deductions for capital raising costs, where the apportionment ratio is based on their taxable supplies as a fraction of their total supplies (excluding the supplies of financial services made to raise capital). Example Pilkinton Properties is a property development company. Eighty percent of its supplies are taxable, and twenty percent are exempt. It issues a bond to raise capital in order to finance the purchase of land. In issuing the bond, it spends $11,500 in legal fees, including GST of $1,500. Pilkinton Properties claims a deduction of $1,200 (eighty percent of $1,500) based on Pilkinton Properties’ usual ratio of taxable to exempt supplies (excluding the bond issue itself). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 94 NEW LEGISLATION GST – DEFINITION OF “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” Section 2A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 The definition of “associated persons” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) has been amended to better align it with the original policy intent. Background The universal tripartite test of association in section 2A(1)(i) of the GST Act 1985 generally associates two persons, A and B, if person A is associated with a third person (person C) under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h), and person B is also associated with person C under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h). Section 2A(8) limits the universal tripartite test to prevent the tripartite test unintentionally increasing association past two degrees of blood relationship by chaining together associated relatives. For example, the limitation prevents an uncle and a nephew from being associated under the tripartite test only as a result of their blood relationship with the brother/father (or sister/mother). Key features Amendments have been made to rectify two issues relating to the universal tripartite test: • Under the previous law, it was possible that distant blood relations (such as an uncle and a nephew) could be associated because of the interaction of the universal tripartite test with the partnership and associate of a partner test in section 2A(1)(e). This is contrary to the policy intent. Further, the universal tripartite test means that the partnership and associate of partner test (as a type of “mini”-tripartite test) was not necessary. The partnership and associate of partner test has therefore been repealed. • A remedial amendment in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 inserted new section 2A(1)(hb) to associate a trustee of a trust with a person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee. However, an oversight meant the universal tripartite test was not updated to include a cross-reference to new paragraph (hb). An amendment inserts this cross-reference. Application date The amendments came into force on the date of enactment, being 26 June 2019. APPORTIONING GST FOR MIXED-USE ASSETS Section 20G(2)(a) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 An amendment has been made to the definition of “input tax for asset” which relates to the formula for apportioning input tax on mixed-use assets. The amended definition excludes expenditure solely related to taxable use of the asset, as well as expenditure solely related to non-taxable use of the asset. Background Section 20G of the GST Act is a special apportionment method for mixed-use assets that aims to apply a similar approach for GST as the approach that is used for income tax purposes under subpart DG of the Income Tax Act 2007. A typical example of a mixed-use asset is a holiday home which is used sometimes for family holidays, sometimes by members of the public for a fee, and unoccupied for the remaining period. The aim of subpart DG is to apportion the expenses relating to the unoccupied period according to the relative levels of private and income earning use. A key difference between the income tax rules and the GST rules is the treatment of associated party use of an asset. For income tax purposes, associated party use is considered to be private use, however, the same use is considered to be income-earning for GST purposes (taxable supply at open market value). The definition of “input tax for asset” in section 20G(2)(a) excluded expenditure related solely to the private use of the asset, as that term is defined in section DG 4 of the Income Tax Act. The issue was that private use of the asset included any use of the asset by a natural person who is associated with the person who owns or leases the asset, whether or not an amount of income is derived in relation to its use. This meant that asset owners were unable to claim input tax deductions for this use despite it being income earning use for GST purposes. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 95 NEW LEGISLATION Example 1 Otto, a GST-registered commercial accommodation provider, purchases a bach in Whangamata. Otto stays in the bach for around 30 days every year. He also rents it out to Jared, Otto’s son, for a market rate for approximately 30 days each year. The bach is not rented out to anyone else and is empty when not in use by Otto or Jared. As Jared is associated with Otto any use of the bach by Jared is private use, as that term is defined in section DG 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Therefore, Otto was unable to claim input tax deductions for expenditure on the bach. Key features In the exclusions from the definition of “input tax for asset” in section 20G(2)(a): • The reference to expenditure “related solely to the income-earning use of the asset as described in section DG 7 \[of the Income Tax Act 2007\]” has been replaced with expenditure “related solely to the taxable use of the asset” (see subparagraph (i)). • The reference to expenditure “related solely to the private use of the asset, as that term is defined in section DG 4 of that Act” has been replaced with expenditure “related solely to the non-taxable use of the asset” (see subparagraph (ii)). This means that where expenditure incurred by the person in relation to the use of the asset relates to both taxable (including associated party use) and non-taxable use, the amount of input tax for the asset under section 20G(2)(a) will be apportioned appropriately. Example 2 Consider Otto and Jared in the previous example. As the bach is used for 60 days every year and 30 days of that time relates to taxable use, Otto can make input tax deductions for 50% of his expenditure on the bach (input tax for asset × 30 days ÷ 60 days). Application date The amendment applies on and after 1 April 2013, the main application date of the mixed-use asset rules. TREATMENT OF ARRANGING SERVICES RELATING TO GOODS OFFSHORE Section 11A(1)(jbb) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 An amendment has been made to ensure that the arranging of services supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property located outside New Zealand is zero-rated, in line with the policy intent and the previous treatment that applied prior to 1 October 2016. Background The Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Act 2016 applied GST to supplies of “remote services” from non-residents to New Zealand-resident consumers with effect from 1 October 2016. It was recognised at the time that, for the new rules to work as intended, an amendment was needed to the zero-rating rule for services that are physically performed outside New Zealand. Section 11A(1)(j) was therefore amended so that services physically performed outside New Zealand (or that arrange services that are physically performed outside New Zealand) are zero-rated, provided that these services are not remote services supplied to a New Zealand resident who is not a registered person. Services which are provided in relation to goods located overseas may be “remote services” under the current definition in the GST Act – even though these services will be clearly zero-rated by section 11A(1)(f) if they are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand at the time of performance of the services. Given that an arranging service cannot be supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property, the 2016 amendment to section 11A(1)(j) meant that the arranging of these services would only be zero-rated if the (New Zealand- resident) recipient of the services was a registered person. This was an unintended policy change, as the general policy intention is that the GST treatment of an arranging service should follow that of the service being arranged. Key features New section 11A(1)(jbb) provides that services are zero-rated if they are the arranging of underlying services that are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 96 NEW LEGISLATION This zero-rating treatment applies if the moveable personal property is situated outside New Zealand at the time the underlying services are performed. The new section is not dependent on the residency status of the recipient of the services, nor whether the recipient is registered for GST. Example – arranging of storage of goods overseas and other associated services Sistinas Pty Ltd (Sistinas), an Australian company that is registered for GST in New Zealand, carries on a number of business activities related to e-commerce. One of these activities involves the facilitation of a range of underlying services related to goods stored in third-party warehouses in Australia (such as gift wrapping, handling, logistics and transportation) which are sold as bundled packages to customers resident in New Zealand. These customers are typically GST-registered e-commerce businesses selling goods into Australia, but may also include some non-registered microbusinesses and consumers. While most of the consideration paid by Sistinas’ customers relates to the core underlying services, Sistinas charges its customers a “preparation fee” relating to its facilitation services. Where one of these service packages is supplied to a person in New Zealand who is not a registered person, the underlying services are zero-rated under either section 11A(1)(a) or (f) as the supply of overseas transportation, or of services that are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand. Assuming that the arranging services are treated as supplied in New Zealand, section 11A(1)(jbb) applies to zero-rate these services. This means that the preparation fee is subject to GST at the rate of zero percent. Application date The amendment applies on and after 1 October 2016, being the date that the previous law change that inadvertently changed the GST treatment of certain arranging services came into force. BINDING RULINGS MINOR AMENDMENTS Sections 91CB and 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Two minor amendments have been made to two provisions in Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which contain the rules for binding rulings. Background Consistent with the “right-from-the-start” framework, amendments were made to the binding rulings provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 following the enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 to enable greater up-front certainty for taxpayers by extending the scope of matters that the Commissioner can issue binding rulings on. The amendments removed the prohibition on ruling a taxpayer’s purpose under certain provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The amendments also allow the Commissioner to issue binding rulings on more factual questions not involving “arrangements”, such as on a person’s New Zealand tax residence. 40 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 made two minor amendments that are necessary to ensure the binding rulings provisions operate as intended. Key features The amendments: • Improve the drafting of section 91CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which permits the Commissioner to issue binding rulings in respect of certain matters not involving arrangements. • Clarify that a private ruling made in relation to a matter not involving an arrangement no longer applies if the person’s circumstances differ materially from the circumstances to which the ruling was made. Application date(s) The amendments both take effect from 18 March 2019 which is the date from which the Commissioner has been able to issue binding rulings on certain matters not involving arrangements. 40 See section 91CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 97 NEW LEGISLATION Detailed analysis The Commissioner can, under section 91CB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, issue binding rulings on a person’s purpose under certain provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (such as whether an amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person under section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007, or whether an amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person under either sections CB 6 or CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007). Section 91CB(3)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 referred to the “principal purpose of making taxable supplies” test of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which was repealed following the enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. This provision has been repealed to clarify that the Commissioner will not be able to issue binding rulings on the “principal purpose of making taxable supplies” test. The other change amends section 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which outlines when a private ruling no longer has application. In particular, section 91EB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to provide that where a private ruling has been issued for a matter that does not involve an arrangement, the ruling no longer has effect if the circumstances of the person to whom the ruling applies are materially different from the circumstances described in the ruling. This is consistent with the purpose of section 91EB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which is to protect the revenue base from binding rulings given where there has been a material omission or representation in the application for the ruling or when the ruling could be applied in circumstances that are materially different from those outlined in the application. TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE: REMEDIAL CHANGE TO THE TRANSITIONAL RULES Section EY 30 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Changes have been made to the transitional rules for life insurance policies sold as “level premium” in response to the low rates of inflation experienced in New Zealand over recent years. “Level premium” life insurance policies are sold on the basis that premiums paid by the policyholder do not increase over a specified period, referred to as the “continuous rate period”. The amendment clarifies that level premium life insurance policies that provide for an increase in premiums as a direct result of an increase in the amount of life cover that does not exceed (whichever percentage is the higher) 3 percent or the percentage increase in the consumer price index (CPI) remain eligible for transitional relief. The amendment sets the measurement of CPI movements for the relevant life policy by reference to the preceeding four calendar quarters that is relevant to the life insurance policy’s cover review period or other anniversary. Section EY 30(5) has also been redrafted. Section EY 30(5)(b) sets the requirements for life insurers tax transitional relief for life insurance policies that were sold as “level premium” on or before 30 June 2010. New section EY 30(5)(BA) specifies the conditions when increases in premium caused by an increase in the amount of life cover are ignored for the purposes of section EY 30(5)(b). Application date The proposed changes apply from 1 July 2010 or the beginning of an income year that includes 1 July 2010. A savings provision was inserted in response to submissions on the bill and allows taxpayers to take an alternative tax position if it was filed before 26 June 2019 (the enactment date of the bill). REIMBURSEMENT ACC ATTENDANT CARE PAYMENTS Section LB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 An unintended consequence of an amendment previously made to exempt backdated ACC payments that reimburse ACC beneficiaries for care they have paid for, is that the tax credit for the tax withheld by ACC is passed through to the carer where it should be assigned to the claimant. This amendment rectifies this unintended consequence. Background ACC make payments to a number of ACC claimants who do not have full capacity and are unable to look after themselves. These payments are known as personal service rehabilitation payments and are paid under the Accident Compensation Act 2001 to help provide key aspects of rehabilitation such as attendant care, child care, home help, and training or transport for independence. The payments are treated as schedular payments and ACC withhold tax at a rate of 10.5%. The ACC claimants who are recipients of these payments can then on-pay this income to carers (attendant care payments) who provide services to the ACC claimants. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 98 NEW LEGISLATION An amendment was included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 (ARMTARM) to eliminate the double taxation that arose where a backdated payment was paid to a claimant. This double taxation arose because the payment would be taxed in the hands of the claimant when received from ACC, and in the hands of the carer who paid tax at their marginal rate when the income was derived (usually some years previously). The relevant legislation has been amended to ensure that this does not occur. However, because the ARMTARM amendments followed the payment structure that applied to ACC attendant care payments that were made in the current year for the purposes of determining the allocation of tax withheld by ACC, it failed to take into account that where a reimbursement payment is made the claimant has previously paid the carer a ‘gross’ amount and the carer would have paid tax on this amount. As applied, the amendments would deny the claimant a tax credit, and would allow the carer to claim a tax credit to which they were not entitled. Key features Section LB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to ensure that where a reimbursement payment is made, the recipient of the payment (claimant) will have a tax credit, rather than the provider (carer). The carer will still receive the tax credit under LB 7 for the tax withheld by ACC from an ACC attendant care payment that is not a reimbursement payment. Application date(s) This amendment applies from 1 April 2018 to ensure that the rule is in place for the 2018/19 tax year, which is the first year to which the new individual’s income tax rules apply. Detailed analysis The following example demonstrates that, under this amendment, the tax credit will be assigned to the claimant where a reimbursement ACC rehabilitation payment is made. This is necessary to ensure that the claimant is sufficiently reimbursed for payments they would have made from their own pocket in prior years. Example: Lumpsum backyear entitlement that reimburses the claimant for payments made to the carer Adam receives a reimbursement payment from ACC of $40,000 which covers attendant care payments he has made to Ben over the past four years ($10,000 per year) out of his own pocket. ACC withholds tax on the $40,000 payment in the year it is paid ($4,200). Ben has paid tax on the attendant care payments received over the last four years. To ensure that Adam is reimbursed for the $40,000 he has paid, the tax credit should be attributed to Adam.

Background An amendment was made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act (“ARMTARM”) to the ACC attendant care payment rules to eliminate the double taxation that occurs when a reimbursement payment is paid to a claimant. The amendment achieves this outcome by legislating that, where certain requirements are met, the reimbursement payment is exempt to the claimant. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 99 NEW LEGISLATION Where an ACC claimant has returned that income in a prior year, they must request that the Commissioner amends their assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will allow them to treat the payment as exempt income and therefore claim a tax refund. Prior to the amendment made in this Act, section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 acted as an impediment to the issuance of the refund due to the application of the time bar to amended assessments. Key features This amendment allows a taxpayer to claim a refund from an amended assessment outside the time bar period where the refund arises due to a reimbursement ACC attendant care payment. Application date(s) This amendment applies from 1 April 2008, to coincide with the date that the amendment in ARMTARM was retrospective from. Detailed analysis The example below explains the effect of the amendment. Example Mary was involved in a car accident in 2006 which impacts her ability to care for herself. Mary pays Mandy $10,000 pa to care for her out of her own pocket. 2006/07 tax year: Mary pays Mandy $10,000. Mandy pays tax on this at her marginal rate. 2007/08 tax year: Same as above ($10,000). 2008/09 tax year: Same as above ($10,000). 2009/10 tax year: Same as above ($10,000). 2010/11 tax year: ACC accept that Mary is entitled to ongoing care. Along with paying Mary an entitlement for the 2010/11 tax year, ACC also pay Mary a lumpsum of $40,000 (less $4,200 withholding tax) as compensation for the previous 4 tax years. Mary files a tax return and also pays additional tax on this amount at her marginal tax rate. Treatment of the $40,000 reimbursement payment (post ARMTARM amendments) Under section CZ 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the lumpsum reimbursement payment that Mary received during the 2010/11 tax year will be treated as exempt income to Mary in the year in which it was received where the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax obligations relating to the payment have been met. Assuming that the Commissioner was satisfied that the tax obligations in relation to the payment had been met by the carer, this means that Mary could, under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, request that the Commissioner amend her assessment. The Commissioner would accept this request which would result in Mary being owed a substantial tax refund, as she has paid tax on income that is now determined to be exempt. Refund time bar The way that section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies is to limit a taxpayer’s ability to claim a refund from an amended assessment to the timebar period, being four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the return. This achieves the desired policy intent in most instances, but means that, in Mary’s situation, she would be timebarred from claiming a refund. This is because more than four years have passed from the end of the tax year (2010/11) in which Mary provided the return. Section RM 2 has now been amended to provide an exception for reimbursement ACC attendant care payments. This means that a refund can now be paid out to Mary. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 100 NEW LEGISLATION TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT – INFORMATION COLLECTION Sections 17(1CB) and 17E of the Tax Administration Act Background The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 provided a new power for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to request information held by a member of a large multinational group. The policy intent was that criminal penalties would not apply in respect of such information requests. Instead, the civil penalty in section 139AB of the Tax Administration Act could be applied to large multinational groups that fail to provide information requested by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Key features Remedial amendments have been made to section 17E and the older equivalent provision in section 17(1CB) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to remove some erroneous references to “sections 143 and 143A” as those sections involve criminal penalties. The reference to “section 139AB” is retained. This allows the civil penalty in section 139AB to be imposed in relation to the relevant request under section 17E or section 17(1CB) for information held by a member of a large multinational group. Application date The amendment to section 17(1CB) applies from 27 June 2018 which is the date that the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 was enacted. The amendment to section 17E applies from 18 March 2019 which is the date that section 17E was inserted by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. DEFINITION OF HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENT Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act The definition of “hire purchase agreement” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains an exclusion in paragraph (d) for agreements under which the legal ownership of the goods passes absolutely to the purchaser of the goods at the time the agreement is made or before the goods are delivered. However, a drafting error meant that these agreements were not actually excluded from the definition if they met the general criteria set out in paragraphs a(i) and a(ii). Paragraph (d) of the hire purchase definition has been replaced to remove the error. This ensures that an agreement which meets both the general criteria, and the exclusion in paragraph (d) will be excluded from the definition of a hire purchase agreement. Application date The amendment applies from 26 June 2019. RWT EXEMPT STATUS Section 32E Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment removes the requirement for a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005 to apply for RWT exempt status. The amendment reduces compliance costs for such charities by ensuring that as soon as a charity becomes a registered charity, it will also have RWT exempt status. The RWT exempt status will continue until the charity is deregistered. Key features Reforms to employment and investment information requirements as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation project will result in a reduction in compliance costs for RWT-exempt people by: • requiring investors with RWT exempt status to notify payers of investment income of their status; and • requiring Inland Revenue to maintain a public electronic register of persons having RWT exempt status; • requiring payers of investment income to verify the RWT exempt status of an investor prior to making a payment. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 101 NEW LEGISLATION The amendment contains a legislative cross-reference error to the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. It should refer to the Charities Act 2005 and this will be corrected in an upcoming tax Bill. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The following amendments are minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes. Application dates Commencement dates for each amendment are stated in table 2. Minor maintenance items The amendments set out in Table 2 relate to minor maintenance items, which correct any of the following: • ambiguities; • compilation issues; • cross-references; • drafting consistency, including readers’ aids – for example, the defined terms lists; • grammar; • consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments; or • the consistent use of terminology and definitions.

The Budget 2019 Welfare Package is designed to increase the incomes of low-income individuals and families and to support a sustained reduction in child poverty. The Act provides for changes to increase benefit abatement thresholds, to adjust main benefits annually in line with any upward percentage movement in the average wage and to remove the benefit sanction for sole parents who fail to apply for child support. In addition, it enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to excuse a person in receipt of an Unsupported Child’s benefit or sole parent rate of benefit from their obligation to apply for child support. Removing the benefit sanction for sole parents who fail to apply for child support and giving the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the authority to excuse a person from their obligation to apply for child support requires changes to the Child Support Act 1991. These changes are covered in this item. REPEAL OF BENEFIT SANCTION FOR SOLE PARENTS WHO FAIL TO ASSIST CHILD SUPPORT Sections 9 and 122 of the Child Support Act 1991 Amendments have been made to the Child Support Act 1991 consequential to the repeal of the s192 benefit sanction on sole parent beneficiaries in the Social Security Act. Background The Social Security Act 2018 provides that a person who is granted a sole parent rate of benefit must (subject to some exceptions) have their benefit reduced if they fail to: • identify in law the other parent of their child; • apply for child support; or • give evidence as a compellable witness in a proceeding under the Child Support Act. The intention of the sanction is to incentivise parents and carers to comply with these obligations to assist child support. In order to assist the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) with the administration of this benefit sanction, Inland Revenue will inform MSD when a sole parent hasn’t fulfilled their obligations for child support so a benefit reduction can be considered. The new law will see the repeal of this sanction in the Social Security Act 2018 and means a benefit reduction will no longer be applied to sole parent beneficiaries who fail to assist child support. Key features Sections 9(6),(6B),(7) and 122(2) of the Child Support Act 1991 are repealed as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will no longer need to inform MSD if a person fails to meet their obligation to assist child support. Application date The amendments come into force on 1 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 103 NEW LEGISLATION EXCUSING CARERS FROM THEIR OBLIGATION TO APPLY FOR CHILD SUPPORT Section 9(5B) of the Child Support Act 1991 An amendment has been made to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the ability to excuse people receiving an Unsupported Child or sole parent rate of benefit from their obligation to apply for child support in compelling situations. Background Sole parent beneficiaries and carers receiving an Unsupported Child’s Benefit are obligated to apply for child support unless there is compelling reason for them not to apply – for example a fear of violence. Under the current law only the Chief Executive of MSD can excuse the beneficiary from this obligation this can sometimes lead to child support obligations being established when they shouldn’t because the customer has not disclosed their situation to MSD and Inland Revenue cannot excuse the beneficiary from their obligation. The new law will mean beneficiaries who are obligated to apply for child support can choose to disclose information about their compelling situation to either Inland Revenue or MSD and be excused from applying for child support. Key features Section 9(5B) is updated to give authority to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to excuse a person from their obligation to apply for child support if they qualify under one of the reasons outlined in this section: • There is insufficient evidence to establish who the other parent is. • There is a risk of violence against the person, or other family members (including their children or partner if they are a unsupported child’s benefit recipient). • The other parent is deceased. • The child was conceived as a result of incest or sexual violation. • Some other compelling reason. Application date(s) The amendment comes into force on 1 April 2020 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 104 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates their tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715). You can download this publication free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz BINDING RULINGS BR Pub 19/03: Income tax – employer issued crypto-assets provided to an employee This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Taxation law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CX 2, RD 27 and RD 40(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the agreement to provide crypto-assets to an employee in connection with their employment in circumstances where: • the employer is issuing crypto-assets (for example through an Initial Coin Offering, an Initial Exchange Offering, a Security Token Offering, or a Token Generating Event); • the employee will receive the crypto-assets only if they are still employed by the employer at a specified future date (the condition); and • the employee cannot sell or otherwise transfer the crypto-assets until the specified future date. The Ruling applies only to salary and wage earners, not to self-employed taxpayers. The Ruling does not apply where: • the crypto-asset provided is a “share” for income tax purposes that is received under an “employee share scheme” as defined in s CE 7; or • Public Ruling “BR Pub 19/01: Income Tax – Salary and wages paid in crypto-assets” or Public Ruling “BR Pub 19/02: Income Tax – Bonuses paid in crypto-assets” applies. How the taxation law applies to the Arrangement The taxation laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • A fringe benefit will be provided under s CX 2 when the condition is met and the employee becomes entitled to the crypto-assets. • Where the employer is selling its crypto-assets to arm’s length buyers at the time the crypto-assets are provided to the employee, the value of the fringe benefit is the “market value” determined under s RD 40. • Where s RD 40 does not apply and at the time the crypto-assets are provided to the employee it can be purchased on the open market, the value of the fringe benefit is the “market value” determined under s RD 27(3). • Where there is no “market value” under s RD 27 or s RD 40, the Commissioner will need to determine the value of the fringe benefit. The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for a period of three years beginning on 30 July 2019. This Ruling is signed by me 30 July 2019. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 105 BINDING RULINGS Commentary on public ruling BR Pub 19/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 19/X3 (“the Ruling”). Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary. Summary 1. This Ruling considers the income tax treatment of employer-issued crypto-assets provided to employees. In particular, it covers the situation where the crypto-assets are subject to conditions that the employee must satisfy to become entitled to the crypto-assets. The commentary discusses the application of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules to the Arrangement. It also briefly discusses the FBT treatment of similar arrangements. Background 2. The crypto-asset industry is still evolving and there is currently no standard terminology used. The Ruling uses the term “crypto-asset” to cover digital assets that use cryptography and blockchain technology to regulate their generation and verify transfers. 1 3. It is becoming more common for employees (particularly those working in crypto-asset-related industries) to receive remuneration in crypto-assets. The Commissioner has been asked to provide guidance on how remuneration paid in crypto-assets is taxed. 4. This Ruling sets out the Commissioner’s view on the situation where an employee receives crypto-assets issued by their employer (or an associated person). Often this will occur in the context of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), an Initial Exchange Offering, a Security Token Offering, or Token Generating Event. 5. This Ruling considers the situation, as is common in arrangements of this type, where the crypto-assets are provided subject to a condition that must be satisfied before an employee becomes entitled to the crypto-assets. The condition considered in the Ruling is that the employee remains employed by the employer. However, the same reasoning applies for other conditions that must be satisfied for the employee to become entitled to the crypto-assets – for example, meeting certain performance targets. Application of the legislation 6. Section CE 1 sets out when an amount derived by a person in connection with their employment will be their income. The crypto-assets covered by this Ruling will not come within any of the paragraphs of s CE 1. Consequently, it is necessary to consider how FBT applies. 7. Section CX 2(1) defines “fringe benefit” as: (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. 8. Broadly, a fringe benefit is a benefit an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment. The following analysis considers: • whether there is a “benefit”; • when the benefit is “provided”; and • what the value of the benefit is. Whether there is a benefit 9. Crypto-assets are not included in ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, and CX 12 to CX 16. Therefore, if it is a benefit, it is an unclassified benefit under s CX 37. 10. The Act does not define the term “benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules. Therefore, “benefit” should be given its ordinary meaning. 1 These are sometimes referred to by other terms including “cryptocurrencies” and “tokens”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 106 BINDING RULINGS 11. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) relevantly defines “benefit” as “an advantage or profit gained from something”. 12. In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,069, the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) considered the FBT status of contributions to a superannuation fund and the provision of motor vehicles that were available for the private use and enjoyment of two employees. The TRA commented on the general meaning of “benefit” (at 2,074): The section itself to an extent explains what is a benefit, for the purposes of a fringe benefit; so long as something is provided by an employer to an employee that can be reasonably, practically and sensibly understood as a benefit to the employee in itself and is not expressly excluded, \[that\] would be sufficient for it to be a benefit for the purposes of the definition of “fringe benefit” as provided by the section. 13. It can be seen from the quotation above that “benefit” has a wide meaning and includes anything that can be “reasonably, practically and sensibly understood as a benefit to the employee”. Crypto-assets provided to an employee would, therefore, be a “benefit”. 14. A benefit is treated as being received from an employer where the employer arranges with a third party to provide a benefit to an employee (s CX 2(2)). In the current context, this would apply, for example, when an employer entered into an arrangement for an associated company to provide crypto-assets to the employer’s employees. 15. A benefit provided to an associate of an employee is treated as if it were provided by the employer to the employee (s CX 2(5)(b)). When the benefit is “provided” 16. Where ownership of the crypto-assets will not pass unless certain requirements are met, the Commissioner’s view is that no benefit is provided until the requirements are met. For example, if transfer of the crypto-assets is subject to an employee remaining in employment for six months or meeting certain performance targets, there will be no benefit for FBT purposes until those conditions are satisfied and the employee becomes entitled to the crypto-assets. 17. This is because, until the conditions are satisfied, it is not clear whether the employee will receive the crypto-assets – provision of the crypto-assets is contingent on future events that may or may not happen. What the value of the benefit is 18. Sections RD 27 to RD 57 set out how to determine the value of a benefit for FBT purposes. The potentially relevant provisions are: • s RD 40(1)(a), which applies where an employer provides an employee with “goods” the employer has produced; and • s RD 27(2), which applies where none of the other valuation provisions applies. 19. Section RD 40(1)(a) states: Market value or cost (1) The value of a fringe benefit that an employer provides to an employee in goods is determined as follows: (a) when the person providing the goods manufactured, produced, or processed them, their market value: Whether crypto-assets are “goods” for FBT valuation purposes 20. Section RD 40 raises an issue as to whether crypto-assets are “goods” for FBT purposes. The word “goods” is not defined. Further, no case law considers the meaning of “goods” in this context. In the absence of a definition, “goods” takes it meaning from the context in which it is used. In concluding that securities (in the form of bearer bonds or coupons) were “goods”, the Privy Council in The Noordam (No 2) \[1920\] AC 904 made the following comments (at 908): At first sight the word “goods” might seem to be an equally inappropriate description. It must, however, be observed that the word is of very general and quite indefinite import, and primarily derives its meaning from the context in which it is used. ... The content of the word “goods” differs greatly according to the context in which it is found and the instrument in which it occurs. ... the word may sometimes be of the narrowest and sometimes of the widest scope. 21. The High Court in Waimea Nurseries Ltd v Director-General for Primary Industries \[2019\] 2 NZLR 107 cited The Noordam (No 2) favourably. Cooke J stated (at 124) that the meaning to be given to “goods” “will be highly dependent on the c o n t e x t ”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 107 BINDING RULINGS 22. Potential wide and narrow interpretations were discussed in Spring House (Freehold) Ltd v Mount Cook Land Ltd \[2002\] 2 All ER 822 (CA), where Ward and Rix LJJ stated (at 828): It is common ground, as the dictionary definition makes clear, that “goods” can be widely understood to mean “property or possessions”, or more narrowly “saleable commodities, merchandise, wares” or ... “tangible moveable property viewed as an item or items of commerce”. 23. It can be seen from the above discussion that “goods” can be interpreted widely enough to include crypto-assets (which would, for example, be “property or possessions”). Whether this is appropriate depends on the context of s RD 40 and the FBT provisions more generally. 24. Section RD 40 provides a valuation methodology for the situation where an employer provides an employee with “goods” the employer has produced. Section RD 41 provides a similar provision for services the employer provides as part of their business. Where neither provision applies, unclassified benefits fall to be valued under the default provision (and may require the Commissioner to determine the value). Where s RD 40(1) applies, the value of the benefit provided is based on the amount the employer sells those goods to the public for. There seems to be no reason to limit the type of goods that the provision applies to (for example, by distinguishing between tangible and intangible goods). Doing so would mean no specific valuation provision exists for those types of property. Consequently, in the Commissioner’s view, crypto-assets are “goods” for the purposes of s RD 40. Application of s RD 40 25. Section RD 40(1)(a) provides that: (1) The value of a fringe benefit that an employer provides to an employee in goods is determined as follows: (a) when the person providing the goods manufactured, produced, or processed them, their market value: 26. “Market value” is defined for the purposes of s RD 40 in s RD 40(3) as: market value means the lowest price, at the time at which the goods were provided to the employee, for which identical goods were sold by the same person to an arm’s length buyer, whether wholesaler, retailer, or the public, in the open market in New Zealand in a sale freely offered and made on ordinary trade terms 27. Therefore, s RD 40(1) applies only where the employer is selling the crypto-assets to arm’s length buyers at the time the crypto-assets are provided to the employee. 2 In such a case, the “value” of the crypto-assets will be the lowest price for which the employer was selling identical crypto-assets to arm’s length buyers in the open market in New Zealand. 28. Where the employer is not selling the crypto-assets at the time it is provided to the employee (which may be the case, for example, before or after an ICO), s RD 40(1) will not apply. Valuation where s RD 40 does not apply 29. Section RD 27(2) applies where the value of a benefit cannot be determined under other provisions. It provides that the value of the fringe benefit is the market value or a value determined by the Commissioner: When value cannot be ascertained (2) If, under sections RD 28, RD 29, and RD 33 to RD 41, the value of a fringe benefit cannot be ascertained, the value is the market value or otherwise as the Commissioner determines. 30. Section RD 27(3) defines “market value” for the purposes of s RD 27(2). Unlike the definition of “market value” for the purposes of s RD 40(1), s RD 27(3) does not require the employer to be selling the crypto-assets. However, it does require the existence of an open market accessible to the public: Meaning of market value (3) In subsection (2), market value means the price normally paid, at the time when the fringe benefit is received by the employee, for the fringe benefit in a sale— (a) in the open market; and (b) freely offered; and (c) made on ordinary trade terms; and (d) to a member of the public at arm’s length. 2 Although unlikely to occur in this context, an exception to this statement applies where the employer’s sale price is greater than the open market value. In such a case, the open market value calculated under s RD 40(2) applies. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 108 BINDING RULINGS 31. Where there is no market value, the Commissioner needs to determine the value of the fringe benefit. In the Commissioner’s view, valuation in these circumstances should be determined as follows: • Where the crypto-assets are provided to the employee before sale to the public, the employer should use the price at which the crypto-assets will first be sold to the public if such a price has been determined. For example, if the crypto- assets will initially be sold to the public as part of an ICO at $1 per token, crypto-assets provided to employees before the ICO should also be valued at $1. Where the first public sale price has not yet been determined, the employer can use a value based on the last arm’s length sale price (if applicable). For example, if seed capital has been invested in return for a share of crypto-assets, a crypto-asset value could be determined from this. • Where the crypto-assets are provided to the employee after the employer has ceased selling to the public but before there is an established market for the crypto-assets, the employer should use the price at which the crypto-assets were last sold to the public. • If none of the above situations apply, the employer should contact Inland Revenue to discuss their particular situation. Similar situations 32. This Ruling considers the situation where crypto-assets are promised to an employee at a future date if certain conditions are met. There are other similar arrangements under which an employer could provide its crypto-assets to employees. 33. Determining when a benefit has been provided requires a careful consideration of the legal arrangements between the employer and the employee. Arrangements with similar effect could have different treatments depending on their legal form. 34. Two potential scenarios are briefly considered below. These are both situations where the employee is not required to meet any conditions to be entitled to the crypto-assets. Crypto-assets transferred to employee without any conditions or restrictions on sale 35. Where crypto-assets are transferred to the employee without any conditions, a benefit will be provided for FBT purposes at the time of transfer. 36. The value of the benefit will be determined under ss RD 40(1) and RD 27 as discussed in paras 18 to 31. Legal or beneficial ownership transferred to employee subject to restrictions on sale 37. Sometimes crypto-assets are transferred to an employee subject to restrictions on their sale (for example, the crypto- assets cannot be sold for three months). In the Commissioner’s view, a benefit would be provided for FBT purposes at the time the employee becomes legally entitled to receive the crypto-assets (regardless of any restrictions on disposal). This is different to the situation considered in the Ruling where the employee does not become legally entitled to the crypto- assets until certain conditions are met. 38. In the Commissioner’s view, a benefit will also be provided where the crypto-assets are not physically provided to the employee but are held on trust for the employee until the restricted sale period is over. 3 In such a case, beneficial ownership of the crypto-assets passes to the employee. Any trust would be non-discretionary as there are no conditions that the employee must satisfy to be entitled to the crypto-assets. 39. Where the benefit being provided to the employee is a beneficial interest in the crypto-assets or the crypto-assets are subject to restrictions on sale, there is unlikely to be a “market value” for the benefit provided (under either s RD 40 or s RD 27). 4 In such a case, the Commissioner would need to determine the relevant value, which may differ from the market value for crypto-assets not subject to restrictions. 3 Where the crypto-assets are is held on a trust of this type, it would generally be expected that any entitlements subsequently arising from the crypto-assets (such as “interest” or “dividend” type payments) would also be held for the benefit of the employee. These additional benefits would not be subject to FBT as they arise after the benefit has been provided to the employee. 4 A possible exception would be if the employer were also offering crypto-assets with the same restrictions to arm’s length parties. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 109 BINDING RULINGS Examples 40. The following examples illustrate the application of the law. Example 1: Crypto-assets provided as an employee incentive 41. Bionic Animal Services Ltd (Bionic) is developing a new crypto-asset (Bio-record) to be used with a blockchain-based database that stores animal records. Bionic has hired two full stack developers, Lesley and Mei, to assist with the project. 42. To provide an incentive to Lesley and Mei to stay with Bionic until the project is completed, Bionic has agreed to provide Lesley and Mei with 1,000 Bio-record tokens if they are still employed by Bionic in 12 months’ time. Bionic is currently offering Bio-record for sale to the public as part of an ICO. The current purchase price is $10 per token. 43. Bionic wants to know whether it should return FBT now. No FBT is payable at the current time as no benefit has been provided to the employees yet. 44. Lesley leaves Bionic within the 12-month period, so does not receive any Bio-record. After 12 months, Mei is still working for Bionic, so she becomes entitled to receive 1,000 Bio-record. Bionic is no longer selling Bio-record to the public. However, it is available through a local cryptocurrency exchange for $12 per token. 45. Bionic is liable for FBT at the time Mei becomes legally entitled to the Bio-record tokens. The value of the benefit for FBT purposes is $12,000 (1,000 tokens x $12 per token). Example 2: Crypto-assets provided subject to restrictions 46. Bionic also hires a new manager, Raju. Bionic want to incentivise Raju to stay employed with them. However Bionic also wants to avoid its employees affecting the market for Bio-record tokens by selling as soon as they become entitled to their Bio-record. 47. Bionic agrees to provide Raju with 2,000 Bio-record tokens if he is still employed by Bionic in 12 months’ time. However, the Bio-record will be provided subject to a restriction preventing Raju from selling the tokens for a further six-months. 48. Bionic wants to know when it should return FBT. No FBT is payable at the current time as no benefit has been provided to Raju yet. FBT will be payable if Raju is still employed with Bionic in 12 months’ time, as this is when Raju becomes legally entitled to the Bio-record tokens. 49. As the Bio-record tokens will be subject to a six-month restriction on sale, this may affect their value. Bionic should contact Inland Revenue to discuss an appropriate value for FBT purposes.

Section CX 2 provides: CX 2 Meaning of fringe benefit Meaning (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. Arrangement to provide benefit (2) A benefit that is provided to an employee through an arrangement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided is treated as having been provided by the employer. Past, present, or future employment (3) It is not necessary to the existence of a fringe benefit that an employment relationship exists when the employee receives the benefit. Relationship with subpart RD (4) Sections RD 25 to RD 63 (which relate to fringe benefit tax) deal with the calculation of the taxable value of fringe benefits. Arrangements (5) A benefit may be treated for the purposes of the FBT rules as being provided by an employer to an employee under— (a) section GB 31 (FBT arrangements: general): (b) section GB 32 (Benefits provided to employee’s associates). 50. Section GB 32 provides: GB 32 Benefits provided to employee’s associates When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a benefit is provided to a person who is associated with an employee of an employer; and (b) the benefit would be a fringe benefit if provided to the employee; and (c) the benefit is provided either by the employer or by another person under an arrangement with the employer for providing the benefit; and (d) the exemptions in subsections (2) and (2B) do not apply. Exemption for shareholder-employees and corporate associates (2) Subsection (3) does not apply when— (a) the benefit is provided by an employer that is a company; and (b) the employee is a shareholder in the company; and (c) the person associated with the employee is a company; and (d) the benefit is not provided under an arrangement that has a purpose of providing the benefit either— (i) in place of employment income; or (ii) free from fringe benefit tax. Exemption for LTCs and partnerships (2B) Subsection (3) does not apply when— (a) the benefit is provided by an employer that is— (i) a look-through company (an LTC): (ii) a partnership or limited partnership; and (b) the person associated with the employee, described in subsection (1)(a), is— (i) an owner of the relevant LTC: (ii) a partner of the relevant partnership or limited partnership. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 111 BINDING RULINGS Benefit treated as provided to employee (3) For the purposes of the FBT rules, the benefit is treated as provided by the employer to the employee. Application of section CX 18 (4) Section CX 18 (Benefits provided to associates of both employees and shareholders) applies to determine when a benefit provided to an associate of both an employee and a shareholder is treated as a fringe benefit and not a dividend. 51. Section RD 27 provides: RD 27 Determining fringe benefit values What sections RD 28 to RD 53 do (1) Sections RD 28 to RD 53 set out the rules for determining the value of a fringe benefit provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. The taxable value of a fringe benefit when an employee pays an amount for receiving the benefit is dealt with in sections RD 54 to RD 57. When value cannot be ascertained (2) If, under sections RD 28, RD 29, and RD 33 to RD 41, the value of a fringe benefit cannot be ascertained, the value is the market value or otherwise as the Commissioner determines. Meaning of market value (3) In subsection (2), market value means the price normally paid, at the time when the fringe benefit is received by the employee, for the fringe benefit in a sale— (a) in the open market; and (b) freely offered; and (c) made on ordinary trade terms; and (d) to a member of the public at arm’s length. 52. Section RD 40 provides: RD 40 Goods Market value or cost (1) The value of a fringe benefit that an employer provides to an employee in goods is determined as follows: (a) when the person providing the goods manufactured, produced, or processed them, their market value: (b) when the person providing the goods otherwise acquired them, or paid for them to be acquired, dealing at arm’s length with the supplier of the goods, the cost of the goods to the person: (c) if the person providing the goods is a company included in a group of companies, then, as the person chooses, the value of the benefit under either paragraph (a) or (b), applying the provisions as if the group of companies were 1 company. Sale in open market (2) Despite subsection (1), if the value of the fringe benefit as determined under that subsection would be more than the amount that would have been paid to the employer for the purchase of the goods in a sale described in paragraphs (a) to (d), then the value is treated as that amount. The sale must be— (a) at retail in the open market in New Zealand; and (b) freely offered; and (c) made on ordinary trade terms; and (d) to a member of the public with whom the employer is at arm’s length. Some definitions (3) In this section,— ... market value means the lowest price, at the time at which the goods were provided to the employee, for which identical goods were sold by the same person to an arm’s length buyer, whether wholesaler, retailer, or the public, in the open market in New Zealand in a sale freely offered and made on ordinary trade terms ... Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 112 OPERATIONAL POSITION OPERATIONAL POSITION The purpose of an Operational Position is to outline the legal position that the Commissioner considers is correct for an issue identified and the approach the Commissioner will be taking to applying that position in practice. Commissioner’s Operational Position - New section HC 27(6) – treatment of a beneficiary as a settlor in certain circumstances \[1\] The law around whether a beneficiary who leaves distributions in a trust is regarded as a settlor has been unclear, and Inland Revenue has expressed differing views on the issue. \[2\] In December 2013 Inland Revenue wrote to NZICA (as it then was) and advised that merely leaving funds available at call in a trust current account did not result in a beneficiary becoming a settlor. The letter relevantly said: Whether a beneficiary of a trust can be deemed a settlor under tax law comes down in the end to a factual enquiry. However, we have concluded that a beneficiary, who simply has money vested in interest or in possession, where such sums remain with the trustee, does not become a settlor under s HC 27(2) Income Tax Act 2007 on that basis. The existence of an amount that is “beneficiary income” in relation to a particular beneficiary, which is (for example) held by the trustee in a current account that contains amounts to be distributed to that beneficiary, does not make that beneficiary a settlor. The fact that the amount could be called for by the beneficiary, and would be provided by the trustee if they did, does not make the beneficiary a settlor on the basis of deciding not to do so. ... However, a beneficiary who has taken possession and enters into a contract to lend the money back to the trust may be deemed a settlor under s HC 27(2) if he or she: a. Contracts to be paid nil or below market-rate interest, or b. Contracts to receive interest but does not make demand for such interest or defers demand, or c. Does not demand repayment of capital. \[3\] This view appears to have been circulated, but not formally published by Inland Revenue. \[4\] In the course of preparing a public statement on this matter the issues were reconsidered and ultimately different views were reached, namely: • simply leaving funds on call in a current account (without market interest being paid) would result in a beneficiary becoming a settlor, and • if funds were loaned to a trust at less than market interest rates the beneficiary would also become a settlor. \[5\] Given the differing views, and the variety of approaches being adopted by affected taxpayers, a legislative clarification was proposed and ultimately enacted by section 67 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. That section enacts an amendment to section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007. That amendment provides that when a beneficiary of a trust is owed an amount by the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor of the trust if — (a) the trustee pays to the beneficiary in the income year interest on the amount owing at a rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest: (b) the amount owing at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000. \[6\] This amendment comes into force on 1 April 2020, and does not have retrospective effect. \[7\] Given the lack of retrospective effect, and the differing communications by Inland Revenue, some taxpayers may be uncertain about which interpretation Inland Revenue will apply until 1 April 2020 (when the new law takes effect). Operational position \[8\] So as to provide greater certainty and to minimise compliance costs, the Commissioner has exercised her care and management power, to provide that up to and including 31 March 2020, Inland Revenue will continue to allow taxpayers to rely on the existing public position, as set out in paragraph \[2\] of this Operational Position. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 113 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. High Court considers whether a geothermal turbine hall is a building for depreciation purposes CaseMercury NZ Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 1524 Decision date1 July 2019 Act(s)Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994 KeywordsDepreciation, building, plant, turbine hall, powerhouse, gantry crane, EUL, estimated useful life, geothermal, hydroelectric, PROV 26, PROV 27, ordinary meaning, natural meaning. Summary Mercury challenged the 2012 – 2015 income years to determine whether the turbine halls at its Kawerau and Nga Awa Purua geothermal powerstations (“powerstations”) were buildings and therefore subject to a depreciation rate of 0%. Mercury asserted that the turbine halls were to be treated as part of the gantry cranes which are situated within the turbine halls, and therefore were depreciable at a rate of 9.6%. The Court found in favour of the Commissioner. Impact The judgment is significant as it contains the first judicial analysis in New Zealand of what constitutes a building in the modern depreciation context (which has been in force since 1993) and sets out the order of the questions to be asked. It affirms the Commissioner’s published approach that the definition of building is its ordinary and natural meaning. The Court has concluded as a matter of fact that the geothermal turbine halls at Kawerau and Nga Awa Purua are buildings. Facts The powerhouse, which forms part of each powerstation, incorporates a turbine hall and any attached annex housing electrical equipment and other plant (Mercury NZ Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 1524 (“Mercury v The Commissioner”) \[7\]). The turbine halls house the main generating plant (turbines, generators and other equipment) and a gantry crane. Mercury accepted the Commissioner’s assessment that the electrical annex to the turbine hall was building with a depreciation rate of 0%. Prior to 1 July 2011, the Kawerau and Nga Awa Purua turbine halls were depreciated, as “structures (default class)” with an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of 50-years, at a rate of 4%. The gantry crane and the foundation for the turbines and generators (known as the TG foundation which is set within the turbine hall but is a separate structure) were not separately depreciated but capitalised as part of the “structures (default class)” at the 4% rate. When the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 (“the 2010 Budget Act”) came into force, the depreciation rate for a building with an EUL of 50-years or more was set at 0% with effect from the 2012 income year. This change led to the issue in these proceedings. The gantry crane rate was set at 9.6%. Post 2010 Budget Act and following considerable industry consultations, on 25 March 2015 the Commissioner issued Provisional Determination PROV 26: Depreciation Rate for hydroelectric powerhouses, which provides that a hydroelectric powerhouse has an EUL of 100 years and a provisional depreciation rate of 2%. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 8 September 2019 Inland Revenue Department 114 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES Discussions continued with the electricity sector who had geothermal power stations and on 23 February 2016, the Commissioner issued Provisional Determination Rate: PROV 27 Thermal and Geothermal Powerhouses which, applied retrospectively back to the 2012 income year, declared that geothermal powerhouses were buildings with an EUL of 50 years and a depreciation rate of 0%. Decision Question 1: What is the item? The Court concluded that there was only one item – the turbine hall was one structure (neutral term) and therefore one item for the purpose of this inquiry (Mercury v The Commissioner \[31\]). The evidence before the Court from expert witnesses from both sides concluded that the three elements initially referred to by Mercury (as the gantry crane support structural system, the turbine hall base structure and the cladding system) are integrated and interdependent; part of one unit (\[32\]). Question 2: Is the turbine hall a building? The Court noted that Mercury could not realistically dispute the fact that the turbine hall has an EUL of 50-years or more as its own design specifications provided for a physical/design life of 50-years or more (\[35\]). Furthermore, Mercury’s own asset register specifically listed the turbine halls as having an EUL of 50-years (\[35\]). The definition of “building” in the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) is exclusionary only. (The exclusion of grandparented structure was incorporated into the Act by the 2010 Budget Act and the exclusion for commercial fitout was inserted by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 – s 132(4)). The Court agreed with the Commissioner that “building” in the Act is to be given its conventional meaning and that some assistance in discerning the intended meaning can be gained from what is excluded from the definition (\[39\]). This approach made it reasonably clear that buildings would include industrial buildings and buildings that would be considered to be of a specialised industrial nature (\[40\]). The Court discussed the definition for “plant” and “commercial building” and concluded that the “combination of these provisions makes it clear that anything that is structural in relation to a building, even if it would otherwise be plant, is not plant. It is part of the building for depreciation purposes” (\[44\]). In considering the definition of “temporary building”, (The Court considered the definition as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 since prior to the 2010 Budget Act and also amended by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010) the Court said it “makes it clear that even structures erected and used to house specific plant and that are to be demolished once the plant is removed, would fall in the intended definition of building, but are purposefully excluded because they are only useful for the life of the plant” (\[46\]). Ordinary and natural meaning Justice Hinton accepted that the approach to take for answering the question of what was a building for the purposes of depreciation under the Act, was the “ordinary and natural meaning of the word” particularly when nothing in the legislation gives any signal that a building for purposes of the depreciation provisions is anything other than a building in the ordinary sense of the word (\[48\]). The Court acknowledged the hypothetical view of the reasonable lay observer which has been useful for other Courts. Justice Hinton said the turbine hall “certainly looks like a building from the outside (\[54\]), a concession Mr McKay accepted on a “first blush” basis (\[55\]) before stressing the need to look both inside and outside the turbine hall (\[56\]). The Court said that “a reasonable observer looking both from inside and outside the turbine hall would say it is a building” (\[57\]) and disagreed that the common-sense approach should be given low priority (\[58\]). Other considerations Mercury argued that there was no material distinction between a hydroelectric powerhouse and a geothermal powerhouse. The Court did not have information in front of it to draw a meaningful comparison between the two regardless of what reliance was placed on PROV 26 (\[89\]). However Justice Hinton, after acknowledging that there are likely material differences between the two, went further and said that as hydroelectric powerhouses were situated in rivers, have water flowing through them or part of them and are attached to the dam, this tended to suggest that the hydroelectric powerhouse would fall into the limited category of structures that are integrally involved in the production process (\[90\]). Mercury treats the geothermal turbine hall at Rotokawa as a building for which 0% depreciation is claimed. The Court agreed with the Commissioner that Mercury’s tax treatment of the three turbine halls appeared to be inconsistent but was not prepared to put any weight on this point (\[91\]).

NEW LEGISLATION Order in Council – Tax Administration (Regular Collection of Bulk Data) Regulations 2022 Section 17L(2) Tax Administration Act 1994 Order The Tax Administration (Regular Collection of Bulk Data) Regulations 2022 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to collect datasets from Payment Service Providers on a regular basis and sets 1 April 2023 as the beginning of the first reporting period for the regulations. Background Before the enactment of section 17L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), data requests were made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to Payment Service Providers (PSPs) on an ad hoc basis under section 17B of the TAA. This was a resource- intensive way for the Commissioner to collect the required datasets. Section 17L of the TAA allows for the regular collection of bulk datasets by Order in Council. The Tax Administration (Regular Collection of Bulk Data) Regulations 2022 allows the Commissioner to collect datasets from PSPs on a regular basis. These datasets will form a database that will support improved compliance and detect those operating in the hidden economy. Section 17L sets out the ability to define the class of persons the regulations will apply to and defines the scope the datasets. Key features Who is affected The regulations set out the definitions of who will be affected and what data they are required to supply, including both merchant and transaction details. A PSP is a business that participates in a payment system by facilitating payments for goods and services between customers and merchants. These businesses include: merchant acquirers entities who provide switch services entities who provide settlement services entities who provide online payment gateways entities who provide alternative payment methods. An entity that is an issuer (for example, the customer’s bank that issues a payment card) or a business that provides payment service hardware is not included, except to the extent that the business also provides an included service. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has taken notable steps to advise the PSPs that are affected. However, there may still be some entities that meet the requirements and have not been notified. These entities are still subject to the reporting obligations as outlined in the regulations. Examples of who will be affected will be added to the Inland Revenue website over time. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION Reporting the datasets Beginning from 1 April 2023, the annual datasets provided are to consist of aggregate monthly merchant transactions for the 6-month periods of 1 April to 30 September and 1 October to 31 March. These datasets are due to be reported to the Commissioner one month and seven days after the conclusion of the reporting period, being 7 November and 7 May. The first reporting period The regulations came into force on 15 December 2022. The first reporting period will commence on 1 April 2023 and conclude on 30 September 2023 with the datasets due to Inland Revenue by 7 November 2023. Exemptions Some PSPs may be eligible for an exemption. All information and required forms are available on the Inland Revenue website. Getting an exemption (ird.govt.nz/topics/intermediaries/payment-service-providers/getting-an-exemption) Steps to be taken before criminal proceedings brought The Commissioner must, before deciding whether criminal proceedings should be brought for a failure to comply with these regulations, notify the PSP of the due date for the provision of the information, communicate with the PSP to find out why the information has not been provided, and in particular if there are impediments delaying or preventing its provision, and advise the PSP of the consequences of not providing the information to the Commissioner. Defenses in any proceedings relating to failure to comply with this order Where a PSP is required to provide information to the Commissioner under these regulations and fails to do so, they have a defence in any proceedings where they can prove that they took all reasonable steps to provide correct and complete information required by these regulations. No penalty may be imposed in relation to the failure to provide information or complete information. Further information The new regulations can be found at: https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0295/latest/whole.html Further information about the legislation can be found at: ird.govt.nz/topics/intermediaries/payment-service-providers Order in Council – Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2022 Sections RA 21(3) and (4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Order The Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2022 was made on 21 November 2022. The Order changes the prescribed rate of interest for calculating fringe benefit tax on low-interest loans provided by an employer to an employee. The fringe benefit tax (FBT) prescribed rate of interest for low-interest employment-related loans has been increased from 4.78% to 6.71 % in line with recent changes in market interest rates. Background The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment- related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans they have provided to their employees. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 4 NEW LEGISLATION Section RA 21(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. By administrative convention, the FBT prescribed rate of interest is based on the ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’ series published by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) each month. It is updated when there has been an increase or decrease in the RBNZ rate of 20 or more basis points since the FBT rate was last set. The RBNZ rate for August 2022 was 6.71%. This is up from 4.78%, the rate for January 2022, which the most recent FBT prescribed interest rate was based off. The FBT prescribed rate of interest is being lifted accordingly. Effective date The new prescribed rate of 6.71% applies for the quarter beginning 1 January 2023 and subsequent quarters. Further information The regulations updating the prescribed rate of interest can be found at: https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0306/latest/whole.html Order in Council – Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations (No 3) 2022 Sections 120E(1) and 120H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Order The Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations (No 3) 2022 Order in Council was made on 24 November 2022. The Order changes the use of money interest (UOMI) rates on underpayments and overpayments of taxes and duties in line with market interest rates. The new underpayment rate is 9.21% (previously 7.96%). The new overpayment rate is 2.31% (previously 1.22%). Background The UOMI underpayment rate is charged to taxpayers on underpayments of their liability to Inland Revenue, while the UOMI overpayment rate is paid to taxpayers on money paid to Inland Revenue exceeding their liability. Section 120H(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set the UOMI underpayment and overpayment rates. Once a rate is set, it remains at that rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The UOMI underpayment rate is based on the ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’ series published by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) each month, while the UOMI overpayment rate is based on RBNZ’s ’90-day bank bill rate’ series each month. The UOMI rates are both adjusted if either the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 1% or more, or if one of these indexes moves by 0.2% or more and the UOMI rates have not been adjusted in the last 12 months. The UOMI rates are adjusted as required to ensure they are in line with market interest rates. The new UOMI rates are consistent with the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate and the 90-day bank bill rate. Effective date The new UOMI rates apply on and after 17 January 2023. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 5 NEW LEGISLATION Further information The regulations updating the use of money interest rates can be found at https://legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0315/latest/whole.html Order in Council – Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold for 2023–24 Tax Year and Subsequent Tax Years) Regulations 2022 Section 215(1)(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Order These regulations, which come into force on 1 April 2023, increase the annual repayment threshold for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 from $21,268 to $22,828. Key features These regulations also revoke the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021. Background The student loan repayment threshold is the amount of annual income a New Zealand-based borrower can earn before being required to make repayments on their outstanding student loan balance. Under current policy, the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted for inflation annually. From 1 April 2023, New Zealand based borrowers must make student loan repayments on income above $22,828. This is an increase from the 2022-23 tax year threshold of $21,268. In previous years, this adjustment was calculated using a consumer price index (CPI) figure that excluded tobacco products. In November 2022, Cabinet agreed to return to a CPI measure which includes tobacco products, reflecting the government-wide approach to indexation. This calculation method applies from the 2023-24 tax year onwards. Effective date The new repayment threshold applies from 1 April 2023. Further information The new repayment threshold applies from 1 April 2023. https://legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0316/latest/whole.html Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 6 NEW LEGISLATION Order in Council – Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 Section 70C(1) Tax Administration Act 1994 Order The Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 was made on 19 December 2022 and came into force on 22 December 2022. The Order extends the deadline for filing a statement required under section 70C(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the 2021–22 tax year until 30 April 2023. Background Research and Development loss tax credits (R&DLTCs) allow loss-making taxpayers undertaking R&D to “cash out” their losses. This provides a timing benefit to the taxpayer, but those losses then cannot be used to shelter future income once the taxpayer is profitable. It is an R&D support measure that supports the cashflow position of new R&D businesses, as they otherwise might not be able to receive the tax benefit of those losses until several years in the future. To be eligible to claim R&DLTCs for a year, a taxpayer must submit a statement as required by section 70C(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The due date for this statement is provided for in section 70C(2), with the due date in any year being the earlier of: The day on which the taxpayer files a return of income, and The last day for filing a return of income. In practice, the former of the above two limbs will tend to be the binding due date. This can be problematic if the taxpayer inadvertently files their income tax return at least a day before they file an R&DLTC statement. Under the current legislative settings, that taxpayer would be ineligible for R&DLTCs for the year. This is true even if both the return and the R&DLTC statement are filed well in advance of the actual due date for the income tax return. This outcome is counter to the intent of the R&DLTC regime, where businesses have an incentive to file their income tax return early to be able to cash out their losses s o oner. Extension of deadline for R&D loss tax credit statements The Tax Administration (Extension of Deadline for Research and Development Loss Tax Credit Statements) Order 2022 counteracts the timing issue mentioned above, for the 2021–22 tax year, by allowing the statement to be filed as late as 30 April 2022, regardless of the date of filing of the income tax return. The Order is made under section 226 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. That section allows for extensions of time to be granted by Order in Council to meet requirements under some of the Inland Revenue Acts, even when the deadline has already expired. Effective date The Order came into force on 22 December 2022. Further information The Order can be found at: https://legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0342/latest/whole.html Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 7 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates their tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715). You can download this publication free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz BINDING RULINGS BR Prd 22/14 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Bank of New Zealand (BNZ). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: ss BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, RE 1, RF 1; and; ss 86F and 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (SCDA). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a product (TotalMoney) that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may only be individuals, companies, or trusts. TotalMoney involves the creation of specific accounts that must be in a group of accounts, and the facility for customers to elect to group up to 50 of these specific accounts into one or more groups to either “pool” or “offset” the account balances. “Pooling” involves the aggregation of account credit balances to determine the tiered interest rate that will apply to the calculation and crediting of interest to each account balance. “Offsetting” involves the aggregation of account balances to calculate the amount of interest debited to a lending facility account balance. The Arrangement is set out in the documents listed below, copies of which were received by the Tax Counsel Office, Inland Revenue, on 29 June 2022 and 1 November 2022: Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Personal and Sole Trader Customers; Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Companies and Trusts; Bank of New Zealand Home Loan Facility Master Agreement; Letter of Advice – TotalMoney Home Loan; Facility Document – TotalMoney Business Term Loan; and BNZ Business Lending Master Terms and Conditions. While the Letter of Advice will be personalised for each customer’s circumstances, contracts under the Arrangement are between arms-length parties operating on standard contractual terms. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 8 BINDING RULINGS Changes will be made to some aspects of the Arrangement from 31 October 2022 to: remove the credit interest paid on credit balances for existing and new TotalMoney accounts; remove the fees for existing and new accounts for personal TotalMoney customers; remove TotalMoney “pooling”; and retain the fees for existing TotalMoney for Business accounts, with the potential to remove this fee in the future. The Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Personal and Sole Trader Customers and the Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Companies and Trusts will change from 31 October 2022 to address the removal of “pooling” and interest paid on credit balances under "pooling" and/or "offsetting" and to set out the changes in fees. These changes are set out in BNZ’s website (Public Notices – BNZ) under Changes to TotalMoney terms and conditions (effective 31 October 2022). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1) TotalMoney is a package of accounts and loans that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may only be individuals, companies, or trusts. 2) C ustomers in general have a range of accounts with BNZ, including transaction accounts, savings accounts, and various loan accounts. Loan accounts may be only table, non-table, tailored, principal and interest, interest only, fixed or floating home loan accounts, or business loan accounts. 3) T otalMoney allows customers to group or aggregate these accounts for the purposes of either “pooling” or “offsetting” the account balances. Primary features of TotalMoney 4) The primary features of TotalMoney are the “pooling” and “offsetting” features. These features operate in the manner described below. Pooling until 31 October 2022 a) T he pooling aspect of TotalMoney operates when several transaction accounts with credit balances exist. Interest on these credit balance accounts is calculated and paid based on the cumulative credit balance of all transaction accounts in the group. Interest-bearing accounts usually attract interest based on interest rate brackets that apply to the balance of each relevant individual account. b) The cumulative credit balance is calculated so BNZ can ascertain the relevant interest rate tier applicable to the relevant accounts. The separate funds are not actually transferred to one account before the interest is calculated. BNZ calculates interest at the applicable interest rate tier that applies to the accumulated balance. Offsetting a) W ith the offset feature of TotalMoney, interest on a lending facility or facilities within the group is calculated and paid by the customer on the difference between the lending facility balances and the credit balances of transaction accounts in the group. Under the terms and conditions agreed between BNZ and its customers for TotalMoney, BNZ pays no interest on the credit balances that are “offset” against the lending facility. b) T he “offsetting” is only to calculate the balance of the lending facility or facilities on which interest is payable, or, where the credit balances of transaction accounts exceed the balance of the lending facility or facilities in the group of which the credit balances are “offset” against, the balance of the excess credit balances on which interest is receivable. There is no actual transfer of funds, no set-off or netting of funds together in an account, and no transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 9 BINDING RULINGS Pooling and interest on credit balances from 31 October 2022 a) TotalMoney for Business lending is no longer available to new business customers. Existing TotalMoney for Business customers can remain in a group but no interest will be paid on the credit balances of the group accounts or the “offsetting” accounts. b) W hile grouping TotalMoney transactional accounts will still be available, there will be no interest paid on the credit balances of the group accounts or the “offsetting” accounts. c) TotalMoney transactional accounts without TotalMoney home loans will no longer be available to new customers from 31 October 2022. d) BNZ will review all existing pooling customers and will be encouraging them to transfer to other products that are more suitable for savings accounts and their needs. 5) Every transaction account in a TotalMoney group is automatically set to “pool” or “offset”. If a customer has any lending facilities within their TotalMoney group, the customer's transaction accounts with credit balances are “offset” against their lending facilities. Interest is payable by the customer if the balance of their lending facilities exceeds the balance of their transaction accounts with credit balances, and until 31 October 2022, interest is payable by BNZ if a customer's transaction accounts with credit balances exceeds the balance of their lending facilities. Where the customer has no loan account(s), a customer’s TotalMoney accounts will automatically group. 6) TotalMoney does not provide a facility for other accounts. Instead it involves creating a specific type of account. To participate in TotalMoney, a customer must open specific TotalMoney accounts that are particular to the TotalMoney product, or a customer may convert an existing BNZ account to a new TotalMoney account. However, the customer must agree that the existing terms and conditions that apply to those accounts cease to apply, and are replaced by the TotalMoney Terms and Conditions. 7) F or new TotalMoney accounts, the account will be set to “offset”. Pooling – further detail 8) Until the changes are made to the credit interest aspect of TotalMoney from 31 October 2022, BNZ has a contractual obligation to pay interest if either a customer's transaction accounts with credit balances exceeds their lending facilities within a TotalMoney group, or a customer only has transaction accounts with credit balances (and no lending facilities) within a TotalMoney group. The interest payable is based on the applicable interest rate tier that applies based on the total credit balance being "pooled" or "offset" against any lending facilities in the TotalMoney group. Following usual business practice, BNZ makes a separate determination for withholding tax on each interest payment made to each account. 9) The benefit of the “pooling” feature for customers is that they can earn more interest by combining smaller balances and reaching higher interest-rate tiers and still maintain their money in separate accounts for separate purposes. The customer may consider this an advantageous way to manage their money. 10) Account owners have full deposit and withdrawal access to their transaction accounts. Overdraft facilities may be available in relation to these accounts. However, any overdraft balance is ignored for “pooling” purposes. BNZ charges debit interest on the overdrawn balance of any account. The overdrawn balance does not reduce the “pooled” balance of the credit balance accounts when BNZ is calculating interest for those accounts. 11) BNZ will be removing “pooling” and the payment of interest on credit balances from 31 October 2022. This is as part of the replacement of BNZ’s core banking systems and is intended to simplify products to customers. As part of its plans for the future, BNZ will be encouraging customers who have credit balances to transfer to a different type of account that has appropriate rates of interest and are better suited to their needs. 12) BNZ will also be reconsidering its fees for the TotalMoney product. It will remove the fee for all personal customers with TotalMoney accounts around the same time the change to credit interest is made. The fee for TotalMoney business customers will remain for the time being, and may be removed at some point in the future. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 10 BINDING RULINGS Offsetting – further detail 13) Where a customer has a TotalMoney loan account, this account will generally be grouped with at least one other TotalMoney transaction account. There must be at least one loan account in the group, and may be more at BNZ’s discretion. 14) Where one loan account is in the group, the interest payable on the loan account is calculated on the balance of the loan account less the credit balances of accounts in the group. This will be the case as a matter of law (in terms of TotalMoney documentation) and as a matter of practice (in terms of BNZ’s computer system). There is no actual set-off, netting, or transfer of funds, or transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. “Offsetting” occurs before debit or credit interest is calculated. 15) For example, in the case of a loan account that would otherwise be the same as a standard variable rate table home loan facility over 30 years with a “minimum payment”, there will be no provision for the amount of interest saved under “offsetting” to reduce the “minimum payment”. The effect of “offsetting” is the same as a decrease in the floating interest rate and a decision not to reduce the amount of the “minimum payment”. In either case, the term of the loan is reduced because the principal portion of the payment is effectively increased. In the case of a non-table loan, interest payments will be reduced by “offsetting”, principal repayments will not change, and the loan term will not reduce. In the case of interest only loans, repayments comprise solely interest, so the impact of "offsetting" will be to reduce the interest amount and therefore reduce the "minimum payment". 16) Where there is more than one loan account in the group, the loan accounts in the group are given a default priority; namely, the oldest loan account in the group will receive the highest priority. However, the customer may elect two or more of those loan accounts to be prioritised for “offsetting” purposes. The loan account with the highest priority will receive the benefit of “offsetting” first. It is only where the credit balances of transaction accounts in the group exceed the balance of that highest priority loan account that the next highest priority loan account balance is offset, and so on. 17) Until the changes are made to the credit interest aspect of TotalMoney, if the total credit balances of the transaction accounts are greater than the total debit balance of the loan accounts in a group, credit interest will be applied to the difference. Interest is then paid on a prorated basis to the credit balance accounts in accordance with the balance of those accounts (essentially in line with the “pooling” feature of TotalMoney). 18) B NZ will be removing the payment of interest on credit balances from 31 October 2022. As discussed at 11), this is as part of a replacement of BNZ’s core banking systems and is intended to simplify products to customers. 19) BNZ calculates interest daily. If, during a month, BNZ has both an entitlement to receive interest (that is, the balance of participating loan accounts exceeds the balance of all transaction accounts in a group) and, at another point in the month, BNZ has an obligation to pay interest (that is, the balance of transaction accounts in a group exceeds the balance of the relevant loan accounts), then the two interest payments are made and are not set-off. 20) T he “offsetting” feature of TotalMoney essentially offers the same benefits to customers as offered by a revolving credit loan (such as BNZ’s “Rapid Repay” product) in terms of lower interest costs and a shorter time to repay the loan. However, this feature overcomes a primary perceived disadvantage of a revolving credit loan because it allows customers to retain separate account balances (which customers may prefer when managing their finances). 21) N o arrangement must exist between the customers who have grouped their accounts that provides for the loan account owner(s) to make a payment(s) to the transaction account owner(s) in consideration for the transaction account owner(s) "offsetting" their accounts under TotalMoney. Business purposes 22) When TotalMoney was established, customers were contractually prohibited from using TotalMoney for business purposes. BNZ later removed the prohibition on the business use of TotalMoney. BNZ extended the availability of TotalMoney to business customers to give them the same tools for managing their financial affairs as it gives to personal customers. 23) U nder the terms and conditions applicable to TotalMoney, customers were able to use TotalMoney accounts for business purposes. This means that, customers, such as sole traders, could group business and non-business product accounts. 24) O n 1 November 2019, BNZ stopped offering TotalMoney for Business lending for sale and intends to keep this off-sale. However, there are existing TotalMoney for Business customers who have not yet transferred to a different product. 25) I n August 2022 BNZ stopped offering new TotalMoney home lending to non-natural persons (such as trusts and look- through companies). However, existing TotalMoney home loans for these customers at the date of this Ruling remain as is. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 11 BINDING RULINGS Terms and Conditions for the TotalMoney home loan products 26) The TotalMoney product home loans are documented primarily in a Home Loan Facility Master Agreement, and personalised Letter of Advice. The relevant TotalMoney Account Terms and Conditions (i.e. either for Personal & Sole Trader or Trusts and Companies) also apply as a separate contract to the TotalMoney Home Loan contract. 27) Table loans provide for regular payments and a set date when they will be paid off. Most payments early in the loan term comprise interest, while most of the payments later in the term comprise repayments of the principal. Non-table loans have two separate repayments, one of interest and one of principal. Customers repay the same amount of principal each time and interest is charged separately. 28) The documentation for a TotalMoney standard variable rate table home loan facility over 30 years is largely the same as that for current BNZ home loan facilities that are standard variable rate table home loans over 30 years. The only differences are; branding (the name on the Letter of Advice), the interest calculation (which provides for the effect of the “offset”), and, in relation to table loans, the provision stating that where the loan has the benefit of the “offset” to reduce the interest cost, the “minimum payment” specified for the loan will not decrease because of any interest savings but instead the loan term will reduce. 29) Under a non-table loan, any interest saving (whether as a result of a reduction in the applicable interest rate because of a general decrease in interest rates, or because of the offset feature) would result in either a reduction of the interest repayment or a reduction in the loan term (if the original repayment amount is maintained despite the interest saving). In relation to a TotalMoney product home loan that is a table home loan, a reduction is only allowed in the loan term. Under a TotalMoney product interest only loan, any interest saving (whether as a result of a reduction in the applicable interest rate because of a general decrease in interest rates, or because of the offset feature) would result in a reduction of the interest repayment. Terms and conditions for TotalMoney business loan products 30) The TotalMoney business loans are documented primarily in the Facility Document – TotalMoney Business Term Loan and other Ancillary documents. The business loans are also subject to the relevant BNZ Business Lending Master Terms and Conditions. As previously stated at 24), BNZ stopped offering TotalMoney for Business lending for sale from 1 November 2019. Groups 31) TotalMoney is based on a group of participating accounts. Groups can be comprised of only the following categories: a) Na tural persons: i) T he accounts of an individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de facto, and civil union couples, and any of their children may be combined as part of one group of accounts. ii) For example, the various accounts of one natural person, Jane, or, the various accounts (individual or joint) of Jane and her husband John and their child Joe. The group is not limited to residents of New Zealand, although the group may not include both residents and non-residents. b) O ne company or one trust: i) Multiple accounts of one company (including a qualifying company or look through company) or one trust may be combined as part of a group. Only one entity can be in a group at any time. ii) Accounts of different entities (including the entity and any related individual) cannot be pooled or offset. 32) A ccounts may only be included in one group. An individual may have accounts in three groups, through membership in one as an individual customer, the second as a joint customer and in the third as a sole trader. A group may not include more than one sole trader's accounts. 33) A customer may be a resident or non-resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. However, where a group of accounts consists of accounts owned by more than one legal person, BNZ will obtain representations from the owners of those accounts that they do not have different tax residence status. That is, where more than one legal person is participating in a group of accounts, either all persons must be residents of New Zealand for tax purposes or all persons must be non- residents of New Zealand for tax purposes.

Scott Davidson Tax Counsel Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 13 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS TRU 22/01: Variation to s 59BA(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for trustees of certain trusts that derive a small amount of income Variation The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has, under the discretion provided under section 59BA(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, made the following statutory variation: 1. S ection 59BA(2)(a) – (e) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is varied for a trustee of an Eligible Trust to the name, date of birth, jurisdiction of tax residence, and tax file number and taxpayer identification number, of each settlor who makes a settlement on the trust in the income year. 2. For the purpose of this variation, a trust is an Eligible Trust, for a tax year, where the trustee of the trust derives assessable income for the tax year, the trust is a complying trust under section HC 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and the trust satisfies Criteria A and/or Criteria B. Criteria A: 3. For the corresponding income year for a tax year, the trustee of the trust: • has derived no income other than income that would be reportable income, as defined in section 22D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the trust was an individual, to the extent to which the total amount of that income does not exceed $1,000; and • has no deductions; and • has not been a party to, or perpetuated, or continued with, transactions with assets of the trust which, during the corresponding income year: - give rise to income in any person’s hands; or - give rise to fringe benefits to an employee or to a former employee. 4. In determining whether a trust complies with the requirements of Criteria A, no account shall be taken of any: • reasonable fees paid to professional persons to administer the trust; or • b ank charges or other minimal administration costs totalling not more than $1,000 in the income year; or • in surance, rates, interest, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. Criteria B: 5. For the corresponding income year for a tax year: • t he trust is a testamentary trust; and • distributions from the trust during the income year do not exceed $100,000; and • where the trust earned income that would be reportable income, as defined in section 22D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the trust was an individual, tax has been deducted from that income at the correct rate, and the total amount of that income does not exceed $5,000 for the income year; and • the trust derives non-reportable income of $1,000 or less and the trust has deductions against that income of at least $800 for the income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 14 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Application date This variation applies for the 2021-22 income year and, for a trustee of a trust that is wound up during the 2022-23 income year, the 2022-23 income year. Dated at Wellington on 18 November 2022. Catherine Atkins Deputy Commissioner, Customer and Compliance Services – Business Inland Revenue Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. Under s 59BA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) a trustee of a trust who derives assessable income for a tax year must file a return of all income derived in the corresponding income year (unless the trustee has been excused from filing a return under s 43B of the TAA). Section 59BA(2) of the TAA sets out further information a trustee is required to provide to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner). 2. The variation limits the information that a trustee of an Eligible Trust is required to disclose to comply with s 59BA(2) of the TAA and means that a trustee of an Eligible Trust does not need to provide all the information set out in s 59BA(2)(a) – (e) of the TAA. 3. The Inland Revenue Department website will set out how a trustee applying the variation is to provide the information. 4. T he variation will apply for the 2021-22 income year and, for a trustee of a trust that is wound up during the 2022-23 income year, the 2022-23 income year. 5. S ection 43B of the TAA allows a trustee of a “non-active” trust to be excused from the requirement to file a return where certain criteria are met. A trustee of a trust that is excused from the requirement to file a return by s 43B of the TAA is not required to comply with the disclosure requirements in s 59BA(2). 6. Amendments proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, for 2022-23, Platform Economy and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) (the Bill), which was introduced on 8 September 2022, would broaden s 43B of the TAA, so that trustees of more trusts (including certain testamentary trusts) that derive small amounts of income would qualify for an exclusion from filing a return. These amendments are proposed to have effect from the 2021-22 income year. 7. T he criteria to determine which trustees would qualify for the more limited disclosure requirements in this variation are consistent with what the criteria in s 43B of the TAA would be provided the amendments proposed in the Bill are enacted into law. However, unlike s 43B of the TAA, the variation does not provide an exclusion from filing a return (i.e. a trustee of an Eligible Trust would still be required to file a return under s 59BA(1) of the TAA). Provisions affected 8. Section 59BA(2) of the TAA. Application of variation 9. This variation applies to a trustee of an Eligible Trust that is subject to the information disclosure requirements in s 59BA(2) of the TAA. It varies the information that a trustee of an Eligible Trust needs to provide to the Commissioner to comply with s 59BA(2) of the TAA. 10. A trustee of an Eligible Trust can also choose to provide all the information required by s 59BA(2)(a) – (e) of the TAA.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 16 REVENUE ALERTS Provides information about a significant and/or emerging tax planning issue that is of concern to Inland Revenue. REVENUE ALERTS RA 22/01: Consequences of acquiring, possessing or using electronic sales suppression tools Inland Revenue is aware of the existence of Electronic Sales Suppression tools (ESS tools) which are used to systematically alter point-of-sale data collected by a business in order to understate or completely conceal revenues for the purpose of evading tax. The Commissioner considers that the threat that such tools pose to the integrity of the tax system is significant. Therefore, a number of measures were introduced in 2022 to respond to the threat posed by the ESS tools, including new civil and criminal penalties. The Commissioner is increasing the compliance focus to more closely monitor the use of ESS tools and will consider all of the options that are available to him whenever these ESS tools are found. The purpose of this Revenue Alert is to highlight the possible consequences of being involved with ESS tools. All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise specified. Background 1. A number of new measures have been introduced to respond to the threat posed by ESS tools to discourage their spread within the New Zealand tax base. 2. ESS tools are software programs, devices, or other tools that systematically alter point-of-sale data collected by a business. The software provides a means to understate or completely conceal revenues, which facilitates tax evasion. These tools can work in a variety of ways, targeting the integrity of transactions, software, internal memory, external filing, or reporting to delete, change, or simply not record select sales data and transactions. 3. M anipulation occurs either at, or after, the point of sale. These tools have varied functionalities but may be able to: Permanently delete and re-sequence transactions. Change transactions to reduce the amount of a sale. Misrepresent records (for example, re-categorising a product to avoid GST). roduce false records. 4. The term “electronic sales suppression tool” is defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as meaning: A software program, device, tool, or other thing, part of a thing, or combination of things or parts,— (a) that can hide, conceal, modify, falsify, destroy, or prevent the creation of a record that— (i) a person is required under a tax law to make or keep; and (ii) is, or would be, created by a system that is or includes an electronic point of sale system; and (b) the use of which would lead to a reasonable conclusion that 1 of its principal functions is to facilitate the concealment, modification, falsification, destruction, or prevention of the creation of a record. 5. A new civil penalty and two new criminal offences have been introduced in relation to involvement with ESS tools: New section 141EE establishes the ESS penalty of $5,000 for the acquisition or possession of a suppression tool. New section 143BB establishes an offence of manufacturing or supplying a suppression tool. A person convicted of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to $250,000. New section 143BC establishes an offence of acquiring or possessing a suppression tool. A person convicted of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to $50,000. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 17 REVENUE ALERTS Current view 6. The Commissioner considers the threat that ESS tools pose to the integrity of the tax system is significant. 7. Therefore, the Commissioner will be increasing his focus on identifying the customers who are or may be thinking of acquiring, creating or using the ESS tools. Where cases are disclosed, the Commissioner will be considering all of the options that are available to him to respond whenever these tools are found. Offence of manufacturing or supplying suppression tools (section 143BB) 8. It is an offence under143BB(1) to: Manufacture, develop, or publish a suppression tool that is provided to a person: i) who is liable for an ESS penalty, ii) w ho commits an offence under section 143BC, iii) or who commits an offence under section 143BB(2). 9. It is an offence under143BB(2) to: Knowingly supply, make available for use, or otherwise provide a suppression tool, or the right to use a suppression tool, to a person resident in New Zealand, or knowingly provide a service to a person resident in New Zealand that includes the use of a suppression tool (subsection (2)). 10. T he penalty for committing any of these offences is a fine up to a maximum of $250,000. 11. I f you are considering involvement in some way in creating or providing ESS tools you should be aware Inland Revenue will be actively considering prosecution under section 143BB in appropriate cases. Acquiring or possessing electronic sales suppression tools Electronic sales suppression penalty (section 141EE) 12. Section 141EE of the TAA establishes a civil penalty for taxpayers who knowingly acquire, possess or control a suppression tool, or have the right to use the suppression tool, with the purpose of evading their own, or some other person’s, assessment or payment of tax (referred to as the ESS penalty). 13. I t is important to note that a person is treated as meeting the purpose test if they have used the suppression tool to evade the assessment or payment of tax. 14. A n exception to the penalty exists for taxpayers who acquire a business whose operations include the use of a suppression tool if the taxpayer could not reasonably have known of the tool’s existence and has not used the tool. This ensures taxpayers who accidentally acquire a tool in this way are not penalised for this unintentional acquisition. 15. The ESS penalty amount is set at $5,000. Offence of acquiring or possessing suppression tools (section 143BC) 16. Section 143BC of the TAA establishes the criminal equivalent of the civil ESS penalty. It provides that it is an offence for a taxpayer required to keep records under a tax law to knowingly acquire, possess or control a suppression tool, or have a right to use the suppression tool, with the purpose of evading their own or some other person’s assessment or payment of tax. 17. T he penalty for committing this offence is a fine of up to a maximum of $50,000. 18. I f you are considering getting ESS tools you should be aware that Inland Revenue will be actively considering prosecution under section 143BC in appropriate cases. Further consequences of using electronic sales suppression tools 19. As well as the new civil and criminal penalties further consequences could arise for taxpayers who use ESS tools. 20. F irstly, the Commissioner considers that the use of sales suppression tools to reduce sales with a resulting decrease in the income tax and/or GST that might otherwise arise is tax evasion. 21. Where ESS tools are used the Commissioner will consider whether to prosecute in relation to the tax evasion (for example under section 143B). A person who is convicted of an offence under that section is liable to: (a) imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years; or (b) a fine not exceeding $50,000; or (c) both. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 18 REVENUE ALERTS 22. This is in addition to any prosecution for acquiring or having possession or control of an electronic sales suppression tool or a right to use a suppression tool. 23. Importantly, taxpayers who use these tools to artificially decrease tax liabilities may also be subject to the shortfall penalty that applies for evasion or similar act. The penalty is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. 24. T his is in addition to being required to pay the actual tax shortfall that arises from using the ESS tools as well as any resulting use of money interest and late payment penalties. Reduction in penalty for previous behaviour not available 25. Further, the reduction in a shortfall penalty for previous behaviour is not available in relation to the 150% shortfall penalty where ESS tools have been used. Write-off 26. It is important to note that the Commissioner cannot write off amounts owing (including the shortfall penalty imposed) when a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position or evasion or a similar act, in relation to the outstanding tax. 27. T his means that where ESS tools have been used to evade tax, the outstanding amount tax plus any penalties and interest that will also arise cannot be written off. The options left to the Commissioner when the outstanding tax cannot be paid (even by instalment) are bankruptcy or liquidation. Time-bar 28. There are time limits in place for both GST and Income Tax which generally prevent the Commissioner from increasing assessments after the expiry of the applicable four-year period (this restriction is commonly referred to as the time-bar). Due to the nature of the activity if ESS tools are used to artificially reduce tax liability this restriction does not apply. Current status 29. Inland Revenue is currently investigating the extent to which ESS tools are present in New Zealand. 30. Where we identify specific instances of ESS tools being used to evade tax, Inland Revenue will consider all of the options available to the Commissioner to respond to the presence of those tools. This will include consideration of the imposition civil penalties and the possibility of prosecution. 31. T he Commissioner will require payment of any evaded tax, plus penalties and use of money interest. Where payment is not made, the Commissioner will consider applying for the taxpayer to be put into bankruptcy or liquidation. 32. If you consider that you may have become involved with ESS tools, we recommend you discuss the matter with your tax advisor, or with us and consider making a voluntary disclosure. 33. Guidelines for making a voluntary disclosure are contained in Standard Practice Statement SPS 19/02 and on the Inland Revenue website.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 19 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions people have asked. They are published here as they may be of general interest to readers. QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED QB 22/10: Can a close company deduct interest on a shareholder loan account where the amount is not known until after balance date? Question Can a close company deduct interest on a shareholder loan account in its tax return if the exact amount of interest is not known until after balance date? Answer Yes – a close company can do so if it has a legal obligation to pay the interest on the shareholder loan account based on a previously agreed formula or method. The company must have the legal obligation, including a method of calculating the liability, before its balance date, which is usually 31 March. The financial arrangements rules (FA rules) may apply to determine the timing of the deduction. Companies need to keep records of the method they used to determine the amount of interest owing and of the legal obligation to pay the interest. Key terms Close company means a company with 5 or fewer natural persons or trustees who hold more than 50% of the voting interests or market value interests in the company. All natural persons associated at the time are treated as one person (s YA 1 and s YB 3). Close companies are often small businesses owned and operated by family members. FA rules means the rules in subpart EW that require parties to a financial arrangement to spread income or expenditure from the arrangement over its term. The key purpose of the FA rules is to prevent deductions for expenditure being accelerated and income recognition being deferred. Explanation 1. Public Information Bulletin No. 130 on “Deductibility of interest, the quantum of which has not been determined at balance date” (September 1984:7) (the PIB) 1 discussed post-balance date adjustments by a company for interest on shareholders’ loan accounts. The PIB stated that such adjustments must be subject to a contractual obligation showing how to calculate the interest to be paid or credited to the shareholder. This QWBA updates the PIB to reflect changes in case law on when expenditure is incurred. It also sets out the resident withholding tax consequences of interest payments made to shareholder loan accounts. Background 2. Most close companies are automatically allowed a deduction for interest incurred on a loan although some interest is not deductible (s DB 7). However, not all companies get an automatic deduction. Qualifying companies, some non- resident companies and companies that derive exempt income (except in certain circumstances) are some of the excluded companies. 3. Us ually a company knows how much interest it owes on any money it has borrowed and how much it can deduct as an expense. However, where a company borrows money from its shareholders, it may not be able to calculate the amount of interest payable until after its balance date. 1 This item is set out in full at the end of this document. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 20 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 4. This is often the case for close companies who have only a few shareholders. Amounts owing to shareholders such as interest or a salary may be credited to a shareholder’s loan account, but the amount owing may depend on the company’s profitability. Such amounts may not therefore be determined until after balance date. For example, a company has an extended period in which to pay shareholder-employees their salary (s EA 4(3)). Once the company has determined its result for the year and calculated the shareholder-employees’ salaries, it will know the final balance of those shareholders’ loan accounts and can calculate any interest owing to shareholders. 5. I nterest is normally paid on shareholder loan accounts at a market rate. If interest is paid at above market rates, it may give rise to FBT or a non-cash dividend. 2 6. To deduct interest at balance date, where the exact amount owing is not known until after that date, a company must show that: it has incurred the interest on or before balance date, and the amount is calculated based on a previously agreed formula or method. 7. A s hareholder loan account is a loan between a company and a shareholder. Loans are generally subject to the FA rules. The FA rules will therefore determine when interest income from a loan is derived and when a deduction for the interest payment can be taken. Under the FA rules, shareholders that are associated with a company, for example, through family or trust relationships, may have to account for interest on the same basis as the company (s EW 59). This will usually be on an accrual basis. Incurring interest 8. Interest is deductible in the year in which it is incurred, unless other tax laws, such as the FA rules, apply (s BD 4(2)). 3 A company incurs interest when it pays, agrees to pay or becomes definitively committed to the interest. 4 This means that a company must have an existing legal obligation to pay the interest. A legal obligation can exist even if the obligation to pay the interest has a condition attached or the obligation can be changed. 5 For example, a company would still have a legal obligation to pay interest if the company and its shareholders agreed that interest would only be paid on the shareholders’ loan accounts if the company made a profit. 9. If there is just a possibility that interest might be payable, the company will have no legal obligation to pay it. This situation might occur where directors have discussed the payment of interest and agreed to see if the company has made enough profit before deciding whether interest should be paid. In that case, the company has no legal obligation to pay on or before balance date. 10. F or close companies (like other companies), the obligation to manage the business and affairs of the company rests with the board of directors. 6 Therefore, whether a close company has an existing legal obligation to pay interest on a shareholder loan account should be reflected in a decision of the directors of the close company (who may also be shareholders of the company) 7 . 11. F or example, there may be written agreements, meeting minutes, director resolutions, correspondence with shareholders or other written confirmation that the company agrees to pay interest on shareholders’ loan accounts. The legal obligation must be to pay interest, not just to repay the loan. 2 See “IS 21/10 Non-cash dividends” (2 July 2021) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 (August 2021): 16. 3 For more detail on financial arrangements, see “IS 22/05: Cash basis persons under the financial arrangements rules”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34, No 8 (September 2022): 38, or “IS 20/07: Income tax – Application of the financial arrangements rules to foreign currency loans used to finance foreign residential rental property”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 7 (August 2020): 110. 4 CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351. 5 FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd (1953) 88 CLR 492.  Section 128 of the Companies Act 1993. 7 A M Bisley & Co Ltd & Ors v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 21 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 1: Interest has not been incurred Upkwick NZ Limited has three shareholders who are also directors – Miley, Miriana and Taylor. Each shareholder has a shareholder’s loan account. The company is newly incorporated and unsure whether it will make a profit in its first year of operation (to 31 March 2022) as a housebuilder. In July 2022, the accountant confirms that the company has made a small profit. The directors did not discuss whether interest would be paid on any shareholders’ loan accounts until their accountant contacted them to ask whether interest was to be paid. In August 2022, the directors agreed at a company meeting that interest should be charged on the balances of the shareholders’ loan accounts at the end of every income year as long as the company makes a sufficient profit. The company agrees that the rate of interest should be the same rate as the 1-year fixed term deposit rate at Milton Bank on 31 March each year. On the same day, Miriana emails the company accountant to relay the company’s decision. The accountant includes this in the August 2022 company minutes. Upkwick NZ Limited has not incurred any interest in its first year of operation. The directors did not determine whether any interest was to be charged on the shareholder loan accounts until after the end of the income year. The interest is therefore not deductible in the income year ended 31 March 2022. Example 2: Interest has not been incurred Snazzy Sox Limited has two shareholders who are also directors – Aroha and her grandfather Hemi. In setting up the company in May 2021, Hemi provided 95% of the funding required to manufacture merino socks for dogs. Before 31 March 2022, the directors discuss whether the company should pay interest on Hemi’s shareholder loan account. Hemi tells Aroha that there’s no need for the company to pay him interest for the first couple of years, but that he might need some interest to be paid on the loan in 2024, depending on the company’s financial situation, because his grandson Etera is getting married in that year. The directors agree that the company will discuss paying interest on any shareholder loan accounts in 2023. Snazzy Sox Limited has not incurred a legal obligation to pay Hemi interest in any of the 2022-24 income years, as any payments are no more than pending, threatened or expected in those years. Example 3: Interest has been incurred Spurred on by its success in 2022, Upkwick NZ Limited from Example 1 continues to build houses in the 2023 income year. In July 2023, the company’s accountant confirms that the company has made a sufficient profit to pay interest on the shareholder loan accounts. The accountant determines the interest payable on each shareholder loan account based on the company minutes from August 2022 which show the company’s agreement to pay interest and how to calculate the interest payable. Because the company agreed to charge interest before 31 March 2023, identified a method of calculation and emailed the company’s accountant with this information, Upkwick NZ Limited can demonstrate that it has a legal obligation to pay interest to its shareholders on their loan accounts in the income year. Upkwick NZ Limited has therefore incurred interest in the income year ending 31 March 2023. Method of determining the amount payable 12. Part of having a legal obligation to pay interest is being able to work out how much interest is owed. With shareholder loan accounts, this calculation may not be possible until after balance date. 13. However, if before balance date a company and its shareholders have agreed how to calculate the amount of interest that will be payable once the company’s accounts are finalised, the company can deduct the interest in its tax return. 8 The method of calculation must be agreed in the year for which the deduction is sought, that is, before balance date. There must be a method of calculation and it must be certain. Guessing how much interest should be paid is not a method of calculation. 8 RACV Insurance Pty Ltd v FCT 74 ATC 4169; Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v FC of T 77 ATC 4186. example Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 22 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 14. Methods of calculating the amount of interest payable could be based on: the terms of an agreement that provides a method of calculating the interest, a bank rate at a given date, or interest rates used in previous years. 15. A company must keep documents to show the method it has agreed to use to calculate the interest. These could include written agreements, meeting minutes, directors’ resolutions, correspondence with shareholders or other written confirmation as to how the amount is calculated. Example 4: Method of calculation is certain The Closet Company Limited has a business offering home storage solutions. Its five shareholders are all family members. Two of the shareholders are also directors. When the company was first established in July 2021, the directors discussed the payment of interest on shareholder loan accounts at a board meeting. They agreed that an interest rate of 1% more than the interest rate on balance date, on a 1-year fixed term deposit at Milton Bank, will be applied to the balance of the individual shareholder loan accounts at balance date. This decision is recorded in the minutes kept by the Closet Company Limited. The Closet Company Limited has incurred an interest expense in the income year. The amount of interest payable can be calculated using the current Milton Bank interest rate at balance date. The company can also rely on the board meeting minutes to demonstrate its obligation to make payment and the method it used to calculate the interest amount. Paying the interest 16. When a company pays interest owing to a shareholder, it may have to deduct resident withholding tax (RWT) from the payment and pay that amount to Inland Revenue. Generally, this requirement will apply if the company is resident in New Zealand and carrying on a taxable activity or is a non-resident carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand through a fixed establishment (ss RE 3 and RE 4). However, the company may not be required to deduct RWT if it pays less than $5,000 in interest in the year (s RE 10). 17. For RWT purposes, a company will pay interest to a person when it: gives the interest to them, for example, by bank transfer, credits the amount to a shareholder’s loan account, or deals with the amount in their interest, or on their behalf, in some other way such as when it pays a bill to a third party for them (s YA 1 – definition of “pay”). 18. T he way that a company pays interest to shareholders determines whether payment has been made for RWT purposes. A company may pay interest to a shareholder for RWT purposes before transferring the funds to a bank account or crediting it to a shareholder’s loan account. This situation could occur when directors make an unconditional resolution to pay the interest, or they approve the financial statements as shown in Example 5. 19. A c ompany with non-resident shareholders may have to deduct non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) from a payment of interest. For more detail on when companies must deduct RWT and NRWT, see Resident withholding tax (RWT) and Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) payer’s guide IR 283 (June 2020), Non-resident withholding tax and NRWT Payer’s guide IR 291 (September 2020). Example 5: Payment of interest has been made In late May 2023, the Closet Company Limited’s accountant quantifies the interest due on the shareholder loan accounts and prepares the journal entries for the interest payments. The Closet Company Limited finalises its 2023 year-end accounts at an Annual General Meeting on 8 June 2023. The ratified accounts include the journal entries crediting the shareholder loan accounts of three of the shareholders with the interest payable. On 15 June 2023, the Closet Company Limited pays the other two shareholders their interest by bank transfer as requested. The date of payment for RWT purposes for three of the shareholders is 8 June 2023 as this is the date that the directors of the Closet Company Limited ratified the accounts crediting the interest to the shareholder loan accounts. The date of payment for the other two shareholders is 15 June 2023, when the bank transfers were made. The Closet Company Limited should deduct RWT from the interest it pays to all its shareholders on these dates and return it to Inland Revenue by 20 July 2023. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 23 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Taking the deduction 20. Under the FA rules, parties to a financial arrangement must spread interest over the period of the arrangement. Where interest is accrued on shareholder loan accounts on a daily basis and paid on an annual basis, there will be no income or expenditure to spread. This means deductions can be taken when the company incurs the interest expense, and the interest income will need to be returned by the shareholders when they derive it. 21. I f interest is not paid annually, Inland Revenue expects companies to apply the FA rules to determine when a deduction for the interest expense can be taken. Receiving the interest 22. A shareholder will be treated as receiving interest in the year that they derive it. Which year this is will depend on whether the shareholder returns their income as they receive it or as they earn it (even if they haven’t received payment) (s BD 3(3)). If the FA rules apply to spread any income, those rules will determine the time of derivation. 23. As noted at \[7\], under the FA rules, shareholders that are associated with a company may have to account for interest on the same basis as the company (s EW 59). A company and a shareholder (who is not a company) will be associated persons if the shareholder has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more. However, if a shareholder is an associated person of another shareholder, their interests are combined and treated as one interest. With close companies usually being family- owned companies, shareholders are very likely to be associated with one another because they are related by blood, by family trust relationships or other relationships (ss YB 4 – YB 14). This means that both the company and its shareholders will have to account for interest on the same basis. This will usually be on an accrual basis. 24. A s hareholder will still derive interest income if they do not receive it but the amount is credited to their account or they direct the company to use the money in another way for the shareholder’s benefit (s BD 3(4)). For example, the shareholder may direct the company to pay the interest amount directly to satisfy the shareholder’s debt with a third party. 25. A shareholder can claim a credit for any RWT deducted and paid in their tax return for the year that they derive the interest. Example 6: Use of RWT credit The Closet Company Limited in Example 5 pays interest to its shareholders on 8 June and 15 June 2023. It also deducts an amount of RWT on these dates. On 18 July 2023, the company’s accountant reports the required information to Inland Revenue. This includes the interest paid, the RWT deducted and the names, contact details, IRD numbers and tax rates of the shareholders. At the same time, the accountant pays the RWT deducted to Inland Revenue. The next day, the accountant prepares and files tax returns for the year ending 31 March 2023 for both the company and the shareholders. The company returns its income on an accrual basis. The shareholder loan accounts are financial arrangements and the company and the shareholders are associated persons. The accountant therefore returns the interest income of the shareholders on the same basis as the company and includes the interest income in the shareholders’ tax returns for 31 March 2023. The shareholders’ tax returns include a tax credit for the RWT deducted. The shareholders can claim the amount of RWT withheld by the Closet Company Limited in their tax returns for the year ending 31 March 2023 because the RWT has been deducted and paid to Inland Revenue.

The area of concern is the practice of creating and claiming deductions for interest for which no liability existed at balance date. A typical example is the post-balance date adjustments by a company for interest on the shareholders' advances. Unless there is a contractual obligation at balance date to pay the interest it is the Department's view that the interest has not been incurred in the relevant income year. This view is well supported by case law. While the actual quantum of the interest need not be determined by balance date, the interest adjustments must be subject to a contractual obligation (resolution or separate agreement) which shows how the interest to be paid or credited is to be calculated. The rate of interest payable, (e.g., 11 percent) need not necessarily be specified but some basis or measure for calculation would be expected, e.g., the average bank overdraft rate for the period. It is acknowledged that there will be circumstances, e.g., insufficient profits, where a lesser amount will actually be paid or credited and this generally will be acceptable. In essence it is necessary that a contractual obligation, evidenced in writing, exists in the year of claim. Where rates and amounts are not specified, or are subject to modification in certain circumstances, the method of determining the amount and/or the relevant circumstances, should be given.

Facts | Meka 1. The Taxpayer is an individual who registered for GST because they were starting a new video production business. During the periods in dispute, the Taxpayer returned expenses relating to the cost of various electronic equipment and some accommodation costs and claimed input tax deductions, but did not return any income or output tax, resulting in a refund position. 2. C ustomer & Compliance Services, Inland Revenue (CCS) argued that the Taxpayer has not been carrying on a taxable activity. CCS considered any activity that was carried on by the Taxpayer was insufficiently continuous or regular to constitute a taxable activity and was merely commencement activity only, which does not itself amount to a taxable activity. Issues | Take 3. The main issue considered in this dispute was whether the Taxpayer has been carrying on a taxable activity. 4. There was also a preliminary issue on the onus and standard of proof. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 26 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Decisions | Whakatau 5. The Tax Counsel Office (TCO) decided that the Taxpayer has taken steps towards establishing a taxable activity, but was not yet carrying on a taxable activity, having not yet moved beyond preparatory work. Reasons for decisions | Pūnga o ngā whakatau Preliminary issue | Take tōmua: Onus and standard of proof 6. The onus of proof in civil proceedings 1 is on the taxpayer, except for shortfall penalties for evasion or similar act, or obstruction. 2 The taxpayer must prove that an assessment is wrong, why it is wrong, and by how much it is wrong. 3 7. The standard of proof in civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities. 4 This standard is met if it is proved that a matter is “more likely than not”. 5 TCO applied a similar standard to considering the issue in this dispute, given the Taxpayer’s ability to challenge any subsequent assessments that are made in civil proceedings. Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Taxable activity 8. The issue is whether the Taxpayer has been carrying on a taxable activity. If the Taxpayer has yet to commence a taxable activity, as CCS argued, the Taxpayer is not entitled to the input tax deductions claimed and the Commissioner can cancel the Taxpayer’s registration from the date of registration. 9. S ection 20 provides for the deduction of input tax from output tax, but only to the extent the goods or services to which the input tax relates are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. 10. “Taxable supply” is defined in s 2 to mean a supply of goods and services in New Zealand that is charged with tax under s 8. Section 8 imposes GST on supplies of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the registered person. 6 Therefore, to make taxable supplies, a person must be carrying on a taxable activity. 11. There are four requirements that must be satisfied to show there is a taxable activity under s 6(1)(a): There must be an activity. 7 The activity must be carried on continuously or regularly by a person. 8 The activity must involve, or be intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person. 9 The supply or intended supply must be made for a consideration. 10 12. Section 6(2) provides that anything done in connection with the beginning or ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. 1 Challenge proceedings (ie, the proceedings that would follow if this dispute proceeds to the Taxation Review Authority or a court) are civil proceedings. 2 Section 149A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 3 Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA); Beckham v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 22,066 (CA). 4 Section 149A(1) of the TAA; Yew v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710 (CA); Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,493 (HC); Case X16 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,216; Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028. 5 Miller v Minister of Pensions \[1947\] 2 All ER 372, 374. 6 See Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 at 3,235. 7 Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC) at 11,233, CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA) at 14,078, and Case 14/2016 \[2016\] NZTRA 14, (2016) 27 NZTC 3-036 at \[63\]. 8 CIR v Newman (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA) at 12,100; Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 277 at 278; Premier Automatic Ticket Issues Ltd v FCT (1933) 50 CLR 268 (HCA) at 298; Case 14/2016 at \[67\]-\[68\]; Wakelin v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 (HC) at 13,185-13,186; Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 at 3,238-3,239; Allen Yacht Charters Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270 (HC) at 11,274; Case P20 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,136 at 4,147; Tout & Anor v Cook (1991) 13 NZTC 8,053 (HC). 9 Definition of “supply” in s 5(1); Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) at 6,223; Pacific Trawling Ltd v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Fisheries (2005) 22 NZTC 19,204 (HC); Case S77 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,483; Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391; Case N27 at 3,239-3,238; Case 14/2016 at \[69\]. 10 Definition of “consideration” in s 2(1); CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) at 13,193; Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636 (HC); Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA) at \[61\]; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC) at 13,150; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA) at \[18\] and \[30\].

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 27 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 13. The case law on the relevance of a beginning of a taxable activity confirms that s 6(2) adds anything done in connection with the beginning of a taxable activity to the taxable activity but does not create one where one would otherwise not exist. Section 6(2) merely adds the commencement activity to the taxable activity. By itself, it cannot amount to a taxable activity. 11 14. TCO concluded that the Taxpayer was not carrying on a taxable activity, and therefore, was not entitled to the input tax deductions claimed for these reasons: The Taxpayer has undertaken activities that could constitute an activity for the purposes of the s 6 definition of “taxable activity”. However, it was clear that the Taxpayer has not been carrying on a taxable activity during the periods in dispute. While the Taxpayer has taken steps to establish their video production business, they have yet to achieve that enterprise. The steps taken by the Taxpayer, which included the purchase of set up equipment and producing sample work to demonstrate their skills, were preparatory and had not yet gone beyond the development work for a taxable activity. While s 6(2) deems the inclusion of commencement (and termination) activity into the course of a taxable activity, the Taxpayer has not yet established any taxable activity. The case law is clear that commencement work can only be added to such an activity, and by itself, cannot amount to a taxable activity. In terms of the definition in s 6(1), the Taxpayer’s preparatory work in itself was not an activity that involves, or intends to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. In any event, the activity of the Taxpayer has not commenced to the necessary degree to be either continuous or regular to comprise a taxable activity. 15. The Commissioner may cancel a person’s GST registration if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person is not carrying on a taxable activity (s 52(5)). The cancellation may be retrospective to the date the person was GST registered if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person did not carry on any taxable activity from that date (s 52(5A)). As the Taxpayer was not carrying on a taxable activity, the Commissioner is entitled to cancel the Taxpayer’s GST registration from the date of registration. 11 C ase 14/2016 at \[72\] and \[96\]; Case P73 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,489 at 4,493 to 4,494.

Facts | Meka 1. This dispute involved a two-lot subdivision carried out at a property by the Taxpayer. 2. T he Taxpayer is an individual. While outside of New Zealand, the Taxpayer purchased a property in New Zealand (the Property). The Taxpayer funded the purchase out of their own money. 3. The Taxpayer stated that they acquired the Property for the purpose of renovating and extending it to live in with their extended family. The Taxpayer’s extended family moved into the existing dwelling at the Property upon settlement. The Taxpayer joined the family at the Property upon their return to New Zealand a few months later. 4. An architect was engaged to consider the extension of the existing dwelling. However, due to some serious issues with the existing dwelling, such as drainage and asbestos, it was suggested that the Taxpayer should subdivide the Property into two lots and construct a new dwelling on each lot. 5. Consequently, plans for the two new houses were drawn up and finance was obtained from the bank to fund the project. A resource consent application was submitted to the local council, which was subsequently approved and issued, to demolish the existing dwelling, to construct two new dwellings and to subdivide the land into two lots. Building consents were also issued in respect of both lots. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 29 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 6. While the works were undertaken, the Taxpayer’s extended family moved into a rental property. The Taxpayer was outside of New Zealand for a part of that time but lived in the rental property with the extended family while they were in New Zealand. 7. The Taxpayer asserted that they occupied the newly constructed family home at the Property for 8 months prior to the subdivision of the land. 8. T he subdivision of the Property was completed after the code compliance certificate was issued for both dwellings. Two new titles were issued – one for the land on which the family home was constructed (House A) and the other for the land on which the second dwelling was constructed (House B). 9. The Taxpayer sold House B soon after the subdivision was completed and received proceeds from the sale. 10. T he Taxpayer lived at House A for a further 5 years after selling House B. Issues | Take 11. The main issues considered in this dispute were: whether the Taxpayer entered into an undertaking or scheme at the Property for the dominant purpose of making a profit for s CB 3 to apply to the sale of House B; whether the Taxpayer acquired the Property for a purpose or with an intention of disposing of it for s CB 6 to apply to the sale of House B; whether the residential land exclusion in s CB 17(2) prevented s CB 12 from applying to the sale of House B; and whether the supply of House B was subject to GST. 12. There was also a preliminary issue on the onus and standard of proof. Decisions | Whakatau 13. The Tax Counsel Office (TCO) decided that: The Taxpayer did not enter into the undertaking or scheme at the Property for the dominant purpose of making a profit. Therefore, the sale proceeds are not income for the Taxpayer under s CB 3. The Taxpayer acquired the Property for the sole purpose and with the sole intention of creating a home for themself and their extended family. Therefore, the proceeds of sale of House B are not income for the Taxpayer under s CB 6. The Taxpayer occupied the Property mainly as residential land prior to the subdivision. Therefore, the exclusion in s CB 17(2) applies to the Taxpayer and the sale proceeds are not income for the Taxpayer under s CB 12. The Taxpayer did not carry on a “taxable activity”, as defined in s 6 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (G S TA), in carrying out the development, construction and subdivision project at the Property. Therefore s 8(1) of the GSTA does not require the Taxpayer to charge GST on the supply of House B.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 30 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 16. An assessment made by the Commissioner cannot be arbitrary. He must make the best judgment he can on the information in his possession as to the amount of taxable income and the amount of tax payable. In some cases, a taxpayer may be able to discharge the onus of proof by showing that the assessment is arbitrary or demonstrably unfair. 6 Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Section CB 3 – undertaking or scheme 17. Section CB 3 includes in a taxpayer’s assessable income amounts derived from the carrying on or carrying out of an undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit. 18. The issue is whether s CB 3 applies to the sale of House B. 19. Customer & Compliance Services (CCS) argued that s CB 3 applies to the sale of House B because the Taxpayer carried on or carried out an undertaking or scheme (involving the demolition of the existing dwelling, subdivision of the land into two lots, building a new dwelling on the land that became House B, and the sale of House B) entered into or devised for the dominant purpose of making a profit. 20. The Taxpayer argued that they carried on or carried out the development, subdivision and building work for the dominant purpose of providing a home for themself and their extended family. 21. T he key principles derived from case law on s CB 3 are: An undertaking or scheme is a programme of action, or series of steps, directed to an end result. The plan or purpose must be coherent and have some unity of conception, but it does not need to be precise. There must be a nexus between the undertaking or scheme and any gain derived. 7 Not all schemes or undertakings come within the scope of s CB 3. In the case of an undertaking or scheme involving a single transaction of acquisition and re-sale, at least, the provision is intended to apply if the undertaking or scheme exhibits the characteristics of a business deal but falls short of a business. 8 The provision does not apply to tax capital gains where the taxpayer has done no more than realise a capital asset (even if this is done in a way that secures the best price). 9 For s CB 3 to apply, profit-making must be the dominant purpose of entering into or devising the undertaking or scheme. A taxpayer may have more than one purpose for entering into or devising an undertaking or scheme; but for s CB 3 to apply, the purpose of making a profit must be “the purpose” for entering into or devising the undertaking or scheme. 10 The focus is on the taxpayer’s subjective purpose in entering into or devising the undertaking or scheme; but this is assessed objectively. 11 This is tested when the undertaking or scheme commences 12 , this being when it is clear that the taxpayer has taken an overt step in putting into action a coherent plan formulated earlier. 13 This is to be determined on the facts of each case. 14 In respect of an undivided block of land, it is the taxpayer’s dominant purpose in relation to the block as a whole that is relevant. 15 6 Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA); CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meat Co Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,150 (CA); CIR v New Zealand Wool Board (1999) 19 NZTC 15,476 (CA). 7 Investment & Merchant Finance v FCT (1970) CLR 177 (HCA) at 189; Vuleta v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 325 (NZSC) at 329; Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131 (CA) at 61,141; Case S86 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,538 at 7,548. 8 McClelland v FCT 70 ATC 4115 (PC) at 26-27; Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131 (CA) at 61,141.

Based on the facts and the evidence presented in this dispute, TCO decided that the Taxpayer did not enter into the undertaking or scheme at the Property for the dominant purpose of making a profit, and therefore, the proceeds from the sale of House B were not income for the Taxpayer under s CB 3 for these reasons: The Taxpayer entered into an undertaking or scheme in relation to the Property for the demolition of the existing dwelling and associated development work, the construction of two new dwellings, and subdivision of the Property into two lots. The undertaking or scheme commenced when the Taxpayer applied for a resource consent for the development, construction and division work. Where an undertaking or scheme involves a single transaction of acquisition and re-sale, s CB 3 does require that the undertaking or scheme exhibits the characteristics of a “business deal” but does not require that a “business” is carried on in terms of the criteria in Grieve. It is considered the Taxpayer’s undertaking or scheme arguably did not involve “a single transaction of acquisition and re-sale”. However, even if it did, the Taxpayer’s undertaking or scheme did not exhibit the characteristics of a “business deal”. Where land is undivided (as the Property was when the Taxpayer entered into the undertaking or scheme), the relevant case law establishes that it is not possible for a taxpayer to have separate “dominant” purposes for separate parts of the undivided land. The Taxpayer’s purpose for the sale of House B must be viewed in light of their purpose for the whole property on commencement of the undertaking or scheme. The Taxpayer’s dominant purpose for the Property as a whole on entering into the undertaking or scheme was to create a new home for themself and their extended family. Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Section CB 6 – acquired for purpose of disposal 23. Under s CB 6, an amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if they acquired the land: for one or more purposes that included the purpose of disposing of it, and/or with one or more intentions that included the intention of disposing of it. 24. TCO concluded that the findings that the Taxpayer acquired the Property for the sole purpose and with the sole intention of creating a new home for themself and their extended family, prevented any finding that s CB 6 applied to treat the sale proceeds of House B as income. Issue 3 | Take tuatoru: Residential land exclusion 25. The issue is whether the exclusion for residential land contained in s CB 17(2) prevents s CB 12 from applying to the sale of House B. 26. Section CB 12(1) taxes as income certain amounts that a person derives from the disposal of land where there is an undertaking or scheme involving the development of land or the division of land into lots. However, s CB 12(1) does not apply if an exclusion referred to in s CB 12(2) applies, one of which is the exclusion for residential land in s CB 17. 27. The exclusion in s CB 17(2) applies if the land disposed of is a lot resulting from the division into two or more lots of a larger area of land not exceeding 4,500 square metres immediately before the division and the larger area of land was occupied by the taxpayer mainly as residential land. 28. CCS argued the exclusion in s CB 17(2) did not apply on the basis that the Taxpayer did not occupy the Property mainly as residential land at the relevant times. 29. The Taxpayer argued that the exclusion contained in s CB 17(2) applied on the basis that the Taxpayer and their family did occupy the Property mainly as residential land at the relevant times. 30. T he following principles can be derived from case law 16 that relates to the exclusion: A taxpayer whose activities in relation to that land are carried on for the purposes of residing on that land has occupied that land as residential land. 17 The division of the land into lots does not take place until the stage when a separate title can be issued in respect of the lots in question. 18 16 TCO concluded that the intended scope and effect of the residential exclusion in s CB 17(2) is the same as when it was first enacted as s 88AA(3) of the LITA 1954. Case law on the predecessor sections is therefore considered authoritative in interpreting s CB 17(2). 17 Case C33 (1978) 3 NZTC 60,312, also cited as TRA Case 6 (1978) 3 TRNZ 54 Lloyd Martin SM. 18 Wellington v C of IR (1981) 5 TRNZ 51,154. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 32 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES It is not necessary for the land to have had a dwellinghouse erected on it prior to subdivision or even for it to have been used “in conjunction with a residence” (as grounds) prior to subdivision. It is enough if the land was intended to be used by a taxpayer to erect their own home and/or if the taxpayer intended that the land was to form part of the grounds for the taxpayer’s residence, provided there had been some work done towards achieving that objective. 19 Lots of land that were used or intended to be used as the grounds for a taxpayer’s dwellinghouse are within the definition of “residential land” that is occupied by that taxpayer. 20 For a taxpayer to occupy land “mainly” (previously “primarily and principally”) as residential land their foremost or chief reason for that occupation must be to use that land for their own residential purposes (or for residential purposes for themself and members of their family living with them). 21 31. It is implicit from the case law that it does not matter if the taxpayer is temporarily absent from the land or has another home during the period of ownership of the relevant property prior to subdivision. 32. In addressing the parties’ arguments, TCO made the following observations about s CB 17(2): Section CB 17(2) is a use-based test. The exclusion is based on the taxpayer’s intended use for the land. The case law indicates that land intended for use as a residence, but which is temporarily used for other purposes, such as commercial or farm land, could potentially be “occupied mainly as residential land” provided the taxpayer is taking steps to turn it into residential land. Section CB 17(2) is not a time-based test as there is no reference in the text of the provision to a period of ownership. This can be contrasted with other provisions in the ITA, such as s CB 16A(1), which specifically refers to a day-count criterion. There is no requirement that the taxpayer must reside on the land for more than 50% of the time of ownership. The text of the provision does not refer to the taxpayer “residing” on the land (unlike the exclusion in s CB 17(1)) and does not refer to a “dwelling” (as s CB 16A does) or to a “dwellinghouse” (as s CB 16 does). The adjective “residential” describes the noun “land”. It is the land that must be “residential”. The person must “occupy” the land as residential land. The word “occupy” does not imply permanence (but it does require something more than visiting a property that is occupied by someone else). Section CB 17(2) does not require that the land was occupied as residential land “immediately before” the subdivision, only that the larger area of land was 4,500 square metres or less “immediately before” the land was divided. 33. B ased on the facts and the evidence presented in this dispute, TCO decided that the residential land exclusion in s CB 17(2) applied and, therefore, the sale proceeds were not income for the Taxpayer under s CB 12 for these reasons: The Taxpayer first occupied the Property mainly as residential land for themself and their extended family from the date of settlement. The Taxpayer continued to occupy the Property mainly as residential land until the subdivision was completed (the date new titles were issued). The relevant case law indicates that land is “occupied mainly as residential land” if the taxpayer mainly intends to use the land as their home (or as one of their homes), provided they have actually done so prior to the subdivision or have taken steps to do so prior to the subdivision. “Mainly” in this context means primarily and principally (or chiefly or pre-eminently). It is directed at the taxpayer’s main intended purpose for the land, not their main use. Considering the above in light of the Taxpayer’s facts, the Taxpayer bought the Property in their own name and with their own money. The Taxpayer’s extended family moved into the Property upon settlement, and it was intended that the Taxpayer would live there with them. The Taxpayer lived at the Property while they dealt with the architect. Even though the Taxpayer was outside of New Zealand when the project commenced, the Taxpayer returned before the project was completed to live in the rental accommodation with their extended family and, presumably, to prepare to move into House A. 19 Case C33. 20 Wellington v C of IR. 21 Case C9 (1977) 3 NZTC 60,058. See in contrast Case G76 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,348; Case K21 (1988) 10 NZTC 218; Case M102 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,634; Case 5/2013 (2013) 26 NZTC 2,004, where the dwellinghouses in question were not “primarily and principally” occupied as personal residences of the taxpayers. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 33 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES It did not matter that there was no habitable dwelling at the Property for a period of time, as the Taxpayer’s main intended purpose for the Property had not changed during that period, and steps were taken to construct a new home at the Property. Nor did it matter that the Taxpayer spent time overseas. Their extended family (and presumably some of their belongings) remained at the Property as long as there was a dwelling there. The Taxpayer was unable to live at the Property for the larger part of their absence from New Zealand anyway, and so would have had to live in alternative accommodation if they had stayed in New Zealand. The Taxpayer’s absence from New Zealand at the actual date of subdivision was not material as, again, their extended family and presumably their belongings remained at House A while the Taxpayer was temporarily overseas. The fact that the Taxpayer’s main intended purpose for the Property had not changed by the subdivision date was supported by their subsequent conduct, in that they lived at House A for a further 5 years before selling it. Issue 4 | Take tuawhā: GST 34. The issue is whether the supply of House B was subject to GST. 35. C CS argued the Taxpayer carried on a taxable activity in carrying out the development, building work and subdivision of the Property. Therefore, the Taxpayer should have been registered for GST and returned GST on the supply of House B. 36. The Taxpayer argued that the development and building work and subdivision of the Property was not a taxable activity and, therefore, they were not required to register for GST or return GST on the supply of House B. 37. Section 8(1) of the GSTA imposes GST on taxable supplies of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the registered person. Establishing that there is a taxable activity is crucial to whether a person should be registered for GST and subject to the GSTA. 38. There are four requirements that must be satisfied to show there is a taxable activity under s 6(1)(a) of the GSTA: There must be an activity. 22 The activity must be carried on continuously or regularly by a person. The activity must involve, or be intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person. 23 The supply or intended supply must be made for a consideration. 24 39. CCS and the Taxpayer agreed that the development, construction, and subdivision project amounted to “an activity” carried on by the Taxpayer, and that the activity did involve the supply of goods and services (House B) to another person for consideration. However, the Taxpayer argued that the activity was not carried on “continuously or regularly”, and therefore that there was no “taxable activity” as defined. “Continuously or regularly” 40. To “carry on” an activity means that a person must be pursuing a course of conduct habitually or be engaging in a series of acts. The focus is on the activity as a whole and not on the individual steps involved in the activity. 25 41. An activity is carried on continuously if: it is carried on over a period, in a sequence uninterrupted in time, or it is connected; 26 it has not ceased in a permanent sense, and has not been interrupted in a significant way; 27 it is not intermittent or occasional. 28 22 Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC) at 11,233, CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA) at 14,078, and Case 14/2016 \[2016\] NZTRA 14, (2016) 27 NZTC 3-036 at \[63\]. 23 Definition of “supply” in s 5(1); Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) at 6,223; Pacific Trawling Ltd v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Fisheries (2005) 22 NZTC 19,204 (HC); Case S77 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,483; Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391; Case N27 at 3,239-3,238; Case 14/2016 at \[69\]. 24 Definition of “consideration” in s 2(1); CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) at 13,193; Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636 (HC); Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA) at \[61\]; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC) at 13,150; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA) at \[18\] and \[30\].

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 34 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 42. An activity is carried on regularly if: 29 it is carried on in accordance with a definite course, or a uniform principle of action or conduct; there is a proper correspondence between the elements of the activity. 43. This means that an activity is carried on regularly if the elements of it recur at fairly fixed times, or at generally uniform intervals, so as to be of a habitual nature and character. 30 44. Whether an activity is being carried on continuously or regularly is a matter of fact and degree. 31 An activity that is of a “one-off ” nature, never to be repeated, is unlikely to qualify as an activity carried on either continuously or regularly. 32 45. A number of cases have considered whether there was a continuous or regular activity in the context of subdivision activities. The key principles drawn from these cases are: A subdivision that is part of a continuing pattern of subdivision work is likely to be a continuous and/or regular activity. 33 A one-off subdivision is not likely to be a continuous or regular activity. 34 An activity leading to only one supply should not normally be regarded as carried on continuously or regularly. 35 A one-off subdivision that involves a significant amount of physical development or other work (such as a high-end residential development) may be a continuous activity. 36 But if the subdivision involves a relatively minor amount of development work, it is unlikely to be a continuous activity. 37 The lack of any commercial flavour is not sufficient to prevent an activity from being carried on “continuously” if it is of a large enough scale. 38 46. TCO concluded that the Taxpayer’s activity was not carried on continuously or regularly and, therefore, the Taxpayer was not carrying on a taxable activity for these reasons: The development, construction, subdivision and sale of a single residential property (i.e. a “single supply” development) is usually regarded as a “one-off ” transaction and does not amount to an activity carried on “continuously”, unless the project is a high-end residential development project. Provided there was nothing extraordinary about the project, it should be regarded as a “one-off ” transaction and the steps taken by the Taxpayer should merely be regarded as components of the “one-off ” transaction. The Taxpayer’s project involved only one supply and was not connected to any other project. There was nothing extraordinary about the project. The section contour was flat and did not require extensive earthworks. House B was a relatively standard residential house. The amount of financial investment was on par with a standard two-lot development, construction and subdivision project carried on at that location at the time. 47. As the Taxpayer’s activity was not a “taxable activity”, the supply of House B was not made by the Taxpayer “in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity” carried on by them. Therefore, s 8(1) of the GSTA did not require the Taxpayer to charge GST on the supply of House B. 29 Wakelin at 13,185-13,186; Case 14/2016 at \[68\]. 30 Case N27 at 3,239. 31 Newman (CA) at 12,101; Case 14/2016 at \[67\]. 32 Newman (CA) at 12,104; Tout & Anor v Cook (1991) 13 NZTC 8,053 (HC); Allen Yacht Charters at 11,274; Case 14/2016 at \[68\]. 33 Wakelin at 13,185-13,186. 34 Case 14/2016; Tout & Anor v Cook; Newman (CA). 35 Wakelin; To u t; Newman (CA). 36 See for example Case P10 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,066; Case P76 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,512; Wakelin; Case 7/2012 \[2012\] NZTRA 07, (2012) 25 NZTC 1-019. 37 Newman (CA). 38 Case 7/2012.

CSUM 22/05: Supreme Court confirms Frucor’s tax avoidance and finds shortfall penalties apply Decision date: 30 September 2022 Case Frucor Suntory New Zealand Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2022\] NZSC 113 Legislative References Income Tax Act 2004, ss BG 1 and GB 1. Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 141B, 141D and 141FB. Legal terms Tax avoidance, shortfall penalties, unacceptable tax position, abusive tax position. Summary The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Commissioner) disallowed interest deductions claimed by the predecessor of Frucor Suntory New Zealand Limited (Frucor) in respect of a tax-driven structured finance transaction it entered into in March 2003 involving associated companies and the Deutsche Bank. The Commissioner contended that the funding arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA) and denied a portion of Frucor’s claimed interest deductions in the 2006 and 2007 income tax years. The Commissioner also contended that Frucor took an unacceptable tax position and an abusive tax position such that shortfall penalties should be imposed. Frucor challenged the assessments and was successful in the High Court, with that Court holding that the funding arrangement was not a tax avoidance arrangement. The Commissioner’s assessments for 2006 and 2007 were thereby cancelled. The Commissioner appealed and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the orders of the High Court, reinstated the Commissioner’s assessments based on tax avoidance with regards to the disallowed deductions but held that shortfall penalties did not apply. Frucor appealed the finding on tax avoidance and the Commissioner cross-appealed the finding that shortfall penalties did not apply. The Supreme Court dismissed Frucor’s appeal, finding there was tax avoidance and allowed the cross-appeal, finding shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position also applied. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 36 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Case Impact Statement The decision of the Supreme Court confirms the legal framework for consideration of avoidance under s BG 1(1) of the ITA as articulated in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115. The Court did not signal that it was making a change in approach from that of the Ben Nevis Court. In line with the Supreme Court’s summarised reasons for finding tax avoidance, the Commissioner considers that using a tax provision allowing deductibility where the economic cost or burden has not been suffered will usually be outside Parliament’s contemplation. In other words, where there is no expenditure incurred in an economic sense, Parliament would not have contemplated a deduction unless the specific provisions indicate otherwise. Artificiality and contrivance will reinforce such a conclusion. Similarly, where an income provision does not apply but the economic benefits are enjoyed by the taxpayer, this too will usually be outside Parliament’s contemplation. The Supreme Court decision confirmed the Commissioner’s broad powers to counteract any tax advantage from an arrangement deemed void in accordance with s BG 1 of the ITA through application of s GB 1 of the ITA. The Court also noted that consideration of counterfactuals as part of the counteraction process is permitted, but not mandatory. The Commissioner considers that the Supreme Court’s judgment on shortfall penalties is also an orthodox one and it does not alter the approach to determining whether an abusive tax position (ATP) shortfall penalty should apply. Shortfall penalties do not follow automatically from a finding of tax avoidance, and their applicability is a separate enquiry. The enquiry under s 141D of the TAA for an ATP penalty firstly involves whether a taxpayer took an unacceptable tax position because, viewed objectively, the tax position failed to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. The Supreme Court clarified that it is not appropriate to replace the statutory “about as likely as not to be correct” test with a test of substantiality, based on the language used in Ben Nevis. Aside from this clarification, the Commissioner considers that the Supreme Court took an orthodox approach to determining whether a taxpayer has taken an unacceptable tax position. If there is an unacceptable tax position, s 141D requires an ATP shortfall penalty if the arrangement was entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. In contrast, s BG 1 has a lower threshold, requiring an arrangement have a more than merely incidental purpose of avoiding tax. The ATP penalty tests were considered satisfied on the facts as the Supreme Court found them to be, having also analysed the state of the law at the time the tax positions were taken. The Court considered the arrangement was based on a “generic tax- driven structure” developed by Deutsche Bank (which received a significant arranger fee) and the convertible note structure had no point, “leaving aside the purpose of obtaining tax advantages in New Zealand”. A discount of 50% under s 141FB of the TAA may apply in circumstances where the taxpayer has not previously had a penalty imposed. Facts Frucor entered into a funding arrangement, whereby Deutsche Bank advanced $204m to Frucor in exchange for a fee of $1.8m and a convertible note redeemable at maturity in five years’ time by the issue of 1,025 non-voting shares in Frucor (the note). The $204m advance by Deutsche Bank was funded by a contemporaneous payment of $149m from Frucor’s parent, Danone Asia Pty Ltd (DAP), for the forward purchase of the shares from Deutsche Bank in five years’ time at a pre-agreed price matching the face value of the note (the forward purchase agreement). The balance of $55m was contributed by Deutsche Bank. Over the life of the note, Frucor paid $66m to Deutsche Bank and claimed the full $66m as interest payments on an interest only basis on $204m. The $66m coupon payments equated to the amount required to pay amortising principal and interest on the $55m introduced into the funding arrangement by Deutsche Bank. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 37 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Issues The issues for consideration by the Supreme Court were: Whether s BG 1 of the ITA (the general anti-avoidance provision) was engaged? Whether the Commissioner’s reconstruction under s GB 1(1) of the ITA, disallowing some of the interest deductions claimed, was correct? and Whether the tax positions adopted by Frucor were “unacceptable” on the basis that they did not meet the “about as likely as not to be correct” standard of s 141B of the TAA, and if so, whether they were also “abusive” on the basis that Frucor had acted with the “dominant purpose” of obtaining tax advantages (s 141D of the TAA). Decision Tax Avoidance The Supreme Court summarised its reasons for finding the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement as follows: 1 Section BG 1(1) applies to tax arrangements (such as those associated with the note) which, but for its invocation, would have been effective in producing the desired tax advantage. 2 Such application is justified if the tax advantage results from the use of a tax provision outside the parliamentary contemplation of that provision’s purpose. 3 Us e of a tax provision intended to provide relief in relation to a particular economic burden (such as a cost, a loss or a reduction in income), where such a burden has not, in economic substance, been suffered, will usually lie outside of the relevant parliamentary contemplation. This is particularly so where such use is contrived and artificial. 4 In this instance the tax provisions relied on by \[Frucor\] provide relief in relation to “interest incurred”. In economic substance, however, the payments in respect of which \[Frucor\] sought the disallowed deductions were repayments of principal. The arrangements on which \[Frucor\] relied to categorise these principal repayments as interest were contrived and artificial. Deductibility for such repayments is not within the purpose of allowing deductibility for “interest incurred”. Accordingly, \[Frucor’s\] use of the deductibility provisions lay outside of the relevant parliamentary contemplation. This means that s BG 1(1) applies to void the arrangements. Section GB 1 The Supreme Court found that because the purpose and effect of the tax avoidance arrangements were to provide deductibility for what in economic substance were repayments of principal, the Commissioner had correctly applied s GB 1(1) to adjust the taxable income of Frucor to disallow the deductions illegitimately claimed. Shortfall Penalties The Supreme Court noted, that in this case at least, the application of the “about as likely as not to be correct” standard must be taken against the background of the facts as the Court finds them to be. Based on the facts as the Supreme Court found them to be, the tax positions adopted by Frucor did not meet that standard and were thus unacceptable. Further, Frucor acted with the dominant purpose of obtaining tax advantages with the result that the tax positions were abusive. The Supreme Court found approaches taken to determining whether shortfall penalties should apply by the High Court and Court of Appeal were erroneous. The High Court erred because it determined the shortfall penalty question based on the facts as it found them to be, but the Supreme Court considered those factual findings to be wrong. The Court of Appeal did not seek to apply the “as likely as not to be correct standard” to the facts as it found them to be. Instead, it allowed its conclusion to be controlled by the result arrived at by the High Court Judge, despite not accepting his factual findings. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 38 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES CSUM 22/06: Court of Appeal confirms High Court order that backdating of child support liability was invalid Decision date: 30 November 2022 Case Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Lindsay \[2022\] NZCA 585 Legislative References Child Support Act 1991 (as it applied in October 2003), ss 4, 14, 17, 18, 19 Judicial Review Procedure Act 2016, s 16 Legal terms Judicial review; Child support; Proof of paternity; Backdated child support liability; Court’s discretion in granting judicial review; Increased costs. Summary This was an appeal by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) of the High Court decision which upheld Mr Lindsay’s judicial review, making a declaration that the child support assessment dated 23 November 2017 was invalid to the extent that it imposed backdated liability to 2003. The Commissioner also appealed the High Court’s 10% uplift award of costs. A cross appeal of the High Court decision to only award Mr Lindsay a 10% uplift in costs was undertaken by Mr Lindsay. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Commissioner’s substantive appeal and upheld the High Court’s declaration that the child support assessment which backdated Mr Lindsay’s liability to 2003 was invalid. However, the Court of Appeal allowed the Commissioner’s costs appeal and set aside the 10% uplift awarded by the High Court. Mr Lindsay’s cross appeal asking for an increase in uplift from 10% was dismissed. Impact The outcome of this case turns on its facts, however, the decision is significant being an appeal of a New Zealand Court’s first consideration of the interpretation of s 19 of the Child Support Act 1991 (the Act). However, the case will have limited precedential effect as s 19 of the Act has been further amended by the Child Support Amendment Act 2021. This amendment provides that child support only be backdated on receipt of a declaration of parentage if the custodial parent applied for the order within limited timeframes. Facts Mr Lindsay and Ms Jones began a sexual relationship in approximately 2000 which continued until the end of 2002. Ms Jones advised Mr Lindsay in March 2003 that she was pregnant with his child, and she gave birth to their son in September 2003. She applied for child support in October 2003, but it was declined on the basis the application did not provide proof of paternity or proof of birth. In 2016, Mr Lindsay was served with paternity proceedings by Ms Jones. He defended the proceedings on the basis that he could not be sure that he was the father but agreed to do DNA testing. This testing established he was the father, and a paternity order was made by consent by the Family Court on 26 October 2017. Ms Jones applied for child support at this time. On 27 November 2017 the Commissioner determined that Mr Lindsay was obliged to provide child support and his liability was backdated to 2003, the time when Ms Jones first made an application for child support. The backdated amount owing by Mr Lindsay was around $90,000. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 39 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Issues The issues for consideration by the Court of Appeal were: Whether the High Court erred in making a declaration that the child support assessment dated 23 November 2017 made by the Commissioner was invalid to the extent it imposed backdated liability to 2003. Specifically – i) W as the Judge correct to find s 19 only applied to a live child support applications and that the 2003 application was no longer live as at 2017. ii) Was the Judge correct to find s 19 did not apply because ‘unable to accept’ in s 19 differs in meaning to ‘refuse to accept’ used elsewhere in part 1 of the Act. Should the Judge have exercised his discretion not to grant relief on the basis Mr Lindsay had not properly exercised his right of objection under the Act? Was the costs awarded appropriate in all the circumstances? Whether the High Court erred in making the declaration the child support assessment was invalid Was the 2003 application live? The Court of Appeal considered the conclusion that the 2003 application was no longer live as of 2017 was well supported by the evidence. Firstly, it considered the 2003 application was largely pro forma in nature, likely prompted by the requirement in s 9 of the Act which required the recipient of a social welfare benefit to apply for a child support formula assessment. There was no incentive for Ms Jones to pursue the application as any child support payments would be retained by the state. Secondly, from 2006, any child support payments would have gone directly to Ms Jones as she was no longer in receipt of a benefit. She was aware that if the non-custodial parent did not pay child support, then she would not be paid child support. Ms Jones did not take any further steps to obtain child support for a further 10 years. Finally, when Ms Jones contacted the Commissioner in 2016, neither she nor the Inland Revenue officer she spoke to considered the 2003 application was still live. Ms Jones was advised to file another application which she did in 2017. Does section 19 only apply to live applications? The Court of Appeal’s view was that when s 19 is considered purposively and in light of the statutory context it must be limited to applications that are live. Section 19 provides an exception to the default position in s 17(2) which provides for liability for child support to commence when an application is ‘properly made’ ie: when all relevant information has been provided. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the exception in s 19 allowing child support to be backdated to when the application was made following the provision of all relevant information reflects a recognition that it can be difficult to obtain proof of parentage and without the exception it could incentivise liable parents to delay or frustrate attempts to establish proof of parentage. However, the facts did not fall within the scope of this s 19 purpose as the delays were not due to Mr Lindsay but due to Ms Jones who elected not to take steps to prove paternity and as such the 2003 application became defunct. The scheme of the Act does not envisage custodial parents seeking backdated payment of child support many years after the costs are incurred. The objects of the Act include ensuring the level of financial support is determined according to the parents’ financial capacity. This capacity is assessed on an annual basis based on the liable parents’ income of the previous year. The scheme of the Act enables carers to receive ongoing financial support when needed and allows liable parents to manage their affairs in real time. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that Mr Lindsay’s right to procedural fairness would be cut across if liability was backdated 14 years in reliance on the 2003 application, which Mr Lindsay was not notified of and which the Court considered abandoned by 2006 (at the latest). In addition, the penalties arising as a consequence of backdating liability for many years were severe; the Court of Appeal considered this outcome to be draconian and unjust which further supported a view that Parliament could not have intended the literal application of s 19 in this case. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 1 February 2023Inland Revenue Department 40 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Was the High Court correct to find the term ‘unable to accept’ in s 19 differed to ‘refuse to accept’? While it was not strictly necessary to consider this issue due to the finding s 19 only applied to live applications, the Court of Appeal made several observations including: The statutory framework does not support the view that ‘unable to accept’ creates a third category of applications that are neither accepted or refused but ‘put on hold’. The statutory scheme is binary and envisages two outcomes – acceptance or refusal. The scheme of the Act does not require the Commissioner to have an intermediate ‘unable to accept’ option to put an application on hold pending further information – this is provided for in the binary framework. In addition, the Court of Appeal found the High Court erred in finding the Commissioner had refused the 2003 application as the evidence did not support the conclusion that Ms Jones had advised in that application that she did not intend to pursue paternity proceedings. She was simply confirming paternity action had not yet been taken at the time of making the 2003 application. Should the Hight Court have declined to grant relief? The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that Mr Lindsay’s judicial review application was not an abuse of process. Therefore, the decision to reject the Commissioner’ submission that the High Court should have declined to grant relief was correct. The prospect of Mr Lindsay obtaining legal advice and lodging a properly informed objection following the notices of assessment in November 2017 within the statutory timeframe was negligible. By the end of December 2017, he had lost the ability to object to the assessments as of right. At the time his objection was rejected for lateness Mr Lindsay understood judicial review was the only option available to him and the issues were suitable for that procedure. Was the costs award appropriate? The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the high threshold required for indemnity costs was not met in this case. There was nothing to suggest the Commissioner had acted otherwise than in good faith in exercising his statutory role. However, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court increasing costs pursuant to the High Court Rules. There was nothing here to suggest Mr Lindsay was motivated to bring proceedings in the public interest. He was solely concerned (appropriately) with challenging his own child support liability. They accepted the Commissioner did not run the case as a matter of principle but that he defended it on the basis he had correctly applied the law and the assessments were valid.
