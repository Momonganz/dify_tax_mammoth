Current tax legislation can lead to impractical outcomes that may differ from how employers apply the rules in practice. Under current tax law, when an employee expenditure payment is made, provided it is to cover a work expense, it is not taxable. However, when there is a private element linked to the expense, that element is taxable. This is because it is considered to be in effect an alternative to receiving more salary or wages, which would be normally taxed. An expense is private in nature if it is intended to further some personal purpose or provide a private or domestic benefit. As meals, accommodation and normal clothing are inherently private, the starting position under current tax law is that any employee expenditure payment to cover these sorts of expenses should be taxed. In many instances, however, the private benefit is either incidental to the business objective or is minimal or hard to measure, and apportionment between the private and employment purpose is not practical, given the compliance costs associated with separating out the relative elements. Accordingly, the proposals in the bill apply the principle that the private amount should be ignored when low in value or hard to measure, and not provided as a substitute for salary or wages. The proposals also take into account three key policy objectives:  To improve clarity and certainty, thereby improving compliance. Rules that are relatively easy for employers to understand and apply aid compliance and help to minimise compliance and administration costs.  To improve fairness by ensuring employees pay their fair share of tax, and that social assistance payments are targeted at those in genuine need. When an employee expenditure payment provides a substitute for labour income or a material private benefit, it ought to be, like salary and wages, taxed and included in income when determining eligibility for social assistance. This ensures that the tax and social assistance outcomes are the same for employees irrespective of the composition of their remuneration.  To enhance economic efficiency by ensuring that tax rules in this area are not an impediment to business decision-making. The law on employee expenditure payments can affect a broad spectrum of employees who incur expenditure during the course of their work and for which they are reimbursed by their employers. In some cases their employers ultimately bear the additional tax costs. Other than this direct financial implication for the employee or employer, there is the potential for the tax rules to act, where the payment relates to accommodation and meals, as a disincentive to the free movement of labour and, more generally, to normal business activities that require travel. To avoid these economic costs, it is crucial to have rules that are clear and that tax only the private benefit element. 4 The proposed new rules have been developed after significant consultation, both leading up to the release of the November 2012 issues paper, Reviewing the tax treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments, and subsequently. A total of 27 submissions were received on the suggestions in the officials’ issues paper. Most submissions focussed on the tax treatment of accommodation expenses and establishing a boundary between private and work-related expenditure. Subsequently, Inland Revenue officials carried out further consultation with key stakeholders, including the Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. The main area of concern was that any new rules should encompass not only work-related secondments but also employee involvement in longer-term projects. Those projects included work on the Canterbury earthquake recovery and projects in other locations throughout New Zealand (for example, the ultra-fast broadband roll-out, dam rebuilds and other major water storage projects, and road building projects). The proposals in the bill have taken this various feedback into account. The proposals include the use of a set of time limits to determine the boundary between when an accommodation benefit is taxable or non-taxable rather than the use of fact-based criteria such as whether the employee still has a house at their previous work location; and valuation rules when it is taxable. A special transitional rule will apply for Canterbury earthquake recovery work. Potentially, the proposed changes could affect a wide range of employees who are required to work away from their normal place of work for a period of time, as well as on specific groups. However, in most cases the new rules will largely match existing business practice but with the added advantage of providing greater certainty, so the overall effect on employees and employers should be limited. The merits of the proposed changes are analysed in the Regulatory Impact Statement (available on http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/type/ris). Application dates Most of the proposed amendments will apply from 1 April 2015. However, there will be a choice of applying the revised accommodation rules to accommodation arrangements put in place on or after 1 January 2011, subject to meeting certain conditions. The changes specific to Canterbury earthquake recovery work will apply from 4 September 2010, the date of the first earthquake. 5 EMPLOYEE ACCOMMODATION – OUT-OF-TOWN SECONDMENTS AND PROJECTS (Clauses 20, 33 and 34) Summary of proposed amendment When an employer either provides accommodation or an accommodation payment for an employee who is on a secondment or project of limited duration, time limits will apply to determine whether the accommodation or payment is exempt from income tax. An additional transitional exemption is proposed for employees working on Canterbury earthquake recovery projects. (New sections CW 16B, C, E and CZ 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007.) Application date The proposed application date for the new rules is 1 April 2015. However, employers and employees will have the choice of applying the new rules retrospectively to accommodation arrangements put in place on or after 1 January 2011, provided they had not taken a tax position before 6 December 2012 (the date of the Commissioner’s statement on accommodation) that the amounts involved or accommodation provided were taxable. In the case of Canterbury earthquake recovery projects, the proposed application date is 4 September 2010, the date of the first earthquake. Key features Employer-provided accommodation or an accommodation payment provided because an employee needs to work at a new work location and that location is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of their home, will be tax-exempt provided:  There is either a reasonable expectation that the employee’s secondment to that work location will be for a period of two years or less, in which case the payment will be exempt for up to two years.  The move is to work on a project of limited duration whose principal purpose is the creation, enhancement or demolition of a capital asset and the employee’s involvement in that project is expected to be for no more than three years, in which case the maximum exemption period is three years.  If the move is to work on Canterbury earthquake recovery projects, the maximum period is extended to five years if the employee starts work in the period starting on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2015, and to four years if the employee starts work in the period beginning 1 April 2013 and ending 31 March 2016. The maximum period reverts to three years when the employee starts work on or after 1 April 2016. 6 Background Employer-provided accommodation and accommodation payments provide an inherently private benefit to an employee and should generally be taxed, particularly if they are provided as part of a salary trade-off. However, sometimes there is little benefit to the employee, largely because the accommodation or payments arise from the requirements of the employer or the job. In these cases there should be no tax liability. A key concern is identifying an appropriate boundary between private and work-related expenditure. The amendments propose tests based around time limits to determine the boundary. This approach should be easier for employers and employees to apply than tests that use fact- based criteria such as whether an employee has a house in their previous location. It is also the approach used in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Australia and the United States have a one-year “bright line” tax exemption, while Canada and the United Kingdom have a two-year “bright line” tax exemption. Detailed analysis Two-year time limit Example 1 Adam is an accountant who has worked for his employer in Auckland for 10 years where he lives with his family. He is sent by his employer to New Plymouth for three months to carry out an audit of a large client before returning to the Auckland office. Adam’s employer reimburses his hotel costs in New Plymouth. As Adam’s employer expects him to work in New Plymouth for less than two years, the payment that Adam receives reimbursing him for his accommodation costs in New Plymouth will be exempt income. Example 2 Bill lives in Wellington. His job is moved permanently to Auckland but he chooses not to move his family and commutes on a weekly basis, returning to Wellington at the weekend. Bill’s employer pays him an accommodation allowance towards his Auckland accommodation costs. Bill and his employer expect he will work at the Auckland workplace for more than two years. The accommodation allowance is not tax exempt under the two year rule. Accommodation linked to long-term projects of limited duration The longer maximum exempt time-period of three years allowed for involvement in longer- term projects takes into account business practices, particularly in the construction industry. The workers might be housed at or near the construction site, might share accommodation, and might be employed on a fly in/fly out basis, so would not be relocating. Employees may be recruited specifically from overseas with no intention that they ever relocate to New Zealand. 7 Example 3 Eddie is seconded by his employer to work on a dam construction project for a client in a remote area of the North Island. Because of the scale of the project, number of workers and remoteness of the location, Eddie’s employer sets up an accommodation camp to house its employees. The dam project is expected to take around five years to complete. However, Eddie’s employer expects him to work on the project for only the first two and a half years. Eddie is working on a project involving the construction of a capital asset so the three-year upper time limit applies. His employer expects him to be working at the distant work location for no more than three years so the value of the accommodation is exempt. While the projects covered by the three-year exemption will often relate to the construction industry, they may also involve upgrades of existing infrastructure and information technology development and implementation, for example. The duration of the project can be longer than three years. The project will also have to satisfy the following requirements:  Creation of a capital asset – The principal aim of the project must be the creation of a capital asset of some form, whether a new capital asset, a replacement of an existing asset, an upgrade or refurbishment.  Employment duties specific to the project – The employee must be engaged exclusively on project work (bar incidental activities).  The project must involve work for a client not related to the employer. When does the exemption cease? The payment or employer-provided accommodation will cease to be tax-exempt before the respective maximum period if any of the following occur:  The employer pays the employee’s costs associated with buying a house in or near the new work location, as an eligible relocation expense.  There is a change in the expectation that the employee will be at the new location for, as relevant, a maximum of two years or three years.  The employee’s involvement in the secondment or project comes to an end before the maximum time is up. Example 4 Donna works for an employer in Auckland. Her employer sends her to work in Hamilton for an expected 18-month period. After four months, Donna decides that she wants to relocate permanently to Hamilton and her employer agrees to make her job there permanent. Donna’s employer has agreed to pay her an accommodation allowance for the first six months after arrival. Up to the four-month point, Donna’s employer’s expectation was that she would not be working in Hamilton for more than two years, and payments to cover accommodation up to that point are exempt under the two- year rule. But given the expectation that Donna will now be working in Hamilton for more than two years, payments to cover Donna’s accommodation after four months would be taxable. 8 Anti-avoidance rules The proposed rules will be subject to certain conditions to protect against abuse:  The exemption will not apply if accommodation is provided under an explicit salary trade-off arrangement.  There will be an anti-avoidance rule to prevent behaviour intended simply to restart the respective time limit. New employees The above exemptions will apply to accommodation provided to existing employees, and to new employees in specific instances. New employees will qualify for the three-year exemption subject to the same conditions as existing employees, including that the work is on a project of limited duration and their contract is for a period of three years or less. This will ensure that there is no disparity in the treatment of new and existing employees working on the same project. New employees will only qualify for the two-year exemption when:  the employee is newly recruited to work at a particular work location but is then sent to work at another work location temporarily – for example, an individual is recruited to work in Auckland but is then sent to work in Dunedin for a month before returning to Auckland; or  an employee working for one employer is seconded to work for another employer on a temporary basis, with the expectation that the employee will return to work for the original employer – for example, an individual working for an Australian accountancy firm is sent to work for an affiliated New Zealand firm in Auckland for 18 months. A more restrictive approach is being taken for new employees in respect of the two-year rule to reduce the likelihood of behavioural changes to the way that new employees are remunerated. The existing rules applying to tax-exempt relocation payments will continue to be available to these new employees. Exceptional circumstances There will be a very restricted ability to extend the thresholds in exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances will be confined to those that are outside the control of the employer and employee, such as a natural disaster or medical emergency, that mean the employee has to stay at the work location beyond the maximum tax-free time threshold. The time limit will be extended for as long as the employee is unable to leave the work location because of the exceptional circumstance. Whether exceptional circumstances apply will be determined by self-assessment. 9 Accommodation linked to Canterbury earthquake reconstruction work Given the special nature and scale of the Canterbury earthquake reconstruction work, there will be a transitional rule (new section CZ 29) for employer-provided or paid-for accommodation for employees working on Canterbury earthquake reconstruction projects over the period from 4 September 2010 to 31 March 2019. When the employment duties of the employee require them to work in greater Christchurch on a project or projects for rebuilding or recovery work arising out of the Canterbury earthquakes, the time limit in the definition of “project of limited duration” in proposed section CW 16B(4), is effectively replaced by the following:  five years when the employee’s date of arrival is in the period from 4 September 2010 to 31 March 2015;  four years when the employee’s date of arrival is in the period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016; and  three years when the employee’s date of arrival is in the period from 1 April 2016 onwards, for arrivals up to 31 March 2019. The normal three-year rule will apply to Canterbury rebuild and recovery work from 1 April 2019. When the date of arrival in “greater Christchurch” (as defined in the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011) is in the period from 4 September 2010 (the date of the first earthquake) to 31 March 2015, the time limit will be applied by reference to the time the employee works continuously in greater Christchurch rather than to any expectation. For other periods, the time limits apply based on the employer’s expectation. Applying time limit in other cases In the case of other out-of-town secondments and projects, for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2015, the relevant time limit can be assessed by either using the employees actual period of continuous work at the distant work place or the employer’s expectation of how long the employee will be involved in the out-of-town secondment or project (see proposed section CZ 30). For other periods, the time limits apply based on the employer’s expectation. 10 EMPLOYEE ACCOMMODATION – ON-GOING MULTIPLE WORK PLACES (Clause 20) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that when an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an on- going basis the accommodation or accommodation payment will be tax-exempt without an upper time limit. (New section CW 16F of the Income Tax Act 2007.) Application dates The application dates for the proposed new rule are the same as for the previous item. Key features There are a number of circumstances in which an employee would have to work at more than one workplace on an on-going basis, because of the nature of their duties, and the additional workplaces are beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from their home. This could be the case, for example, for senior managers of large organisations. In these circumstances there will be an exemption for employer-provided accommodation and accommodation payments, without an upper time limit, given that there will be genuine on- going additional costs in such cases. (If the employee has multiple work places for a limited period, the two or three-year time limit-based exemptions may also apply.) Detailed analysis Example 1 Andrew manages two offices, one in Christchurch and one in Dunedin. He works in Christchurch two days a week and in Dunedin for three days a week. His home is in Dunedin. Andrew has more than one on-going work location. When he works in Christchurch, he is beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from his home in Dunedin. An accommodation payment to cover his hotel costs when staying in Christchurch is not taxable. The Christchurch accommodation is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. The Dunedin accommodation is not tax-exempt. The multiple workplace rule can also apply when an employee is sent on a short-term business trip to another location. In these circumstances the employee will continue to have on-going duties at their normal place of work while they are working at the other work location during the business trip. 11 Example 2 Carmen is chief executive of a large group of companies based in Auckland. The company has offices in several cities across New Zealand. Each month Carmen visits one of these offices as part of her management duties. Typically these visits can last up to a week and her employer arranges and pays for her accommodation. When Carmen is visiting the offices away from Auckland she has more than one on-going workplace for the duration of her visit. The accommodation while working at those offices is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. 12 EMPLOYEE ACCOMMODATION – CONFERENCES AND TRAINING COURSES (Clause 20) Summary of proposed amendment When an employee needs to attend a work-related conference or training course that requires at least an overnight stay, the accommodation or accommodation payment will be tax-exempt without an upper time limit. (New section CW 16D.) Application dates The application dates for the new rule are the same as for the previous item. Key features While the need for accommodation would normally arise because the work-related conference or training course is beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from the employee’s home, this need not be the case. Some courses may be held locally but for reasons, such as networking and team-building, may require employees to stay overnight. Proposed section CW 16D, therefore, covers both local and distant accommodation situations. It is possible, depending on the circumstances, that the multiple work-place exemption or the two or three-year time-based exemption could also apply. 13 EMPLOYEE ACCOMMODATION – DETERMINING TAXABLE VALUE (Clauses 11, 12, 24 and 35) Summary of proposed amendment When employer-provided accommodation, accommodation allowances and other payments for accommodation are taxable, the proposed revisions to section CE 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007 specify how to determine their taxable value. In the case of employer-provided accommodation, the taxable value will continue to be linked to market rental value but will be subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2015. However, the amendments relating to accommodation provided to ministers of religion will apply from 1 July 2013 and those relating to accommodation provided to personnel of the New Zealand Defence Force will apply from 6 December 2012. Background When employers make a payment for accommodation, then the market value is just the amount of the payment. However, when an employer directly provides accommodation to its employees, the current approach is to base the taxable amount on its market value. What “market value” means in these circumstances, including what adjustments can be made, is not always clear. The proposed rules endeavour to provide more clarity in this area. Key features  The taxable value will be confirmed as market rental value when accommodation is provided by the employer, less any rent paid by the employee and any adjustment for business/work use of the premises.  There will be a specific valuation rule for accommodation supplied (whether owned or rented) by religious bodies to their ministers (proposed section CW 25B). A long- standing administrative practice has, in certain circumstances, capped the benefit of church-supplied accommodation at 10 percent of ministers’ stipends. This longstanding practice will be incorporated into the legislation, subject to the amount to which this treatment applies being capped at a reasonable rental value that is commensurate with the duties of the minister, and the location in which the minister performs his or her duties. This rule is intended to apply across a wide variety of churches.  There is also a specific rule to confirm that the market value is discounted in the case of accommodation provided to New Zealand Defence Force personnel to reflect the specific limitations imposed on such properties (proposed section CZ 31). 14  The taxable value of employer-funded accommodation provided to employees as part of an overseas posting will be capped at the average or median rental value for accommodation in the vicinity that the employee would live if in New Zealand. This cap, which is of significance to employees who remain tax-resident in New Zealand, recognises that the market rental value of accommodation in overseas locations can be disproportionately high compared with that which an employee might occupy if working in New Zealand. Detailed analysis In addition to the above, there will be a rule for when more than one employee shares in the accommodation provided by their employer. In these circumstances, the taxable amount will, for simplicity, be apportioned equally between the employees to ensure the accommodation benefit is taxed only once. Example Two employees share a house provided by their employer with a weekly rental value of $300. They will each be taxed on $150 per week. The deduction from the taxable amount when part of the accommodation is used for work purposes (and there is no private benefit) reflects current practice and the amendment is merely intended to clarify and confirm that approach. Example An employer provides an employee with accommodation with a market rental value of $500 a week. One- tenth of the accommodation is used for work purposes. $50 is deducted from the taxable amount. Accommodation provided by religious bodies to ministers of religion The proposed valuation rule based on 10 percent of remuneration for accommodation provided to a minister of religion or member of the clergy by the religious body of which he or she is a minister will apply only to ministers who are performing religious duties. The amount exempted under this rule will be capped based on what is a reasonable rental value commensurate with the duties of the minister and the location in which the minister performs the duties. The proposed valuation rule will apply to a wide range of religious bodies and their ministers. The religious body may own the accommodation or, alternatively, rent the accommodation being provided to the minister. The proposed valuation rule extends to both these situations. This specific valuation rule will supplement the existing exemption in section CW 25 for board and lodging provided to members of religious societies or orders whose sole occupation is service in a society or order and who are not paid for their service. 15 Accommodation for employees working overseas The proposed amendment to use a New Zealand-based value rather than the market value of the overseas accommodation will apply not only to employer-provided accommodation but also when the employer makes an accommodation payment for the employee’s accommodation costs at the overseas location. In establishing the value of the comparable New Zealand property, the work location the employee would be likely to be working in for the employer, and the average or median market rental values at or near that work location would need to be taken into account. Example Zoe is seconded by her employer to Brussels for three years and is provided with a flat for the duration of her secondment. The rent paid by the employer is equivalent to $120,000 a year. Zoe would normally work in Wellington if working in New Zealand, where an average rental value would be $24,000. Zoe will pay tax on an accommodation benefit of $24,000. When there is more than one location in New Zealand where the employee could work for the employer, a New Zealand-wide valuation can be used. Accommodation provided to Defence Force personnel The proposed valuation rule for accommodation provided to New Zealand Defence Force personnel is that, up to 31 March 2015, the rent currently being paid will be treated as the market rental value. After that date, the market value will be the lesser of (a) the market rental value for the accommodation and (b) the market rent for the national New Zealand Defence Force benchmark property of that type less a discount. The benchmark properties, their market value and the discount will be determined jointly by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Chief of the Defence Force, following advice from a registered valuer. Given the compulsion on New Zealand Defence Force personnel to accept a posting anywhere in New Zealand, the New Zealand Defence Force has historically considered it appropriate to take a national approach to considering market rental value of New Zealand Defence Force accommodation. The deployment of personnel is concentrated around the central North Island, and therefore national benchmark properties have previously been assessed by reference to accommodation in the area of Linton Camp. Linton also offers a representative range of NZDF housing stock, reasonable access to amenities and a stable basis for rental comparison purposes. 16 PAYMENTS TO COVER EMPLOYEE MEALS (Clause 22) Summary of proposed amendment The full amount of meal payments linked to work-related travel will be tax-exempt, subject to a three-month upper time limit at a particular work location. The full amount of meal payments and light refreshments outside of work-related travel, such as at conferences, will be tax-exempt without a time limit. Such payments include reimbursement payments and allowances. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features Proposed section CW 17 CB will introduce two specific exemptions:  An exemption of up to three months for meal payments if the employee is required to work away from their normal work location because of travelling on business. This may be for a specific short-term, work-related journey or for a longer period such as a secondment to a distant work location.  Payments to cover working meals and light refreshments when working off the employer’s premises will be exempt without any upper time limit. In both circumstances, when the exemption applies, the full amount of any meal payment will be exempt. These proposed rules will not affect the existing exemptions in section CW 17C that apply to overtime meal payments and sustenance allowances. Likewise it is not intended that meals provided directly by the employer should be subject to these rules. Such meals may, however, be subject to the fringe benefit tax rules. Background Employers typically meet an employee’s meal costs when linked to work-related duties. This recognises that these meal costs may be more expensive than normal meal costs at home for the employee. When an employer reimburses the cost of a work-related meal, the amount saved by the employee (in other words their normal expenditure on the meal) is arguably taxable. However, it would not be practical to carry out an apportionment each time a meal payment is made. A more practical approach that better matches business practice is needed, given that these meal payments are generally not provided as a substitute for taxable salary. 17 Detailed analysis Calculating the three-month time limit The three-month time limit will run from the date the employee starts working at the workplace and extend for as long as the employee works continuously at that location. Example Vernon normally works in Christchurch but is sent by his employer to work in the employer’s Nelson office for a period of six months. Vernon’s employer pays him a meal allowance for the duration of the secondment. The meal allowance is exempt for the first three months and taxable for the remainder of the secondment. If the employee does not have a fixed work base, but instead works at a variety of locations and works out of an accommodation base, the time limit will apply from the date at which they arrive at the accommodation base. Example An employee is working on an infrastructure project that requires him to work in a variety of locations. Rather than moving to each location, the employee rents a house to use as a base from which he can travel to those locations each day as required. The three-month time limit will apply from the date the employee moves to the rented accommodation. In determining whether the employee is working continuously at a particular location, periods when away from the location for personal reasons such as leave, weekend breaks and short breaks that are required for work purposes will be disregarded. The payment will not be exempt when it is paid by way of a salary trade-off. Working meals and light refreshments at or near the employee’s normal work location Payments to cover meal expenses for a working meal near the employee’s work location will be exempt. For example, this will include lunches at conferences or training courses near the employee’s normal work location. The expense will only be exempt if the employee attends the meal because of the nature of the duties of the job. The meal expense will not be exempt if it is provided as a salary trade-off. The amendments will also introduce an exemption for payments for light refreshments (in the form of tea, coffee, water or similar), when the following criteria are met:  the employee normally works at least seven hours a day;  the nature of the employee’s employment duties mean he or she has to be away from the employer’s premises for most of the day;  the employer would normally provide the refreshments to the employee on the day; and  it is not practicable for the employer to provide the refreshments on the day. 18 DISTINCTIVE CLOTHING (Clause 23) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments propose exemptions for:  payments provided to cover the costs of purchasing and maintaining distinctive work clothing, such as uniforms, that are clearly related to the employee’s job; and  payments to meet the costs of a plain clothes allowance paid to members of a uniformed service who are required to wear ordinary clothing instead of their uniform. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 July 2013. Key features The amendment to exempt payments provided to cover the costs of purchasing and maintaining distinctive work clothing, such as uniforms, will ensure that the rules covering employee expenditure payments are better aligned with the equivalent fringe benefit rule. Background Under the current general rules used to determine whether a payment or allowance is taxable, expenditure incurred on the purchase and maintenance of clothing is normally a private expense. Case law has confirmed that there is an exception to this general approach when the particular clothing is “necessary and peculiar” to the employee’s occupation. This has been taken to include a uniform, or specialist clothing that is not reasonably suitable for private use. Examples include uniforms worn by nursing staff, members of the armed forces and police officers. However, ordinary clothing of a particular style or colour which could reasonably be worn outside the job would not be treated as a uniform. Specialist clothing might include overalls and protective clothing worn for health and safety reasons. When an employer directly provides or maintains work-related clothing instead of paying an allowance, the fringe benefit tax rules apply. Rather than relying on case law, the Income Tax Act specifically includes a distinctive work clothing exemption (section CX 30). Applying this same approach to clothing allowances would provide consistency in this area. 19 Detailed analysis The proposed changes in section CW 17CC will make it clearer that an allowance to cover the cost of buying and maintaining distinctive work clothing will not be taxable income. “Distinctive work clothing” is defined drawing on the fringe benefit tax definition in section CX 30(2) to mean a single item of clothing, that:  is worn by an employee as, or as part of, a uniform that can be identified with the employer: – through the permanent and prominent display of a name, logo, or other identification that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their activity or undertaking; or – because of the colour scheme, pattern or style is readily associated with the employer; and  is worn in the course of, or as an incident of, employment; and  is not clothing that employees would normally wear for private purposes. Payments in relation to the purchase and maintenance of other clothing will continue to be subject to the general rules for determining when a payment that does not have its own exemption rules is tax-exempt. The proposed distinctive clothing exemption will also cover partly taxable plain clothes allowances that were in place as at 1 July 2013 and paid to uniformed personnel who are required to wear plain clothes in order to carry out their duties. This is in line with a long- standing expectation that a portion of the plain clothes allowance paid to police officers is non-taxable, based on the specific circumstances involved. The formal exemption of the non-taxable portion will apply only when:  the employer provides a uniform to all or almost all of its employees to wear when performing the duties of their employment; and  despite the fact that the employee has been provided with a uniform, it is a requirement of their current job with the same employer that they do not wear that uniform and, therefore, need to wear plain clothes; and  the plain clothes allowance was in place at 1 July 2013; and  part of that allowance was treated as taxable. 20 GENERAL RULE FOR DETERMINING TAXABLE PORTION OF OTHER EXPENDITURE PAYMENTS (Clauses 21 and 134) Summary of proposed amendment Various legislative changes, including a Commissioner determination-making power, are proposed in relation to the general rule that determines what portion of other payments made to employees are exempt income. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features The amendments add several criteria to the general rule in section CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for determining the tax treatment of amounts paid to or for the benefit of employees for expenditure in connection with their employment or service. These criteria are intended to clarify when an expense would be an allowable deduction in relation to earning employment income and, therefore, would be non-taxable. The amendments will also provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to issue determinations on what proportion of a particular type of payment provided to a wide group of employees would be exempt income. Background For the most part, beyond the specific payments discussed earlier in relation to accommodation, meals and distinctive clothing, the general rule for establishing the taxable part of an employee expenditure payment works satisfactorily. However, some further clarity about what the rule involves is merited. Furthermore, there is still the possibility that at some time in the future the general rule may not provide an appropriate outcome for another particular type of payment. There are advantages in having a mechanism to handle this other than through specific legislative amendment. Detailed analysis Nexus test – clarifying the approach Under the current approach, expenditure being paid to or on behalf of the employee is exempt income of the employee provided it is incurred in connection with the employee’s employment or service, and the employee would be allowed a deduction of that amount if the limitation on employees claiming deductions (the employment limitation) did not exist. This is often referred to as the “nexus test”. It effectively means that a payment is exempt provided it is not of a private, domestic or capital nature. Given that these rules generally deal satisfactorily with the vast majority of expenses that do not have their own rule, the proposed changes are simply aimed at providing greater clarity about what the nexus test involves. 21 Section CW 17 clarifies that to qualify as expenditure that is incurred in connection with an employee’s employment or service, it must be because the employee is performing an obligation required by their employment or service, and the employee earns income through the performance of the obligation, and the expenditure is necessary in the performance of the obligation. Commissioner determination-making power The amendments introduce a power to enable the Commissioner to issue a determination (under section 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994) in relation to a payment made to a wide group or class of employees. The Commissioner may determine the extent to which on average the amount is exempt income, by setting a percentage that represents the extent to which the payment for the particular type of expense, based on a reasonable estimate, is taxable. This determination-making power would be discretionary and the Commissioner would need to be satisfied that the payment not only affects a large group or class of employees but also that the average private or capital benefit likely to be received is hard to measure, and that the payment is not paid as a substitute for salary or wages. Any determination issued will be binding on the Commissioner but not the taxpayer, which means that it will act as a safe harbour. If the employer or employee has evidence to demonstrate that in their particular circumstance some other apportionment is appropriate under the section CW 17 general rule, the taxpayer will still be able to apply that apportionment. 22 EXPENDITURE ON ACCOUNT OF AN EMPLOYEE (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendment A minor technical change to the exclusions from the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” is proposed. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features The amendment changes the general “expenditure on account of an employee” definition to make a clearer distinction between the exclusion in section CE 5(3)(c) and the exclusion in section CE 5(3)(a), and removes any overlap. Background When an employer reimburses or otherwise meets a specific employee expense, this is an employee expenditure payment known as “expenditure on account of an employee”. The statutory definition is very widely drawn, so there is a comprehensive list of exclusions from the definition, including two general exclusions that cover employee expenditure payments in general. The first of these excludes payments to third parties or to employees for expenditure incurred by those employees in deriving their employment income. The second excludes payments made by employers to employees for expenses that an employee had incurred and paid for on their employer’s behalf, when the expenses were the employer’s liability. An example would be when the employee buys a box of photocopying paper on the employer’s behalf on the basis that the employer will reimburse them. There have been significant changes to the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” since it was first introduced in 1985. As a result, the general exclusions have been amended and expanded and it is no longer clear how the two exclusions should apply in relation to each other. Arguably, there is now some overlap, which the proposed amendment is designed to remove. 23 Detailed analysis The amendment changes the general exclusion in section CE 5(3)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that it applies subject to:  the particular payment not falling within section CE 5(3)(a), which should take priority;  the expense covered by the payment being incurred by or on behalf of the employee’s employer; and  the expense having been paid for by the employee on their employer’s behalf. Provided these criteria are satisfied, the payment will be excluded from being expenditure on account of an employee under section CE 5(3)(c). 24 MINOR TECHNICAL MATTERS (Clauses 11, 13, 21, 31 and 32) Summary of proposed amendment Several technical amendments are proposed to support the wider changes to the rules governing the tax treatment of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments and other allowances and payments by employers to cover employee expenditure. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features The amendments cover changes to definitions, headings and cross-references that are being made to ensure compatibility with the proposed rules. 25 Thin capitalisation rules 26 27 OVERVIEW The thin capitalisation rules form part of New Zealand’s international tax rules and are designed to protect our tax base. The rules place limits on how much debt a non-resident can put into their New Zealand investments. This is important as the use of debt is one method that non-residents can use to move profits out of New Zealand to significantly lower the amount of New Zealand tax they would otherwise pay. The thin capitalisation rules have generally been operating effectively. However, Inland Revenue’s investigators, through their normal audit work, have come across some situations where strengthening the rules would be beneficial. There are two key concerns with the existing rules. They currently only apply when a single non-resident controls a New Zealand investment. However, investors can often act together in a way that mimics control by a single investor. The rules can also be ineffective when the debt of a worldwide group of companies comes from shareholders rather than third parties. To respond to these issues, the bill proposes expanding the thin capitalisation rules so they apply when a group of non-residents appear to be acting as a group and own 50 percent or more of a New Zealand investment. The bill also proposes ignoring shareholder debt when taxpayers are calculating their allowable level of New Zealand debt under the rules. Amendments to three other aspects of the rules are intended to address other areas where the rules appear to be deficient. These changes were signalled in an issues paper, Review of the thin capitalisation rules. The original proposals have been modified, based on feedback received. For example, the definition of shareholders “acting together” in the bill is more certain than that originally proposed, and there is now a limited extension to what is known as the “on-lending concession” for trusts. The proposed changes will apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year. 28 PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE THIN CAPITALISATION RULES (Clauses 87 to 98, 123(30) and 123(32)) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes changes to five aspects of the thin capitalisation rules. The most significant change of these extends the rules so they will apply when non-residents who appear to be acting together own 50 percent or more of a company. Non-residents will be treated as acting together if they hold debt in a company in proportion to their equity, have entered into an arrangement setting out how to fund the company, or act on the instructions of another person (such as a private equity manager). The bill will also extend the rules so they apply to all trusts that have been majority settled by non-residents, as well as all companies controlled by the trustees of such trusts. The bill will change what is known as the “110 percent worldwide debt test”. This test, in essence, compares the amount of debt in a company’s worldwide operations to the debt in the company’s New Zealand operations. The proposed change will mean debt that originates from shareholders will be excluded when calculating the debt level of a company’s worldwide operations. Increases in asset values following internal company reorganisations will be ignored, unless the increase in asset value would be allowed under generally accepted accounting principles in the absence of the reorganisation, or if the reorganisation is part of the purchase of the company by a third party. The bill will also make a technical change to ensure that, in the outbound thin capitalisation rules, individuals and trustees must generally exclude their indirect interests in offshore companies if the interest is held through a company they are associated with. Key features  Sections FE 2, FE 4, FE 26 and FE 31D extend the inbound thin capitalisation rules to cases in which non-residents act together when investing in New Zealand (they currently apply only when a single non-resident controls the investment).  Section FE 18 excludes, from the worldwide group debt measure used in the inbound rules, debt linked to shareholders of group entities or to persons associated with shareholders.  Sections FE 2, FE 3 and FE 26 extend the inbound rules to apply to all resident trustees if 50 percent or more of settlements made on the trust were made by a non- resident, non-residents acting together or other entities subject to the thin capitalisation rules.  Section FE 13 extends the on-lending concession so that it applies to all financial arrangements held by a trust provided certain criteria are met.  Section FE 16 ignores increases in asset values that are the result of transactions between associated persons, unless the increase would be allowed by accounting standards in the absence of a transaction. 29  Section FE 16, in relation to the outbound thin capitalisation rules, forces consolidation of interests held by individuals or trustees with interests held by companies in which they have a significant interest. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2015–16 income year. Background An officials’ issues paper, Review of the thin capitalisation rules, 1 released in January 2013 proposed six changes to the thin capitalisation rules. The issues paper proposed the following changes:  that the thin capitalisation rules would apply if a group of non-residents who were “acting together” own 50 percent or more of a company;  a change to what is known as the “110% worldwide debt test” to exclude debt that originates from shareholders when calculating the debt level of a company’s worldwide operations;  extending the rules so they apply to all types of trust that have been majority-settled by a non-resident, or a group of non-residents “acting together”;  excluding capitalised interest from a company’s asset base;  requiring individuals and trustees to consolidate a trust’s interests with companies they own when determining their New Zealand group;  ignoring increases in asset values that are the result of an internal sale of assets. Fifteen submissions were received on the issues paper. Most submitters agreed with the need to reform the thin capitalisation rules but raised several technical concerns, such as the proposed method of defining non-residents “acting together”. Officials subsequently released a second paper, Thin capitalisation review: technical issues, 2 to address the technical concerns raised by submitters. Based on feedback in both rounds of consultation, several changes were made to the original proposals. For example, the definition of shareholders “acting together” in the bill is more certain than that originally proposed, and there is now a limited extension to what is known as the “on-lending concession” for trusts. 1 The paper can be found at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2013-ip-thin-capitalisation/overview. 2 The paper can be found at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2013-ip-thin-capitalisation-technical-issues/overview. 30 Detailed analysis Companies controlled by shareholders acting together The thin capitalisation rules are designed to apply to companies controlled by shareholders who have the ability to substitute equity with debt. This is clearly the case when a company is controlled by a single non-resident – the controlling non-resident has little constraint on how it can fund the company, and so is free to invest through debt rather than equity. However, this ability to substitute equity with debt is also available to non-residents who are acting together. They are able to coordinate their activities and act in much the same way as a single non-resident yet the current rules do not apply. The bill proposes to extend the rules so they apply also to companies controlled by a group of shareholders who are acting together. Section FE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended so the thin capitalisation rules apply to a company where a non-resident owning body holds 50 percent or more of a company’s ownership interests, or has control of a company by any other means. Consequentially, section FE 1 will also be amended to reflect the broader application of the rules. Non-resident owning body Proposed amendments to section FE 4 define a non-resident owning body. To be a non-resident owning body, two or more non-residents will have the following characteristics:  have, directly or indirectly, 3 debt in the company in proportion to their equity;  have an agreement that sets out how the company should be funded if the company is not widely held (a term defined in section YA 1);  exercise their rights under their ownership interests in a way recommended by a person or persons (such as a private equity manager), or similarly a person or persons act on the members’ behalf to exercise their rights. Member interests will only need to be approximately in proportion. This rule is intended to prevent taxpayers from structuring investment arrangements to avoid exact proportionality. An agreement that sets out how an entity should be funded in the event of a specified event (such as insolvency) will not constitute an agreement that sets out how the company should be funded. 3 Legally, debt cannot be held indirectly. Accordingly, proposed section FE 4(1)(a)(ii) will provide how to determine if debt is held indirectly in proportion to equity. 31 Example Resident company NZ Co has three non-resident shareholders: Hold Co, Shareholder 2 and Shareholder 3. Shareholder 1 owns 100 percent of the shares in Hold Co, and is therefore an indirect owner of NZ Co. Shareholder 1 and Shareholder 2 have also lent money to NZ Co ($50 and $25, respectively). Shareholder 1 (together with its associate Hold Co) and Shareholder 2 will be members of a non-resident owning body. Shareholder 1 has 40 percent of the shares in NZ Co and has lent it $50 (a ratio of 0.8:1). Shareholder 2 has 20 percent of the shares in NZ Co and has lent it $25 (also a ratio of 0.8:1). The thin capitalisation rules will therefore apply to NZ Co as 60 percent of its shares are held by a non- resident owning body. The ownership interests of a non-resident owning body will be determined as if the members of the body are associates. This means that, as per section FE 41, the ownership interests of the owning body will be calculated by aggregating the ownership interests of the body’s members, except to the extent the aggregation would result in double-counting. Example Resident company A Co has five non-resident shareholders who have an agreement that specifies how company A should be funded: Mr W (married to Mrs W), Mrs W, Mr X, Mr Y and Mr Z. Each holds 20 percent of the issued shares. Mr W’s ownership interest in A is 40 percent (as his interests are aggregated with Mrs W under section FE 41). Mrs W’s ownership interest is similarly 40 percent. The other shareholders (who are not associated with each other or Mr and Mrs W) have an ownership of 20 percent each. The ownership interests are added together, but with 40 percent removed to correct for double-counting of Mr and Mrs W’s interests. The non-resident owning body made up of Mr W, Mrs W, Mr X, Mr Y and Mr Z therefore has 100 percent of the ownership interests in A Co. Shareholder 1 Shareholder 2 Shareholder 3 Hold Co $50 debt NZ Co 100% 40% 20% + $25 debt 40% Offshore New Zealand 32 New Zealand groups Under the proposed new rules, the New Zealand group of a company controlled by a non- resident owning group will be determined much in the same way as companies controlled by a single non-resident. Proposed new section FE 26(2)(bb) will generally provide that a New Zealand company is a New Zealand parent company if a non-resident owning body has direct ownership interests of 50 percent or more in the company. A similar amendment is proposed for section FE 26(3)(d), which will generally define a parent of an excess debt entity as the company where the non-resident owning body directly holds 50 percent or more of its ownership interests. There are two exceptions to these rules. The first is when a non-resident owning body has members that have operations in New Zealand (for example, if some of the members of the group operate through a branch in New Zealand). In this case, the non-resident owning body will be the New Zealand parent as provided by subsection (2)(bc) or (4C), as appropriate. The second exception is if some members of a non-resident owning body invest into New Zealand through holding companies. The grouping rules will not be able to identify a New Zealand parent for the top-level operating company in New Zealand (Z Co in the example below). Accordingly, section FE 26(6) will deem the top-level operating company as the New Zealand parent. A company controlled by the top-level operating company will identify the operating company as its parent under section FE 26(3). Each holding company will also have a New Zealand group that is just the company. Example Non-residents X Co, Y Co and Z Co (who are not associated persons) each own 33 percent of resident company A Co and have proportionate debt and equity. They therefore will form a non-resident owning body. A Co has three resident subsidiaries. The New Zealand parent for A Co can only be determined under section FE 26(2)(bb), under which A Co will be treated as the New Zealand parent (the non-resident owning body has direct interests of 100 percent in A Co). Similarly, A Co’s subsidiaries will only be able to determine their New Zealand parent (A Co) under section FE 26(3)(d)(ii). A Co’s New Zealand group will comprise A Co and its three subsidiaries. As A Co’s group could only be determined under sections FE 26(2)(bb) and (3)(d)(ii), section FE 31D applies to deem the worldwide group of A Co to be its New Zealand group. 33 Example Non-resident Co 1 owns 100 percent of Hold Co 1 and Non-resident Co 2 owns 100 percent of Hold Co 2. Hold Co 1 and Hold Co 2 are therefore subject to the thin capitalisation rules under section FE 2(1)(c). The non-residents meet the criteria for being a non-resident owning body. Z Co is therefore also subject to the thin capitalisation rules under section FE 2(1)(bb). Hold Co 1’s New Zealand group is Hold Co 1 (as Hold Co does not hold 50 percent or more of Z Co’s ownership interests it does not include it in its group under section FE 26). Hold Co 2’s New Zealand group is similarly just Hold Co 2. Z Co’s New Zealand group cannot be determined under section FE 26 other than under subsection (6). Z Co is therefore deemed to be its New Zealand parent. As Z Co has no subsidiaries, its New Zealand group comprises only itself. New grouping rules only apply if existing rules do not These new grouping rules will only apply if the thin capitalisation rules as they currently stand do not apply – that is, to a company not controlled directly or indirectly by a single non-resident. This means the New Zealand parent of a company controlled by a single non- resident will be unaffected by the proposed changes, even if the company is also controlled by a non-resident owning body. Its New Zealand group will, by extension, also be unaffected. NZ Non-resident Co 1 Non-resident Co 2 Offshore 100% 100% 49% Z Co 49% 1% ... Hold Co 1 Hold Co 2 NR owning body 34 Example Non-resident companies Z, X and Y own 50, 25 and 25 percent, respectively, of New Zealand-resident company A Co. Z, X and Y have an agreement that sets out how A Co should be funded. Z, X and Y therefore form a non-resident owning body. A Co has three resident subsidiaries. Z also owns 100% of an Australian company. Under the current thin capitalisation rules, the New Zealand group of A Co comprises A Co and its three New Zealand subsidiaries. The worldwide group is the New Zealand group, Z and the Australian company. There will be no change to the New Zealand or worldwide group of A Co as a single non-resident (Z) owns 50 percent of its shares – even though a non-resident owning body also holds 50 percent or more of A Co’s shares. Worldwide groups Proposed new section FE 31D will provide that the worldwide group of a company controlled by a non-resident owning body is just its New Zealand group, unless a single non-resident also controls the company. Rules to ensure matching New Zealand groups Under the thin capitalisation rules it is important that New Zealand groups of different entities are the same. That is, if Company A includes Company B in its New Zealand group, then Company B should include Company A in its group. It is also important that an entity cannot be included in multiple groups. This is to prevent the double-counting of the entity’s debt and assets. Proposed section FE 3(d) and (f) excludes a company from a group of a trust (or from the group of a controlling body) if the company does not include the trust (or body) in its own group. This rule would apply, for example, when a trust owns a subsidiary company. Without the rule a trust could include a company in its group but the company may not include the trust in its group. A separate rule is proposed in section FE 14(3B) to ensure that an entity cannot include its debt and assets in more than one New Zealand and worldwide group. This might occur, for example, if a member of a controlling group controls some companies in its own right. An ordering rule will apply in some cases when an entity is determining what group it should include its debt and assets in: if the entity is a company that is controlled indirectly or directly by a single non-resident then it must include its debt and assets in the New Zealand group of the single non-resident. If this is not the case then there will be no rule for determining what group the debt and assets should be included in. 35 Worldwide group debt test Whether there is any interest denial under the thin capitalisation rules depends on the result of two tests. One of these tests is known as the “worldwide group debt test” and is designed to ensure the amount of debt in a New Zealand company is proportionate to the amount of genuine external debt of the ultimate non-resident parent of that New Zealand company. In some circumstances, however, the debt of the ultimate parent company may also include debt from the parent’s shareholders or other owners of the group. In such cases the debt level of the worldwide group does not reflect the level of genuine external debt. The worldwide group debt test therefore does not operate as intended. To address this, proposed new section FE 18(3B) will provide that, when an excess debt entity (other than an outbound excess debt entity 4 ) is calculating its worldwide group debt percentage, it must exclude debt that is linked to an owner of the worldwide group. An “owner” will be a person who has an ownership interest in a member of the group or is a settlor of a trust that is a member of the group. A financial arrangement will be treated as linked to an owner of the group if the owner, or an associate of the owner (excluding associates who are members of the group):  is a party to the financial arrangement (for example, by a loan directly from the owner);  has guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the financial agreement (for example, where an owner has used some of its assets as security for the loan);  has provided funds or will provide funds, directly or indirectly, to another person who is providing funds under the financial arrangement (such as a back-to-back loan). Carve-out for minor shareholders’ debt Proposed new section FE 18(3B) will also include a carve-out to the above rule for minor shareholders. An owner’s financial arrangement will not be excluded from the worldwide group debt test if:  the owner has a 10 percent or less ownership interest in the group; and  the financial arrangements held by the owner are traded on a public exchange. 4 This change applies to the “inbound” thin capitalisation rules, which apply to non-resident investments in New Zealand. The “outbound” thin capitalisation rules, which apply to New Zealand investment abroad, are not affected. 36 Example Three shareholders collectively own New Zealand company NZ Co. As NZ Co is controlled by a non- resident owning body, its worldwide group is the same as its New Zealand group. The three non-resident shareholders will be treated as “owners” of NZ Co as they each have an ownership interest in NZ Co and are outside of its worldwide group. Any debt they extend to NZ Co will not be treated as debt in NZ Co’s worldwide group debt test. Bank, however, will not be treated as an “owner” of NZ Co as it has no ownership interest in NZ Co and is not associated with any of the shareholders. A loan from Bank will therefore be included as debt in NZ Co’s worldwide group debt test. Effect of shareholders lending to NZ Co The three shareholders decide to lend a total of $500,000 to NZ Co. NZ Co has $800,000 of assets. The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co’s New Zealand group is = 62.5 percent. The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co’s worldwide group is = 0 percent (as the debt from the owners is excluded). The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co’s New Zealand group exceeds both the 60 percent safe harbour and worldwide group debt test. NZ Co will therefore have income under section CH 9 to cancel out some of its interest deductions. Effect of Bank lending to NZ Co Instead of borrowing from its shareholders, NZ Co borrows the $500,000 from Bank. Again, NZ Co has $800,000 of assets. The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co’s New Zealand group is = 62.5 percent. The debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co’s worldwide group is = 62.5 percent. While the debt-to-asset ratio of NZ Co’s New Zealand group exceeds the 60 percent safe harbour, it does not exceed the worldwide group debt test. NZ Co will not have any income under section CH 9. Shareholder 1 Shareholder 2 Shareholder 3 NZ Co NZ & worldwide groups NZ Offshore Non-resident owning body Bank Debt 37 Extending the thin capitalisation rules to more trusts Proposed amendments to section FE 2(1)(d) will extend the thin capitalisation rules to all types of trusts for tax purposes (complying trusts, non-complying trusts and foreign trusts). The proposed new rules will mean a trust is subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the majority of settlements on it come from non-residents, or from persons who are subject to the thin capitalisation rules. A trust will be subject to the rules if 50 percent or more of the settlements are made by:  a non-resident or an associated person; 5  an entity subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules (that is, an entity to which section FE 2(a) to (cc) and (db) applies); or  a group of non-residents or entities subject to the thin capitalisation rules that act together as a group. As with companies, the thin capitalisation rules will apply to trusts settled by entities acting together as a group (a controlling group). This concept of “acting together as a group” will be left undefined. This is because the proposed rules for determining when a group of shareholders are acting as a group (thereby forming a non-resident owning body) cannot be used for trusts. For example, it is not sensible to refer to settlements made in proportion to debt extended to a trust because rights to income from a trust generally do not depend on the amount a person has settled on it. As with companies, the ownership interests of a controlling group will also be aggregated as if the members were associates. Proposed new section FE 2(1)(db) will also provide that a trust is subject to the thin capitalisation rules if a person subject to the thin capitalisation rules has the power to appoint or remove a trustee. This is designed as an anti-circumvention measure. It will mean trusts are subject to the rules if they have been settled by a New Zealand resident and then effective control of the trust is transferred to a non-resident by giving the non-resident power to appoint or remove the trustee. There will be a carve-out from this rule if a person has the power to add or remove a trustee for the purpose of protecting a security interest. This type of security interest is commonly held by banks that have lent to a trust. Proposed sections FE 2(1)(d) and (db) provide that settlements made by the trustee and powers of removal or appointment of the trustee must be ignored when applying the sections. This is to prevent circularity if two trusts make settlements on each other or each have the ability to appoint the other’s trustee. 5 Here, an associate will not include a relative that has not made any settlements on the trust. This is to prevent the rules from applying to a trust settled by a New Zealand resident merely because the resident has a non-resident relation. 38 To illustrate, say settlements on Trust A are made by a non-resident and Trust B. Settlements made on Trust B are made by Trust A. It is only possible to determine whether Trust B is subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the settlement it has made on Trust A is ignored. Ignoring the settlement means the sole settlor of Trust A is a non-resident; Trust B is therefore subject to the thin capitalisation rules as it has been settled by a trust that is itself subject to the rules. Once Trust B’s status is determined, it is then possible to determine that Trust A should also be subject to the rules as it has also been settled by entities that are subject to the rules (a non-resident and Trust B). Companies controlled by trusts Proposed new section FE 2(1)(cc) ensures the thin capitalisation rules apply to any resident company that is controlled by a trust that is already subject to the thin capitalisation rules (to which the amended section FE 2(1)(d) or (db) will apply), or controlled by such trusts and other persons acting together as a group. This proposed amendment is a consequence of extending the thin capitalisation rules to more trusts. If a trust will be subject to the thin capitalisation rules, companies controlled by that trust should also be subject to the rules. Grouping rules for trusts and companies controlled by trusts Proposed amendments to section FE 3 will define the New Zealand group of a trust as the trust and all companies controlled by the trust. Whether a trust controls a company will be determined under section FE 27, based on its choice of control threshold under that section. Similarly, the New Zealand group of a company that is controlled by a trust will be the trust and all other companies controlled by the trust. This will be provided by proposed new section FE 26(4C), which will define the New Zealand parent of a company controlled by a trust (or controlling group) to be the trust (or the group). The other members of the New Zealand group will then be determined under section FE 28. As with companies controlled by non-resident owning bodies, the worldwide group of a trust, a controlling group and a company controlled by a trust (or controlling group) is the same as its New Zealand group. Extension of on-lending concession for trusts Currently, section FE 13 provides what is commonly referred to as the “on-lending concession”. It removes financial arrangements that provide funds to a person from the ambit of the thin capitalisation rules. Proposed amendments to section FE 13 will mean that, for a trust that holds only financial arrangements and does not control any companies, the on-lending concession will apply regardless of whether the arrangement provides funds. This amendment is designed for securitisation vehicles that hold only financial arrangements, which will become subject to the rules because of the changes relating to trusts described above. This carve-out is proposed on the basis that the on-lending concession would apply to most of the trust’s debt in any event. 39 Exclusion of asset uplift Proposed new sections FE 16(1D) and (1E) will provide that increases in a company’s New Zealand group assets that arise from sale or other transfer of assets between a member of the group and a person associated with the group must be ignored. This may or may not be another member of the group. However, the increase in value will be allowed if:  generally accepted accounting practice would allow the increase in asset values in the absence of the transfer; or  the transfer is part of a restructure following the purchase of the group by a person not associated with the group. This is to ensure that increases in asset values that are not recognised under generally accepted accounting practice in the consolidated worldwide accounts of a company cannot nevertheless be recognised in the asset values of the company’s New Zealand group. Example Parent Co owns two New Zealand subsidiaries, NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2. NZ Co 1 purchases the shares in NZ Co 2 from Parent Co. NZ Co 1 will not be able to include any increase in asset values resulting from this purchase for thin capitalisation purposes unless that increase would have been allowed under generally accepted accounting practice in the absence of the purchase. Excluding individuals’ and trustees’ interest in a CFC Proposed new section FE 16(1BA) largely rewrites existing section FE 16(1B) but with a new provision. Individuals or trustees will be required to exclude certain interests in a CFC or FIF they hold indirectly through an associate that is outside of their New Zealand group if the associate is outside of their group by virtue of being an excess debt outbound company or included in the group of such a company. This provision is necessary as section FE 3(2)(a) excludes from the New Zealand group of an individual or trustee who is an outbound investor, all companies that are excess debt outbound companies or included in the group of such a company. Despite this provision, the person or trustee’s indirect interests in the CFC or FIF should be still be excluded from their group assets. Parent Co NZ Offshore NZ Co 1 NZ Co 2 Purchase Consideration 40 41 Black hole expenditure 42 43 OVERVIEW This group of amendments deals with the tax treatment of certain items of “black hole” expenditure that were announced as part of the Budget 2013 revenue package. Black hole expenditure is business expenditure of a capital nature that is not immediately deductible for tax purposes and does not give rise to a depreciable asset, so cannot be deducted as tax depreciation over time. These amendments will remove certain distortions against investment arising from current tax settings, while reducing compliance costs and providing greater certainty for taxpayers. 44 APPLICATIONS FOR RESOURCE CONSENTS, PATENTS AND PLANT VARIETY RIGHTS (Clauses 39, 41 and 42) Summary of proposed amendments Proposed amendments to sections DB 19 and DB 37 and proposed new section DB 40BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 will allow taxpayers an immediate tax deduction for capital expenditure incurred for the purpose of applying for the grant of a resource consent, patent or plant variety rights, when the application is not lodged or is withdrawn, or the grant is refused. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. Key features The proposed amendment to section DB 19 removes the requirement for a taxpayer to have lodged an application for the grant of a resource consent before capital expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful resource consent application can be deducted. The proposed amendment to section DB 37 removes the requirement for a taxpayer to have lodged an application for the grant of a patent before capital expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful patent application can be deducted. Proposed new section DB 40BA allows a taxpayer a deduction for capital expenditure they have incurred for the purpose of applying for the grant of plant variety rights, but they do not obtain the plant variety rights because the application is not lodged or is withdrawn, or because the grant is refused. A deduction under the proposed new section will be allocated to the income year in which the taxpayer decides not to lodge the application, withdraws the application or is refused the grant of plant variety rights. Background Sections DB 19 and DB 37 currently require a taxpayer to have lodged an application for the grant of a resource consent or a patent in order to obtain a deduction for capital expenditure that has failed to give rise to a depreciable asset. A taxpayer who has incurred capital expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of a resource consent or a patent but does not lodge the application is currently unable to receive a deduction for that expenditure. 45 The proposed amendments to sections DB 19 and DB 37 expand the scope of eligibility for a deduction under these sections to instances when expenditure has been incurred by a taxpayer on an intended application which they decide not to lodge. This removes the need for taxpayers to incur further expenditure in making an application for a grant that is no longer sought in order to access a deduction. Currently, a taxpayer who incurs capital expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of plant variety rights is unable to deduct that expenditure when the plant variety rights are not granted, as there is no equivalent provision to sections DB 19 or DB 37 for plant variety rights. As this expenditure would have been depreciable if the plant variety rights had been obtained, making this expenditure deductible when it fails to give rise to a depreciable asset will improve the symmetry between the tax treatment of successful and unsuccessful expenditure. 46 CLAW-BACK FOR SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS OR DISPOSALS (Clauses 16, 54 and 55) Summary of proposed amendments Under the proposed new rules, deductions that have been taken for an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of a resource consent, a patent or plant variety rights, will be clawed back as income if the taxpayer subsequently sells or uses the abandoned application property. In the latter case, the clawed back amount will be included in the cost of the intangible property to be depreciated over the life of the depreciable asset. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. Key features Proposed new section CG 7B of the Income Tax Act 2007 is a claw-back provision which will apply when a taxpayer:  has taken a deduction under section DB 19 or DB 37 or proposed new section DB 40BA (for an aborted or unsuccessful resource consent, patent or plant variety rights application), and subsequently derives consideration for the disposal of application property acquired as a result of expenditure on the intended, withdrawn or unsuccessful application; or  lodges a patent application after having previously taken a deduction under section DB 37 for expenditure on an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of a patent, to the extent that this expenditure also relates to the patent application lodged; or  is granted a resource consent after having previously taken a deduction under section DB 19 for expenditure on an aborted or unsuccessful application, to the extent that this expenditure also relates to the resource consent granted; or  is granted plant variety rights after having previously taken a deduction under proposed new section DB 40BA for expenditure on an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of plant variety rights, to the extent that this expenditure also relates to the plant variety rights granted. When the taxpayer derives consideration for the disposal, the amount that will be clawed back as income will generally be the lesser of the consideration derived for the disposal and the amount of the deduction that has previously been taken. The exception to this will be when the disposal of the property otherwise gives rise to income under the Income Tax Act 2007, in which case the entire amount of the consideration derived from the disposal will continue to be income. 47 When the taxpayer subsequently lodges a patent application or is subsequently granted a resource consent or plant variety rights, the amount that will be clawed back as income will be the total amount of deductions taken for the expenditure under sections DB 19 or DB 37, or proposed new section DB 40BA (whichever applies). The clawed-back amount will then be included in the cost base of the resource consent, the patent application (and subsequently the patent if it is granted) or the plant variety rights and can be depreciated over the legal life of the depreciable asset in the usual way. Proposed amendment to section EE 25 will ensure that any expenditure clawed back as income under proposed new section CG 7B is included in the cost of a subsequent plant variety rights application for the purpose of calculating the pro-rated deduction for the cost of a plant variety rights application that a taxpayer is allowed when they are granted plant variety rights. The proposed amendment to section EE 57 will ensure that the “base value” used for the purpose of calculating a depreciable asset’s “adjusted tax value” includes any expenditure clawed back as income under proposed new section CG 7B. Background It is possible that after taking a deduction for expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of a resource consent, a patent or plant variety rights, that a taxpayer may use or sell that application property at a later date. In the case of selling application property, the taxpayer has conceptually derived income. A claw-back provision is necessary to preserve a neutral tax treatment because otherwise taxpayers could receive a deduction that is larger than the loss they have suffered. The tax treatment of expenditure on application property from an aborted or unsuccessful application that is later used in a successful application and expenditure on a first-time successful application should be neutral. In other words, expenditure on a depreciable intangible asset should be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. That certain expenditure did not create a depreciable asset in the first instance does not change the fact that the expenditure has ultimately created depreciable intangible property. Continuing to allow an immediate deduction for such expenditure is not a neutral tax treatment. A claw-back provision will ensure that taxpayers do not receive a timing advantage from immediately deducting expenditure on the initially unsuccessful, but ultimately successful, application property instead of spreading depreciation deductions over the estimated useful life of the depreciable asset created. 48 COMPANY ADMINISTRATION COSTS (Clause 44) Summary of proposed amendments Proposed new section DB 63 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows companies a deduction for all direct costs associated with the payment of a dividend. This does not include the amount of the dividend itself. Proposed new section DB 63B allows listed companies a deduction for expenditure incurred on an annual listing fee to maintain registration on a recognised stock exchange. Proposed new section DB 63C allows companies a deduction for expenditure incurred to hold an annual general meeting (AGM) of the shareholders of the company, but denies a deduction for expenditure incurred to hold a special or extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the company. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. Background The dividend payment process involves authorising, allocating and paying the dividend, as well as addressing any disputes arising over its allocation. Expenditure incurred during this process is a mixture of capital and revenue. However, requiring taxpayers to separately track or apportion this expenditure into its deductible and non-deductible constituent parts could result in disproportionate compliance costs and uncertainty for taxpayers. Listed companies incur expenditure on an annual listing fee to maintain registration on a recognised stock exchange. Allowing this expenditure to be deductible recognises that its benefit persists for one year only, and is a necessary expense for a listed company. AGMs are an annual, recurring cost of doing business as a company, while special shareholder meetings are often held to consider a material change in the business of the company. Allowing a deduction for AGM costs while denying a deduction for special shareholder meeting costs ensures that taxpayers are not subject to disproportionate compliance costs or uncertainty over the tax treatment of shareholder meeting costs, and approximates the capital-revenue criteria. 49 FIXED-LIFE RESOURCE CONSENTS (Clause 124) Summary of proposed amendment This proposed amendment to item 10 in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will ensure that expenditure incurred on resource consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) to do something that would otherwise contravene sections 15A (Restrictions on dumping and incineration of waste or other matter in coastal marine area) or 15B (Discharge of harmful substances from ships or offshore installations) of the RMA can be depreciated over the life of the resource consent. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. Background Depreciation is appropriate for resource consents if they have a fixed life after which they have no economic value. Resource consents granted under the RMA to do something that would otherwise contravene sections 15A or 15B of that Act have a fixed life of between five and 35 years. Adding these resource consents to schedule 14, which lists items of depreciable intangible property, brings their tax treatment into line with other fixed-life resource consents. 50 51 Foreign account information-sharing agreement 52 53 FOREIGN ACCOUNT INFORMATION-SHARING AGREEMENT (Clauses 2(23), 5, 6, 37, 128(1), (2), (5), 123(15), 129, 150, 151, 152 and 158) Summary of proposed amendments New Zealand has signalled its intentions to negotiate an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) with the United States to clarify the reporting obligations of New Zealand financial institutions under the United States law commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Under the terms of this IGA, New Zealand financial institutions would be required to collect information on their customers that are, or are likely to be United States taxpayers. This information must be sent to Inland Revenue, who in turn would transmit it to United States tax authorities under the existing exchange of information mechanism in the double tax agreement between the two countries. The IGA also provides for reciprocal information to be sent from the United States to Inland Revenue. Amendments to New Zealand’s tax legislation are required to bring any agreed IGA into domestic law and allow New Zealand financial institutions to comply with its terms. In particular, there are concerns that, in the absence of any specific change, financial institutions may be unable to provide the relevant information to Inland Revenue without breaching the Privacy Act 1993. The amendments proposed in the bill therefore seek to explicitly authorise financial institutions to obtain and provide to Inland Revenue the information that New Zealand is obliged to obtain and exchange under the IGA. The proposed amendments are generally drafted in a broad manner to accommodate the possibility of New Zealand entering into similar agreements with other jurisdictions in the future. FATCA requirements, with or without an IGA are due to take effect from 1 June 2014. Accordingly, this is the effective date for the new provisions. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 June 2014. Key features The first foreign account information-sharing agreement that the Government anticipates entering into is the IGA with the United States. A model IGA (“Reciprocal Model 1A Agreement, Pre-existing TIEA or DTC”) is available on the United States Treasury website: (http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA.aspx) 54 This commentary uses the United States’ Treasury model agreement to illustrate examples. It uses terms like “financial institution”, and other terms defined in that model. In doing so, it is recognised that the relevant provisions and terms may be superseded by the specific terms of any IGA formally agreed between the two countries. Equally, these examples may have limited or no application to other similar agreements that may be entered into in the future. Status of the agreement The IGA, and other similar agreements that New Zealand may enter into in the future, are defined as “foreign account information-sharing agreements”. The bill introduces this concept as a defined term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. At present, this definition only includes the planned IGA, but it is anticipated that future agreements could be accommodated into the proposed set of rules by simply including them in this definition. The proposed amendments to sections BB 3(2) and BH 1(4) are intended to clarify that foreign account information-sharing agreements will be “double tax agreements for the purposes of the Income Tax Act”. This means that the agreements, like other double tax agreements and tax information exchange agreements, generally override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act and the Privacy Act. A new section BH 1(5) states that proposed part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to these agreements. This simply clarifies that Part 11B sets rules for these agreements despite their generally overriding nature. Operative provisions Proposed Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains the operative provisions that will govern how foreign account information-sharing agreements are brought into New Zealand law. Clause 152 contains a consequential amendment that moves the definition of “competent authority” from section 173B to section 3. Part 11B Part 11B contains provisions that implement foreign account information-sharing agreements. These provisions are important because, for the New Zealand Government to comply with its obligations under such an agreement, it is required to obtain and exchange certain information with a foreign government. It is necessary to have rules that require the relevant New Zealand taxpayers to acquire this information and provide it to the New Zealand Government, so this exchange can take place. This Part therefore provides the compulsion for New Zealand taxpayers to obtain this information and pass it on to Inland Revenue. It comprises the following proposed sections: 185E – Purpose This section sets out the purpose of the Part, which is to give effect to and implement foreign account information-sharing agreements. 55 Section 185F – Permitted choices The model IGA contemplates that financial institutions may have choices in the way they comply with the agreement. Equally, the agreement may allow the New Zealand Government to make choices that could have consequences for the affected financial institution. The choices a person makes will determine the way the agreement applies to them. Section 185F is designed to recognise these choices, and then authorises a person to make them and treat such choices as being binding for the purposes of the agreement and the person’s obligations under the agreement. Proposed section 185F(1) deals with such choices. Section 185F(2) explicitly authorises a person to make such a choice and anything necessarily incidental to give effect to that choice. Section 185F(3) clarifies that a person’s obligations are modified to the extent necessary to give effect to that choice. This is important because financial institutions should not be in a position where they are required to comply with all possible scenarios that an agreement contemplates. An institution that makes a choice should be accountable for the consequences of that choice – but not be punished for failing to take the alternative option. Example 1 Annex II of the IGA provides a list of entities and products that are exempt from IGA reporting. However, qualification is not always automatic. For instance, a person may qualify as a “financial institution with a local client base” under paragraph III.A only if it has certain “policies and procedures” designed to detect accounts held by United States persons. Applying these policies and procedures is a choice that the financial institution is entitled to make. However, its choice will have consequences. If it chooses to set up such policies and procedures, it will have the advantage of being non-reporting, but it will need to make sure those policies and procedures continue to meet the requirements set out in the agreement. Equally, if it considers that setting up the policies and procedures represents an unreasonable compliance burden, it can choose not to implement them, but the consequence will be that the exemption will not apply and it must report on relevant accounts in the same way as any other non- exempt institution. The financial institutions should not be in a position where a customer can claim that it could have been exempt and therefore it should have made that choice. The agreement contemplates the existence of this choice, so the proposed legislation attempts to provide the flexibility for financial institutions to make it. Example 2 In the same exemption in Annex II, a financial institution that wishes to take advantage of the exemption has a choice in respect of taking customers that are United States citizens that are not also New Zealand-resident. The financial institution can either report on such financial account or close the account. Again, this a choice contemplated by the agreement. A US person residing offshore should not have an action against a financial institution that closes their account just because the institution had an alternative course of action (in this case, reporting on the account). The legislation explicitly authorises the choice to be made because it is contemplated in the agreement. 56 Under the model IGA, New Zealand has a number of choices it can make at government level. Proposed section 185F caters for these choices and allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish a choice made or revoked in a publication of the Commissioner’s choosing (see subsection (4)). The method of publication is broad to allow for the fact that the Commissioner may wish to publish a number of choices in, for example, a Tax Information Bulletin, at the time an agreement is signed. Proposed section 185F(5) clarifies that choices made by the Government or by an affected person are treated as part of the agreement for all aspects of Part 11B and section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Example Part F of Annex I of the model IGA provides that New Zealand may permit reporting financial institutions to rely on third-party providers to perform due diligence obligations. The “may permit” wording provides New Zealand with a choice about whether it is willing to allow third-party providers. When the Government makes this choice, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will publish it so that financial institutions are aware of what is acceptable. If the Government were to allow third-party providers (and published this choice in an appropriate manner), this would then afford financial institutions with a choice of their own: whether to conduct due diligence themselves or outsource to a third party. Again, either of these actions is explicitly sanctioned because it is a legitimate choice that the IGA contemplates financial institutions would have in these circumstances. There are some choices that the Government may not want people to make. To be as transparent as possible about these choices, the concept of an “excluded choice” is created by proposed section 185F(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A list of excluded choices is contained in section 185F(7). Like the agreements themselves, these choices are defined in accordance with specific agreements so that there is maximum clarity around what the excluded choice is. In the context of the IGA, the Government is of the view that only accounts that are actually required to be reported on should be submitted to Inland Revenue. In this regard, for example, paragraph II.A of Annex 1 of the model IGA contemplates that a person can elect to report on accounts even if they are below the reporting threshold set out in the IGA. This election can only be made when the implementing rules provide for this election. The effect of section 185F(6) and (7) is that the implementing rules will not provide for such an election – this also applies to other similar “low value threshold” elections contained in the model IGA. Therefore making the choice to report on all accounts below the threshold is not a “permitted choice” for the purposes of the proposed legislation. Example A financial institution has nine pre-existing depository accounts held by “US persons” that are individuals. Three of those accounts would be reportable except they have a balance of less than US$50,000, with the others having balances above that threshold. The financial institution does not have the option of reporting on all nine accounts, it must only report on the six that exceed the minimum threshold set out in the model IGA. 57 Section 185G of the Tax Administration Act – Registration The model IGA contemplates that financial institutions that meet certain requirements must register with the United States Internal Revenue Service. Proposed section 185G brings the aspects of this registration requirement relevant to the financial institution into New Zealand law. Section 185H of the Tax Administration Act – Due diligence The model IGA also sets out detailed due diligence obligations for affected financial institutions. Proposed section 185H therefore clarifies that a financial institution is required to apply the relevant procedures. It is worth noting that the relevant procedures may depend on permitted choices that the Government and/or the financial institution will have made. A financial institution is only required to perform the due diligence procedures that flow from permitted choices they have made. Section 185I of the Tax Administration Act – Information for New Zealand competent authority Proposed section 185I is the central provision for ensuring New Zealand’s compliance with foreign account information-sharing agreements. In essence, it says that, if New Zealand is obliged to obtain and exchange information with a foreign competent authority, the person described or contemplated in the agreement as obtaining and providing the information must obtain and provide it to the New Zealand competent authority. All relevant steps in relation to obtaining and proving that information must be done in accordance with the agreement. In the IGA context, this means that any information the New Zealand Government is obliged to exchange with the United States must be obtained by New Zealand financial institutions and provided to Inland Revenue. The section also allows the provision of information if it is not required for exchange purposes, as long as obtaining and providing that information is contemplated in the agreement. As with the other operative provisions, the relevant information may be dependent on choices that the Government and financial institution have made. The section also clarifies that the Government may wish to make regulations in this area to spell out any finer details in a person’s reporting obligations. Example 1 If a financial institution chooses to take advantage of an exemption, this will have a direct bearing on the information that New Zealand is expected to provide in respect of accounts held by that institution. The institution is therefore only required to obtain and provide the information that is consistent with its exempt status. Example 2 Reporting on accounts below certain thresholds is contemplated by the agreement. However, the fact that reporting on these accounts is an “excluded choice” means that they cannot be reported on by a financial institution. 58 Section 185J of the Tax Administration Act – Information for third parties Agreements may contemplate that a financial institution has to provide information to third parties. In the IGA context, these third parties could be foreign competent authorities or other financial institutions. Proposed section 185J authorises obtaining and proving this information, provided it is described or contemplated in the agreement. For foreign competent authorities, the request for information must be valid under the terms of the agreement. Again, a regulatory power is included to allow obligations to be clarified if necessary. Example 1 Article 5.1 of the model IGA contemplates a foreign competent authority making an enquiry directly to a financial institution “... where it has reason to believe that administration errors or other minor errors may have led to incorrect or incomplete information reporting...”. If a foreign competent authority were to make a request within this framework to a New Zealand financial institution, the institution must provide that information. The institution is not authorised to provide the information if the enquiry is of a substantive nature that is above “administration” or “minor” error. Example 2 Article 4.1 of the model IGA provides a description of how a financial institution must behave in order to be treated as compliant. One of the requirements (in paragraph (e)) is that, if the institution makes United States sourced payment to a non-participating financial institution, the financial institution must provide information to the immediate payer of that amount (payment intermediary) the information required for withholding and reporting to occur on that payment. A New Zealand financial institution making such a payment to another financial institution is authorised to provide the necessary information to the payment intermediary. Section 185K of the Tax Administration Act – Prescribed form Proposed section 185K allows the Commissioner to prescribe the form in which information is received. This is particularly important for foreign account information- sharing agreements because it may be that the form of the information is set by either a foreign competent authority or other international organisation. Some flexibility to set these forms is therefore crucial to the smooth administration of these agreements. Section 185L of the Tax Administration Act – Anti-avoidance Proposed section 185L is an anti-avoidance provision that allows an arrangement to be treated as having no effect if the main purpose of entering into the arrangement is to avoid a person’s obligations under Part 11B. This provision is recognition of the fact that some people may not want to report on their customers for commercial/compliance costs reasons. However, in entering into foreign account information-sharing agreements, the Government is agreeing to obtain and provide certain information. The ability to unwind arrangements that avoid reporting is a requirement of the IGA. In any event, it is considered an important tool for the Government to be able to comply with the intended effect of these agreements. 59 Section 185M of the Tax Administration Act – Timeframes Foreign account information-sharing agreements may not set a specific reporting period. They might be happy with any period, provided it is at least annual. In the New Zealand context, most businesses have systems designed to report on a tax-year basis. Proposed section 18M therefore clarifies that:  When an agreement or regulation does not specify, or is discretionary as to, a reporting period, that period will be a tax year, from 1 April to 31 March. The model IGA anticipates this period being legitimate for the purposes of that agreement.  When an agreement or regulation does not specify, or is discretionary about, the time in which a person must provide the information to Inland Revenue, it must be provided within two months of the end of the period. For example, assuming the reporting period ends on 31 March, the information must be provided to Inland Revenue by 31 May of that year. Other matters Tax returns The proposed amendment to the “tax return” definition in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act sets out that information provided in the form set out in section 185K is not a tax return for the purposes of the Act. If the provision of this information was a tax return, various other provisions of the Act, such as the imposition of late filing penalties, would apply. It is not considered necessary to impose late filing penalties because, in many respects, timely filing will be self-policing with inbuilt sanctions for failure. If a person does not file in time, the information may not be exchanged with the foreign competent authority. In an IGA context, this means that a financial institution runs the risk of being treated as non-compliant. Non-compliant status comes with its own sanctions imposed by the United States. The imposition of a domestic fine of up to $500 arguably does not provide any real motivation for financial institutions and has the potential to create disproportionately large administration costs for Inland Revenue. Records The proposed addition of section 22(2)(lb) sets out that a taxpayer must keep sufficient records to allow the Commissioner to readily ascertain the person’s compliance with Part 11B. This makes it a statutory requirement for an affected person to collect and keep the information necessary for compliance with a foreign account information-sharing agreement. It also ensures that the records must be kept for the statutory record-keeping period set out in section 22. Failure to keep documents required by this provision will result in a strict liability offence under section 143 or a knowledge offence under section 143A, as applicable. Penalties Proposed new sections 143(1)(ab) and 143A(1)(ab) introduce a “strict liability” offence and “knowledge” offence related to a person’s failure to register with a foreign competent authority as required by Part 11B. 60 These offences are considered necessary to comply with New Zealand’s obligations under the IGA, and possibly future agreements. New Zealand has an obligation under the IGA to rectify what is known as “significant non-compliance” through its domestic law. It is considered that serious non-compliance will most likely come about in three main ways: 1. A financial institution will fail to register. 2. A financial institution will fail to obtain the required information from its customers. 3. A financial institution will obtain the information but fail to provide it to Inland Revenue. In cases 2 and 3, it is considered that current legislation gives the Commissioner adequate flexibility to deal with non-compliance. As set out above, if a person does not obtain the required information from its customers, it will have failed to keep documents required by a tax law – resulting in offences being committed under section 143 and (potentially) 143A. Similarly, if a person obtains records but fails to provide them to Inland Revenue, the Commissioner will have the ability under section 17 of the Act to require their release. If the person does not comply with the section 17 notice, this refusal will also result in offences being committed under section 143 and (potentially) 143A. However, in case 1, where there has been a failure to register, domestic legislation does not currently have a requirement to register and a sanction for not doing so. As discussed above, proposed section 185G will provide a requirement to register. The proposed changes to sections 143 and 143A will match that requirement with a sanction. By putting this sanction into sections 143 and 143A the changes also mirror the potential outcomes for the other forms of serious non-compliance. However, to recognise the fact that a failure to register may occur for circumstances beyond the control of the person concerned, proposed section 143(2B) provides an exclusion from the absolute liability offence if the relevant failure to register occurred through no fault of the person. Deductions for withholding Under section DB 1 of the Income Tax Act, various types of taxes are disallowed as deductions for income tax purposes. Proposed section DB 1(1)(b) clarifies that any FATCA withholding that a person suffers is similarly not available as a deduction, even if the general permissions for deductions are satisfied. It is Inland Revenue’s preliminary view that FATCA withholding will also not be available as a tax credit under subpart LJ of the Income Tax Act. This is because FATCA withholding is more akin to a penalty than a withholding tax. 61 Deregistration of charities 62 63 OVERVIEW An officials’ issues paper, Clarifying the tax consequences for deregistered charities, was released in July 2013. The paper discussed problems with the current tax treatment of deregistered charities, and suggested a possible solution for clarifying the tax consequences for these entities by prescribing in legislation rules to deal with their new tax-paying status. A “deregistered charity” refers to an entity that has been removed from the Charities Register by the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services (formerly the Charities Commission). In general, an entity must be registered with the Charities Services in order to qualify for the income tax exemption for charities in sections CW 41 and 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Registered charities are also entitled to an exemption from fringe benefit tax, and are treated as “donee organisations”, which means that donors are entitled to some form of tax relief on donations made to these entities. Recent high-profile cases involving deregistered charities, particularly when the entity continues in existence, have shown that these entities can face a range of complex tax consequences that can be retrospective, transitional and prospective in nature. These consequences give rise to questions such as when the entity should start its life as a tax- paying entity; how the entity should treat its depreciable property or financial arrangements when it becomes a tax-paying entity, and what tax provisions should apply to the entity going forward. Currently, the nature and extent of the potential tax consequences ultimately depend on the underlying reason why the entity was deregistered. These consequences may be more onerous (and may involve retrospective tax liabilities) if the deregistered charity is found never to have had a “charitable purpose” or to have ceased being charitable in purpose at some time in the past, compared with the situation when a deregistered charity has simply failed to file the required annual return with Charities Services. Consultation on the officials’ issues paper confirmed that the current tax law as it relates to deregistered charities is neither comprehensive nor robust – that is, it does not adequately deal with the full range of tax consequences involving deregistered charities and, in some cases, does not achieve the desired policy intentions. Two major policy changes arose from consultation which led to the suggested solution in the issues paper being modified.  The first change extinguishes any retrospective tax costs for deregistered charities (and their donors) that have acted in good faith and have been compliant.  The second change imposes an additional tax cost on deregistered charities that have not divested themselves of their assets or income that they had accumulated as a charity, within 12 months of the deregistration date. 64 Key changes The new legislative rules proposed in the bill will:  clarify how the general tax rules (including the income tax, fringe benefit tax and donations tax relief regimes) apply to deregistered charities;  establish the opening values of assets or consideration for any financial arrangements held by a deregistered charity when it becomes a tax-paying entity;  prescribe specific timing rules for the application of the taxing provisions; and  outline new requirements for the treatment of the accumulated assets of deregistered charities. The new rules are aimed at clarifying the tax law so that deregistered charities and their donors have a greater level of certainty as to their tax obligations, and to protect the integrity of the revenue base by ensuring the tax concessions that apply to charities are well-targeted and policy intentions are met. This includes, for example, ensuring that if an entity has claimed tax exemptions as a charity and has accumulated assets and income, these assets and income should always be destined for a charitable purpose. For the majority of deregistered charities that have in good faith tried to meet their registration requirements, the proposed new rules should provide them with greater certainty about their tax obligations after deregistration. On the other hand, the very small minority of deregistered charities that have wilfully refused to meet their registration requirements could still face onerous tax consequences (including retrospective tax liabilities) under the new proposed rules. Application dates The amendments will generally apply from 14 April 2014. There is one exception to this, which relates to the new requirement for accumulated assets of deregistered charities, for which there is a split application date. This rule will apply from:  14 April 2014 for entities which choose to voluntarily deregister; and  1 April 2015 for entities which are deregistered by Charities Services. 65 CLARIFYING HOW THE GENERAL TAX RULES APPLY TO DEREGISTERED CHARITIES (Clauses 104 and 107) Summary of proposed amendments Clause 107 introduces new section HR 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which clarifies how a deregistered charity should establish its initial tax base – such as the opening values of its assets and consideration for its financial arrangements. Clause 104 removes charitable trusts which lose their charitable status from the operation of section HC 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007. All charities which are removed from the Charities Register from 14 April 2014 will have greater certainty about their income tax obligations when they enter the tax system. Key features New section HR 11 sets out how an entity which has ceased to meet the requirements to derive exempt income under sections CW 41 or CW 42 should:  establish the cost base for its property – specifically premises, plant, equipment and trading stock;  establish the consideration for any financial arrangements; and  value prepayments it has made. These tax base calculations are required to be undertaken on and after the date that a deregistered charity ceases to derive exempt income. Section HC 31 has been consequentially amended so that it no longer applies to a charitable trust that has lost its charitable status. Instead, new section HR 11 will set out the initial tax base for all charities which come into the tax base. Background Currently, section HC 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the tax consequences for trusts that enter the tax base, but not corporate entities. Section HC 31 is further limited because it does not cover all assets that may be held by a deregistered charity – for example, prepayments. 66 New section HR 11 applies on and after the day that a deregistered charity ceases to meet the requirements to derive exempt income under section CW 41 or section CW 42. This point in time is referred to as the “date of cessation”. The date of cessation is used to trigger the tax base calculations in the year the entity becomes a tax-paying entity but may also apply for each subsequent income year that the deregistered charity ceases to meet the requirements to derive exempt income under sections CW 41 or CW 42. The following examples illustrate how and when the tax base calculations are to be undertaken. Example: Depreciable property Charity A was registered as a charitable entity in 2008. That same year, Charity A purchased office furniture for $50,000 (GST exclusive) during the first month of the 2008 tax year. In 2013, Charity A was deregistered because it was found by Charities Services to have been non-compliant with its constitution since it was registered. Charity A still owns the office furniture at the date of deregistration. The depreciation rate for office furniture is 19.2%. Charity A must file an income tax return for each year starting from the 2008 year. Under new section HR 11(2) the cost of premises, plant, equipment, and trading stock is the value that would be used at the “date of cessation” under the general tax rules if section CW 41 or section CW 42 never applied. Under the general tax rules, office furniture must be depreciated each year it is used in the business of Charity A. Therefore, the cost of office furniture for each year from 2008 to the present day is as follows: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Opening value ($) 50,000 40,400 32,643 26,376 21,312 17,220 Depreciation ($) 9,600 7,757 6,267 5,064 4,092 3,306 Year-end balance ($) 40,400 32,643 26,376 21,312 17,220 13,914 Charity A will introduce the asset into the tax base at $50,000 and recognise a depreciation charge of $9,600 in its 2008 income tax return. Example: Financial arrangement Assuming the deregistration facts as above, Charity A had loaned $100,000 to person X in 2008. The loan was repayable on demand and interest was 10% per annum compounding. No loan repayments were made. Under new section HR 11(3), Charity A is required to account for this loan under the financial arrangement rules in each of the years that it had ceased to meet the requirements of sections CW 41 or CW 42. It must also calculate an opening value using the formula in new section HR 11(4). The calculations are as follows: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Opening value ($) 100,000 110,000 121,000 133,100 146,410 161,051 Interest ($) 10,000 11,000 12,100 13,310 14,641 16,105 Year-end balance ($) 110,000 121,000 133,100 146,410 161,051 177,156 In 2008 the opening value would be $100,000 and the closing value would be $110,000. Charity A would account for $10,000 accrued interest income in its 2008 income tax return. 67 FROM WHICH POINT WILL A DEREGISTERED CHARITY BE SUBJECT TO TAXING PROVISIONS (Clauses 27 and 123(8)) Summary of proposed amendments Clause 27 amends section CW 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Clause 123(8) inserts a new definition of “final date of decision” in section YA of the Income Tax Act 2007. The amendments to section CW 41 ensure that entities which are removed from the charities register will continue to be tax-exempt until the date of “final decision”, so long as they have acted in accordance with their constitution or other information supplied to the Charities Services, since registration. The amendments should help to ensure that a large majority of deregistered charities do not face retrospective tax consequences. Key features The amendments to section CW 41 provide that:  income derived by a deregistered charity in a specified period is treated as exempt income; and  a deregistered charity is a “tax charity” (as defined in section CW 41 (5)) for the specified period. The specified period in question starts from the date the entity is registered on the charities register, and ends with the earlier of two dates. These dates are:  the day on which the entity fails to act in accordance with its constitution, or other information supplied to Charities Services at the time of applying for charitable status; or  the day of final decision. A new definition of “day of final decision” is included in section YA 1. It is the later of two dates, namely:  the day the entity is removed from the charities register; or  the day on which that entity exhausts all disputes and appeals its charitable status. 68 Background Under current law, tax consequences on deregistration may be quite onerous and may involve retrospective tax liabilities if a deregistered charity is found never to have had a “charitable purpose” or ceased being charitable in purpose at some time in the past. In some cases, however, these entities will have been acting in accordance with their constitutions, but there may simply have been a slight change in jurisprudential interpretation of what is “charitable” and what is not. The amendments to section CW 41 should afford entities a greater level of certainty that, for tax purposes, they should be able to rely on the decision made by Charities Services to recognise that entity as charitable in purpose. This protection, however, only applies when the deregistered charity has acted in accordance with all the information and evidence that Charities Services used to make its registration decision. If an entity has ceased to act in accordance with the evidence or information provided to Charities Services, then that entity should not be able to take advantage of the decision to register it. Therefore, entities that have continued to be compliant with their constitutions and other supporting information provided at the time of registration will not be liable for tax in periods before they were deregistered, and if they dispute their deregistration, not before the date their dispute is finally decided. As under current law, a small number of entities could face a retrospective tax liability when they are deregistered. 69 REQUIREMENTS FOR DEREGISTERED CHARITIES WITH ACCUMULATED ASSETS (Clauses 19 and 108) Summary of proposed amendments Clause 108 inserts new section HR 12, which is intended to encourage deregistered charities to distribute their accumulated assets and income to charitable purposes within 12 months of being deregistered. If the entity chooses to retain the assets and income it has accumulated, it will be required to include the value of its net assets on hand as an amount of income which will be subject to tax. Clause 19 inserts new section CV 17, which sets out that any amount of income arising under new section HR 12 will be considered as income of the entity in the income year after the income year in which the entity is deregistered. Key features New sections CV 17 and HR 12 provide that an entity has an amount of income equal to the greater of zero or the value of its net assets held at the time that is 12 months after the date of deregistration, subject to some adjustments. These adjustments carve out certain assets, which reduce the net assets balance that will be subject to tax. The items carved out are:  any assets distributed to charitable purposes in the 12 months after the entity is deregistered; and  any assets (not including money) gifted or left to the entity while it was deriving exempt income. New section HR 12 has a split application date. It generally applies from 1 April 2015, but applies from 14 April 2014 for charities that choose to voluntarily deregister. Background Current tax law (legislation and case law) supports the ability of charities to accumulate their income for future use, and no symmetry is required between the income tax exemption and the payments towards charitable purposes, either in amount or timing. Although there is a requirement for deregistered charities which cease to operate to distribute their assets and income to charitable purposes, there is no such requirement when deregistered charities continue to operate. 70 The Government believes that the assets and income of a charitable entity with tax-exempt status should always be destined for a charitable destination, irrespective of whether the entity ceases to exist or not. However, if a deregistered charity continues in existence, the Government considers that the value of the deregistered charity’s net assets (assets minus liabilities) should be subject to income tax. The imposition of tax in this instance is consistent with the current policy intentions underlying the charities-related tax concessions. In other words, the tax concessions should only be available to bona fide charities and deregistered charities should be held to account for the assets and income they have built up while they enjoyed the benefit of the tax concessions. For reasons of fairness, however, deregistered charities should be given time to apply any assets or income to charitable purposes before the imposition of any tax, and an adjustment should be permitted for any donated assets as these assets were not funded by non-taxed income or through a tax-preferred source. Example: Taxation of tax-exempt accumulation Charity A’s date of deregistration is 1 June 2013. The balance sheet for Charity A at 1 June 2013 is shown below. Assets Liabilities Cash $50 Loan $200 Inventory $300 Equity Land (donated) $3,000 Shareholders’ equity $3,150 The net asset calculation will be $3,150; less the value of the donated land; less any assets and income distributed for charitable purposes within 12 months of the date of deregistration. The net assets value will be $150 ($3,150 less $3,000). Assume Charity A has a July balance date for tax purposes. Charity A would include $150 as income in its 2014 income tax return. 71 CONSEQUENCES OF DEREGISTRATION ON ELIGIBILITY TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANISATION (Clause 123(6)) Summary of proposed amendments Clause 123(6) amends the definition of “charitable organisation” in section YA 1. It widens the definition of “charitable organisation” to include an entity which has been removed from the charities register, so long as it has acted in accordance with its constitution and other supporting information provided at the time of registration. This amendment clarifies the FBT treatment for deregistered charities and largely mirrors the amendment to section CW 41 in clause 27 discussed earlier. Key features The definition of “charitable organisation” in section YA 1 is being amended to ensure that a deregistered entity can still be a charitable organisation for a specified period. The period in question starts from the date the entity is registered on the charities register, and ends with the earlier of two dates. These dates are:  the last day of the relevant quarter or income year in which the entity fails to act in accordance with its constitution, or other information supplied at the time of registration; or  the last day of the relevant quarter or income year in which the final decision on the entity’s charitable status is made. Background Despite being deregistered, an entity might still qualify to be a “charitable organisation”, if it is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and applies its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand, or is listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. If a deregistered charity is no longer eligible for the FBT exemption, the FBT rules will apply to that entity in the same way as for income tax purposes. This means that deregistered charities that have complied with their constitution will lose their FBT exemption from the date of the final decision about their charitable status, and non- compliant entities from the date of non-compliance. 72 CONSEQUENCES OF DEREGISTRATION ON ELIGIBILITY TO BE A DONEE ORGANISATION (Clause 110) Summary of proposed amendments Clause 110 amends section LD 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to confer donee status on an entity registered on the register of charitable entities under the Charities Act 2005. The amendment would ensure donors have a greater level of certainty that their donations tax relief will not ordinarily be reversed in circumstances when they have made a bona fide monetary gift and the entity they have donated to is later deregistered. Key features New section LD 3(2)(ab) ensures that monetary gifts that meet the requirements of a “charitable or other public benefit gift” in section LD 3(1) made to registered charities can still qualify for donations tax relief even if that entity is later deregistered. Background A deregistered charity may still qualify for donee organisation status if it meets the other donee organisation requirements. 6 If, however, the entity no longer qualifies for donee organisation status, donors will no longer be entitled to tax relief on their donations. Under current law, this will happen at the point at which the entity no longer satisfies any of the requirements to be a donee organisation. This could be in the past, which would give rise to retrospective consequences for donors. Under current law, donors who have made cash donations to an entity after the point at which it no longer qualifies to be a donee organisation are technically not eligible for donations tax relief. In the case of individuals, this relief is in the form of a tax credit; in the case of corporate or Māori authority donors, in the form of a tax deduction. Inland Revenue has the ability to reverse previous tax relief claims that have been claimed incorrectly. The Government accepts that Inland Revenue should be able to reverse tax relief in certain circumstances, but this power should not be used as a matter of course. In particular, this power should only be available in circumstances when a donor had knowledge at the time of claiming the relief that the entity did not satisfy any of the requirements to be a donee organisation, or when the donor was involved in fraud in relation to the donation and the donee organisation, or when the requirements substantiating that a bona fide monetary gift has been made are not met under general law. The amendment should protect donors who have claimed donations tax relief in good faith, assuming that an organisation was a donee organisation. 6 A donee organisation is an organisation that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand. The Income Tax Act 2007 also lists 108 donee organisations whose charitable purposes are largely carried out overseas. 73 Tax status of certain community housing entities 74 75 TAX STATUS OF CERTAIN COMMUNITY HOUSING ENTITIES (Clauses 28, 29, 110, 123(7) and 159) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to confer tax-exempt status and donee organisation status on community housing entities who meet specified criteria. The amendments address current tax uncertainties relating to community housing entities who provide affordable home-ownership products to low-income households. Application date The majority of amendments will apply from 14 April 2014. The specific criterion in the proposed income tax exemption that the entity must be a registered community housing entity under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992 will apply from the date the new Regulatory Authority proposed under the Social Housing (Restructuring and Tenancy Matters) Bill comes into existence. Key features  New section CW 42B of the Income Tax Act 2007 confers an income tax exemption on community housing entities which meet specified criteria, including only supplying housing products or services to specific classes of recipients which are listed in the new section.  The specific classes of recipients listed in new section CW 42B include other tax- exempt community housing entities, and people or classes of people, described in regulations to be set under new section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  New section LD (3)(1)(ab) of the Income Tax Act 2007 confers donee organisation status on community housing entities which meet the requirements in new section CW 42B, which ensures that donors who give monetary gifts of $5 or more to one of these entities qualify for donations tax relief. Background Currently, the tax-exempt status and donee organisation status of community housing entities involved in the provision of affordable home-ownership products aimed at low- income households with alternative housing options is not certain. This is because the charitable status of these entities is uncertain. Charitable entities that are registered with the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services are eligible for the charities-related income tax exemption and donee organisation status. 76 Charities law recognises the relief of poverty as a charitable purpose, however entities that offer affordable home-ownership products tend to fall outside the charities criteria – the ability to purchase a house is an indication a person is not “in poverty”. The Government believes that community housing entities should have a range of options in relation to housing products to offer to recipients – for example, rental and home ownership. If an entity provides affordable home-ownership products aimed at low-income households, but in all other ways would be recognised as charitable in purpose, the Government believes that the provision of a home ownership product alone should not disqualify that entity from being entitled to tax-exempt status or donee organisation status. The proposed amendments are intended to address the current lack of tax certainty, and help to promote home ownership for New Zealanders who would not otherwise be able to afford to buy a house. Detailed analysis Income tax exemption (clauses 28, 29, 123(7) and 158) A community housing entity is eligible for the proposed income tax exemption if it carries on the business of providing housing products or services to the following recipients:  persons, or classes of persons, described in regulations made under new section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and  other community housing entities which are eligible for the proposed income tax exemption. Classes of recipients’ criteria New section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permits the Governor-General to make regulations specifying people, or classes of people who may be recipients of housing products or services offered by community housing entities. The factors which may be used to determine a recipient are:  the person’s geographic location in New Zealand;  the composition of the household a person lives in;  the income of the person or household; and  the person’s assets. These criteria ensure that the proposed exemption is aimed at community housing entities that are involved in the provision of new housing products to people who are on low- incomes and who could not otherwise afford to buy a home without Government assistance. 77 The Minister for Housing and the Minister of Revenue will be responsible for establishing a framework for determining who can be an eligible recipient of housing assistance for the purposes of the proposed exemption. This framework is currently being developed. Furthermore, new section 225D contemplates that the regulations may have retrospective effect and could apply from a date before the bill containing these amendments is enacted. Other exemption criteria The community housing entity must also ensure that:  its business is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual;  all profit of the business is reinvested into the business; and  no person with some control over the business may be able to direct or divert an amount derived by the business for their own benefit or advantage. These criteria are similar to those described in current sections CW 42(5), (6), (7) and (8) of the Income Tax Act 2007. They ensure that only community housing entities that operate under a non-profit model are eligible for the proposed income tax exemption. Donations tax relief for donations to tax-exempt housing entities (clause 110) Under current tax law, donors who make cash donations of $5 or more to donee organisations are entitled to tax relief based on their donation. In the case of individuals this relief is in the form of a tax credit; in the case of corporate or Māori authority donors, in the form of a tax deduction. The proposed amendment to section LD 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 confers donee organisation status on community housing entities. 78 79 The taxation of land-related lease payments 80 81 OVERVIEW Currently, the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the tax treatment of certain land-related lease payments. For example, lease premiums, lease inducement and lease surrender payments are generally taxable and tax deductible under the Act. In absence of specific provisions, the tax treatment of other land-related lease payments is determined under general provisions and principles. 7 Since the Act does not provide comprehensive coverage of all land-related lease payments, similar lease payments can be treated differently for income tax purposes, which can have the effect of distorting business decisions. An officials’ issues paper, The taxation of land-related lease payments, released in April 2013, sought feedback on proposals to introduce a broad reform to achieve a coherent and consistent tax treatment of all land-related lease payments. In particular, the issues paper suggested making commercial land-related lease payments taxable and deductible by introducing a bright-line rule of 50 years for leases and licences of land. Commercial leases or licences of land lasting less than 50 years would therefore have been put on revenue account. Leases and licences of land lasting 50 years or more would have been put on capital account, which would provide a similar tax treatment to most freehold land. Following public consultation, the Government decided to introduce a targeted reform to address specific revenue risks with lease transfer payments (that is, received by an exiting tenant for transferring a lease to an incoming tenant). The bill proposes to tax, from 1 April 2015, certain lease transfer payments, which are substitutable for taxable lease surrender and lease premiums payments. This bill also proposes a number of technical amendments to tax law relating to leases and licences of land to provide consistency and certainty. 7 Generally, payments that are revenue in nature, such as receipts or expenditure derived or incurred in the ordinary course of business, are treated as taxable income and tax deductible expenditure. Generally, payments that are capital in nature are treated as non-taxable income and non-deductible expenditure. 82 LEASE TRANSFER PAYMENTS (Clauses 9 and 123(23)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment taxes certain lease transfer payments that are substitutable for taxable lease surrender payments and lease premiums. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features New section CC 1B extends section CC 1B to include certain lease transfer payments that are substitutable for taxable lease surrender payments in section CC 1C and taxable lease premiums in section CC 1. A lease transfer payment will be taxable in following situations:  The lease transfer payment is sourced directly or indirectly from funds provided by the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted; such a payment is substitutable for a lease surrender payment.  The person purchasing the lease is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted; the lease transfer payment is substitutable for a lease surrender payment.  The vendor of the lease is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted; the lease transfer payment is substitutable for a lease premium. Background Lease transfer payments are generally received by an exiting tenant (assignor) from a new incoming tenant (assignee), for the transfer or assignment of a lease. For income tax purposes, the payment is generally non-taxable to the exiting tenant. The current non-taxable status of lease transfer payments, in tandem with taxable lease surrender payments, 8 can distort commercial decisions when tenants exit a lease. As lease transfer payments are generally not taxable, it would be tax advantageous for a tenant to exit a lease by transferring the lease to a third party for a tax-free lease transfer payment, rather than surrendering it to a landlord for a taxable lease surrender payment. 8 Lease surrender payments are taxable under section CC 1C of the Income Tax Act 2007. 83 From the exiting tenant’s perspective, there is no economic difference between surrendering the lease to the landlord and transferring it to a third party. The effect is the same – the tenant exits the lease and receives consideration for it. Treating similar payments differently for income tax purposes distorts business decisions and results in economic inefficiency and unfairness. Example On 1 April 2015, a landlord and a tenant enter into a 10-year lease. After three years, the landlord expands its business to retail, by setting up a subsidiary company. The landlord wishes the tenant to exit the lease so that the subsidiary company can use the premises to carry on its retail business. If the landlord pays a lease surrender payment to the tenant, the payment is taxable to the tenant and deductible to the landlord. A subsidiary company of the landlord and the tenant enter into an agreement to transfer the lease. The subsidiary company pays the tenant $100,000 for the transfer. Under the current rules, the lease transfer payment of $100,000 is deductible to the subsidiary company over the remaining seven years under the depreciation rules. The lease transfer payment is non-taxable to the exiting tenant. The exiting tenant is $28,000 ($100,000 x 28%) better off than receiving a lease surrender payment from the landlord. The revenue risk increases when the commercial property market tightens – that is, when there is a shortage of business premises in economic upturns. This is because lease transfer payments from new tenants or lease surrender payments from landlords tend to occur more often when leases become valuable in a tight commercial property market. For example, prospective tenants or landlords would be more prepared to pay existing tenants for the transfer or surrender of a lease. Following public consultation, the Government decided to tax certain lease transfer payments as a base-protection measure – that is, to prevent non-taxable lease transfer payments being substitutable for taxable lease surrender payments or lease premiums. Landlord Tenant (assignor) New tenant (subsidiary) Lease transfer Lease Lease surrender payment (taxable) Lease transfer payment (non-taxable) $ $ X 84 Detailed analysis The tax treatment of lease transfer payments The new rules extend section CC 1B to include certain lease transfer payments. This extension is intended to be a targeted base-maintenance measure. If a person (the payee) derives an amount, in relation to a land right, as consideration for the transfer of the land right from the holder of the land right to another person, the amount will be taxable to the payee (new sections CC 1B(1)(b) and (2)). The land right must be a right that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land. The term “leasehold estate” is defined broadly in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. 9 The charging provision, therefore, does not apply to payments for a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land. Despite this broad charging provision for lease transfer payments, most lease transfer payments will not be taxable by satisfying the following conditions listed in new section CC 1B(3):  the payee is the holder of the land right (for example, the exiting tenant);  the amount is consideration for the transfer of the land right to the person paying the amount (for example, the new tenant);  the amount is not sourced directly or indirectly from funds provided by the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and  each of the payee and the person paying the amount is not associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted. Payments derived in situations when these conditions are not satisfied will be taxable to the payee. If a lease is transferred as part of a business transfer, consideration for goodwill attaching to the land will be taxable to the payee; however, consideration for business or personal goodwill will not be subject to the charging provision. Situations involving lease transfer payments that are covered by the proposed section CC 1B are payments that are substitutable for taxable lease surrender payments in section CC 1C and taxable lease premiums in section CC 1. 9 For income tax purposes, an interest in land has the same meaning as an estate in land. 85 There are two situations when lease transfer payments that are substitutable for lease surrender payments will be taxable to the payee. They are:  if the amount is sourced directly or indirectly from funds provided by the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted. 10  if the person paying the amount is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted. An exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises will apply to the two situations described above. The amount is not income if the payee is a natural person (individual) and derives the amount as a tenant or licensee of residential premises whose expenditure on the residential premises does not meet the requirements of the general permission (proposed section CC 1B(4)(a)). This exclusion is intended to provide a consistent tax treatment with that for lease surrender payments in section CC 1C. 10 Note that the payment from the landlord to the new tenant for the lease transfer is deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B and taxable to the new tenant under existing section CC 1B. Landlord Tenant (assignor) New tenant (assignee) Lease transfer Lease Lease transfer payment (taxable) $ $ Landlord Tenant (assignor) New tenant (assignee) Lease transfer Lease Lease transfer payment (taxable) associated $ 86 Another situation when lease transfer payments will be made taxable is payments that are substitutable for lease premium payments. In particular, if the payee is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted, lease transfer payments will be taxable. This would prevent a landlord setting up a lease with a low rent with their associate and, as part of this arrangement, the associated tenant transfers the lease to a non-associated tenant and receives a non-taxable lease transfer payment. Taxing a lease transfer payment in such situation will supplement the existing anti- avoidance provision in section GC 5, which allows the Commissioner to set an adequate level of rent for leases between associates. Lease transfer payments received for residential premises will also be taxable if the payee (the tenant) is associated with the owner of the estate in land from which the land right is granted (proposed section CC 1B(4)). The definition of “land provisions” in section YA 1 will be amended so that the definition of “associated person” applying in new section CC 1B is the one applicable to land provisions. If a person receives a lease transfer payment on behalf of another person, the current nominee rules in section YB 21 apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person. An amount that is subject to the existing capital contribution rules will not be subject to the charging provision (proposed section CC 1B(5)). A capital contribution will continue to be income under section CG 8 and spread evenly over 10 years unless the payee chooses to reduce the cost base of the depreciable property under section DB 64. Timing of income The timing provision in section EI 4B applies to the amount of income under section CC 1B. Under that provision, the allocation of income is affected by when the income is derived in relation to the spreading period. The exiting tenant (assignor) who receives a lease transfer payment has no remaining period over which to spread the amount of income under section CC 1B. Therefore, the amount of income will be allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived.

Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features Proposed section CC 1(2C) provides that if an owner of a fee simple estate in land derives an amount as consideration for the grant, for the duration of the estate, of an easement over the land, the amount will not be income of the owner. The purpose of this specific exclusion is to align the tax treatment of a permanent easement (or a perpetual right of way) with that for freehold land under the existing section CC 1. Accordingly, a payment for a permanent easement will not be taxable to the owner of land (the grantor) under section CC 1, 11 and a payment for a permanent easement will not be deductible to the payer (the grantee) under the depreciation rules. Background Section CC 1 applies broadly to tax income from land by providing that amounts derived from land by a landowner are taxable even if the amounts are traditionally categorised as capital in nature – for example, a lease premium. A payment for a permanent easement is currently taxable to a landowner under section CC 1. On the other hand, a payment for a permanent easement is generally non-deductible to the payer (the grantee) under the depreciation rules. Generally, a permanent easement does not meet the definition of depreciable property under section EE 6; in particular, in normal circumstances, a permanent easement is not reasonably expected to decline in value. 11 Note that the land provisions in sections CB 6 – CB 23B continue to apply to permanent easements. 88 PERPETUALLY RENEWABLE LEASES (“GLASGOW” LEASES) (Clause 53) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment excludes a perpetually renewable lease from being depreciable property. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features Section EE 7 will be amended to exclude a lease of land with a perpetual right of renewal from being depreciable property. The purpose is to treat a perpetually renewable lease similarly to freehold land under the depreciation rules. Accordingly, depreciation deductions will not be available for a perpetually renewable lease. Background Perpetually renewable leases last for a certain duration (for example, 7, 10 or 21 years), but are renewable in perpetuity at the option of tenants. They are commonly known as “Glasgow” leases. They are typically for the bare land only and tenants generally own the improvements on the land. Rents on these leases are reviewed periodically (usually to a market rate). Under the current rules, “the right to use land” is contained in the list of depreciable intangible property in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Usually, a commercial tenant of a lease can claim depreciation deductions for their cost to acquire the lease (that is, a lease premium or lease transfer payment) over the term of the lease. However, a tenant under a perpetually renewable lease may not claim depreciation deductions during the term of the lease because these leases have a perpetually renewable lease period. The tenant, however, may be able to claim a depreciation loss when the perpetually renewable lease is sold for less than its adjusted tax value if the lease meets the definition of “depreciable property” in section EE 6 – that is, in normal circumstances, the lease might reasonably be expected to decline in value. Note that a payment for a perpetually renewable lease continues to be taxable to a landowner under section CC 1. This payment (for example, a lease premium) is easily substitutable for taxable rent payments on a perpetually renewable lease that are periodically reset to market levels. 89 CONSECUTIVE LEASES (Clauses 56, 123(23) and 123(24)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment treats consecutive leases of land as a single lease for depreciation purposes. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features Section EE 67 will be amended to include consecutive leases in the existing definition of “legal life” for a lease and licence to use land. The definition of “legal life” is used to determine the annual depreciation rate for an item of fixed-life intangible property, such as a lease of land, in section EE 33. If consecutive leases over the same parcel of land are granted to a person or an associated person at the same time, the term of a lease owned by the person will also include the terms of consecutive leases owned by that person or an associate. This will have an effect of treating consecutive leases as a single lease. Any genuinely subsequently negotiated leases or licences of land will not be counted towards the legal life of a lease. Consecutive leases would need to be acquired by the person or associated person at the same time to be counted towards the legal life of a lease. This is intended as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent the timing of depreciation deductions for the cost of acquiring a lease (a lease premium or lease transfer payment), being accelerated by entering into consecutive leases. If consecutive leases are entered into around the same time (such as one day apart), the general anti-avoidance provision in section BG 1 may apply to counter any transactions that attempt to circumvent this measure contrary to the policy intent. 90 Example On 1 April 2015, A Ltd and its associates, B Ltd and C Ltd, enter into three separate leases for the same parcel of land to take effect immediately after one terminates. The first lease commences on 1 April 2015. Each lease lasts for 10 years. Lease Commencement date Lease ownership Term of the lease 1 1 April 2015 A Ltd 10 years 2 1 April 2025 B Ltd 10 years 3 1 April 2035 C Ltd 10 years A Ltd, B Ltd and C Ltd are associated and they have entered into consecutive leases for the same parcel of land on the same day. Therefore, under the proposed rules:  A Ltd’s interest (owner’s interest) in the lease will be treated as lasting for 30 years, which includes both B Ltd and C Ltd’s interests in the lease.  B Ltd’s interest (owner’s interest) in the lease will be treated as lasting for 20 years, which includes C Ltd’s interest in the lease.  C Ltd’s interest (owner’s interest) in the lease lasts for 10 years as there is no consecutive lease. The definition of “land provisions” in section YA 1 will be amended so that the definition of “associated person” applying in section EE 67 is the one applicable to land provisions. Also, paragraph (d)(v) of the definition of “lease” in section YA 1 will be amended to remove the Commissioner’s discretion to determine consecutive leases for the purposes of personal property lease payments. A similar definition to the one that is proposed for depreciation purposes in section EE 67 will be adopted to provide certainty and consistency. Background Consecutive leases are multiple leases for the same parcel of land that are granted to a person or an associated person at the same time, and are linked to take effect immediately after one terminates. Under the current rules, depreciation deductions on a lease could be accelerated by entering into consecutive leases, including involving associated persons, rather than a single lease. 91 RETIREMENT VILLAGE OCCUPATION RIGHTS (Clause 123(25)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment excludes an occupation right agreement as defined in the Retirement Villages Act 2003 from the financial arrangement rules. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features Paragraph (f) of the “lease” definition in section YA 1 will be amended to include an occupation right agreement as defined in the Retirement Villages Act 2003. This way, retirement village occupation rights will be treated as an excepted financial arrangement in section EW 5(9), and accordingly excluded from the financial arrangement rules. This amendment is intended to align the treatment of retirement village occupation rights with leases of land under the financial arrangement rules, and to provide certainty that retirement village residents are not subject to these rules. Background Leases are currently excluded from the financial arrangement rules because they are excepted financial arrangements under section EW 5(9). However, retirement village occupation rights that are licences to occupy are currently regarded as financial arrangements because they are not a lease for the purposes of financial arrangement rules as defined in section YA 1. 12 Treating certain retirement village occupation rights as financial arrangements is undesirable from a policy perspective. In particular, if certain retirement village occupation rights are subject to the financial arrangement rules, there may be tax consequences for a retirement village resident. 13 Note that Determination S16, which was issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in 2010, applies to certain retirement village occupation rights that are leases resulting in the financial arrangement rules not applying to such arrangements. However, a legislative amendment in this area would provide greater certainty and ensure that all occupation right agreements under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are excluded from the financial arrangement rules. 12 See paragraphs (d) and (f) of the definition of “lease” in section YA 1. 13 The existing financial arrangement rules shift financial benefits from the transaction from one party to another. Consequently, under certain retirement village occupation rights arrangements, deductions may be allowed to a retirement village operator and assessable income may arise to the resident. This tax outcome would not generally have been contemplated by the contracting parties at the time of the transaction. 92 93 Other policy matters 94 95 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS – AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PROPERTY OR SERVICES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY (Clauses 60 to 67) Summary of proposed amendments The taxation rules for financial arrangements which are agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services in foreign currency (the foreign currency arrangements) are being changed to:  reduce the complexity of calculations and increase overall compliance;  minimise the volatility of taxable income in comparison to accounting income; and  ensure that interest calculation for tax purposes reflects the economic reality. An officials’ issues paper released in July 2012 also proposed that the taxation rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services in New Zealand currency be changed for the same reasons. This proposal has been deferred to allow for further consideration of the issues by officials in consultation with taxpayers. Application dates The amendments will apply to foreign currency arrangements entered into from the 2014–15 income year. Taxpayers using International financial reporting standards (IFRS) can make a once-and-for-all election to apply the new rules to foreign currency arrangements entered into from the beginning of an income year commencing with the 2011–12 income year. In addition, tax positions taken consistently for existing foreign currency arrangements which are essentially based on the new rules will be validated. Key features The new rules will require IFRS taxpayers to follow their accounting treatment for foreign currency arrangements. This means the value of the property and services and any interest included in foreign currency arrangements will follow the accounting treatment. Compliance costs and complexity for these taxpayers will be considerably reduced compared with the current tax treatment. Non-IFRS taxpayers will follow similar rules to IFRS taxpayers, based on spot exchange rates. There will be the ability to use forward exchange rates when these taxpayers elect to follow a prescribed foreign currency hedging tax treatment. Again, compliance costs and complexity for these taxpayers will be reduced. 96 Background A primary purpose of the financial arrangements rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 is to account for the income or expenditure on a financial arrangement (the “interest” component) over the term of the arrangement. The interest component includes foreign currency gains and losses on financial arrangements. Agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services have been financial arrangements since the commencement of the financial arrangement rules in 1986. This is because they can include an interest component resulting from prepayments or deferred payments. Any interest component is identified by comparing the value of the property or services with the consideration paid for the property or services. Foreign currency arrangements have been subject to a complex mandatory tax treatment since 1996 to identify any interest component. This treatment includes the use of forward exchange rates for valuing the property or services and taxing the unrealised gains and losses during the term of the arrangements. The current rules for foreign currency arrangements have caused significant compliance difficulties and volatility of taxable income (compared with accounting income). The volatility of taxable income is especially significant for IFRS taxpayers. The compliance difficulties are relevant to all taxpayers but are especially significant for non-IFRS taxpayers. Modern accounting practice has now comprehensively and coherently dealt with this issue, thereby offering an opportunity to consider changes to the relevant tax rules. Detailed analysis The proposed new rules will apply from the application dates noted above to new foreign currency arrangements as follows: IFRS taxpayers:  This group will use the accounting treatment for the value of property or services in all cases. These values are calculated at spot exchange rates where designated hedging is not applied for accounting purposes. When designated hedging is applied for accounting amounts from the designated hedges are aggregated with the values calculated at the spot exchange rates to get the values of property or services. The accounting values will also be used for other tax purposes for example, the “cost” of property for calculating tax depreciation, and valuing revenue account property etc. These taxpayers will be taxed on any interest and foreign currency gains and losses from foreign currency arrangements and designated hedges included in the accounting income statement that are not included in the accounting values of property or services. The accounting result is considered to be the correct economic and tax result in these cases. 97  This group will also have existing tax positions consistently taken on existing foreign currency arrangements which are essentially based on the new rules validated. This measure is necessary to ensure existing tax positions for existing foreign currency arrangements where spot exchange rates have been applied instead of the mandated forward exchange rates are not subject to future dispute. The use of spot exchange rates instead of forward exchange rates for existing foreign currency arrangements has resulted in tax timing differences which will reverse over time. These differences will have gone both ways and are now locked into the fiscal base. It is not considered productive to have them corrected by use of the disputes process. Non-IFRS taxpayers:  These taxpayers will generally value the property or services in foreign currency arrangements at actually realised spot exchange rates. There will be a once-and-for- all ability to elect to include in the value of property or services amounts from specifically identified forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge the foreign currency arrangements. The election criteria will be prescribed in the legislation. This will suit many non-IFRS taxpayers who hedge their foreign currency purchases or sales. Others will simply use the spot exchange rate option.  This group will not be taxed on any unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses under the stand-alone foreign currency arrangements. (They are presently taxed on the unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses under the current rules.) If they elect to include amounts from specifically identified forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge the foreign currency arrangements in the value of property or services they will not be taxed on foreign gains and losses on the hedges. If they do not elect to include the hedge amounts in the value of the property or services they will be taxed on foreign currency gains and losses on the hedges. That is the current tax treatment for such stand-alone hedging financial arrangements.  These taxpayers will be taxed on any interest under foreign currency arrangements arising from prepayments or deferred payments which are made 12 months or more before or after the “rights date” (the possession of the property or performance of the services). These prepayments and deferred payments are considered to be in the nature of loans and have always been taxed under the financial arrangement rules. This rule will not apply to payments for progress made on either making or constructing property, or providing services. These payments are not considered to be in the nature of loans.  Under the proposed rules, this group will have existing tax positions consistently taken on existing foreign currency arrangements, and which are essentially based on the new rules, validated. This measure is necessary to ensure existing tax positions for foreign currency arrangements where spot exchange rates have been applied, instead of the mandated forward exchange rates, are not subject to future dispute. 98 INCOME TAX RATES FOR 2014–15 (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2014–15 tax year and are the same as those that applied for the 2013–14 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2014–15 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2014–15 tax year will be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 99 THE ACQUISITION DATE OF LAND (Clause 7) Summary of proposed amendment The land provisions contained in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to clarify the time at which land is considered to have been acquired for tax purposes. In particular, the amendment clarifies that for the purposes of section CB 6 (land acquired with the intention or purpose of disposal), that the date a person’s intention or purpose will be tested is at the beginning of the period when the person has an estate or interest in the land. Application date The amendment will apply to disposals of land from the date the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill is introduced. Key features New section CB 15B provides that the date a person acquires land for the purposes of subpart CB (income derived from land) is the date that begins a period in which the person has an estate or interest in the land. Practically, this means that the date the taxpayer’s purpose or intention is tested under section CB 6, and the other relevant land provisions, will be the date a binding agreement is entered into. Indicative characteristics of the date a binding agreement is entered into (that is, the agreement has no conditions precedent, but the vendor and the purchaser intend to be bound by the terms of the contract even if there are conditions subsequent that have to be fulfilled) are:  the date a binding sale and purchase agreement has been signed and executed by both the vendor or purchaser (including nominees or agents); or  the “Date” indicated on a binding sale and purchase agreement, which is then subsequently signed by the parties to the agreement; or  the date a binding oral agreement for the disposal of land was agreed to by the parties, which has then been subsequently actioned by part performance of the agreement and if required later, evidenced by a memorandum. The definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act 2007 also includes an option to acquire an estate or interest in land. For the purposes of an option under the proposed new rules, the date a binding agreement is entered into will be the date the parties enter into the main contract and the taxpayer acquires the option but has not yet exercised it. Although the option is yet to be exercised and the parties still have to enter into a subsequent agreement for the sale and purchase of the land pertaining to the option, the taxpayer has acquired an equitable interest in the “land” and this date is reflective of the underlying “first interest” policy that underpins the proposed legislative clarification. 100 Background The amendment seeks to clarify the acquisition date of land for the purposes of the land disposal provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, in particular section CB 6, which is causing considerable uncertainty for taxpayers, their agents and Inland Revenue. Section CB 6 deals with land acquired for the purpose of, or with the intention of disposal, and the taxation of income derived from disposing of the land. If a taxpayer acquires the land with the intention or purpose of disposal and subsequently disposes of the land, any profit made is taxable. The uncertainty is caused by the timing of when the taxpayer’s intention or purpose should be determined. The Courts have held that “intention” or “purpose” should be tested when a taxpayer has acquired the land in question (known as the date of acquisition). However, because the definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act 2007 includes estates and interests in land, and the taxpayer acquires different interests and estates in “land” at different times under a typical sale and purchase agreement (which are then merged when the title is registered), neither the legislation nor common law have provided sufficient clarity over which interest in “land” the date of acquisition should apply to. To address this uncertainty, as part of Budget 2013 officials released the issues paper Clarifying the acquisition date of land. The issues paper discussed two possible interpretations of the provisions. It concluded that the “first interest” interpretation whereby the date of acquisition is the date when the first equitable or legal interest in land arises in a sale and purchase agreement (typically in the early phases of a sale and purchase agreement), would provide greater certainty and be more economically efficient. This interpretation also more closely reflected the policy underlying section CB 6 (which targets property speculators), as it is the initial decision-making that informs how a person intends to use the property. It would be unusual for a property speculator to enter into a sale and purchase agreement unless they thought it very likely that the purchase and its subsequent disposal would be profitable. 101 REPEAL OF SUBSTITUTING DEBENTURE RULE (Clauses 38, 40, 51, 83, 84, 105 and 123(13) and (40)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes the repeal of the substituting debenture rule in section FA 2(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007, and other consequential amendments as the rule is now out-dated. Currently, the rule recharacterises debt issued by a company to its shareholders by reference to their equity (most commonly debt issued in proportion to shares held) as equity for tax purposes. This means interest paid in respect of a substituting debenture is taxed as a dividend; it is non-deductible to the company and subject to imputation. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2015–16 and later income years. This aligns with the application date for the amendments in the bill to the thin capitalisation rules. Key features Clause 84 of the bill repeals section FA 2(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007, which defines “substituting debenture”, and section FA 2(7), which quantifies the amount of the debenture. As well as repealing the substituting debenture rule, the bill also:  makes certain consequential amendments, primarily to remove references to substituting debentures in other sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 (in clauses 38, 40, 51, 105 and 123(13) and (40) of the bill); and  introduces a transitional provision for substituting debentures that are already in existence when the rule is repealed. Clause 83 contains the transitional provision. Its purpose is to ensure that no adverse tax consequences arise on transitioning from treating the debenture as a share for tax purposes, to treating it as a debt for tax purposes. The transitional provision will treat the taxpayer as having redeemed the substituting debenture for its outstanding principal immediately before the beginning of its 2015–16 income year and re-advanced the redemption proceeds under a new loan equal to the outstanding principal on the first day of its 2015–16 income year. 102 Any income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the loan on or after the first day of the taxpayer’s 2015–16 income year must be accounted for under the financial arrangements rules. Any income and expenditure arising under the substituting debenture in income years before the 2015–16 income year will not be taken into account under the financial arrangements rules because that income and expenditure will have been dealt with under the tax rules applying to shares. Background A number of tax advisers and commentators have recently raised concerns about the substituting debenture rule. It applies too widely in some circumstances. Arguably any shareholder loan is caught. It is easy for those not taking advice to mistakenly issue substituting debentures. Often the rule applies to fairly common company dealings which are of no policy concern. Taxpayers who inadvertently issue substituting debentures may have consequential problems with past tax years (for example, the company may have paid too little tax by virtue of treating the interest as deductible, the incorrect amount of RWT may have been deducted by the company from the payments, no imputation credits would have been attached by the company to the “dividend”, and there may be penalties and use-of-money interest payable as a result of taking an incorrect tax position in past years). Conversely, the rule is too narrow in other circumstances, and can be easily circumvented. For example, the rule does not apply where the debt is in the form of a convertible note or where the loan is not made by the direct shareholder, but an indirect shareholder higher in the ownership chain. Taxpayers may also deliberately structure their funding as substituting debentures to take advantage of the equity recharacterisation. The ease with which the substituting debenture rule can be manipulated may facilitate cross-border tax arbitrage, as taxpayers can effectively choose whether a debenture is treated as debt or equity for New Zealand tax purposes. The scope and the application of the rule are uncertain. This leads to increased compliance costs as taxpayers are inclined to seek advice (and even binding rulings) on fairly straight forward transactions. Furthermore, in light of the recent tax avoidance cases, taxpayers are becoming increasingly concerned about standard commercial transactions which seemingly circumvent the rule. It is difficult to determine whether Parliament’s intention is frustrated when the policy issue Parliament contemplated no longer exists given current policy settings. The rule was enacted in 1940 as a specific anti-avoidance rule, under very different tax policy settings (in particular, New Zealand did not have an imputation regime). The rule originally targeted transactions in which companies were swapping their ordinary equity for debt. These transactions were popular at the time because dividends were paid out of post-tax income and were exempt income to the shareholders, whereas interest was deductible to the company and taxable to the recipient, generally at a lower tax rate than the (then) company rate. Ultimately, the tax burden on dividends was often higher than that on interest. It is also possible that the Government was concerned about the collection of tax from ultimate shareholders as the predecessor of resident withholding tax (RWT) was easily circumvented. 103 In 1958 the dividend exemption was removed. This meant that dividends were subject to double tax, but interest was not (absent the substituting debenture rule). There was a clear tax incentive to structure investments as debt rather than equity, so the substituting debenture rule continued to serve an anti-avoidance purpose at this time. Since the introduction of imputation in 1988, the original purpose of the substituting debenture rule has ceased to be relevant in many cases (as debt and equity returns are generally subject to the same tax treatment in the hands of a New Zealand-resident in a taxpaying position). For investors such as non-residents, who still prefer to receive interest rather than dividends for tax reasons there are targeted rules, such as the thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules, which limit the ability to take undue advantage of the preference. Accordingly, the rule is now out-dated and the bill proposes its repeal. To mitigate any risk to the tax base as a result of the repeal, the application date of the repeal aligns with the strengthened thin capitalisation rules. 104 WITHHOLDING TAX AND INFLATION-INDEXED BONDS (Clauses 119, 121, 122, 123(22), 128(3), 130, 131, 132 and 133) Summary of proposed amendment The resident withholding tax (RWT) and the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to deal with technical problems relating to the application of these withholding tax rules to inflation-indexed instruments. The proposed amendments relate to the timing and the amount of withholding tax to be deducted from the inflation-indexed component of such instruments. To administer the proposed changes, amendments to the record-keeping and filing provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 are also proposed. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed changes are:  Section RE 2(3) is being amended to exclude the inflation-indexed component, which is income that accrues to the bond holder at the end of the tax year, from being interest for the purposes of the general application of the RWT rules.  New section RE 18B will: - limit the RWT payer’s obligation to deduct resident withholding tax on both the interest and inflation-indexed amount to the amount of the interest payment; and - require RWT to be deducted from the interest and inflation-indexed amount when the bond coupon is paid.  Section RF 2(1) is being amended to treat the inflation-indexed component as being non-resident passive income at the time the coupon interest is paid. This is to ensure that NRWT is deducted at the same time.  Section YA 1 is being amended to insert a definition of an inflation-indexed instrument.  A new paragraph is being inserted in sections 25(6) and 51 (2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that will require the bond issuer to notify the recipient of their requirement to file, and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of any remaining tax liability.  A new paragraph is being inserted in sections 33A(2) and 33AA(1)(l) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that will provide an exclusion from non-filing requirements for a bond holder who has an interest payment capped by new section RE 18B. 105 Background As part of the 2012 Half Yearly Economic Fiscal Update, the Government announced that it intended to target up to 10–20% of total bonds outstanding over time in an inflation- indexed bonds format. The Government had previously issued inflation-indexed bonds in 1996 but suspended their issue in 1999. Inflation-indexed bonds are intended to diversify the Crown’s investor base, to provide long-term cost-effective funding for the Government and to provide investors with a hedge against inflation as recommended by the Capital Market Development Taskforce in 2009, and in accordance with the 2010 Government Action Plan. An inflation-indexed bond is a bond in which the nominal capital value invested increases by a measure of inflation in any year. The measure of inflation is generally a price index published by Statistics New Zealand and is actually credited when the bond matures, but is taken into account in calculating the coupon payments. The coupon paid in any year is paid quarterly on the capital value of the bond. The capital value of the bond is the face value or nominal amount of the bond adjusted for cumulative changes in the Consumer Price Index. Section EI 2 treats the inflation-indexed component as income having been credited at the end of the year. Tax treatment of inflation-indexed instruments The tax treatment of inflation-indexed bonds falls within the relevant RWT, NRWT and inflation-indexed instruments provisions in the Income Tax Act. RWT is due on most forms of interest for New Zealand residents who do not hold an RWT exemption certificate. NRWT is also due on most forms of interest for non-residents, unless a 0% NRWT rate applies. In most cases where a 0% NRWT rate applies, approved issuers (or a person on their behalf) must pay a levy on the securities they register with Inland Revenue, known as the approved issuer levy (AIL). Approved issuers are able to pay interest to non-residents without deducting NRWT. Instead approved issuers are required to pay a levy at the rate of 2% for every dollar of interest paid on the inflation instrument. If RWT or NRWT has been deducted at the wrong rate, the taxpayer may be obliged to file a tax return at the end of the year and make up the difference (or receive a refund). NRWT for the majority of non-resident holders is a final withholding tax. 106 The problems the changes seek to address Two technical tax problems have been identified with the reissuance of these bonds which this bill seeks to address. The primary problem is the potential for a withholding tax obligation to exceed the coupon amount. In this situation, the issuer of an inflation-indexed bond would have a liability to pay withholding tax, but no administratively workable “payment” to deduct it from. At present this problem is a potential risk rather than an actual problem. The current coupon rate for the new Government issue of inflation-indexed bonds is 2% per annum, and this low coupon rate increases this potential risk. For example, the following table provides an indication of what the rate of inflation needs to be in order for the potential risk to become a problem. Tax type and rate Coupon rate Annual inflation rate for the coupon payment to be insufficient RWT at 33% 2% 4.1% RWT at 30% 2% 4.7% RWT at 17.5% 2% 9.5% NRWT at 15% 2% 11.3% While the risk of withholding tax exceeding the coupon payment is currently perceived to be low, the proposed changes go some way towards mitigating the cashflow and potential tax collection consequences if the inflation risk profile were to change significantly. The proposed amendments to limit the RWT liability to the amount of the coupon are not extended to NRWT because the risk is considered lower. The second and related problem stems from a timing issue. The legislation intends that RWT should be deducted annually from the inflation-indexed component. However, the coupon is generally paid quarterly and the administrative practice is to withhold the tax on the inflation-indexed component for the previous quarter, and deduct it from the coupon payment. This can result in an unclear situation where an issuer may be withholding tax from a coupon amount in advance of the bond holder’s legal obligation, because there is some form of cashflow from which to deduct the withholding tax. So that Inland Revenue can administer these proposed changes, additional record-keeping requirements for the bond issuer and filing requirements for the bond holder have also been included in the bill. 107 DEDUCTIONS FOR UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE FACILITIES (Clauses 17, 18 and 36) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment is proposed to remove from the ambit of the petroleum mining tax rules underground facilities that are used to store processed gas. These facilities will instead be covered by the general depreciation tax rules, with deductions for expenditure on these facilities being spread over the estimated economic life of the asset. Application date The amendment will apply to expenditure incurred from the date of enactment. However, there is a grand-parenting provision proposed for expenditure incurred by the owner of an existing underground gas storage facility. Key features An amendment to section CT 7 carves out underground facilities used to store processed gas from being treated as petroleum mining assets. These underground facilities will be subject to the depreciation rules, rather than the petroleum mining rules. Proposed section CZ 32 provides a transitional rule for the tax treatment of proceeds from selling an underground gas storage facility constructed before the amendments come into force. The proceeds received from the sale of an underground gas storage facility are currently treated as being on revenue account under the petroleum mining rules (section CT 1). Under the proposed change, which removes underground storage facilities from the petroleum mining rules and includes them within the depreciation rules, the sale of an underground gas storage facility will be treated as being on capital account. Consideration received from a disposal will be apportioned to reflect the amount of expenditure that has been incurred under the existing rules. For example, if an underground gas storage facility is sold for $500 million in 2016, with $300 million of expenditure incurred before the amendments are enacted and $100 million incurred after the amendments are enacted, the amount of income from selling the facility would be: $300 million/$400 million x $500 million = $375 million. Background Currently, a gap in the petroleum mining tax rules means that underground facilities for storing processed gas are eligible for concessionary treatment as a petroleum mining asset. This means that expenditure on an underground gas storage facility is deductible over seven years, instead of over the economic life of the facility (which would be the treatment under the depreciation rules). This is contrary to the policy intent that only expenditure on petroleum exploration and development should be eligible for concessionary treatment. The underground storage of gas that has already been extracted and processed is not an exploration or development activity. 108 CHARITIES WITH OVERSEAS CHARITABLE PURPOSES (Clauses 2(25) and 126) Summary of proposed amendment The bill adds two new charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to the following charities will be eligible for tax benefits on their donations:  Every Home Global Concern Incorporated  Namibian Educational Trust Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April for the income year following enactment. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled, as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of the monetary amount donated, up to the value of their taxable income. Companies and Māori Authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. The two charitable organisations being added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities:  Every Home Global Concern Incorporated: The Trust is involved in a wide range of projects throughout the developing world, with particular emphasis on breaking the cycle of poverty and oppression and giving people the skills to improve their lives. The Trust carries on projects in Bangladesh (microenterprises) and Malawi (agricultural and livestock training, amenities and water pumps, HIV/Aids education), Africa generally (mosquito nets) and South Asia (vocational training, HIV/Aids education and microenterprises).  Namibian Educational Trust: The Trust is involved in projects directed at improving the health and wellbeing of children in northern Namibia. Its main focus is to resource and provide amenities to schools and villages in the region. 109 CHANGE OF TAX RESIDENCY FOR GST PURPOSES (Clause 161(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment “turns off” the backdating effect of certain residency rules in relation to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Whether a person is a resident or non-resident for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is dependant, in part, on whether the person is present or absent from New Zealand for a certain period of time as determined by the Income Tax Act 2007. Once the time period has been exceeded the person’s residence status is backdated to the beginning of the time period. Under the current rules, to be considered tax resident a person must be present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total, over a 12-month period. In these circumstances, a person is treated as being a tax resident from the first of the 183 days. To be considered non-resident, a person must be outside New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. In this case the resident will be regarded as a non-resident from the first of the 325 days. For the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 only, the proposed amendment “turns off” the retrospective application of the residency rules so a person’s residency status is determined on a prospective basis (starting from the first day after the relevant time period has been exceeded). Background The residency status of a person for GST purposes is determined by section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The provision contains two rules that determine a person’s tax residence – the permanent place-of-abode rule and the day-count rules. There are two “day count” rules, the 183-day rule for determining whether a person becomes a tax resident and the 325-day rule for determining when a person ceases to be a tax resident. 110 A number of provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 refer to the residency status of a person, most notably the provision that allows services supplied to non-residents who are offshore at the time of supply to be zero-rated. However, the retrospective application of the day-count rules can result in the GST treatment applied at the time of the transaction, on the facts known at the time, subsequently becoming incorrect. For example, in a situation when immigration services are zero-rated on the basis of being supplied to a non-resident who is offshore at the time of supply, the GST treatment can become incorrect if the recipient’s tax residency status is backdated to a time before the services were performed. This could happen if the recipient visited New Zealand before the services were performed and came back to New Zealand after the services had been performed. The combined time in New Zealand could result in the application of the 183- day rule. This is not a satisfactory outcome given the fact that the service provider is unlikely to be aware upfront of whether the non-resident will become a resident after the services have been provided. This leads to uncertainty for the supplier who does not know when completing the GST return whether the GST treatment of the services was correct. The proposed amendment is intended to resolve the above problem by turning off the retrospective application of the income tax residency rules in relation to both the 183-day residence test and, correspondingly, the 325-day absence test. The proposed change follows submissions received on the officials’ issues paper, The GST treatment of immigration and other services, released in June 2013. 111 ZERO-RATED SERVICES SUPPLIES TO NON-RESIDENTS (Clause 166) Summary of proposed amendment A new zero-rating rule is being proposed that will allow services to remain exempt from GST when a non-resident receiving services visits New Zealand during the period of service, as long as the non-resident’s presence is “not directly connected” with the services being supplied. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Currently, services supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time services are being performed are zero-rated for GST purposes. The proposed amendment allows “outside New Zealand” to be interpreted (for a natural person) as a presence in New Zealand that is minor and not directly connected with the supply. Background New Zealand’s GST system is based on the “destination principle” under which supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. Since services supplied to non-residents who are offshore will not typically be consumed in New Zealand, the services are zero-rated. This ensures GST is not a cost to overseas consumers. The zero-rating rule requires the supplier to have knowledge of the whereabouts of the non- resident consumer during the period in which the services are performed. However, in some cases the non-resident may visit New Zealand during the period the service is supplied on an unrelated matter. In this situation the supplier may be unaware of the non- resident’s presence in New Zealand and may mistakenly zero-rate the service. The proposed change is intended to resolve this problem by allowing services to remain zero-rated as long as the non-resident’s presence is “not directly connected” with the services being supplied. However, to ensure services are only zero-rated when they are performed to a non-resident who is predominantly outside New Zealand, the proposed change also requires the non-residence presence in New Zealand to be minor in nature. 112 A similar provision applies to non-resident companies and unincorporated bodies that have a minor presence in New Zealand or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. The approach proposed in the amendment has been developed from submissions received from the officials’ issues paper, The GST treatment of immigration and other services, released in June 2013. 113 CLASSIFICATION OF MINING PERMITS AS REAL PROPERTY FOR TAX PURPOSES (Clause 123(35)) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being introduced to clarify that mining permits issued under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 should be treated as “real property” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features A definition of “real property” is being included in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that mining permits issued under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 are treated as “real property” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. Currently, there is some uncertainty about the treatment of mining permits for tax purposes because section 91 of the Crown Minerals Act 1991 states that a mining permit is neither real nor personal property. The proposed change will ensure that New Zealand has source taxing rights over income from these permits under Article 6 of its double tax agreements (DTAs), which applies to income from real property. This is consistent with the approach taken in New Zealand’s newer DTAs (signed since the 1990s) where it is evident that mining permits are included within the definition of “real property” contained in those treaties. 114 EXTENDING THE TAX EXEMPTION FOR NON-RESIDENT OFFSHORE OIL RIG AND SEISMIC VESSEL OPERATORS (Clause 30) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment is proposed to extend the temporary tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators for a further five years, until the end of 2019. An amendment is also proposed to modify the scope of the non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel exemption by excluding modular drilling rigs. Application date The extension of the exemption will apply from 1 January 2015 and expire on 31 December 2019. The amendment modifying the scope of the exemption will apply from 1 January 2015. Key features An amendment is proposed to extend the temporary tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators, in section CW 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007, for a further five years. A temporary five-year exemption from tax on the income of non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators was introduced in 2004. This exemption was rolled over in 2009 for a further five years and is due to expire on 31 December 2014. An amendment is also proposed to modify the scope of the non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel exemption by excluding modular drilling rigs. This will be achieved by amending the definition of “exploration and development activities” in section CW 57(2) to exclude a drilling rig that is of modular construction and is installed on an existing platform. Background Offshore rigs and seismic vessels owned by non-residents are covered by the current exemption. They are used to drill for oil and gas and gather data on potential oil and gas finds. Rigs are generally of two types – semi-submersibles and jack-up rigs. There is a worldwide market in rigs and seismic vessels. No New Zealand company owns offshore rigs or seismic vessels, so any company wishing to explore in New Zealand waters needs to use a rig or seismic vessel provided by a non-resident owner. 115 Section CW 57 was introduced to deal with a problem created by our double tax agreements (DTAs). New Zealand generally taxes non-residents on income that has a source in New Zealand. However, our DTAs provide that non-residents are only taxable on their New Zealand-sourced business profits if they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. Many of our DTAs (such as the New Zealand – United States DTA) have a specific rule providing that a non-resident enterprise involved in exploring for natural resources only has a permanent establishment in New Zealand if they are present for a particular period of time, often 183 days in a year. Once a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, they are taxed on all their New Zealand business profits starting from day one. The issue caused by this DTA provision was that seismic vessels and rigs used in petroleum exploration were leaving New Zealand waters before the 183-day limit was reached so they would not be subject to New Zealand tax. This meant that, in some cases, a rig would leave before 183 days and a different rig was mobilised to complete the exploration programme. This “churning” of rigs increased the cost for companies engaged in exploration and delayed exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery of oil or gas. Section CW 57 applies broadly to non-resident companies operating seismic vessels and rigs used in drilling wells (see the definition of “exploration and development activities” in section CW 57(2)). The main rig types used in drilling wells are semi-submersibles and jack-up rigs. However, a type of rig (a modular drilling rig) exists that is of modular construction and designed to be installed on an existing platform. These modular drilling rigs were never intended to be included within the scope of the exemption, which was designed with semi-submersibles and jack-up rigs in mind. In addition, modular drilling rigs do not have the same high mobilisation and demobilisation costs as larger rigs, which means the rationale for the exemption does not apply in relation to these rigs. 116 117 GST remedial matters 118 119 OVERVIEW Most of the GST remedial items in the bill relate to issues outlined in the GST issues paper, GST remedial issues, released in December 2012. Hence, the majority of the amendments were developed from submissions received on that paper. All section references relate to the Goods and Services Act 1985 unless stated otherwise. 120 SCOPE OF THE “HIRE PURCHASE” DEFINITION (Clause 123(19) and (180)) Summary of proposed amendment The definition of “hire purchase agreement” will be broadened to include any contract where a person has an option to purchase. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2005, with a “savings” provision for taxpayers who filed returns under the contrary position up until the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The definition of “hire purchase agreement” under section YA 1(a)(i) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section OB 1(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be amended to explicitly incorporate contracts under which the person has an option to purchase, but that option is not exercised until a later date. Background The definition of “hire purchase agreement”, in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is intended to cover two types of agreement. The first is when the goods are let or hired to a person with an option to purchase (an “option to purchase agreement”). The second is when a person has agreed to purchase the goods with a condition (a “conditional contract of sale”). The main difference between the two is whether the person has agreed to purchase the goods at the time the relevant contract is entered into. An amendment made to the “hire purchase agreement” definition that took effect from 1 April 2005 contained a drafting error, which arguably means a person’s upfront agreement to purchase the goods is required in order for an arrangement to be a hire purchase agreement. This interpretation is inconsistent with the original policy intent, which is to capture both forms of agreement. The proposed amendment was previously included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2011. However, it was withdrawn for further consultation alongside the proposal for deferred settlement land transactions to be removed from the hire purchase definition (so as to remove the requirement for the up-front payment of GST) and be replaced with an anti-avoidance rule. These issues were further consulted on as part of GST remedial issues. After considering submissions, a decision was made to proceed with the more minor change to the hire purchase definition by extending its scope to include “option to purchase” agreements. 121 DWELLING DEFINITION – RETIREMENT ACCOMMODATION (Clause 161(1) and (2)) Summary of proposed amendments Two proposed amendments to the dwelling and commercial dwelling definitions will clarify that residential units in retirement villages and rest homes where the occupants are essentially living independently are treated as GST-exempt “dwellings”. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2011. However, in recognition of the transitional costs to taxpayers, the amendments will be subject to a “savings” provision for those who filed their tax returns on the reverse basis up until 31 March 2015. Key features The proposed amendment to the “dwelling” definition will create a new subparagraph 2(b)(iii) which states that when the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in a retirement home or village is for the right to occupy a residential unit, the unit will be treated as a dwelling. The proposed amendment to the “commercial dwelling” definition will replace section 2(b)(ii) with a cross-reference to the new amendment to the “dwelling” definition. This will ensure that units in retirement villages where the occupants are living independently are excluded from the “commercial dwelling” definition. Background GST is imposed on accommodation in “commercial dwellings” such as hotels but not in “dwellings” such as private residences, which are GST-exempt. The definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” were amended on 1 April 2011. The policy intention behind the changes was to clarify the boundary between these definitions, and to narrow the scope of what could be considered a “dwelling” on the basis of economic equivalence with owner-occupied homes. Concerns have been raised that tenants of residential units in retirement villages may not meet the new dwelling definition requirement of having “quiet enjoyment” (under section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986) of their properties. As such, despite the previous treatment of these units as GST-exempt dwellings, they could be treated as “commercial dwellings” (subject to GST). This does not align with the policy intention, which was to maintain the pre-April 2011 GST treatment of retirement village accommodation. 122 OUTPUT TAX ON THE DISPOSAL OF LAND (Clause 163) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies that when input tax has been claimed in respect of the acquisition of land, output tax must be paid on its disposal. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment of the bill. Key features The proposed amendment will extend the scope of section 5(16) so that it also applies to all subsequent supplies of land when any input tax credit has been claimed. The amendment will treat such supplies as being in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and therefore subject to GST. The extension of section 5(16) will not apply to situations when a registered person has already returned the output tax – for instance, if they have already performed the wash-up calculation in proposed section 21FB or they have paid output tax upon deregistration. Background If a registered person claims input tax when they purchase land, the correct policy outcome is for output tax to be paid on its sale. However, it is possible that a person could claim input tax on their land, but fail to pay output tax on its disposal if the disposal is outside the “course and furtherance” of their taxable activity. This situation could potentially arise when the use of the land before sale is solely non-taxable. Although the issue also exists in relation to other assets, it predominantly occurs in regard to land. 123 DIRECTORS’ FEES (Clause 164) Summary of proposed amendments Two amendments are proposed to section 6 that relate to the GST treatment of fees paid to directors and board members. The first proposed amendment provides that when an employee is engaged by a third party to be a director or board member, and the employee is required to account to the employer for any payments received, the employer will be treated as supplying services to the third party. The employer will therefore return GST and the third party will be able to claim input tax on the payment for these services. The second proposed amendment extends the proviso under section 6(3)(b) that deems services performed by directors to be supplied in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity when that director has a broader taxable activity to persons listed in section 6(3)(c)(iii) such as members of boards. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment of the bill. Key features The first amendment creates a “flow-through” rule (shown below) that deems services to be supplied by an employer (Company B) to a third party (Company A) when an employee is engaged by the third party to be a director or person listed in section 6(3)(c)(iii) (that is, board members) and when the employee is required to account for any fees or other amounts to their employer (Company B). Hence, the rule will require the employer (Company B) to issue a tax invoice for the fees paid and the third party (Company A) will be able to claim the related input tax deduction. Flow-through rule: Deemed supply of service Reimburses fees to employer Pays director/member Company A (GST-registered) Director/ member (no taxable activity) Company B (Director/ member’s employer - GST-registered) 124 The second amendment extends the provision that deems services performed by directors to be supplied in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity when that director has a broader taxable activity to persons listed in section 6(3)(c)(iii) (Members of boards). Background The first amendment relates to an issue identified in an Inland Revenue Public Ruling (BR Pub 05/13) regarding the GST treatment of directors. It occurs when an employee who is not GST-registered is engaged by a third party to be a director and is required to remit fees paid by the third party to their employer. In this situation, the directors’ fees paid to the employee are not subject to GST because the employee is precluded from having a taxable activity. However, when the employee passes these fees on to their employer, the employer is required to account for output tax on the supply. This result means that the third party will not receive an input tax deduction for the fees paid. The director’s employer will, however, have to account for output tax on the amount reimbursed by the employee. Conceptually the same issue could arise in relation to the persons listed in section 6(3)(c)(iii), such as members of boards. The second issue concerns the exception to the rule that precludes a director from carrying on a taxable activity, under section 6(3)(b). The rule applies when directors have a broader taxable activity, in which case their services as a director are deemed to be supplied in the course and furtherance of that taxable activity. However, members of boards and the other persons listed in section 6(3)(c)(iii) can also have broader taxable activities. For GST purposes the persons listed in section 6(3)(c)(iii) are conceptually the same as directors, therefore they should have the same treatment. 125 SURRENDERS AND ASSIGNMENTS OF INTERESTS IN LAND (Clause 165(1) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to 11(8D) will clarify that assignments and surrenders of interests in land are subject to the zero-rating of land rules. Application date This amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed amendment will replace “chargeable with tax at 0%” with “of land” in section 11(8D)(a) and (b) so the GST treatment of assignments and surrenders of interests in land would depend upon meeting the zero-rating of land requirements in section 11(1)(mb). Background Section 11(8D) is designed to clarify that assignments and surrenders of interests in land are subject to the zero-rating of land rules. The policy intent of this section is that assignments and surrenders of interests in land can be zero-rated when the requirements for the zero-rating of land rules are met. However, the current wording of section 11(8D) arguably allows all “surrenders” or “assignments” of interest in land to be zero-rated, even when the other zero-rating land transaction requirements are not met – for instance, when the recipient of the supply is not GST-registered. 126 PROCUREMENT OF A LEASE (Clause 165(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will ensure payments for the procurement of a lease are subject to the zero-rating of land rules. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment of the bill. Key features A change to section 11(8D) will be made to ensure new interests in land through a procurement of a lease will be zero-rated, subject to the zero-rating of land requirements of section 11(1)(mb) being met. Background The concern is that the procurement of a lease when purchasing a business does not fall under the zero-rating of land rules. This is because an argument can be made that when a new interest has been created in the procurement transaction there is no transfer of an interest in land between the vendor and the purchaser. Therefore, any consideration payable in relation to this supply will not be zero-rated. This outcome does not create the correct policy outcome as lease procurements are arguably economically equivalent to lease assignments which are subject to the zero-rating of land rules. 127 NON-PROFIT BODIES EXEMPTION (Clause 167(1) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will clarify that non-profit bodies can claim all of their GST input deductions other than on inputs that relate to the making of exempt supplies. Application date This amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed amendment will ensure that non-profit bodies can claim all of their GST input deductions except those that relate to exempt supplies. It achieves this by extending the application of section 20(3K) so that it applies for the purposes of section 20(3) and (3C), and the definitions of “percentage actual use” and “percentage intended use” in section 21G(1). Background Non-profit bodies are able to take advantage of a special input deduction rule that allows them to claim input tax deductions on all supplies received except to the extent that the goods or services in question are used for making exempt supplies. However, an unintended consequence of the introduction of the new GST apportionment rules in April 2011 is that they have created some uncertainty around the application of the special rule. This is because the definitions of “percentage actual use” and “percentage intended use” only enable input deductions to the extent that goods and services are actually used for making “taxable supplies”. Hence, it is arguable that non-profit bodies may not be able to claim input tax credits for purchases that relate to non-exempt supplies. The new apportionment rules were not intended to alter the GST input entitlements of non- profit bodies. 128 ALLOWING INPUTS TO REGISTERED PERSONS SUBJECT TO THE DOMESTIC REVERSE CHARGE (Clause 167(2) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will ensure that section 20(4B) does not prevent a person from claiming an input tax credit in cases when they are already registered for GST. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed amendment will extend the scope of the exclusion in section 20(4B) to cover a person that is already registered. This will mean that if a purchaser was already registered for GST when they incorrectly zero-rated a transaction they will still be able to claim an input tax credit. The extended exclusion will only apply to the extent that the person uses the goods for making taxable supplies. Background The supply of land to registered persons is zero-rated in order to prevent “phoenix fraud” 14 arrangements. However, in limited situations this treatment can enable purchasers to avoid paying GST by intentionally or unintentionally representing that they are GST-registered and making the relevant taxable supplies. The “domestic reverse charge” mitigates this risk by requiring the purchaser in this situation to account for the output tax on the sale of the land, but preventing the purchaser from claiming an input tax deduction in relation to this sale (unless they subsequently become registered). What is not catered for is a purchaser who is already GST-registered and incorrectly zero- rates a transaction – for example, as a result of a genuine error. Output tax will be payable under section 20 with no corresponding input tax credit. 14 Phoenix fraud arrangements involve Inland Revenue refunding GST to a purchasing company, but no corresponding payment of output tax being paid to Inland Revenue on a subsequent supply because the company is wound up before making payment. 129 WASH-UP RULE FOR TAXABLE OR NON-TAXABLE USE (Clause 168) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will require taxpayers who have applied the apportionment rules to perform a “wash-up” calculation when their use of an asset changes to 100 percent taxable or 100 percent non-taxable use. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment of the bill. Key features The proposed amendment will, for assets that have been subject to the apportionment rules, require taxpayers to perform a compulsory “wash-up” calculation to account for any unclaimed input tax or pay output tax when the use of the asset changes to solely taxable or non-taxable. Under the proposed rule:  Taxpayers that change from mixed-use to 100 percent taxable use of an asset will be able to claim the “full input tax deduction” (definition under section 21D(2)(a)) less the “actual deduction” (definition under section 21F(3)(c)).  Taxpayers that change from mixed-use to 100 percent non-taxable use of an asset will be required to pay output tax equal to the “actual deduction” already claimed. Once the wash-up calculation has been performed, taxpayers will no longer be required to make any on-going adjustments. To qualify for the “wash-up” deduction, the taxpayer would need to sustain the 100 percent taxable or non-taxable use of their asset for the current apportionment adjustment period and the next adjustment period (up to two years). Background A taxpayer who purchases an asset in order to use it for taxable and non-taxable purposes must apportion their input deductions to account for the non-taxable use. However, if the taxpayer changes the use of the asset to 100 percent taxable they may still be required to perform on- going input tax adjustments. This poses a compliance cost burden on taxpayers, especially in relation to long-lived assets such as land. If taxpayers are allowed to claim a 100 percent deduction earlier to avoid this compliance burden, the logical corollary is that a 100 percent change to non-taxable use of an asset (in respect of which a partial input tax deduction has been claimed) should give rise to an offsetting output tax payment. 130 TRANSITIONAL RULE FOR COMMERCIAL DWELLING ACCOMMODATION ACQUISITION COSTS BEFORE 1 OCTOBER 1986 (Clause 169(1) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the transitional rule in section 21HB will ensure that input tax deductions cannot be claimed for accommodation reclassified as a commercial dwelling if it was acquired before 1 October 1986. Application date The amendment will apply for tax positions taken after the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The proposed amendment to section 21HB(1) will ensure that suppliers who are required to treat their supplies of accommodation as commercial dwellings as a result of the changes to the definitions of “commercial dwelling” and “dwelling” cannot claim input tax for accommodation acquisition costs incurred before 1 October 1986. This will be achieved by replacing the requirement for the costs to be incurred before 1 April 2011, with the requirement that they were incurred between 1 October 1986 and 1 April 2011. Background The transitional rule was developed for suppliers of accommodation who were required to start charging GST as a result of the changes to the “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” definitions. The rule gave these suppliers the ability to claim input tax for the acquisition costs of their newly defined “commercial dwelling” accommodation. However, an unintended effect of the transitional rule is that suppliers affected by the definition changes can arguably claim input tax for accommodation acquired before the introduction of GST on 1 October 1986. This is contrary to the policy rationale underlying the rule as this outcome would allow suppliers to claim input tax for property acquired when no GST was incurred. 131 REQUIREMENT TO BE REGISTERED (Clause 169(2) and (4)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section 21HB will allow suppliers affected by the changes to the definitions of “commercial dwelling” and “dwelling” to have the option of either including or not including a commercial dwelling as part of their broader taxable activity. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed amendment to section 21HB will give a person the option to either include or not include a commercial dwelling as part of their other supplies for consideration if the supply of accommodation in the commercial dwelling is under $60,000 in a 12-month period. The amendment will only apply to persons:  affected by the change to the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”; and  who are required to register because the inclusion of supplies from their newly defined commercial dwelling pushes them over the $60,000 registration threshold under section 51. Background An unintended effect of the change in the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” is that a non-registered person with an activity attributable to newly defined commercial dwelling accommodation (that generates turnover below the GST registration threshold of $60,000) may now have to incorporate the commercial dwelling into their “taxable activity” which may push their turnover above the registration threshold. However, it may be the case that the person would prefer not to be forced to incorporate their newly defined commercial dwelling into their taxable activity for GST purposes, and therefore have to register for GST. 132 MINOR GST REMEDIAL CHANGES Clause Clarification changes Reason Application date Clause 162 Definition of “life insurance contract” in section 3, Meaning of The Term Financial Services. Update the cross- reference to Accident Insurance Act (Entitlements arising from fatal injuries). 1 April 2002 Clause 165(1) and 165(3) Section 11(8D)(b) zero- rating of land. Clarify that commercial leases under which no contemporaneous or advance payment has been made are subject to the exception to the zero- rating of land rules. 1 April 2011 Clause 170 Section 46(1B) non- resident registration.

Clarify the scope of the 5-year embargo on non- resident registration. 1 April 2014 133 CFC remedials 134 135 CFC AND FIF EXEMPTIONS FOR AUSTRALIAN UNIT TRUSTS (Clauses 75 and 76) Summary of proposed amendments Under proposed new rules, Australian Unit Trusts that are not taxed as companies under Australian law will be excluded from the exemptions for Australian controlled foreign companies (CFCs) (section EX 22) and interests in foreign investment funds (FIFs) resident in Australia (section EX 35). Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. Background Before the 2009 international tax reforms, taxpayers did not have to return attributed income in respect of their interest in a CFC if the CFC was resident in a “grey list” country. The grey list comprised eight countries that were thought to have broadly comparable tax systems to our own. Income earned in a grey list country was exempt and income earned in other countries was subject to tax. When the grey list exemption for CFCs was repealed in 2009 it was replaced by an exemption for active income (the active business test) and an exemption for Australian CFCs. Passive income, which included interest, dividends and some types of rent, would be taxable, while active income, primarily business profits, would be exempt. The active business test granted a full tax exemption to CFCs that had only small amounts of passive income. While the active business test required CFCs to earn less than 5 percent passive income, the Australian exemption was a broader, simpler test. CFCs had to be resident in Australia (and only resident in Australia) and subject to Australian income tax. A broader exemption was justified in order to reduce compliance costs for SMEs. Many New Zealand firms looking to expand offshore made their first move across the Tasman and the Australian exemption meant these companies did not need to learn or comply with the attribution rules. The simpler test is buttressed in two ways. First, Inland Revenue and the Australian Tax Office have a close working relationship which makes it easier to monitor and respond to trends and developments. Secondly, the opportunity for mischief is reduced as companies face similar levels of taxation in Australia to those in New Zealand. A equivalent exemption for non-portfolio FIFs (that is where a taxpayer holds more than a 10 percent interest in a FIF) was introduced when the FIF grey list exemption was repealed in 2012. 136 Australian Unit Trusts (AUTs) are generally seen as trusts under Australian tax law but are considered companies under New Zealand tax law. Under the Australian trust regime only a low rate of tax is withheld from passive income; under the New Zealand CFC or non-portfolio FIF regime that income is exempt. In addition, no Australian tax is paid on non-Australian sourced income to which a New Zealand-resident beneficiary is presently entitled. This outcome is concessionary and contrary to the policy objectives of the Australian exemption for CFCs. AUTs are unlikely to be used by New Zealand SMEs looking to expand offshore and the level of taxation on passive income is significantly lower in Australia than it would be in New Zealand. 137 REPEAL OF SECTION DB 55 (Clauses 43 and 174) Summary of proposed amendments The bill repeals section DB 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which allows companies to claim deductions for expenses incurred in deriving exempt foreign dividends. This provision was introduced as exempt foreign dividends were subject to the foreign dividend payment (FDP) rules which were seen as being equivalent to a tax. The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 repealed FDP and section DB 55 no longer served a purpose as exempt foreign dividends were no longer subject to the FDP rules. A “savings” provision is included to preserve assessments based on the current rules if the returns were filed before the date of introduction for this bill. A retrospective amendment is proposed to remove a potential conflict between section DB 55, which allows deductions against exempt foreign dividends, and the general permission under section DA 1, which precludes deductions against exempt income. Application dates The amendment repealing section DB 55 applies from 30 June 2009. The amendment to section DB 55, and section DB 44 of the Income Tax Act 2004, will apply from 1 October 2005. 138 INDIRECT INTERESTS IN FIFS (Clauses 78 and 80) Summary of proposed amendment The bill clarifies the rules that apply to indirectly held interests in FIFs. Additional FIF income is calculated only if the CFC or FIF holds an interest in a FIF that would be an attributable interest if the person had directly held their indirect interest. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. Background The current rules apply a formula to determine the amount of income that should be attributed when a person holds an interest in a CFC or FIF which itself holds an interest in another FIF. For example, a person may hold a 50 percent interest in a CFC which holds a 15 percent interest in a FIF. The intended effect of these rules was that the person should have FIF income attributed to them on the basis of a 7.5 percent indirect interest holding. The proposed amendment ensures that a person in the above situation is not able to access the exemption for interest in a FIF resident in Australia (section EX 35) as they only hold an indirect interest of 7.5 percent. 139 ACTIVE BUSINESS TEST FOR WHOLLY OWNED GROUPS (Clauses 72, 73 and 74(1)) Summary of proposed amendments Under the current rules, taxpayers determining whether a CFC meets the active business test have the option of grouping multiple CFCs together into a test group and working out the ratio of active to passive income based on the consolidated accounts of that group. Amendments are being made to allow companies that are part of wholly owned groups to form test groups which include any interest in a CFC held by a member of the wholly owned group. The same-jurisdiction rule will continue to apply. A further amendment is being made to ensure that wholly owned groups of companies are not able to form over-lapping test groups by including any one CFC in multiple different test groups. Application date The amendments will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Background Taxpayers determining whether their CFCs meet the active business test have the option of grouping multiple CFCs together into a test group and working out the ratio of active to passive income based on the consolidated accounts of the test group. The CFCs must be resident in the same country and the taxpayer must hold an income interest of more than 50 percent in each CFC. It is not uncommon for CFC interests to be held by different members of a wholly owned group. The current rules place unnecessary restrictions on how those groups can access the active business test given that the group effectively has control over all of the CFC holdings. 140 NEGATIVE PASSIVE INCOME AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TEST FOR CFCS (Clauses 74(2), (3) and (4)) Summary of proposed amendments Under the proposed new rule, a negative numerator in the formula defined in section EX 21E(5) will no longer disqualify a CFC from passing the active business test. Instead the negative numerator will be deemed to be zero. Application date The amendments will apply for income years beginning from 1 July 2009. Background The formula for the accounting standards active business test is defined in subsection EX 21E(5) as below: reported passive + added passive – removed passive reported revenue + added revenue – removed revenue Subsection EX 21E(3) provides that if the numerator (the top line of the formula) is negative, the CFC will fail the accounting standards test and will need to perform the default test (EX 21D). CFCs that are demonstrably active CFCs, that is they receive very little, if any, passive income, may fail the accounting standards if they hold foreign currency (that is, currency other than the currency in their home jurisdiction) and that currency loses value, resulting in a foreign exchange loss. Requiring these CFCs to undertake the more demanding default test is considered to be an undue compliance burden. 141 FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ON LIABILITIES (Clauses 74(5), (6), (7), (8) and (9)) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed rules give taxpayers the option to include foreign exchange gains and losses on both financial assets and liabilities when applying the accounting standards test (section EX 21E). Under the current test, the ratio of passive income to active income takes into account foreign exchange gains and losses from financial assets and not from financial liabilities. Taxpayers who are unable to readily distinguish the foreign exchange gains and losses on financial assets from those on liabilities will be able to apply the accounting standards test using a combined amount. Inland Revenue will publish further information in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the legislation on how the term “readily distinguishable” will be interpreted. Application date The amendments will apply for income years from 1 July 2009. Background It is not unusual for companies to produce financial accounts that provide a single rolled up figure of foreign exchange gains and losses from both financial assets and liabilities. The amendment has been proposed to relieve these companies from the additional compliance costs of separating foreign exchange gains from losses. 142 APPORTIONED FUNDING INCOME (Clauses 70 and 71) Summary of proposed amendments The bill relocates the provisions relating to apportioned funding income from section EX 20C (Net attributable CFC income or loss) to section EX 20B (Attributable CFC income). The specific effects of the provisions are unchanged. Taxpayers can exclude a portion of income from financial liabilities (that is, foreign exchange gains on loans taken out by the company) based on the percentage of the company’s assets (the asset fraction) used to generate active income. Moving the provisions into section EX 20B will mean that taxpayers will be able to take this adjustment into account when applying the active business test under section EX 21D. Application date The amendments will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Background Section EX 20B contains the rules defining how a CFC calculates its attributable CFC amount. This is broadly equivalent to the CFC’s gross attributable income. Section EX 20C contains the rules which define what deductions can be taken against that gross attributable income to derive the CFC’s net attributable income or loss. The current subsection EX 20C(3) includes an adjustment which excludes some of the income that was previously included in the gross attributable income (apportioned funding income). As this adjustment is an exclusion of income rather than a deduction against income, it is better situated in section EX 20B. Moving the provision to section EX 20B will also provide more accurate calculations of a CFC’s active-to-passive income ratio as the current rules do not take the adjustment for apportioned funding income into account. 143 Rewrite Advisory Panel remedials 144 145 OVERVIEW The following amendments reflect the recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel following its consideration of submissions on the rewritten Income Tax Acts. The Panel monitors the working of the 2007 Income Tax Act and reviews submissions on what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommends legislative action, when necessary, to correct any problems. 146 REQUIREMENT TO AMEND ASSESSMENTS ON RECOVERY OF DIVIDENDS FROM SHAREHOLDERS (Clauses 10 and 173) Summary of proposed amendment Section CD 40 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section CD 29 of the Income Tax Act 2004 are being amended to state more clearly that, if a company recovers a dividend from its shareholders, section 113B of the Tax Administration Act requires the Commissioner to amend the following:  any income tax assessment and foreign dividend payment assessment of a shareholder to ensure that the dividend and any imputation or foreign dividend payment credit previously attached to the now-recovered dividend are disregarded; and  any assessment of the company made under the imputation rules, the non-resident withholding tax rules, the resident withholding tax rules or under the supplementary dividend rules in subpart LP, again to ensure that the dividend and any imputation or foreign dividend payment credit previously attached to the now-recovered dividend are disregarded. Application date The amendment to section CD 40 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The amendment to section CD 29 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Background A submission was made to the Rewrite Advisory Panel (the Panel) that the cross-reference from section CD 29 of the Income Tax Act 2004 to section 113B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contained an unintended change in outcome. The submission was that after enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004, this cross-reference to section 113B no longer requires the Commissioner to amend an assessment of a company’s imputation credit account on the company recovering a dividend from its shareholders. If a company recovers a dividend from its shareholders and notifies the Commissioner that the dividend has been recovered, the policy intention is that the Commissioner is obliged to amend any assessment to disregard that recovered dividend. The Panel did not agree that an unintended change in the law had occurred because the transitional provisions in section YA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 enable the correct outcome to be determined. However, the Panel considered that the drafting clarity could be improved so that it should be unnecessary to rely on the transitional provisions in section YA 3. This issue also arises in the linkage between section CD 40 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 113B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, resulting in a similar amendment being made to section CD 40. 147 OPTION TO USE FOREIGN TAX BALANCE DATE (Clauses 57 and 176) Summary of proposed amendment Section EG 1 in both the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to ensure that New Zealand-resident taxpayers may elect to include foreign-sourced income (apart from interest, dividends and foreign investment fund income) in the tax year in which the taxpayer’s balance date in the overseas jurisdiction falls. Application date The amendment to section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The amendment to section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 applies from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Background The amendment arises from a submission to the Rewrite Advisory Panel that section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 does not permit a taxpayer to elect to include foreign-sourced income (apart from interest, dividends and foreign investment fund income) in the tax year in which the taxpayer’s balance date in the overseas jurisdiction falls. The submission noted that this election was permitted in the corresponding provision (section EP 1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Panel agreed with the submission and recommended that this unintended change should be corrected retrospectively for section EG 1 in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts. 148 FOREIGN COMPANY – MEANING OF DIRECT CONTROL INTEREST (Clauses 68, 69, 177 and 178) Summary of proposed amendment Section EX 5(1)(c) and (d) in both the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that a direct control interest does not include interests of a person in a foreign company if that person is not entitled to the income or assets and is prohibited from applying the same for their own benefit or interest. Consequentially, section EX 9(1)(c) and (d) of both Acts is also being amended. Application date The amendment to sections EX 5(1) and EX 9(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The amendment to sections EX 5(1) and EX 9(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Background The Rewrite Advisory Panel received a submission that section EX 5 in both the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 contained an unintended change concerning the calculation of control interests to determine whether a foreign company is a controlled foreign company under the international tax rules. Control interests include direct control interests and indirect control interests. Section CG 4(4)(c) and (d) of Income Tax Act 1994 was clear that a direct control interest did not include interests held by a person in a controlled foreign company unless the person would have been entitled to have the income or any value of the net assets dealt with in their interest or on their behalf. The Panel concluded that the provisions were unclear and that the correct outcomes could be obtained only by applying the transitional provisions in section YA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section ZA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Therefore the Panel recommended that:  section EX 5(1) be amended in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts to more clearly reflect the outcome under the corresponding provision in the 1994 Act; and  this amendment apply retrospectively from the first income year to which the 2004 Act applies. In reviewing this submission, it was also noted that the wording in section EX 9(1)(c) and (d) in both the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 mirrored the wording in section EX 5(1)(c) and (d). Therefore, section EX 9 in both Acts is amended in the same manner to ensure the two provisions are consistently worded. 149 COMPARATIVE VALUE METHOD FOR CALCULATING FIF INCOME (Clauses 79 and 179) Summary of proposed amendment Section EX 51 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section EX 44 of the Income Tax Act 2004 are being amended to ensure that expenditure incurred for, or on behalf of the person having the foreign investment fund (FIF) interest is included in the meaning of “cost of a FIF interest” for the purpose of calculating FIF income under the comparative value method. Application date The amendment to section EX 51 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The amendment to section EX 44 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Background A submission made to the Rewrite Advisory Panel identified an unintended change in outcome in the meaning of “cost of a FIF interest” applied for the purpose of calculating FIF income under the comparative value method. The submission was that since the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004, the term “cost” for the comparative value method of calculating FIF income, does not include expenditure incurred for or on behalf of the person having the FIF interest. The policy and legislative history of the provisions show that expenditure incurred on behalf of a person holding a FIF interest is included in the meaning of “cost” for the purpose of calculating FIF income under the comparative value method. For example, if the FIF interest is a shareholding in a foreign company, the cost of an increase in the shareholding made on behalf of the owner of the FIF interest should be included in the value of that cost. The Panel agreed with the submission and recommended that a remedial amendment be made to both the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007, with application from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. 150 LAND TRANSFERRED TO A CLOSE RELATIVE (Clause 86) Summary of proposed amendment Section FC 5(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that if sections CB 9 to CB 11, and CB 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to the land, costs incurred by the executor or administrator on land within 10 years of acquisition of the land by the deceased person are intended to be included in the cost of land in the estate. This ensures that the cost of that land allowed as a deduction from the income under the land sales rule can include costs incurred by the executor or administrator Application date The amendment to section FC 5(3)(b) will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered a submission that in the Income Tax Act 2007, section FC 5 does not include expenditure is incurred by the administrator or executor of the estate as part of the cost of land held in an estate. The submitter states this represents a change from the outcome under the corresponding provisions of the 2004 Act. Section FI 7(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 shows that if the transfer of land is subject to the same land sale rules, the cost of land held by an estate is intended to include expenditure incurred on that land by the administrator or executor of that estate if the expenditure is incurred within 10 years of the acquisition of the land by the deceased person. The Panel agreed with the submission and recommended that the rules for asset transfer on death be retrospectively amended to apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year (the first income year to which the 2007 Act applies). 151 LIABILITY WHEN COMPANY LEAVES CONSOLIDATED GROUP (Clause 99) Summary of proposed amendment Section FM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that the joint and several liability imposed on all members of a consolidated group to satisfy income tax obligations of the consolidated group does not apply to a company that has left the group, in relation to an increase in an income tax obligation of the group made:  for a tax year the exiting company was a member of the group; and  under an amended assessment for that tax year after the exiting company left the group. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background The Panel has considered a submission that when a company exits from a consolidated group, section FM 5 incorrectly results in the exiting company retaining a joint and several liability for increased income tax obligations of the group assessed after the company has left the group. Section HB 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 removed this joint and several liability for a company that has left a consolidated group for increases in income tax obligations of the consolidated group made:  for a tax year the exiting company was a member of the group; and  under an amended assessment for that tax year after the exiting company left the group. The Panel agreed with the submission and recommended that section FM 5(1) be amended retrospectively to apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year (the first income year to which the 2007 Act applies). 152 REVOCATION OF DIRECTORS’ ELECTIONS (Clause 101) Summary of proposed amendment Section HA 31(2) is being amended to ensure that that the director’s notice of revocation should take effect from the later of:  the year in which the notice is received by the Commissioner; or  the effective year stated in the notice. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background The Panel has agreed with a submission that the 2007 Act rewrite of the notice of revocation of director’s election has permitted retrospective revocation of a director’s election for a company to attain qualifying company status. The correct policy is that the director’s notice of revocation should take effect from the later of:  the year in which the notice is received by the Commissioner; or  the effective year stated in the notice. Previously, under the Income Tax Act 2004, the revocation of a qualifying company election was provided for in section HG 3(4) and (5). Section HG 3(5) provided that any revocation took effect on the later of the beginning of the income year the notice of revocation was provided or the beginning of such other income year specified in the notice. The Panel has recommended that section HA 31 be amended retrospectively to the beginning of the 2008–09 income year to correct this unintended change. 153 TREATMENT OF FOREIGN TRUSTS WHEN SETTLOR BECOMES RESIDENT (Clause 103) Summary of proposed amendment Section HC 30(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that if a settlor of a foreign trust becomes resident in New Zealand, and no election is made within 12 months of the settlor becoming resident, the trust continues to be treated as a foreign trust until the end of that 12-month period. Application date The amendment to section HC 30(4) will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered a submission that relates to the taxation consequences when a settlor of a foreign trust becomes resident in New Zealand under section HC 30(4) of the 2007 Act. For foreign trusts, a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of that trust may choose that the trust becomes a complying trust if the settlor becomes resident in New Zealand. This election must be made within 12 months of the settlor becoming resident in New Zealand. The unintended change identified (when compared with section HH 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004) is that if the election is not made within the 12-month period after the settlor becomes resident in New Zealand, section HC 30(4) does not clearly result in that trust continuing, in relation to distributions from the trust, to be treated as:  a foreign trust until the end of that 12-month period; and  as a non-complying trust after the end of that 12-month period. The Panel agrees that, if the settlor of a foreign trust does not make this election within one year of becoming resident in New Zealand, the legislation does not clearly result in that trust continuing to be treated as a foreign trust until the end of that 12-month period. The Panel recommended that:  section HC 30(4)(a) of the 2007 Act be clarified to give the same outcome as its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act; and  the amendment applies retrospectively from the commencement of the 2007 Act. 154 SHORTFALL PENALTIES AND GROUPS OF COMPANIES (Clause 109) Summary of proposed amendment Section IW 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that a group of companies may elect to use a tax loss of one company in the group of companies to satisfy a shortfall penalty assessed against any company within the same group of companies. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered a submission that section IW 1(3) of the 2007 Act does not allow a wholly owned group to use tax losses of one company in the group to pay the shortfall penalties of another company in the group. The submission is that this differs from the outcome given by the corresponding provision, section IG 10(1A), of the Income Tax Act 2004. Section IG 10(1A) of the Income Tax Act 2004 provided for a group of companies to elect a tax loss to satisfy a shortfall penalty assessed against any company within that group of companies. The policy is that a wholly owned group should be able to use tax losses of one company in the group to pay shortfall penalties of another company in the group. The Panel agreed with the submission and recommended that:  the provision be corrected to give the same outcome as the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act; and  this amendment apply retrospectively from the commencement of the 2007 Act. 155 MINOR MAINTENANCE ITEMS The following amendments relate to minor maintenance items referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel as minor maintenance items and retrospectively correct any of the following:  ambiguities;  compilation errors;  cross-references;  drafting consistency, including the consistent use of terminology, definitions, and readers’ aids – for example, the defined terms lists;  grammar;  punctuation;  spelling; or  consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments. Application dates In the table below:  amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 apply retrospectively from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year;  amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 apply retrospectively from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year.

Transitional provisions apply to income derived before the 2015–16 income year if the taxpayer has previously chosen to apply either section EI 7 or section EI 8. The transitional provisions apply to that unallocated income as follows:  If the period of time referred to in those sections has not expired before the start of the 2015–16 income year, that unallocated income is spread evenly over the number of years remaining in that period, beginning with the 2015–16 income year.  If the period of time referred to in those sections has expired before the start of the 2015–16 income year, that unallocated income is allocated to the 2015–16 income year. Application dates The amendment applies to income derived in the 2015–16 and later income years if the taxpayer chooses to apply either section EI 7 or section EI 8. The transitional provisions apply to income derived before the start of the 2015–16 income year if the taxpayer has previously chosen to apply either section EI 7 or section EI 8. Background Sections EI 7 and EI 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide relief to taxpayers who derived income from land, either:  in the nature of fines, premiums or from a payment of goodwill on the grant of a lease (section EI 7); or  as a result of a compulsory disposal of land to the Crown (section EI 8). Before self-assessment legislation enacted in 2001, the corresponding provisions to sections EI 7 and EI 8 in the Income Tax Act 1994 required taxpayers to follow the Commissioner’s practice and spread that income evenly over the number of years referred to in the relevant sections (sections EB 2 and EN 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 160 Following the enactment of self-assessment legislation and subsequent rewriting of the two provisions into the Income Tax Act 2004, consistent with the self-assessment process, it became arguable that the Commissioner’s discretion was replaced with a choice for taxpayers for the spreading of the income. That choice did not require the income to be spread on an even basis. However, the Commissioner’s practice has generally been followed. The proposed amendments to sections EI 7 and EI 8 serve to clarify that the income is to be spread on an even basis over the years referred to in both of those sections. Detailed analysis The policy for sections EI 7 and EI 8 is to provide relief for taxpayers who derived income from land in certain circumstances. The relief granted is to permit the taxpayers to spread the income evenly across the current and certain future income years instead of returning the income in the year it is derived. This relief applies to income derived either:  in the nature of fines, premiums or from a payment of goodwill on the grant of a lease (section EI 7, Income Tax Act 2007); or  from a compulsory disposal of land to the Crown (section EI 8, Income Tax Act 2007). The amendments to sections EI 7 and EI 8 of the 2007 Act clarify that the taxpayer may choose between allocating income to which the sections apply on the default basis (section BD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 refers), or allocate the income to the number of years referred to in sections EI 7 or EI 8, as appropriate. If the taxpayer chooses to spread the income forwards:  income derived from land for payments in the nature of fines, premiums or goodwill on the grant of a lease is allocated evenly over the income year the income is derived in and the five immediately succeeding income years; and  income derived from a compulsory disposal of land to the Crown is allocated evenly over the income year the income is derived in and the three immediately succeeding income years. Both of these amendments apply to income derived in the 2015–16 income year and later income years. Transitional issues The amendments to sections EI 7 and EI 8 apply to income derived from and including the 2015–16 income year. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that all income derived before the 2015–16 income year that has not been fully allocated at the end of the 2014–15 income year is:  allocated evenly to income years from 2015–16 onward, while ensuring that the income spread does not exceed the time period referred to in sections EI 7 or EI 8; and 161  if the period of time referred to in the relevant provision has expired before the start of the 2015–16 income year, to allocate that remaining amount of income to the 2015–16 income year. Transitional provisions apply to sections EI 7 and EI 8 for income derived before the beginning of the 2015–16 income year for which:  the taxpayer has chosen to apply section EI 7 or section EI 8 (as appropriate); and  all of that income has not been allocated to an income year before the beginning of the 2015–16 income year. Example 1: Transitional effect The taxpayer has chosen to spread the income derived in the 2011–12 income year from land for payments in the nature of fines, premiums or goodwill on the grant of a lease on an even basis. The policy intention is that this would result in all of that income being allocated evenly over the 2011–12 to 2016–17 income years. The transitional rule provides that the amount of income derived in the 2011–12 income year that remains unallocated at the start of the 2015–16 income year is spread evenly over the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years. Example 2: Transitional effect A taxpayer has derived income from a premium on the grant of a lease in the 2008–09 income year. Under section EI 7 it was arguable that the taxpayer could choose to allocate all or some of the income to an income year of choice, for example the 2018–19 income year. The policy intention is that the income should have been spread evenly over each of the 2008–09 to 2013–14 income years. The transitional rule provides that the income derived in the 2008–09 income year that remains unallocated at the start of the 2015–16 income year is allocated fully to the 2015–16 income year. This is because the allocation of the income has already been deferred beyond the intended relief period, and therefore should be allocated to the 2015–16 income year. 162 MIXED-USE ASSETS – REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 47, 48 and 49) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes several minor remedial changes to the mixed-use asset rules in subpart DG and section DZ 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date An amendment to the mixed-use asset associated persons rule and amendments to legislative examples apply for the 2013–14 and later income years (that is, the beginning of the mixed-use asset regime). An amendment to the depreciation rollover relief provision applies generally for the 2013–14 and later income years. However, the amendment does not apply in relation to an asset when a shareholder who acquires the asset disposes of it before the date of the bill’s introduction. Key features The proposed amendments fall into three categories and are all consistent with the original policy intent of the rules:  an amendment to the mixed-use asset specific associated persons rule in section DG 6;  minor corrections to several examples in the legislation; and  an amendment to the depreciation rollover relief provision that applies when a company distributes its mixed-use asset to one or more shareholders in the 2013–14 income year. The amendment is to ensure that depreciation recovery income is ultimately crystallised if the shareholder sells the asset for more than its adjusted tax value (taking into account depreciation claimed by the company). Background The mixed-use asset rules were introduced as new subpart DG and related provisions by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. The rules generally apply from the 2013–14 income year to prevent excess deductions where an asset is used partly for business and partly for private purposes. 163 Mixed-use asset specific associated person rule The concept of association is key to the mixed-use asset rules. Section DG 6 modifies the general associated persons rules. Specifically, section DG 6(a) deems a shareholder who holds 5 percent or more of the shares in a company to be associated with that company. It was intended to remove this provision from the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage, however it was not removed before enactment. Accordingly, this bill proposes removing section DG 6(a) with application for the 2013–14 and later income years. Section DG 6(b), which deems a shareholder to be associated with a company if the person's share in the company gives them a right to use a mixed-use asset owned by the company, will remain. Corrections Several examples in the legislation contain minor errors that need to be corrected. These are summarised below with the proposed corrections bolded for emphasis. Section Example and correction Why correction is needed DG 11 Example Holiday Home Ltd holds a holiday home with a rateable value of $200,000. The company has debt of $40,000, with associated interest expenditure of $4,000. Since the debt value is less than the asset value, all the interest expenditure must be apportioned (section DG 11(3)). Boat Ltd has a charter boat whose adjusted tax value cost is $60,000. The company has debt of $100,000, with associated interest expenditure of $10,000. Since the debt value is more than the asset value, the company must apportion interest expenditure of $6,000 (section DG 11(4)-(6)). The formula is $10,000 × ($60,000/$100,000) = $6,000. Under section DG 11(8)(b), the appropriate “asset value” for property other than land is its adjusted tax value, not its cost. DG 16 Example David has a city apartment with a rateable value of $300,000. He rents out the apartment and also uses it privately. He receives market rate rental of $4,000 from non-associates, and $6,000 from associates. David's total allowable expenditure, under sections DG 7, DG 8 and DG 11, is $15,000. The income from associates is exempt under section CW 8B, and is ignored. David therefore has asset income of $4,000 and deductions of $15,000, giving rise to an excess of expenditure over income of $11,000. Since David's income from non-associates is less than 2% of the apartment's rateable value, the excess expenditure of $11,000 $5,000 is denied as a deduction. The amount denied may be allocated to a later income year under section DG 17. The excess expenditure in this example is $11,000 not $5,000. The proposed amendment also provides additional explanation of the calculations to assist readers. DG 17 Example, continued from section DG 16 In the following income year, David derives $10,000 from renting his city apartment at market rates to a non-associate. David's total allowable expenditure, under sections DG 7, DG 8, and DG 11, is $8,000. He also has expenditure of $11,000 $5,000 quarantined from the previous income year. David is able to deduct $2,000 of that quarantined expenditure. The remaining $9,000 $3,000 continues to be quarantined and may be allowed as a deduction for in a later income year. Carry-through from correction of section DG 16. 164 Section Example and correction Why correction is needed DG 18 Example Aircraft Ltd owns an aircraft to which the rules in this subpart apply; the income derived from the asset in the current year is less than 2% of the cost of the aircraft. The company has calculated an outstanding profit balance of $12,000 after the application of section DG 16. Aircraft is 100% owned by Parent Ltd, which has apportioned interest expenditure of $5,000 calculated under section DG 12. Parent has 2 equal shareholders, Alisa who has apportioned interest expenditure of $8,000, and Hamish who has apportioned interest expenditure of $1,000, both calculated under section DG 14. Parent must apply section DG 18 first, and is not required to quarantine any of its interest expenditure; the outstanding profit balance is reduced to $7,000 ($12,000 – $5,000). Alisa’s and Hamish’s share of the outstanding profit balance is $3,500 each ($7,000 $7,500 x 50%). Alisa must quarantine $4,500 of interest expenditure ($8,000 – $3,500); Hamish is not required to quarantine any interest expenditure. Correction of numeric error. DG 19 Example, continued from section DG 18 In the following income year, Aircraft has calculated an outstanding profit balance of $16,000 after the application of section DG 18. Section DG 19 does not apply to Parent or Hamish Alisa because they have no previously quarantined interest expenditure. However, the section does apply to Alisa Hamish because she he has $4,500 of quarantined interest expenditure from the previous year. Alisa’s Hamish’s current year apportioned interest expenditure is $7,000, calculated under section DG 14, and her his share of the outstanding profit balance is $8,000 ($16,000 x 50%). Alisa Hamish is allowed a deduction for $1,000 of previously quarantined expenditure ($8,000 – $7,000). His Her remaining quarantined expenditure is $3,500 ($4,500 – $1,000). Correction of names. DZ 21 Example On 31 March BoatCo has a boat with an acquisition cost of $85,000. on 31 March 2013 which The boat meets the various requirements set out in subpart DG. All the shares in BoatCo are owned by Michelle. The boat has a market value of $75,000, and an adjusted tax value of $55,000. BoatCo transfers the boat to Michelle without payment (which is treated as a dividend of $75,000). For depreciation purposes, BoatCo is treated as disposing of the boat for $55,000, and Michelle is treated as acquiring it for $55,000 $85,000, and having been allowed a deduction of $30,000 for depreciation loss in past income years. Amendments to ensure the example is consistent with the change to section DZ 21 in the bill. Depreciation recovery income for assets transferred in the 2013–14 income year under section DZ 21 There is a one year transitional period (2013–14 income year) in which companies that own mixed-use assets can transfer those assets to their shareholders without triggering depreciation recovery income (this is referred to as “rollover relief”). The rollover relief provision is contained in section DZ 21. Section DZ 21(2) treats the transfer as if it were a disposal and acquisition for an amount equal to the adjusted tax value of the asset on the date of the transfer. 165 This means that there is no depreciation recovery income to the company when it transfers the asset to its shareholder(s) because the consideration deemed to have been received is the same as the asset’s adjusted tax value. If the shareholder later sells the asset for more than its adjusted tax value, the policy intention is that depreciation recovery income will be crystallised at this point. To ensure this policy objective is achieved the bill proposes to treat the shareholder as stepping into the shoes of the company for depreciation purposes – that is, by having:  acquired the asset on the date on which the company acquired it for an amount equal to the amount the company paid to acquire it;  used the asset for the purposes for which the company used it;  used the depreciation method used by the company in relation to the asset; and  been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss that the company has been allowed since the company’s acquisition of the asset. As well as including all depreciation deductions the company has previously been allowed in the depreciation recovery calculation, this amendment also ensures that any change in use or depreciation method by the shareholder is captured and the shareholder has the correct depreciation cost base. 166 LOSS GROUPING CONTINGENT ON GROUP LOSS COMPANY SATISFYING ITS LIABILITIES FOR DEDUCTIBLE EXPENDITURE (Clauses 14, and 15(2), (3)) Summary of proposed amendment Changes are being made to the loss grouping rules to correct an unintended consequence of the rewrite of the Income Tax Acts. The bill proposes a number of amendments to confirm the correct policy intent. Key features Section CG 2 no longer applies to a group loss company if:  the group loss company has previously made a tax loss available to another company in the same group of companies under the loss grouping rules; and  the group loss company in the same group of companies as the group profit company has unsatisfied liabilities for deductible expenditure included in those past tax losses made available under the loss grouping rules; and  the group loss company in the same group of companies is liquidated; or  either the group profit company or the group loss company has left the group and for both cases, the group loss company is insolvent, in receivership or in liquidation at that time. Instead, new sections CG 2C and CG 2D will apply in these circumstances. These amendments confirm the long standing policy that the grouping of tax under the loss grouping rules is contingent on the group loss company fully satisfying its liabilities relating to past deductible expenditure included in the group loss company’s tax losses. If the sections apply, the group profit company derives income equal to the amount of certain unsatisfied liabilities of the group loss company. New section CG 2C will apply if the group loss company has been struck off the register of companies. New section CG 2D will apply if the profit company and the group loss company are no longer part of the same group of companies and:  the group profit company has received the benefit of group tax losses from the group loss company; and  at the time either company leaves the group, the group loss company is insolvent, in receivership or has been placed in liquidation (but not yet struck off the register of companies). 167 Application date New sections CG 2C and CG 2D will apply from the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Background Since the enactment of section 191(7B) of the Income Tax Act 1976, the grouping of tax losses has been contingent on the group loss company fully satisfying its liabilities for deductible expenditure included in its tax losses made available to another company in the same group of companies. This policy was given effect in the Income Tax Act 1994 by the interaction of sections CE 4, IE 1(4) and IG 2(9) which permitted the Commissioner to amend an assessment of a group profit company to reduce the amount of grouped tax losses to the extent the group loss company had not satisfied all liabilities giving rise to deductions included in the grouped tax losses. The effect of the interaction of the predecessors of these three rules was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in the case of Hotdip Galvanisers (Christchurch) Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,337. These three provisions from the Income Tax Act 1994 were rewritten into section CG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and included a policy change relating to the timing of the recovery of amounts relating to remitted or cancelled debts for past deductible expenditure. Section CG 2 was re-enacted unamended into the Income Tax Act 2007. Under current section CG 2, a remitted or cancelled debt for past deductible expenditure is treated as income derived in the year the debt is remitted (for example, on the company being struck off or liquidated). This policy change was to better align the adjustment (for remitted or cancelled liabilities relating to past deductible expenditure) with self-assessment by eliminating the need to amend past assessments. However, this policy change has also resulted in in an unintended consequence for the loss grouping rules. The unintended consequence is that section CG 2 does not give effect to the policy that the benefit of the loss grouping rules is contingent upon the group loss company fully satisfying its liabilities for past deductible expenditure included in its tax losses. Detailed analysis Reduction in benefit of group tax losses under the Income Tax Act 1994 The interaction of sections IG 2(9), IE 1(4) and CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 permitted the Commissioner to amend an assessment of a group profit company to reduce the amount of losses made available under the loss grouping rules. This amended assessment of a group profit company could be made for any income year – it was not limited by the four- year time bar that normally applies to income tax assessments. However, the reduction in the benefit of grouped tax losses was limited to the amount of remitted or cancelled debts of the group loss company. 168 The decision of Hotdip Galvanisers (Christchurch) Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,337, the Court of Appeal confirmed that, under the 1976 Act’s corresponding provision to section IG 2(9) of the 1994 Act:  the Commissioner was entitled to amend an assessment of a group profit company in a group that received the benefit of tax losses from a group loss company, if the group loss company’s deductible expenditure forming part of the loss offsets was remitted or cancelled; and  the provision did not require the Commissioner to first re-assess the group loss company for the remission adjustment; and  the Commissioner was not limited by the four-year time bar that normally applies to income tax assessments. Policy change in Income Tax Act 2004 In rewriting sections CE 4 and IE 1(4)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 into section CG 2 of the Income Tax 2004, it was considered desirable to place the timing of the effect of the remission on a basis consistent with self-assessment. This policy change resulted in the timing the effect of the remission on the income tax liability to the year of remission in contrast to the amendment of previous years’ assessments under the former law. Under the 2004 Act and the 2007 Act, remitted or cancelled debts for past deductible expenditure are treated as income derived in the year the debt is remitted (for example, on the company being struck off or liquidated). Unintended consequence The remission income rule in the 2004 and 2007 Acts applies only to the taxpayer that had incurred the debt. While this rule technically applies to a group loss company that has been liquidated, it has no consequence for a company that has been struck off the register of companies. A company struck off the register does not exist, and no valid assessment for tax on income arising under section CG 2 can be made (absent the company being restored to the register). Under current law, section CG 2 does not apply to a group profit company if a group loss company cannot be assessed for remission income. This has resulted in the unintended consequence that there is no longer a legislative provision to reduce the benefit of past grouped tax losses from group profit companies if debts of the group loss company are remitted or cancelled. The new sections CG 2C and CG 2D give effect to the policy that the retention of the benefits of loss grouping is contingent on the group loss company:  fully satisfying its liabilities for deductible expenditure included in a net loss; and  that net loss has been included in a tax loss subsequently made available under the loss grouping rules to another company in the same group of companies. 169 Group loss company going into liquidation Section CG 2C applies to a group profit company in a group of companies if:  the group profit company has received the benefit of tax losses under the loss grouping rules from a group loss company in the same group of companies;  the group loss company is removed from the register of companies (and not subsequently restored to the register);  the group profit company and the group loss company are in the same group of companies immediately prior to the removal of the group loss company from the register of companies;  at the time the company is removed from the register of companies, the group loss company has unsatisfied liabilities for past deductible expenditure relating to tax losses made available to the group profit company under the loss grouping rules; and  the removal of the group loss company from the register of companies occurs after the tax loss has been made available to another company under the loss grouping rules. On removal from the register of companies, there is no longer a company in existence to meet those unpaid unsatisfied debts. In the absence of this amendment section, section CG 2 would treat the group loss company as deriving income equal to the amount of the unsatisfied liability for prior deductible expenditure, but no valid assessment could be made for income tax on this income without restoring the company to the register. Therefore, section CG 2 does not apply and instead section CG 2C will apply. The section treats the group profit company as deriving income equal to the remitted or cancelled liability (due to the operation of the Companies Act 1993) for deductible expenditure incurred by the group loss company. That income is treated as derived on the day the group loss company is removed from the register of companies. The amendment in section CG 2C ensures that the 2007 Act will have the same effect as the interaction of sections CE 4, IE 4 and IG 2(9) of the Income Tax Act 1994, provided that the group loss company and the group profit company are in the same group of companies immediately prior to the group loss company being removed from the register of companies. New section CG 2C will not apply to a debt arising under a financial arrangement, consistent with section CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Group loss company or group profit company leaving the group A number of commercial considerations mitigate against section CG 2C applying to a group profit company if the group profit company and the group loss company are not in the same group of companies when the group loss company is removed from the register of companies. 170 These considerations include:  The management of the affairs of the group loss company would differ from the management of the affairs of the group profit company. A decision to remove the group loss company from the register of companies by the new owners need not consider the implications for that group profit company given they are no longer part of the same group of companies.  A tax obligation for a company arising from the liquidation of a group loss company that is no longer part of the same group as the group profit company (and beyond the management of the group’s affairs) can impact adversely on the group profit company’s balance sheet, and also potentially affect existing financing arrangements. However, if a group loss company is insolvent, when either it or a group profit company exits the group, it can be assumed that management would be aware at that time:  if an insolvent group loss company has not satisfied its debts giving rise to tax losses transferred under the loss grouping rules; and  there is a strong risk that the insolvent loss group company might not subsequently satisfy its debt obligations for past deductible expenditure included in the tax losses of the group loss company. Under new section CG 2D the profit company must forfeit the benefit of past grouped tax losses to the extent the insolvent loss group company has unsatisfied liabilities for past deductible expenditure. However, if the group loss company satisfies its unpaid debts for past deductible expenditure before the exit time without giving a preference to one creditor over another, section CG 2D would not apply. New section CG 2D will not apply to a debt arising under a financial arrangement, consistent with section CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Voidable preference Under new section CG 2D, either the profit company will forfeit some or all of the benefit of past grouped tax losses or the group loss company will repay the relevant debts. However, because solvency is measured at a point in time, an issue arises under the voidable preference rules in the Companies Act 1993. It is possible for a payment by the group loss company to satisfy an unpaid liability for past deductible expenditure to be a voidable preference under the Companies Act 1993. If the payment is a voidable transaction (a creditor is repaid in preference to other creditors), a liquidator could recover the payment, resulting in the liability being reinstated. The Commissioner has the discretion to ignore payments of the group loss company if those payments could constitute a voidable transaction under the Companies Act 1993. If the Commissioner exercises this discretion, an amended assessment will be made for the group profit company for income derived under new section CG 2D. 171 REMITTED AMOUNTS ON DISCHARGE FROM BANKRUPTCY (Clauses 14 and 15(1)) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment provides that section CG 2 will not apply to a bankrupt on discharge from bankruptcy. At present, section CG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies to a person discharged from bankruptcy and can result in a discharged bankrupt deriving assessable income on the full amount of remitted debts on discharge (remission income). This conflicts with the “fresh start” principles of insolvency law on discharge from bankruptcy. New section CG 2B applies to a person discharged from bankruptcy. This new provision provides for remission income sufficient to reduce the benefit of past deductions to the extent liabilities incurred for those deductions are remitted or cancelled. Instead of section CG 2 applying to debts remitted on discharge from bankruptcy, new section CG 2B will apply to limit the remission income from those debts to the lesser of:  the total amount of debt remitted on discharge from bankruptcy that relates to past deductible expenditure; and  the bankrupt’s loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the discharge from bankruptcy after taking into account any reduction in the loss balance made by the Commissioner under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date The amendment applies from the commencement of the amending Act. Background On 3 October 2011, the Minister of Revenue issued a press release calling for submissions on some remedial items. One of those remedial items related to the Commissioner’s powers, under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, relating to a taxpayer in bankruptcy, to:  write off uncollectible amounts of tax owing by the bankrupt; and  make related consequential adjustments to the taxpayer’s tax losses carried forward (“the loss balance”). Submissions on this remedial item raised two issues relating to the remission of most debts when a bankrupt is discharged from bankruptcy:  Insolvency law remits most debts of a bankrupt at the time of discharge. One issue was whether it was appropriate for section CG 2 to recover all of the past deductions (as remission income of the taxpayer) if debts incurred for those past deductions: a) remained unpaid on the taxpayer being adjudged bankrupt; and b) were subsequently remitted on discharge from bankruptcy. 172  It was unclear whether remission income under section CG 2 is taken into account in the calculation of the bankrupt’s taxable income before or after being discharged from bankruptcy. This uncertainty potentially impacts on the Commissioner’s powers to write off remission income arising on discharge from bankruptcy against a loss balance of the bankrupt. Detailed analysis Section CG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 was re-enacted without change from the Income Tax Act 2004. Section CG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004 corresponded to sections CE 4 and IE 1(4)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section CG 2 applies to a person:  who has been allowed a deduction for an amount the person is liable to pay;  that liability is later remitted or cancelled (but not if the remission or cancellation is a dividend); and  the financial arrangement rules do not require a base price adjustment to be made for that remission or cancellation. The potential application of section CG 2 to a bankrupt on discharge from bankruptcy is an unintended consequence arising from a policy change made in rewriting section CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This policy change related to the timing of income from debt remissions to make the operation of the debt remission rule more consistent with self- assessment principles. Effect of law under the Income Tax Act 1994 Before the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004, a debt remission of this nature would have resulted in the Commissioner amending the income tax assessment for the tax year in which the deduction was incurred (section CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994). This amended assessment could be made for any income year – it was not limited by the four- year time-bar that normally applies to the amendment of income tax assessments. However, the amount of the amended assessment to reduce past tax losses was limited to the amount of remitted or cancelled debts of the bankrupt. Under the Income Tax Act 1994, an amended assessment of the income tax liability for an earlier income year by the Commissioner would have resulted in either:  a reduction in the person’s loss balance at the end of that earlier tax year; or  an increased income tax liability being assessed for that earlier tax year. Policy change in Income Tax Act 2004 In rewriting section CE 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 as section CG 2 of the Income Tax 2004, it was considered desirable to place the timing of the effect of the remission on a basis consistent with self-assessment. This policy change resulted in the timing the effect of the remission in the year of remission in contrast to the amendment of previous years’ assessments under the former law. 173 Amendment to section CG 2, and new section CG 2B The application of section CG 2 to a bankrupt on discharge from bankruptcy conflicts with the “fresh start” policy of insolvency law for a discharged bankrupt. The amendment to section CG 2 ensures that it does not apply on discharge from bankruptcy. Instead, the new section CG 2B is to apply to a person discharged from bankruptcy. If a person discharged from bankruptcy does not have a loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the year in which the discharge occurs, that person will not have remission income under either of section CG 2 or section CG 2B. If a person discharged from bankruptcy has a loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the year in which the discharge occurs, section CG 2 does not apply but section CG 2B applies to provide that the person has income equal to the lesser of:  the total amount of debts remitted which relate to past deductions; and  the person’s loss balance at the end of the tax year preceding the year of discharge (after taking into account any reduction in that loss balance by the Commissioner under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Income derived under section CG 2B is treated as derived on the first day of the income year in which the person is discharged from bankruptcy. This income is included in the calculation of the person’s taxable income for the year of discharge:  effectively reducing the benefit of the loss balance of the taxpayer brought forward from the previous year; and  ensuring that a discharged bankrupt does not have an income tax liability for debts discharged in bankruptcy. 174 SERIOUS HARDSHIP (Clauses 128(4) and 153 to 157) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are made being made to allow the Commissioner, in appropriate circumstances, to bankrupt taxpayers, who are in serious hardship and to ensure the reasons why the debt arose is not a factor in determining whether the taxpayer is in serious hardship. These amendments ensure that the legislation is consistent with Inland Revenue’s current operational practice. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The bill will clarify the meaning of “serious hardship” and ensure that factors that give rise to the taxpayer not being able to pay the outstanding tax are not taken into account when determining whether or not the taxpayer is in serious hardship. The bill also clarifies that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can, in appropriate circumstances, bankrupt taxpayers, when they are in serious hardship. Background In 2003, the debt and hardship rules were introduced. Under the rules the Commissioner must maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer and deal with cases in an efficient manner. However, the Commissioner may not recover to the extent that recovery is an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources or it would place a taxpayer, who is a natural person (individual), in serious hardship. The rules provide incentives for taxpayers who are having problems paying their tax to contact Inland Revenue and discuss the options available to them. The best option is always payment of the full amount on or before the due date. If that is not possible, taxpayers can enter an instalment arrangement and pay the debt off over time. If the debt cannot be paid off over time, the Commissioner has a discretion under which she can write off tax. In addition, the Commissioner must write off the tax that is not collected if the taxpayer is bankrupted, liquidated or their estate has been distributed. The Commissioner’s practice is to bankrupt taxpayers who cannot pay in appropriate circumstances – for example, when it is considered the write-off would have an adverse effect on taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. Following a review of the legislation, an alternative view of the rules has been raised which has two related implications. 175 The first implication is that bankruptcy is a recovery action and at the point that any further recovery action would cause serious hardship, bankruptcy, along with any other recovery action, is prohibited. Therefore, the Commissioner could not bankrupt a taxpayer when the taxpayer is facing serious hardship. Inland Revenue’s current view is that bankruptcy does not place or cause a taxpayer to be in serious hardship. This is consistent with the policy intent; the Official Assignee takes over the bankrupt’s affairs and ensures they do not suffer serious hardship. The second implication arises from the additional view that in determining whether a taxpayer is in serious hardship, Inland Revenue must first consider how the debt arose. For example, if the taxpayer’s debt arose from the taxpayer enjoying goods of an expensive nature, the taxpayer would not be in serious hardship and Inland Revenue could recover the debt. This view is at odds with the way in which Inland Revenue applies the debt and hardship rules and can result in adverse outcomes for taxpayers. The view is also inconsistent with the policy intention of the rules which is to protect taxpayers from being placed in serious hardship as a result of recovery actions taken by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue’s current approach is that when a taxpayer applies for financial relief, Inland Revenue determines whether the taxpayer can pay the debt, or whether paying part or all of the debt would place the taxpayer in serious hardship. The cause of the outstanding tax is not taken into account in determining serious hardship as the alternative would require. If paying the debt would place the taxpayer in serious hardship, Inland Revenue then considers how best to deal with the debt, and in some cases writes off the debt. In some cases the taxpayer would be bankrupted and in other cases the debt would remain. In deciding which action to take, Inland Revenue will at this step consider how the debt arose and the need to maintain the integrity of the tax system. 176 UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION (Clause 146) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment to the unacceptable tax position penalty will clarify that the penalty does not apply to shortfalls that arise in respect of GST and withholding-type taxes. That is, the unacceptable tax position penalty will only apply to income tax shortfalls. The amendment clarifies an amendment made in 2007. Application date The amendment applies retrospectively to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2008 (the application date of the 2007 amendment). Key features The amendment clarifies that the tax types listed in section RA 1 of the Income Tax 2007 are removed from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty so that the penalty will apply only to tax positions relating to income tax. Background A tax shortfall is the difference between a taxpayer’s correct tax liability calculated under the legislation and the position a taxpayer took in their tax return. There are five categories of shortfall penalty – ranging from not taking reasonable care (when the penalty is 20 percent of the tax shortfall) to evasion or a similar act (when the penalty is 150 percent of the tax shortfall). The appropriate penalty is assessed when a required standard is breached – for example, if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care, the penalty for not taking reasonable care is assessed. One of the shortfall penalties is the unacceptable tax position penalty. An “unacceptable tax position” is a tax position that, if viewed objectively, fails to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. This does not mean that the taxpayer’s tax position must be the better view or be more than likely the correct view, but rather that the position is “about as likely as not to be correct”. The aim of the shortfall penalty is to encourage taxpayers to take tax positions that are correct in terms of the law. A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 20% if the taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position in relation to income tax, and the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position is more than both:  $50,000; and  1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. 177 A change to the legislation in 2003 meant the unacceptable tax position penalty potentially applied to all tax shortfalls over the thresholds, including cases when the tax shortfall arose from a mistake in the facts or when an unacceptable tax position was taken and immediately corrected. Taxpayers and tax agents noted that the penalty was having an adverse effect on taxpayer behaviour, resulting in taxpayers being less inclined to make voluntary disclosures. In 2006 a short-term solution was put in place which gave Inland Revenue a discretion not to impose the penalty in specific circumstances. In 2007 the discretion was repealed, the threshold for imposition of the penalty was increased and the scope of the penalty was limited to income tax – that is, the penalty was no longer to be imposed on GST or withholding tax shortfalls. At the same time, the reduction given for voluntary disclosures made before a taxpayer is notified of a pending audit or investigation when the shortfall arose from the taxpayer not taking reasonable care, or from an unacceptable tax position, increased from 75% to 100%. Following a review of the legislation it has been determined that the 2007 amendment does not achieve the desired policy outcome. The 2007 amendment inserted the words “in relation to income tax” in section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, section RA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 deems the tax types listed in section RA 1 to be income tax and therefore subject to the unacceptable tax position penalty. These taxes include PAYE, fringe benefit tax and non-resident withholding tax. The intention of the 2007 amendment was clear and taxpayers expected that following the amendment the unacceptable tax position penalty would only apply to tax shortfalls that arose in annual income tax returns. Inland Revenue’s practice to date has been to apply the penalty only to tax shortfalls that arise in annual income tax returns. 178 CLARIFICATION OF NEW DUE DATE FOR PAYMENT OF TAX (Clause 149) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments clarify that a new due date is not set when the Commissioner makes a systems-generated default assessment, and that when a taxpayer files a return following a systems-generated default assessment, a new due date is set for the resulting tax liability. Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively from 6 October 2009 (which was the application date of the 2009 amendment). Key features The bill proposes a clarification to section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that a new due date is not set when the Commissioner makes a systems generated default assessment. The bill will also clarify that when a taxpayer files a return following a systems generated default assessment, a new due date is set for the resulting tax liability. Background If the Commissioner makes an assessment or amends and increases an assessment, a new due date is set for the tax assessed. Before an amendment in 2007 a new due date was only required when the Commissioner increased an assessment. This had the effect of creating an incentive for taxpayers who considered they did not have a tax liability to file a “nil return”. This meant that if the Commissioner determined at a later date that the taxpayer did have a tax liability, a new due date would be set for the tax assessed by the Commissioner. In the absence of the “nil return”, the taxpayer would be liable for use-of- money interest and late payment penalties from the original due date and, when the taxpayer had breached a required standard of behaviour, shortfall penalties. There was a concern that the penalty rules were discouraging taxpayers from complying voluntarily with their tax obligations, as the imposition of both use-of-money interest and late payment penalties overly penalised taxpayers. Also, the application of late payment penalties when the taxpayer considered they did not have a tax liability could be seen as inappropriate. In some cases the late payment penalty was effectively being used as a penalty for the taxpayer not filing their return on time. 179 In 2007 an amendment was made under which Inland Revenue is required to set a new due date when it makes an assessment or increases an assessment. In 2009 the provision was again amended. The aim of this amendment was to remove the requirement to set a new due date when Inland Revenue makes a systems-generated default assessment. More recently, concerns have been raised that the 2009 amendment does not achieve the desired policy outcome. In particular, it has been found that when a taxpayer files a return following a default assessment, a new due date is only set when the tax assessed by the taxpayer is more than the default assessment and the new due date only applies to the difference. This is contrary to the policy intent which is that the late payment penalty is a penalty imposed when the taxpayer knows they have a tax liability and they do not pay on time. Default assessments are made by the Commissioner under section 106 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. There are a number of different circumstances when the Commissioner can issue a default assessment, for example, when a return has not been made or following an audit or investigation when the Commissioner is not satisfied with the return filed by the taxpayer. The 2009 amendment which removed the requirement to set a new due date when Inland Revenue makes a default assessment was aimed at systems-generated default assessments, assessments generated by Inland Revenue’s FIRST system to encourage the taxpayer to file an outstanding return. It was not aimed at assessments made by the Commissioner following an audit. It was considered appropriate to impose late payment penalties from the original due date because in the case of systems-generated default assessments the assessment is issued because there is a concern about the taxpayer’s non-compliance. 180 REFERENCES TO LOSS ATTRIBUTING QUALIFYING COMPANIES (Clauses 147 and 148) Summary of proposed amendment In 2010 the loss attributing qualifying company rules were repealed and the look-through company rules introduced. The promoter penalty legislation still refers to “loss attributing qualifying companies” when it should refer to “look-through companies”. The bill proposes that the references in the promoter (section 141EB) penalty legislation which refer to loss attributing qualifying companies be updated to refer to look-through companies, and the penalty relief provision for loss attributing qualifying companies be repealed. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2011 (the date from which the look-through company rules apply). 181 WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS (Clauses 114 to 116) Summary of proposed amendments Additional items are proposed to be added to the list of payments that are excluded from the definition of family scheme income in relation to the Working for Families scheme (WFF) under section MB 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. These items are windfall gains or payments of a capital nature. The change reflects that WFF is income-tested but not asset- tested. There are also two remedial changes to clarify wording and correct errors in section MB 1(5C) relating to depreciation losses in earlier years, and section MB 7B(2) concerning employment benefits. Application dates The amendments to section MB 13(2) apply for the 2015–16 and later income years. The amendments to section MB 1(5C) apply from 1 April 2011. The amendments to section MB 7B(2) apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Changes to the rules in subpart MB of the Income Tax Act 2007 describing the definition of family scheme income are proposed. The main change will add the following items to the list of payments that are excluded from the “other payments” rule in section MB 13:  repayment of a loan;  repayment of a mistaken or misdirected payment;  refund of a payment (including tax, student loan and child support refunds resulting from an overpayment);  payment from the person’s ownership of an investment activity or business, where it is received on capital account, and the payment is not a loan and is not a payment by a trustee;  payment of an inheritance from a deceased person’s estate;  money won from gambling or a New Zealand lottery. The other changes in subpart MB will:  correct a cross-reference error in section MB 1(5C)  amend section MB 1(5C) to cover depreciation loss for a building in an investment activity, to mirror earlier changes made to section MB 3 to ignore net losses from investment activities; and 182  correct a drafting error in section MB 7B(2)(b) to refer to a “benefit” instead of a “fringe benefit”. Background WFF tax credits are provided to the principal caregiver of dependent children based, among other things, on their level of family scheme income for a tax year. The tax credits are abated when family scheme income exceeds $36,350 at a rate of 21.25 cents per dollar. Families that choose instalment payments of tax credits throughout the year are required to estimate their family scheme income and are subject to an end-of-year reconciliation. Alternatively, families can apply for an end-of-year lump sum payment. The family scheme income provisions have been amended a number of times over the last decade, including as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. The definition of “family scheme income” was broadened as part of Budget 2010, with effect from 1 April 2011. This included a new provision for other payments a family may receive to replace lost income or to meet their usual living expenses. The broader definition is intended to improve the fairness and integrity of Working for Families tax credits by, for example, countering arrangements that have the effect of inflating entitlements beyond what people’s true economic circumstances justify. In 2012 the Government agreed that employer-provided vouchers and other short-term charge facilities should also be included in family scheme income. This change comes into effect from 1 April 2014. The definition of “family scheme income” is also used, with some adjustments, for determining eligibility for some people applying for student allowances and the community services card. The income definition will also be the basis for assessing child support in the future. A similar definition is used for student loan repayments. Detailed analysis Current sections MB 1 to MB 12 list specific amounts that are included in family scheme income. Section MB 13(1) includes other payments in the definition of family scheme income where the payment is paid or provided to the person from any source and used by the person to:  replace lost or diminished income of the person or the person’s family; or  meet usual living expenses of the person or the person’s family. Current section MB 13(1) is broadly drafted. Section MB 13(2) then excludes payments from MB 13(1) where the payment is not intended to form part of family scheme income. An example is when a payment is already included in family scheme income under sections MB 1 to MB 12, or when it is a government payment and treated as exempt income for tax and welfare purposes. 183 The WFF tax credits are income-tested on family income. While it has a broad definition of income, it is not the policy intent for the tax credit to be asset-tested. For example, the use of money or cash assets from a person’s bank account for usual living expenses is not intended to be included in family scheme income, whereas interest earned on savings is included. Similarly, the family scheme income definition is not intended to capture the realisation of assets into cash, other than the extent to which it is assessable income under the Income Tax Act. Section MB 13(2)(b) excludes a payment where it is the proceeds of the disposal of property and not assessable income of the person disposing of the property. This is intended to prevent, for example, the proceeds from the sale of a car, when the proceeds are used to meet usual living expenses, from being included in family scheme income. The exception is when sales proceeds are assessable income for that person. There are payments not covered by section MB 13(2)(b) but which are similar in nature to capital or they relate to a change in how assets are held or realised which should be excluded. It has also not been the policy intention to include windfall gains in family scheme income, to the extent that they are not assessable income for the person. For families who estimate their family scheme income upfront, it would not be possible to accurately estimate windfall gains, leading to end-of-year debts. It is also unlikely that the family would rely on windfall gains to meet the family’s usual living expenses. The proposed list of items to be excluded under section MB 13(2) can be technically caught by the wording of section MB 13(1) but do not come within the policy intent of that provision. They are:  Repayment of a loan – this covers the repayment of the principal of the loan. Interest payable on the loan is assessable income and is already included in family scheme income under another provision.  Repayment of a mistaken or misdirected payment – this is not additional money for the person or their family.  Refund of a payment (including tax, student loan and child support refunds resulting from an overpayment).  Payment of an inheritance from a deceased person’s estate.  Money won from gambling or a New Zealand lottery – these windfall gains are not intended to be caught by the “other payments” rule. The bill also proposes to include in the list of excluded items a payment from the person’s ownership of an investment activity or business, where it is received on capital account, and the payment is not a loan and is not a payment by a trustee. Dividends, shareholder salary, interest, or rent from a business or investment activity are not received on capital account and are already included under other provisions in subsection MB. A payment from a person’s investment or business received on capital account is equivalent to the withdrawal of funds from a savings account and should likewise not be included in family scheme income. The person and their family are not “better off” from receiving the payment, rather they are converting their assets into cash. Often the payment on capital account will be referred to as drawings, although some drawings may be a loan or income that has been incorrectly labelled. A loan from a business or investment to the person will be excluded under section MB 13(2)(a) if it is on the basis of ordinary commercial terms and conditions. 184 CHILD SUPPORT REMEDIALS (Clauses 181 to 191) Summary of proposed amendments A number of changes are proposed to ensure the policy objectives of the child support reform are achieved. The changes clarify wording, correct errors, make further consequential changes and make minor improvements to simplify the child support scheme. Application date The majority of the amendments will apply from 1 April 2014. One amendment will apply from the day of Royal assent. Background Under the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 a number of changes were made concerning child support terms – for example, the “custodial parent” of the qualifying child is now referred to as the “receiving carer”. The Child Support Amendment Act will also amend, from 1 April 2014, the way a formula assessment of child support is determined and make improvements to the operation of the child support scheme. The amendments include:  decreasing the threshold for recognised shared care;  the Commissioner determining who is a liable parent and who is a receiving carer of the qualifying child based on the income and care details of both parents;  defining who is a non-parent receiving carer;  changes to how income is measured and estimated for assessment purposes; and  how child support is distributed. Key features The bill proposes the following additional remedial changes to the Child Support Act 1991:  removing the definition of “election period” in the interpretation section as it has been replaced by a new definition in new section 40AA;  clarifying in new section 9(1)(c) that a beneficiary is not required to apply for child support if they are already a receiving carer; 185  clarify that notices of election in new section 40(1) cannot be given after the end of the child support year to which the election relates;  correcting the ordering of provisions in new section 44 relating to the end-of-year reconciliation of an estimate of income to ensure the correct policy outcome is achieved;  consequential changes to section 65 in light of the new rules for determining liable parents and receiving carers, and to prevent a voluntary agreement and a formula assessment for a child being in force simultaneously;  repealing new section 92(3A) as the provision is no longer required;  amending section 98 to align with new section 32 on the method for distributing the minimum annual amount of child support when there is more than one receiving carer;  ensure that a non-parent receiving carer who has been granted a Sole Parent Support payment under the Social Security Act 1964 cannot waiver the right to collect child support from a liable parent; and  further consequential amendments reflecting the changes in child support terminology. 186 TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994: CROSS-REFERENCES TO SECTIONS 108 AND 109 (Clauses 135 to 145) Summary of proposed amendment Sections 93(2)(b), 94(2)(b), (c), 95(2)(b), 97(3)(a), 97B(3)(a), 98(2)(a), 98B(3)(a), 99(2)(a), (b), 100(3)(b), 101(2)(a) and 101B(2)(a) are being amended to confirm that:  the Commissioner cannot amend an earlier assessment made under any of those provisions outside the time-bar period; and  section 109 applies in relation to these provisions. These amendments correct cross-referencing to sections 108 and 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 October 1996. Background In a recent court decision (Vinelight Nominees Limited v CIR \[2012\] NZHC 3306), Peters J identified a remedial issue within section 99 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, concerning the relationship of section 99 to section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Peters J stated: \[100\] There is an obvious difficulty with s 99(2)(a), because s 108(1) does not include the words “income tax for any year”. The judge’s comments in the Vinelight decision highlight a technical problem that the time bar may not apply to resident withholding tax (RWT) assessments. The words identified by Peters J, “income tax for any income year”, were repealed in 1996 as part of the reforms of the disputes resolution legislation. Section 99 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was not updated at that time to reflect the new wording in section 108(1). The same cross- referencing problem arises in a number of provisions from section 93 to section 101B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Similar drafting issues arise from the use of the term “taxpayer” in a number of provisions from section 93 to section 101B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that refer to section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is because the term “taxpayer” no longer appears in section 109. 187 Section 99 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables the Commissioner to assess a person for RWT if the Commissioner considers that person has not paid the correct amount of RWT. Under the RWT rules, a person paying resident withholding income is required to withhold RWT and pay to the Commissioner the amount of RWT withheld on a periodic basis. The reference in section 99(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to section 108(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is necessary to ensure that the Commissioner cannot amend an earlier RWT assessment outside the time-bar period. Peters J’s comments in the Vinelight decision highlight a technical problem that the time bar may not apply to RWT assessments. Section 108(1) imposes a time limit (time bar) on the Commissioner’s power to amend an earlier assessment of income tax. That time-bar period is four years after the end of the tax year in which the earlier assessment was made. Section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that disputable decisions are treated as correct unless a challenge is lodged against that decision, but the provision no longer uses the word “taxpayer”. Disputable decisions include assessments by the Commissioner and most decisions of the Commissioner in relation to the application of a tax law to a taxpayer’s circumstances. Again, this drafting issue results from these provisions not being updated correctly in 1996 to reflect the amended wording in section 109. 188 TRUSTS THAT ARE LOCAL AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES (Clauses 25 and 26) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to section CW 38 and CW 39 clarify that an amount derived by a trustee for a local authority or a public authority constituted as a trust:  does not enjoy the exempt income status under sections CW 38 or CW 39 if that amount is retained and included in trustee income of the trustee; and  is exempt income if that amount is distributed to a beneficiary that itself is exempt from income tax in relation to that distribution. Application date The amendment applies from the commencement of the amending Act. Background The Income Tax Act 2007 currently exempts from tax any amount derived by a local authority and a public authority other than “an amount received in trust”. The exact meaning of these words is unclear and their interpretation has caused difficulty for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The policy is that this exemption should not extend to amounts that a local authority receives as a trustee. However, if the trustee receives an amount (other than as trustee for a beneficiary which itself enjoys exempt income status).

The current rules for taxing New Zealand residents on their foreign superannuation are complex and can be difficult for taxpayers to understand. In some cases, superannuation interests are subject to tax on accrual under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. In other cases, a person may be taxed on receipt depending on the legal structure of the foreign scheme (such as whether the scheme is structured as a company or a trust). The tax treatment differs according to which set of rules applies. As a result, it is not always clear that the rules result in a fair outcome, particularly for lump-sum amounts. From 1 April 2014, a new cohesive set of rules will replace the current rules applying to interests in, and income from, foreign superannuation schemes. The FIF rules will cease to apply to foreign superannuation interests. Instead lump-sum amounts will be taxed on receipt under one of two new calculation methods: the schedule method or the formula method. The schedule method is the default method. It is designed to approximate the tax that would have been paid on accrual while the person was New Zealand-resident, in conjunction with an interest charge that recognises that the payment of tax has been deferred until receipt. The formula method taxes the person based on the actual gains while they were resident in New Zealand, again in conjunction with an interest charge that recognises that the payment of tax has been deferred until receipt. The proposed new rules were signalled in the officials’ issues paper, Taxation of foreign superannuation, released in July 2012. While essentially following the approach proposed in the issues paper, the rules proposed in the bill vary in some respects from those proposed in the issues paper. These variances are in response to submissions received and subsequent consultation with interested parties. 3 TAX TREATMENT OF FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION (Clauses 6–9, 17, 18, 25, 40–43, 75, 103(9) –(11), 106, 115–117) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes new rules for taxing interests of New Zealand residents in foreign superannuation schemes. Under the proposed changes, interests will no longer be taxed on accrual under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules or on distribution from a company or a trust. Instead, distributions will be taxed under a new set of rules specific to foreign superannuation. Lump-sum amounts from foreign superannuation schemes will be partially or wholly taxed when received. The new rules will apply to cash withdrawals and to amounts transferred into New Zealand or Australian superannuation schemes. Transfers between foreign schemes will generally not be taxable. Withdrawals in the first four years after a person becomes resident will not be taxable. After the four-year exemption period, a person’s tax liability on a withdrawal will generally be calculated using a new “schedule method”. Proposed new schedule 33 provides a particular fraction based on how long the person has been a New Zealand resident before making the withdrawal. This fraction will be applied to the withdrawal to determine the person’s taxable income. This method will approximate the tax that would otherwise have been paid on accrual while the person is resident in New Zealand. An alternative method of calculating actual gains derived while the person is New Zealand-resident – the “formula method” – will also be available for amounts received from foreign “defined contribution schemes”. An interest factor will be applied to the value of the gains to compensate for the use-of-money (deferral) benefit. The proposed new rules will mainly apply to people who contribute to a foreign superannuation scheme through an employer while working overseas. They will also cover non-employment-related schemes which fall within the tax definition of a “foreign superannuation scheme”. The proposed rules will not apply to periodic pensions or foreign social security, which will continue to be taxed as they are currently − that is, taxed on receipt at the person’s marginal tax rate. The proposed rules will not be expected to apply to withdrawals from Australian superannuation funds, which are generally exempt under the New Zealand-Australia double tax agreement. Under the proposed changes, people who have transferred their superannuation savings from a foreign superannuation scheme to a KiwiSaver scheme will be able to withdraw funds from the transferred amount to pay the tax liability. 4 Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2014. A person may continue to apply the FIF rules to an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme if they returned FIF income or a loss in respect of that interest before the date this legislation was introduced. As a concessionary measure, people who have made a lump sum withdrawal or transfer before 1 April 2014 will have the option to pay tax on only 15 percent of the lump-sum amount. People using this option will need to include 15 percent of the lump-sum amount as income in their 2013–14 or 2014–15 tax return. This option will satisfy the tax liability for past withdrawals in relation to which a person did not properly return income. Background An officials’ issues paper released in July 2012 1 proposed to replace the current rules for taxing foreign superannuation with a new set of rules that would be fairer and simpler for taxpayers to understand and comply with. Further analysis of the rationale of this proposal may be found in the Regulatory Impact Statement to this bill, published on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website, www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. The issues paper proposed that:  foreign superannuation interests would be taxed on receipt rather than under the FIF rules;  lump sums would be partially taxed based on the person’s length of residence (previously called the “inclusion rate” method but under the changes proposed in the bill, this is referred to as the “schedule method”); and  periodic pensions would continue to be taxed on receipt at a person’s marginal tax rate, which is the current tax treatment. While generally supportive of taxing foreign superannuation on receipt, submitters suggested a number of changes. The proposed changes in the bill take into account submitters’ views. In particular, an alternative method is being introduced to tax actual investment gains derived while the taxpayer is a New Zealand resident (the “formula method”). This will be available in respect of interests in foreign “defined contribution schemes” if the person has access to sufficient information. The issues paper proposed that the new rules would apply to transfers from the 2011– 12 tax year (generally from 1 April 2011). However, most submissions favoured a prospective application date. Accordingly, the new rules will generally apply from 1 April 2014. A concessionary measure allowing people to pay tax on 15 percent of 1 Taxation of foreign superannuation, released on 24 July 2012. 5 their lump-sum transfer will be available, in addition to existing law, for transfers made before 1 April 2014. In some cases, foreign superannuation is transferred to a locked-in New Zealand scheme. A person may be unable to access the transferred amount in order to pay the tax liability, which can result in cashflow difficulties. The issues paper invited comment on whether a mechanism for allowing tax to be paid directly from a New Zealand fund would be useful. As a practical solution, an amendment to the KiwiSaver rules will therefore permit withdrawals from KiwiSaver schemes to pay the tax liability. Detailed analysis New rules for interests in foreign superannuation schemes The bill proposes new rules for all interests in foreign superannuation schemes from 1 April 2014. The new rules will apply to interests in a “foreign superannuation scheme” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. A new definition of “FIF superannuation interest” is included in section YA 1, which specifies the requirements by which a person may continue to use the FIF rules from 1 April 2014. The FIF rules will apply only to these interests. The qualifying criteria are discussed in more detail below. Interests in foreign superannuation schemes which are not FIF superannuation interests will be excluded from the FIF rules through amendments to section EX 29 and a broad new FIF exemption in section EX 42B. Proposed new section EX 42B provides that interests in or rights to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme will not be subject to the FIF rules for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2014. Accordingly, sections CQ 5, DN 6, EX 29, EX 33 and EX 42 are being amended or repealed to remove references to the FIF rules that will no longer be required. Proposed new section CD 36B clarifies that foreign superannuation withdrawals will not be taxed as dividends under the company tax rules. Similarly, amendments to sections HC 15 and HC 27 provide that foreign superannuation withdrawals are not subject to the trust tax rules. Instead, all amounts from foreign superannuation schemes – whether in the form of lump sums or pensions − will be taxed on receipt. Proposed new section CF 3 introduces new rules for taxing lump sums received from foreign superannuation schemes. Lump sums will be taxed either under the schedule approach or the formula approach. 6 As with other forms of income, it should be noted that the portion of the lump sum that is assessable income may impact a person’s entitlements and obligations for that tax year, such as child support, Working for Families, and student loans. When will lump-sum withdrawals and transfers be taxed? A lump sum withdrawal will be taxable under the proposed new rules if it is a “foreign superannuation withdrawal” and if it is received during the person’s “assessable period”. The rules for calculating when a person’s assessable period begins and ends are discussed below. Proposed new section CF 3(1) defines a “foreign superannuation withdrawal” as an amount received from a foreign superannuation scheme that is not a pension. It includes:  a cash withdrawal;  a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand superannuation scheme;  a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme outside Australia into an Australian superannuation scheme; and  a disposal of the superannuation interest to another person − for example, as part of a relationship property agreement or if the interest is sold to another person. Example James worked in the United Kingdom and has an interest in a UK scheme. He moves to New Zealand and transfers part of his interest into a KiwiSaver scheme under the UK’s QROPS 2 legislation. The amount that is transferred will come within the definition of a foreign superannuation withdrawal and so James must calculate his tax liability on the transfer under the new rules. When will lump sum withdrawals and transfers not be taxed? Withdrawals and transfers from Australian superannuation schemes Withdrawals from Australian schemes, and transfers from Australian schemes to New Zealand schemes, are generally not taxed under the Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement or under the forthcoming trans-Tasman superannuation portability agreement (which will take effect from 1 July 2013). This treatment will continue under the new rules. 2 Qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme. 7 Transfers between two foreign schemes (rollover relief) A transfer between two foreign superannuation schemes typically gives rise to a taxable event under current law, being a disposal of rights in the first scheme and an acquisition of rights in the new scheme. Proposed new section CF 3(1) provides that a transfer from one foreign superannuation scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme will not be taxable. This may occur, for example, when a person disposes of their interest to purchase an annuity with a different provider, or if a person transfers from one foreign scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme in order to obtain better returns. Instead, the person will be taxed on the eventual withdrawal or payment (or transfer to an Australian or New Zealand scheme) based on the length of their New Zealand residence from when they initially acquired the interest (in the first scheme). As transfers from Australian schemes are typically exempt, as noted above, transfers from a foreign scheme to an Australian scheme will be taxable as if the transfer was made to a New Zealand scheme. Example Sarah, a New Zealand resident, has an Individual Retirement Account in the United States. She wants to purchase an annuity with a different scheme provider. Under normal circumstances this would be taxable as it is a disposal and reacquisition. However, under the proposed new rules Sarah will get rollover relief so does not need to pay tax on the amount she withdraws to purchase the annuity. Any pension received while resident will be taxable under the current law. Transfers upon death Rollover relief will also be provided when a deceased person’s interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is transferred directly to a New Zealand resident. The transfer will not be taxed. Instead, the recipient will be taxed on the eventual withdrawal or transfer (subject to the rollover relief discussed above), based on the duration of New Zealand residence of both the recipient and the deceased. Example Matthew moved to New Zealand in 2016 to be closer to his New Zealand-based daughter Jenny. Matthew died in 2023, seven years after migration. Matthew had an interest in a foreign superannuation fund which was acquired while non-resident. His foreign superannuation was transferred to Jenny under his will, and was not taxed at that time. Jenny withdraws the foreign superannuation in 2026, after her father’s death. She is treated as having acquired the foreign superannuation interest in 2016, which is when Matthew first became resident after acquiring the interest. 8 No tax if lump sum is withdrawn during first four years of residence Under the current rules, people who are transitional residents are generally not subject to tax on foreign income during the first four years of residence. The FIF rules do not apply and any withdrawals are not taxable. Under the proposed new rules, new sections CF 3(2)(b), CW 28B and CF 3(3) provide for a four-year grace period (exemption period) during which certain people who do not meet the criteria for the transitional residents’ exemption may also make a withdrawal or transfer with no New Zealand tax consequences. The exemption period will operate in a similar way to the transitional residents’ exemption, to ensure consistency of treatment between all new migrants. A person may only receive the exemption period once. The exemption period will apply for the 48-month period starting at the end of the month in which they become resident (and are not non-resident under a double tax agreement). It will apply for persons who acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident under either section YD 1 or an applicable double tax agreement. The exemption period will not be available for interests that were acquired while the person was resident in New Zealand. Proposed new section CF 3(2)(a) confirms the current position where there is no tax on foreign superannuation withdrawals for transitional residents. The transitional residents’ exemption in section CW 27 is also being retained in its current form. Example Amanda is deemed to have acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand on 16 June 2015. She is eligible for an exemption period which begins on the date she acquired her permanent place of abode. Her exemption period ends on 30 June 2019. Her assessable period begins on 1 July 2019. Methods for taxing lump sums Lump sums received will be taxable if they are received during the person’s assessable period. How to calculate the assessable period is described below. A lump sum will be partially taxed under one of the two following methods:  the “schedule method” (the default method) in proposed new section CF 3(6)(a); or  the “formula method” in new section CF 3(6)(b). Proposed new section CW 28C provides that the part of the lump sum that is not treated as a gain under the schedule method or formula method is exempt income. A person who satisfies the criteria to use the formula may choose to apply either that method or the schedule method in relation to withdrawals from a particular interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. 9 The criteria for using the formula method are listed in section CF 3(6)(b). The foreign superannuation scheme must be a defined contribution scheme for which a person has sufficient information about the value of the scheme and contributions made. A person must not have used the schedule method for a past withdrawal in respect of that particular interest, and must not have made a withdrawal or transfer before 1 April 2014. Calculating the assessable period As noted above, a person who receives a foreign superannuation withdrawal during their assessable period will be taxed under either the schedule or formula method. If the person acquired the interest while they were non-resident, the assessable period will start when their exemption period ends. If the person acquired the interest while they were resident, they are not eligible for an exemption period. Their assessable period will start when they acquire the interest. The assessable period ends when a person becomes non-resident. The tax liability arising under the schedule method will depend to a large extent on how long the person has been a New Zealand tax resident. This is based on the number of income years beginning in the person’s assessable period. The interest factor in the formula method is also a function of years of residence. Sections CF 3(8)(c) and CF 3(15)(c) provide that a person’s years of residence is calculated as the greater of 1 and the number of income years which begin in the assessable period before a person makes a withdrawal. Example Ben’s exemption period ends on 30 September 2015. His assessable period begins on 1 October 2015. The first income year beginning in his assessable period starts on 1 April 2016. Ben leaves New Zealand and his last day as a New Zealand tax resident is 27 March 2030. His assessable period is from 1 October 2016 until 27 March 2030. As noted above, section CF 3(1) provides that transfers between two foreign schemes will generally not be taxed. Instead, the amount will be taxed under the schedule or formula method either when it is finally withdrawn or when it is transferred to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. The schedule and formula methods are based on the duration of residence since the interest in the first scheme was acquired, so the assessable period will begin on the date the interest in the first scheme was acquired. When an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is transferred to another person, the transfer will be taxable to the transferor based on their years of residence, if the transferor is a New Zealand resident. The recipient’s assessable period will begin 10 when they first acquire the interest from the transferor, if they are a New Zealand resident. This will apply in situations such as a relationship split, where a relationship property agreement may transfer all or part of an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme from one party to the other. For someone who loses residency and then becomes resident again, it is possible to have more than one assessable period. In this situation, the applicable assessable periods will be aggregated. The assessable period will be determined for each specific foreign superannuation interest, based on the number of years of residence since the interest in that particular interest was acquired. It is possible that a person might have different assessable periods for different interests. For example, a person migrates to New Zealand with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme and they acquire an interest in another scheme while they are New Zealand-resident. The assessable period for the first interest will begin when their four-year exemption period ends and for the second interest it will begin when the second interest is acquired. This will ensure that the new rules will still work as intended if an individual has interests in multiple schemes and transfers amounts at different points in time. Schedule method Proposed new sections CF 3(6)(a), CF 3(7), (8) and (16) provide for the schedule method. The schedule method is the default method for taxing foreign superannuation withdrawals. The schedule method deems a certain amount of the lump-sum receipt to be investment gains, based on the person’s years of residence. The approach uses fractions that represent the proportion of the lump-sum receipt to be included in assessable income. The schedule year fractions increase with years of residence. The remainder of the lump-sum receipt is not assessable. The fractions in proposed schedule 33 are set at the rate necessary to put a person who leaves their foreign superannuation overseas in the same position as if they had instead transferred their superannuation to New Zealand and paid tax on investment gains as they accrued. Given the assumptions (including a 5% post-tax interest rate in the foreign scheme), a person should conceptually be indifferent between keeping their superannuation overseas and transferring it to New Zealand. Further discussion of the policy rationale behind the schedule method can be found in the annex to the issues paper. 3 3 Taxation of foreign superannuation, released on 24 July 2012. 11 A person’s assessable income will be calculated as follows: Assessable income = (super withdrawal – contributions left) x schedule year fraction The term “super withdrawal” is the amount of the transfer or withdrawal made by the person. The appropriate “schedule year fraction” to use is identified by calculating the number of income years beginning in the assessable period, before the person receives the lump sum. In short, this is the number of income years which begin after the person is a New Zealand resident and after their four-year “exemption period” ends. The effect of counting a person’s years of residence from the end of the exemption period is to treat them as being non-resident during the exemption period. Gains which accrue during those four years will not be clawed back and taxed on receipt. Example Lucy’s assessable period begins on 1 August 2020. She withdraws a lump sum of $50,000 on 27 January 2024. There are three income years beginning in Lucy’s assessable period, so Lucy is required to use the schedule year fraction for year three. The corresponding schedule fraction is 14.06%, so her assessable income will be $7,030 (being $50,000 x 14.06%). Assuming Lucy’s tax rate is 33%, she will be liable to pay $2,319.90 of tax on her $50,000 lump-sum withdrawal. If the number of income years beginning in their assessable period is zero (that is, in the part-year in which their exemption period ended but before the start of the next income year), the person should use the schedule year fraction associated with year one. Example Karen’s assessable period begins on 1 October 2020. She withdraws a lump sum of $50,000 on 5 February 2021, which means that an income year has not yet started during her assessable period. Karen is required to use the schedule year fraction for year one because the withdrawal was made between 1 October 2020 and 31 March 2022. The corresponding schedule fraction is 4.76%, so her assessable income will be $2,380 (being $50,000 x 4.76%). Assuming Karen’s tax rate is 33%, she will be liable to pay $785.40 of tax on her $50,000 lump-sum withdrawal. 12 Proposed new schedule 33 provides the full schedule of rates per year of residence as follows: Schedule year Schedule year fraction 1 4.76% 2 9.45% 3 14.06% 4 18.60% 5 23.07% 6 27.47% 7 31.80% 8 36.06% 9 40.26% 10 44.39% 11 48.45% 12 52.45% 13 56.39% 14 60.27% 15 64.08% 16 67.84% 17 71.53% 18 75.17% 19 78.75% 20 82.28% 21 85.74% 22 89.16% 23 92.58% 24 95.83% 25 99.08% 26+ 100% The “contributions left” item in the formula is effectively a deduction for contributions made for or on behalf of a person while the person is a New Zealand resident, if the contributions satisfy certain conditions. The schedule method may otherwise treat some of the New Zealand contributions as gains and would result in over-taxation. Proposed new section CF 3(16) sets out these conditions:  at the time the contribution is made, the person must be a New Zealand resident under section YD 1 and not non-resident under a double tax agreement;  the contribution must be required under the rules of the foreign superannuation scheme (that is, voluntary contributions will not be eligible); 13  the contribution has been subject to New Zealand tax, such as being paid out of after-tax income or subject to employer superannuation contribution tax or fringe benefit tax (for an employer contribution); and  the contribution must not have previously been deducted under the schedule method. The contributions that are able to be deducted are restricted in this manner because the schedule rates already include an implicit allowance for contributions. For example, for the year one schedule rate, 4.76% of the withdrawal is treated as taxable New Zealand-sourced gains and the remainder is treated as non-taxable amounts (that is, contributions as well as gains derived while non-resident). A number of submitters on the issues paper argued that there should be no restrictions on the types of contributions that are deductible. This would not be appropriate, as it could lead to contributions being effectively deducted more than once − first, by being deducted as “contributions left” in the formula and, secondly, by then being allocated out using the schedule rates. Formula method The formula method is an alternative to the schedule method for people with a foreign defined contribution scheme if they have sufficient information. This method will tax actual investment gains derived while a person is a New Zealand resident (after the end of their exemption period). It was introduced following submissions on the issues paper. Proposed new sections CF 3(6)(b), CF 3(9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15) and (16), and section YA 1 “foreign defined contribution scheme” provide for the formula method. To use this approach, a person is required to obtain the market value of the foreign superannuation interest at the time the exemption period ends, as well as information about contributions made and other necessary information. Requirements relating to the quality of information will apply. The formula in section CF 3(9) is: Distributed gain = (super withdrawal x calculated gains fraction) – gains out “Super withdrawal” is the amount of the foreign superannuation withdrawal and “gains out” is the total amount of distributed gains previously calculated under this formula for previous withdrawals in the assessable period. The “calculated gains fraction” is given by the formula in section CF 3(11): Predistribution + withdrawals – transit – contributions predistribution 14 “Predistribution” is the value of the person’s interest in the scheme immediately before they made their foreign superannuation withdrawal. “Withdrawals” is the total amount of previous foreign superannuation withdrawals made in the assessable period. “Transit” is the opening value of the person’s interest in the scheme at the beginning of their assessable period. “Contributions” is the total amount of recognised contributions under section CF 3(16), as described above. Interest will be charged on the amount of taxable New Zealand gains to account for the deferral benefit that the person obtains by not paying tax on accrual (similar to the use-of-money interest rules). The interest will be payable at the same rate as the average growth of the person’s superannuation interest over the number of years of residence. The interest component is contained in section CF 3(13) to (15). Taxpayers will not be able to switch from the schedule method to the formula method. 15 Example Thomas migrates to New Zealand with a foreign superannuation scheme worth NZ$100,000. Ten years after Thomas’ assessable period begins, his scheme is worth $180,000 and he withdraws a lump-sum amount of $60,000. Five years after this, his scheme is worth $150,000 and he withdraws the full amount. Thomas has made no contributions to the scheme while he has been New Zealand-resident. First withdrawal The transit value is $100,000 and the predistribution value is $180,000. Since Thomas has made no contributions or taken any withdrawals, contributions and withdrawals are $0. His “calculated gains fraction” under section CF 3(11) is: Thomas’ “distributed gain” under section CF 3(9) is: ( ) The formula in section CF 3(13) is applied to this amount to calculate what Thomas should include as income in his IR 3. This formula requires calculating the “grow rate” which is given by section CF 3(14). Second withdrawal As before, the transit value is $100,000 but the predistribution value is now $150,000. Thomas’ “calculated gains fraction” is calculated as follows: Thomas’ “distributed gain” under section CF 3(9) is: ( ) Thomas is then required calculate his assessable income from this amount using the formula in section CF 3(13). 16 Transfers to KiwiSaver schemes In some cases, foreign superannuation may be transferred into a locked-in superannuation scheme, such as KiwiSaver. This may lead to cashflow difficulties for the person as they cannot access any of the transferred amount to pay the resulting tax liability. To address this, new clause 14A will be inserted into schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. This will allow a person to withdraw an amount up to the value of the tax due from their KiwiSaver scheme. If a taxpayer wishes to use this facility, they will be required to provide a statutory declaration to their KiwiSaver provider. The manager of the KiwiSaver scheme must be sufficiently satisfied that the requested amount does not exceed what a hypothetical tax liability could be for that person in relation to that interest. The money will be paid to the individual rather than directly to Inland Revenue, so the individual will be responsible for ensuring that their tax liability is paid. Example Hannah transfers her interest worth $100,000 in a UK scheme into a KiwiSaver scheme on 1 July 2014. She makes an application to the manager of her KiwiSaver scheme on 6 October 2015 to withdraw the amount of her tax liability arising from the transfer. She provides a signed statutory declaration and the documents required by the manager. The KiwiSaver manager approves the withdrawal and Hannah uses the funds to pay her tax liability. Transitional measures: FIF rules can continue to apply for certain interests (grandparenting) A new definition of a “FIF superannuation scheme” has been inserted in section YA 1 to enable the FIF rules to continue to apply to interests when the person has complied with the FIF rules by the introduction date of the new legislation. These people will have the option to either continue to return income under the FIF rules (that is, they will be grandparented), or to apply the new rules instead. If a person continues to apply the FIF rules, any withdrawals or transfers in relation to that foreign superannuation interest will not be taxed under the proposed new rules. There are certain requirements that must be satisfied in order for a person to use the FIF rules in relation to a particular foreign superannuation interest. Some will be determined based on past behaviour. These criteria must be met each time a person seeks to apply the FIF rules (that is every income year from 1 April 2014):  the person must have had an attributing interest in a FIF under section EX 29 for an income year up to and including the 2014 income year (the qualifying year);  for the relevant income year, the FIF must have been a foreign superannuation scheme; 17  the person must have calculated their FIF income or loss resulting from that attributing interest under one of the methods specified in section EX 44; and  the FIF income or loss must have been included in a tax return filed with Inland Revenue by the date of introduction of this bill. A person who does not meet these criteria by 1 April 2014 may not continue to use the FIF rules for the 2015 income year (commencing 1 April 2014) or subsequent years. The effect of these criteria is straightforward. A person who complied with the FIF rules for a prior year, and filed that return before the introduction of this bill, may be grandparented under the FIF rules. If a person has two or more interests in foreign superannuation schemes, the criteria are assessed per interest (not just once for that person). That person must then continue to return FIF income or losses in relation to that grandparented interest for all income years after 1 April 2014. If FIF income or loss is not returned in a year (in which the person still holds the interest), the interest will cease to be grandparented. The person must pay tax under either the schedule method or the formula method on any subsequent withdrawal. A person whose foreign superannuation assets are valued at less than the $50,000 minimum threshold in section CQ 5(1)(d) may choose to apply the FIF rules in this manner, as long as the above criteria are satisfied. Example Aaron is a migrant to New Zealand and acquired a permanent place of abode in May 2006. He was a transitional resident until the end of May 2010. For the 2011 income year, Aaron complied with the FIF rules in relation to his foreign superannuation interest, and included the FIF income in his tax return before the filing date. He does not return FIF income in relation to this interest in the 2012 to 2014 income years because the interest qualified for a FIF exemption following a change in the foreign superannuation scheme’s rules which made it locked-in. As at 1 April 2014, the criteria are still satisfied as Aaron correctly returned FIF income in the 2011 income year. Despite the exemption, Aaron will have to return FIF income in relation to his interest for the 2015 income year in order for it to remain grandparented. Transition – low cost option for withdrawals from 1 January 2000 to 31 March 2014 Proposed new sections CZ 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007, CF 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and CC 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 allow an optional method in addition to the current provisions for lump-sum transfers and withdrawals up to 31 March 2014, including past transfers that have not complied with the current law. 18 The alternative to using the current provisions is the option to pay tax on only 15 percent of the lump-sum amount. The remainder of the lump sum will not be assessable. This is a simple option which is intended to encourage compliance before the introduction of the new rules. People who have complied with the existing law and paid the associated tax will not be able to reassess their position using the 15 percent option. To use the option, a person will need to return 15 percent of the lump-sum amount in their 2013−14 or 2014−15 tax returns. Penalties and interest will not apply from the tax year in which the withdrawal or transfer was made. The 15 percent option will continue to be available in later years, but the legislation proposes that penalties and use-of-money interest will be calculated from the 2014−15 tax year. The proposed legislation will be changed to clarify that this will be done by amending the person’s 2014−15 income tax return. As with other forms of income, it should be noted that the portion of the lump sum that is assessable income may impact a person’s entitlements and obligations for that tax year, such as child support, Working for Families, and student loans. If the person does not use the option to pay tax on 15 percent of the amount, then they must apply the law as it was at the time that they made the withdrawal. The original due date for payment of tax would still apply if there is a positive amount of income under reassessment. This means that any relevant penalties and use-of-money interest will apply from the income year in which the transfer or withdrawal occurred. 19 MINERAL MINING 20 OVERVIEW The bill proposes to repeal and replace the current rules that apply to mining companies that explore for, develop mines for or physically mine “specified minerals”. There are 50 specified minerals, of which gold, silver and iron sands are the most commonly mined. The current rules that apply to specified mineral mining are highly concessionary. The changes proposed in this bill are designed to more closely align the treatment of specified mineral miners with that of taxpayers more generally, while accommodating some of the more unique aspects of the mineral mining industry. The proposed new rules were signalled in the officials’ issues paper, Taxation of specified mineral mining, released in October 2012. The rules proposed in the bill vary in some respects from those proposed in the issues paper. These variances are in response to submissions received and subsequent consultation with interested parties. The changes will apply from the beginning of the 2014−15 income year. 21 WHO THE RULES APPLY TO (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendments The tests of what types of activities and sources of income a person has to receive in order to be classified as a “mineral miner” are similar to those currently in place. However, the proposed new rules will apply to persons, not just companies. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014−15 income year. Key features The proposed rules will apply to all “mineral miners”. The definition of “mineral miner” in section CU 6 applies to all forms of legal entity. The current rules apply only to “mining companies”. Because the new rules are less concessionary, it is expected that miners will adopt different structures to carry out their operations. The new definition therefore applies to all persons:  whose only or main source of income is from mining-related activities; or  whose only or main activity is mining-related. The relevant sources of income or activities are unchanged from the current legislation, as it is considered these capture the appropriate parties. To ensure this consistency, the proposed rules also largely transpose the existing definitions of “mining operations, “associated mining operations” (proposed section CU 7) and the definition of what were “specified minerals”, but are now defined as “listed industrial minerals” (proposed section CU 8). 22 WHAT IS “INCOME” TO A MINERAL MINER? (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendments Under the proposed new rules, a mineral miner can derive income from four main sources: 1. amounts derived from their mining operations or associated mining operations; 2. amounts derived from the disposal of land; 3. consideration from disposing of a mineral mining asset; and 4. amounts recovered under a special claw-back rule that applies if deductions are taken when, in hindsight, those deductions should not have been taken immediately, but spread over the life of the mine. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014−15 income year. Key features Amounts from mineral mining operations (sections CU 1 and CU 7) As mentioned previously in “Who the rules apply to”, the definitions of “mining operations” and “associated mining operations” are consistent with the current legislation. “Mining operations” covers exploring for minerals, performing development work, extracting minerals and other work directly related to mining. It is important to note that work done on a “service for reward” basis for a mineral miner will not be covered because the person performing the service will not be a “mineral miner” and is therefore outside the ambit of these rules. “Associated mining operations” covers activities carried on in association with mining operations and include accumulation, initial treatment and transport of minerals up to a saleable form or to a stage where they are ready to be used in a manufacturing operation. Disposal of land (section CU 2) Under the proposed rules, land will effectively become revenue account property of a mineral miner. This means the miner will be allowed a deduction for the relevant land in the year of disposal and the amounts derived from disposal will be treated as income – also in the year of disposal. This will give rise to either a net gain or loss on disposal that will be reflected as either income or a deduction. 23 Disposal of a mineral mining asset (section CU 3) Consideration received from the disposal of a “mineral mining asset” will be treated as income to a mineral miner. “Mineral mining asset” is defined in section CU 9 as a mining or prospecting right, an exploration, prospecting or mining permit or a share or partial interest in any of these. It does not include land. “Mining or prospecting right” is broadly defined to effectively include any authority related to exploring, searching or mining for minerals and includes any interest in such authority. It is important to note that proposed section CU 3 is over-ridden by proposed section CX 43, which relates to farm-out arrangements. A “farm-out arrangement” is defined in section YA 1 and is being modified so that it applies to a mineral mining context. At its most simplistic level, a farm-out arrangement is one where a person (the farm-in party) agrees to incur expenditure in doing work in a permit area and, in return, the existing permit holder (the farm-out party) agrees to surrender part of their interest in that permit. Section CX 43 provides that farm-in expenditure under a farm-out arrangement is excluded income of the mineral miner that is the farm-out party. The intention behind the interaction between these sections is that a person who sells an interest in, a permit will be treated as having disposed of a mining asset and the proceeds will be treated as income. By contrast, if the “farm-in party” instead agrees to incur costs in relation to the permit area, the amount spent by that person will be treated as excluded income of the first party. Proposed section CU 5 also clarifies that:  a partner is treated as having the relevant share of assets owned by the partnership; and  reference to a disposal of an asset includes the disposal of a part of an asset. Claw-back rule (section CU 4) The deductions available to a mineral miner under the proposed rules are discussed in more detail below. However, as a general rule, “exploration expenditure” will be deductible to a miner, whereas “development expenditure” must be capitalised and spread over the life of the mine created. This arguably creates incentives to a miner to prefer an “exploration expenditure” categorisation because of the immediate deduction available. It is also recognised that there will be expenditure incurred that, at the time, may be “exploration” or may be “development” – with its true categorisation only becoming apparent in hindsight. To deal with these situations, a recovery or claw-back rule will apply to expenditure that is deducted as exploration expenditure, but which actually results in an asset that is used for commercial production. In order for the claw-back rule to apply, the following criteria must be met:  the expenditure is treated as exploration expenditure; 24  the mineral miner is allowed a deduction for it;  the year is later than the 2013−14 income year;  the expenditure results in an asset; and  the miner uses that asset for or in relation to the commercial production of a mineral. The amount of income is the amount of expenditure that produced the asset, but is capped to the amount of the deduction taken, and is allocated to the income year in which the relevant asset is used in commercial production. Appropriated income Under the current rules, a mining company can deduct amounts appropriated for future development or exploration expenditure. This ability to deduct for future expenditure is one of the more concessionary aspects of the current rules and is being repealed as part of these changes. It is recognised that mining companies may have appropriated significant amounts under the appropriation rules. Therefore, the repeal of these rules could result in those companies having larger than expected income tax liabilities for the 2014−15 income year when the appropriated amounts are added back as income. To alleviate this, proposed section CZ 28 allows a mineral miner with an income tax liability as a result of this repeal to allocate the income equally over the 2014−15 and 2015−16 income years. 25 DEDUCTIONS FOR A MINERAL MINER (Clause 27 and 35) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes that most expenditure of a mineral miner be divided into the following categories, dependent on the phase of the mine in question:  mining prospecting expenditure – immediately deductible;  mining exploration expenditure – immediately deductible, subject to the claw- back rule discussed above;  mining development expenditure – deductible over the life of the mine created;  mining rehabilitation expenditure – deductible in the year it is spent. Other types of expenditure are:  expenditure on land – deductible in the year the land is disposed of;  expenditure on the acquisition of mineral mining assets – timing of deduction dependent on the stage of the operations; and  all other expenditure – subject to general tax rules, including capital/revenue distinction when appropriate. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014−15 income year. Key features Under the proposed new rules, all of the main types of expenditure will be treated as mutually exclusive. This means that prospecting, exploration, development and rehabilitation expenditure will each have specific exclusions for any amounts that fall into one of the other categories. Equally, “residual expenditure” is excluded from all of the main classes of expenditure. To accommodate this, “residual expenditure” in section YA 1 will be extended to include appropriate types of mining expenditure. Proposed section DU 9(2) also clarifies that no expenditure covered by the definitions of exploration, development or rehabilitation expenditure can be reclassified as prospecting expenditure. This is necessary because prospecting expenditure is immediately deductible and not subject to any claw-back rule. As expenditure will generally relate to a “permit area”, the definition of that term has been expanded to include mineral mining activities. 26 Mining prospecting expenditure (sections DU 1(1)(a) and DU 10) A mineral miner will be allowed an immediate deduction for mining prospecting expenditure. This term is defined in proposed section DU 10 to mean expenditure incurred directly in relation to a prospecting right or “mining prospecting information”, which is defined consistently with the corresponding term in existing legislation. Specifically excluded from “mining prospecting expenditure” are the costs of land, plant, machinery, expenditure that falls into on the other main classes of expenditure and “residual expenditure”. Plant and machinery acquired will be subject to the general capital/revenue distinction. To the extent they are capital and depreciable, they will be subject to the normal depreciation rules at the appropriate rate. Mining exploration expenditure (sections DU 1(1)(b), DU 6 and DU 11) “Mining exploration expenditure” will also be immediately deductible, except when the claw-back rule described previously applies. In that case, the exploration expenditure will be effectively reclassified as “mining development expenditure” and is subject to the spreading rule in proposed section DU 6. The spreading rule is explained in more detail below. The definition of “mining exploration expenditure” is largely taken from existing legislation. However, it also specifically excludes land, plant and machinery (as well as the other classes of expenditure and residual expenditure). Mining development expenditure (sections DU 6, DU 7, DU 8 and DU 12) “Mining development expenditure” will be capitalised and deducted over the life of the mine. It is defined to mean expenditure:  incurred in preparing a permit area of mining operations or associated mining operations; or  on operations carried out on a permit area for deriving income, including mining, work directly related to mining and earthworks. It is important to note that, in either case, the expenditure must relate to a permit area. Proposed section DU 12(2) contains a number of specific inclusions, such as acquiring mining permits, obtaining resource consents, establishing mine infrastructure (including, plant, machinery, vehicles, production equipment and storage facilities) and costs of providing utility services to the permit area. Specifically excluded from the definition is the cost of land and any expenditure incurred after commercial production has begun on property that has an estimated useful life independent of the mine. This is designed to capture ongoing expenditure of the mining operations, including plant and machinery purchased after commercial 27 production has begun, which should be deducted according to the estimated useful life of that asset. The rationale for these rules is in accordance with general tax principles: amounts spent on the creation of an asset should be capitalised and deducted over the course of that asset’s useful life. So, for example, expenditure on earthworks undertaken to increase the production capacity of a mine should be spread over the life of the mine created. By contrast, expenditure on a vehicle that has not contributed to the creation of the mine asset (because it was purchased after the mine was operational) should be deducted over its own estimated useful life. Spreading rule Proposed sections DU 6 to 8 set out the spreading rule that applies to development expenditure. The starting premise is that a deduction for the relevant expenditure is denied except in accordance with the spreading rule. Deductions are denied until the mineral miner starts to use the permit area to derive income. The formula for spreading is: rate x value “Value” is the adjusted tax value or the diminished value of the expenditure, as appropriate. The relevant “rate” is the nearest rate to those set out in the schedule 12, column 1 (for the diminishing value rate) and column 2 (for the straight line rate). To arrive at the rate, it is necessary to perform the calculation in proposed section DU 8: 100% Assumed life “Assumed life” is a self-assessed determination of the life of the mine. For a mineral miner that uses an amortisation period for the mine for accounting purposes, the assumed life cannot be less than the accounting amortisation period. If a mineral miner is not required to use an amortisation period for their accounts, they must reasonably estimate the period they expect the permit area to accommodate commercial production. The assumed life is capped at 25 years from the later of the date commercial production begins in the permit area or the date in which the expenditure is incurred. As a mine develops, a miner will continually reassess the assumed life of that mine. It may be that an additional mineral deposit is discovered, which increases the assumed life, or that some factor results in that assumed life reducing. Because the estimated assumed life is not a static concept, proposed section DU 8(3) requires a miner to re- estimate this figure for each year. The figure arrived at applies from the start of the next income year. 28 Example If a miner’s initial estimate is that commercial production will last 8 years, and they elect to use the straight-line method, their rate will be: 100% 8 =12.5 % (this corresponds with a rate in schedule 12, column 2) This estimate is reassessed and confirmed every year until year 4, when an additional deposit is discovered, pushing out the assumed life for a further 6 years (so 14 years in total and 10 years from the current year). The new rate will be: 100% 10 =10% This new rate will apply from the start of year 5. At this stage it is anticipated that half of the original expenditure will have been deducted, with the half remaining being spread over the subsequent 10-year assumed life. Proposed section DU 7 clarifies that the spreading calculations have to be performed in respect of particular expenditure over the spreading period. The spreading period starts from the later of the income year in which commercial production starts in a permit area or the income year in which the expenditure is incurred – and ends at the expiry of the assumed life of the mine. Mining rehabilitation expenditure (sections DU 2 and DU 13) Under the proposed rules mining rehabilitation expenditure will be deductible in the income year in which the amount of expenditure is actually paid (as opposed to “incurred”). To recognise the fact that this payment may occur after the conclusion of a miner’s income-earning activity, a tax credit may be generated under proposed section LU 1 for the corresponding year (this tax credit is explained in more detail below). “Mining rehabilitation expenditure” is defined to mean rehabilitation expenditure incurred on mining permit land carried out in order to comply with the miner’s obligations under their permit or the Resource Management Act 1991. It covers amounts paid during or after the miner’s operations have ceased, but excludes the cost of the land itself. 29 Land (section DU 3) As mentioned above, consideration derived from the disposal of land will be treated as income of the miner. Proposed section DU 3 sets out the deductions available for land purchases. A miner will be allowed a deduction for land or interests in land that it acquires. However, the rule is limited to land that is part of the mineral miner’s permit area, the site of mining operations or associated mining operations. Any expenditure for which the miner has a deduction before disposing of the land or interest in land will be excluded. The deduction will be allowed in the year the land or interest in land is disposed of. This means that the timing of this deduction will match any income derived under proposed section CU 2 and so a net income amount or deduction will be available in that year, depending on whether the land is sold for a profit or loss. Although land generally does not decline in value, a miner may have paid a premium for the land based on its perceived mineral deposits. If those deposits are then removed, it is possible that the land will be sold for less than its purchase price. Again, it is recognised that this disposal may be the final act of a miner’s operations, so could occur in a period when no income-earning activity takes place. So, like rehabilitation expenditure, any loss attributable to land sales may be eligible for a tax credit under proposed section LU 1. Mining assets and farm-out arrangements (sections DU 4 and DU 5) The bill proposes that expenditure on the acquisition of a mineral mining asset will either be immediately deductible or deductible over the life of the relevant mine, depending on the timing. If the asset is acquired before the date a mining permit for the permit area to which the asset relates, then it will be deductible. This is because, if a mining permit has not been obtained, the area will still be in the prospecting/exploration stage. Once a mining permit has been obtained, the holder of that permit is intent on developing the area for commercial production. The purchaser is therefore buying a functioning asset, which should be depreciated over its useful life. The way this is achieved (through proposed section DU 4(2)), is to treat the purchase of a mining asset after the mining permit is granted as “development expenditure”, so it will be spread over the life of the mine. Proposed section DU 4(3) clarifies that “expenditure” for these purposes does not include the actual application costs for a mining right or permit. As a result of sections CU 3 and DU 4, the purchaser of a mineral mining asset will be eligible for a deduction for that expenditure (either immediately or over time) and the person disposing of that asset will treat the consideration received as income. On the other hand if a person, instead of acquiring the mineral mining asset outright, agrees to incur farm-in expenditure, proposed section DU 5 clarifies that this expenditure is to be treated as if it were the applicable class of mining expenditure. If, for example, the expenditure was classified as development expenditure, the farm-in 30 party would be allowed a deduction for that amount over the life of the relevant mine. As the existing rights holder is not getting any money from the farm-out arrangement, the expenditure of the farm-in party is excluded income to the farm-out party (as discussed above in proposed section CX 43). Other types of expenditure Other types of expenditure not covered by the specific rules in subpart DU will be covered by the appropriate general rules set out in the Act. This includes the application of the capital/revenue distinction in determining whether expenditure is immediately deductible, deductible over time or not deductible. 31 TAX CREDITS FOR MINERAL MINERS (Clause 88) Summary of proposed amendments A new subpart LU is proposed to allow mineral miners a refundable credit in circumstances when there is a tax loss due to a loss on disposal of land or because rehabilitation expenditure has been incurred. The value of this credit is limited to the income tax liability attributable to the relevant permit area. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014−15 income year. Key features It is likely that the natural life cycle of a mine will conclude with mining ceasing, the land being restored and then sold. This scenario may result in a mineral miner incurring rehabilitation expenditure or a loss from a land sale after the income-earning activities have ceased. This would see a miner having deductions and losses, but with no prospect of future income to offset those losses against. To recognise this, proposed section LU 1 sets out when a tax credit is available to a mineral miner. The person must have either:  incurred an amount of rehabilitation expenditure; or  disposed of land for a loss – and, after taking those amounts into account, have a tax loss for the year. The credit is the tax rate multiplied by the “expenditure or loss” (section LU 1(2)). The amount of “expenditure or loss” will be capped at the lesser of:  the total of the relevant losses; and  the person’s loss for the year (section LU 1(3)). The total amount of the credit will also be limited to the historical income tax liability the miner has in relation to the permit area. This is to prevent credits that may exceed the tax paid from the mine in question (section LU 1(4)). Proposed section LU 1(5) also clarifies that any loss giving rise to a credit does not form part of a tax loss component or net mining loss of the miner. This is to prevent a miner claiming a credit under subpart LU but also using the same loss to offset any future income. Proposed section LU 1(6) sets out that the credit generated is refundable. 32 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES FOR MINERAL MINERS (Clause 61) Summary of proposed amendments The current anti-avoidance rules in section GB 20 that apply to petroleum miners are being extended to also apply to mineral miners. The broadening of these rules is to reflect the similarities between the two industries, particularly in relation to the tax avoidance risks that they represent. It is considered preferable to have specific rules that apply so the industry has some clear guidance in this area. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014−15 income year. 33 CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 10−12, 19−24, 28, 34, 37, 39, 56−60, 64 76−85 and 103(2), (3), (5) – (7), (12), (14), (15), (17) – (36), (40) –(43), (47−(51)) Although it is not intended to alter the current mineral mining rules in relation to loss ring-fencing, loss carry-forward and shareholder continuity, consequential amendments to Part I of the Act are necessary to delete provisions no longer relevant (such as those that relate to mining holding companies) and amend references to “mining company” so the rules apply, where relevant, to all entity types. Other consequential amendments are also proposed to the following definitions in section YA 1:  Asset  Associated mining operations  Commercial production  Dispose  Farm-out arrangement  Holding company  Income from mining (definition repealed)  Initial treatment  Listed industrial mineral (definition inserted)  Mineral mining asset (definition inserted)  Mining company (definition repealed)  Mining development expenditure  Mining exploration expenditure  Mining holding company (definition repealed)  Mining operations  Mining or prospecting right  Mining outgoing excess (definition repealed)  Mining permit  Mining permit area (definition repealed)  Mining prospecting expenditure (definition inserted)  Mining prospecting information  Mining purposes (definition repealed)  Mining rehabilitation expenditure (definition inserted)  Mining share (definition repealed)  Mining venture (definition repealed)  Net mining loss  Non-resident mining operator (definition repealed)  Permit area  Prescribed amount (definition repealed)  Prescribed period (definition repealed)  Prescribed proportion (definition repealed)  Reinvestment profit (definition repealed)  Resident mining operator (definition repealed) 34  Residual expenditure  Schedular income  Specified mineral (definition repealed) Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2014−15 income year. 35 OTHER POLICY MATTERS 36 ANNUAL CONFIRMATION OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2013–14 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same that applied for the 2012–13 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2013–14 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2013–14 tax year will be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 37 WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS (Clauses 63, 89−98 and 118) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the provisions for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits seek to clarify and improve the provisions to ensure they operate as intended. The proposed amendments are consistent with the policy behind previous amendments, including the broadening of the definition of family scheme income to prevent people structuring their income to inflate their entitlements. Application date The amendments will generally apply for the 2014−15 and later tax years, with some applying from the date of Royal assent. Key features A number of specific changes to the WFF tax credit provisions are proposed:  Sections MD 1, 2 and 16 are being amended to ensure that the formula for calculating the family credit abatement produces the correct result in all cases, when it relates to a family that receives a parental tax credit in a lump sum for a child born within 56 days of the end of the tax year.  Section MB 4 provides that income attributable to shares in a close company held by dependent children will be included in family scheme income. This addresses a situation where a person could reduce their income by allocating shares in a close company to their dependent children. It also clarifies how dividends from close companies are treated.  Section MB 7 ensures that when calculating family scheme income the attribution of trust income takes into account only settlors who were alive in the income year.  Sections MA 8 and MB 1 clarify that family scheme income is based on a person’s net income and is further adjusted as provided by subpart MB.  Section GB 44, the anti-avoidance provision, is being clarified to ensure that all arrangements that have a purpose of favourably affecting an entitlement to WWF tax credits are covered by the provision.  Section MD 12 clarifies the days when a person is entitled to a parental tax credit by reference to the criteria in section MD 11.  The reference to “fortnightly instalments” is being removed from section MD 13 and regulation 8 of the Health Entitlement Cards Regulations 1993, as instalments can be paid weekly as well as fortnightly.  The list of defined terms in section MC 6 is being updated. 38 Background WFF tax credits are provided to the principal caregiver of dependent children based, among other things, on their level of family scheme income for a tax year. WFF tax credits are abated when family scheme income exceeds $36,350 and are abated at the rate of 21.25 cents per dollar. The tax credits can be received as a lump sum at the end of the tax year or in weekly or fortnightly instalments throughout the year. The WFF tax credits are:  Family tax credit − for principal caregivers of dependent children.  In-work tax credit − for principal caregivers of dependent children who are not receiving an income-tested benefit and who meet the full-time earner requirements.  Parental tax credit − for principal caregivers of a newborn child who are not receiving a social assistance payment and not receiving paid parental leave.  Minimum family tax credit − for principal caregivers of dependent children who meet the full-time earner requirement and do not receive income from certain sources such as an income-tested benefit. The provisions have been amended a number of times over the last decade including as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. The names of WFF tax credits and some criteria were amended in 2004. The parental tax credit abatement formula was introduced in 2007 (with effect from 1 April 2008). The definition of family scheme income was broadened as part of Budget 2010, with effect from 1 April 2011. This included a new provision for attributing the income of a trust and trust-owned companies to the settlors of a trust. Detailed analysis Calculation of parental tax credit and abatement The parental tax credit is a payment covering the first eight weeks (56 days) after a child is born (the parental entitlement period). Section MD 11 indicates that a person is entitled to the parental tax credit if they meet the requirements in section MC 2, and for any day within the parental entitlement period they or their spouse are not in receipt of a social assistance payment. They must also not receive paid parental leave for that child. Section MD 12 calculates the amount of parental tax credit and is being amended to clarify that the number of days is based on the days a person meets the entitlement criteria in section MD 11. The maximum amount a person is entitled to is then abated by family scheme income using the main abatement formula in section MD 13. If a principal caregiver has a child born within the last 56 days of the tax year, and receives the parental tax credit as a lump sum in the tax year the child is born, there is an additional abatement calculation reflecting that part of the parental entitlement 39 period falls in the next tax year. For example, for a child born on 1 March, the main abatement formula would calculate abatement for the month of March only but the parental tax credit is based on entitlement for the period 1 March to 25 April. The formula in section MD 16 is required to calculate abatement for the period 1 March to 25 April in this situation. The formula in section MD 16 is being replaced to clarify how it operates in calculating an additional abatement (in the above example for the period 1 April to 25 April). It also improves how the formula works in very unusual circumstances. The formula calculates additional abatement for the parental tax credit based on the rate of abatement that applied on the last day of the last entitlement period in the tax year the child was born. If there was no entitlement period in the tax year the child was born, the rate of abatement is based on the first day of the first entitlement period in the following tax year. The result of the proposed formula in section MD 16 is that the same amount of abated parental tax credit is received regardless of when in the year a child is born. Family scheme income of major shareholders in close companies Section MB 4 is being replaced with an expanded formula and additional definitions. The current formula determines the amount that is included in family scheme income when a person is a major shareholder in a close company on the last day of the company’s balance date for financial purposes. The amount is based on the proportion of the company’s income for the accounting year that reflects the person’s proportional holding of company shares, and reduced to reflect dividends paid. A major shareholder is someone who owns or controls, directly or indirectly, at least 10 percent of the shares of a close company. While a major shareholder includes a person who controls, including indirectly, at least 10 percent of the shares, the formula in section MB 4 only refers to shares held by the person. When shares are held by a dependent child of a principal caregiver or their spouse, the current formula would attribute the relative share of the income of the company to the dependent child. Section MB 11 includes resident passive income derived by a dependent child in family scheme income, including dividends received from a close company, but not attributed income under section MB 4. The replacement formula continues to apply only when a person is a major shareholder in a close company on the last day of the company’s balance date. However, a person who is a major shareholder in a close company will be unable to reduce their attributed income under section MB 4 by transferring ownership of the shares to their dependent child, or dependent child of their spouse, while still retaining control of the shares. The income attributed under section MB 4 will be the greater of zero or the amount given by the formula. This clarifies that the result under section MB 4 cannot be a negative amount (in situations when dividends exceed attributed income). 40 The formula allocates the amount of company income, less total dividends paid by the company, to shareholders based on their proportional holding. Dividends are deducted from the amount of company income as dividends received are already included in family scheme income through section MB 1 (net income of a person) or section MB 11 (resident passive income of a dependent child). The proportion of shares for a person is based on the number of shares held directly and the number of shares attributed to them. Attributed shares are shares held by a dependent child of the person or the person’s spouse, and they are shared among the relevant number of major shareholders connected to the dependent child. Family scheme income of settlors of trust Section MB 7 attributes income where a person is a settlor of a trust. Under this section the income of the trust (and trust-owned companies) is allocated in equal portions to the settlors of the trust when calculating family scheme income. A settlor is a person who, at any time, transfers value to the trust or for the benefit of the trust. Settlors can include people who have gifted property to the trust and since died. The formula is amended so that the attribution of income takes into account only settlors who are alive during the income year. This includes people who were alive for only part of the income year, including the person for whom family scheme income is being calculated. Arrangements involving tax credits for families Section GB 44 currently refers to a person (a claimant) entering into an arrangement and the Commissioner’s ability to reduce the claimant’s tax credit. It is unclear from the wording whether the section would cover an arrangement entered into by a spouse of a principal caregiver, if the principal caregiver was not a party to the arrangement, yet benefited from an increased entitlement to WFF tax credits. For example, a spouse is a major shareholder in a close company and the principal caregiver is not, and the spouse enters into an arrangement with the company to reduce the amount of family scheme income attributed to them in that year. The amended drafting of the section is more closely aligned with the style of other anti-avoidance provisions. Definition of family scheme income Both the change in section MA 8 and the change in section MB 1(1) highlight that a person’s entitlement to a WFF tax credit is based on a person’s family scheme income. Furthermore, family scheme income is based on a person’s net income (calculated under section BC 4) and adjusted as provided by subpart MB. This replaces the current wording in section MB 1(1) which referred to entitlement being based on “the net income (the family scheme income)”. The current wording is unclear and the amendment is intended to make the provisions more accurate. 41 NOTIONAL INTEREST UNDER IFRS (Clauses 38 and 55) Summary of proposed amendment In some situations International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting rules require a special treatment for interest-free and reduced-interest loans. This can involve the recognition of a one-off adjustment to the value of the loan and notional payments (or receipts) of interest. These adjustments do not reflect actual payments made between parties, but rather are bookkeeping adjustments required for accounting purposes. Proposed amendments to section EW 15D clarify that these bookkeeping adjustments do not have a tax effect. The amendment confirms that positive adjustments are not taxable and negative adjustments are not deductible. The amendments will apply only to loans that begin with below market interest rates. The treatment of loans that subsequently pay below market interest (for example, because of movements in market interest rates) is unaffected. Loans that pay no explicit interest but involve increasing repayment amounts as a substitute for interest (for example, deep-discount bonds) are also unaffected. Under the financial arrangement rules any deduction for notional expenses and any notional income returned will be reversed when a loan terminates. However, a loan may not terminate for some time. As such, proposed new section EZ 64 is a transitional provision that requires a taxpayer who has been claiming deductions for notional adjustments (or paying tax on them) to perform a change of spreading method adjustment in their 2014−15 income year. This proposed section brings forward any reversal. Application date The proposed changes will apply from the beginning of the 2013−14 income year. 42 OVER-CREDITING OF IMPUTATION CREDITS IN EXCESS OF FIF INCOME (Clauses 15 and 86) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are being made to address a mismatch arising under the tax rules in relation to imputed dividends paid by Australian companies under the trans-Tasman imputation rules. This mismatch arises because imputation credits are calculated on the basis of the dividend paid but income tax arises only on the foreign investment fund (FIF) income. New section LE 8B limits the amount of the tax credit to the shareholder receiving the imputed dividend to the amount of imputation credits they would have if the imputation credits were calculated on the basis of the shareholder’s FIF income from that company. The amendments apply only if the dividend received from the company exceeds the amount of FIF income. Application date The amendment applies for tax years commencing 1 April 2014. Key features New section LE 8B limits the amount of the tax credit to the shareholder receiving an imputed dividend from an Australian company to the amount of imputation credits they would have if the imputation credits were calculated on the basis of the resident's FIF income from that company. The section will apply only if the dividend amount exceeds the amount of FIF income. In addition, a new section CV 18 is being added to ensure that the shareholder’s tax liability is calculated correctly in relation to the FIF income and imputation credits by providing that a person’s income includes the amount of imputation credits under new section LE 1(8B). In the absence of section CV 18, a shareholder subject to section LE 1(8B) would be under-taxed on their FIF income. Background The trans-Tasman imputation rules permit an Australian company to operate an imputation credit account (ICA). An Australian ICA company that has paid New Zealand tax can attach imputation credits to dividends paid to New Zealand shareholders. Wholly owned Australian and New Zealand companies can also form a trans-Tasman imputation group. New Zealand tax paid by a member of the group will generate imputation credits that can be distributed to a New Zealand shareholder. The amount of imputation credits that a particular shareholder receives is determined with 43 reference to the actual dividend paid by the company. In the domestic context, this works as intended. However, an issue arises when a New Zealand-resident shareholder receives a dividend with imputation credits attached that is paid from a closely held Australian company. The New Zealand resident’s investment in that company will generally be an attributing interest under the FIF rules. Under the FIF rules, a New Zealand resident is taxed only on the deemed FIF income; the actual dividend is disregarded. A mismatch therefore arises, with imputation credits being calculated on the actual dividend paid but income tax arising only on the FIF income. If the dividend is of greater value than the amount of FIF income, the shareholder will receive excess imputation credits, which they can use against the tax on their other income, such as salary and wage income. This is inconsistent with the policy intent. The amendment is intended to address this mismatch. 44 BAD DEBT DEDUCTIONS FOR HOLDERS OF DEBT – COMPLIANCE (Clauses 26, 29) Summary of proposed amendment Two changes are being made to the bad debt deduction rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. The first change is a measure to reduce compliance costs. It will make the law fairer for taxpayers by allowing them to take bad debt deductions in certain situations when they would ordinarily be entitled to them on the cessation of the arrangement, but for technical compliance issues. The second change is a base maintenance measure and is discussed in the following item. Application date The compliance changes apply from the 2008–09 year, subject to a grandparenting provision so that taxpayers who relied on the current law will not be able to re-open previous years’ tax assessments to take advantage of new provisions for prior years. Background One function of the bad debt write-off rules is to ensure that taxpayers are not taxed on amounts which may have been derived and included as assessable income, but are never actually received. If deductions for bad debts were not allowed, taxpayers would pay too much income tax because they would be assessed on income which substantively was not received. There is a required process for taking bad debt deductions. Bad debts for amounts owing under a financial arrangement must be written off before the financial arrangement ends (for instance, by liquidation). This means that if a taxpayer fails to take a bad debt deduction before that time, a bad debt deduction cannot be taken later. Currently, the tax rules require that where a debtor goes into liquidation or bankruptcy, the creditor (holder) can take a bad debt deduction only if the debt was written off as bad in the same income year, and before the liquidation or bankruptcy took place. This requirement can be unnecessarily onerous for certain creditors (for example, “mum and dad” investors in failed finance companies), as it means they would need up-to-date knowledge of the financial state of the debtor in order to take the bad debt deduction in time. In some situations, creditors are not informed of 45 upcoming liquidations or bankruptcies so they would need to regularly check the companies register or public listings for updates on the financial status of debtors. The same strict write-off criteria apply to creditors when the debtor company has entered into a composition 4 with them. In these cases, the creditor can take a bad debt deduction only if the debt was written off as bad in the same income year and before the composition took place. Again, the write-off requirement can be unnecessarily onerous for creditors because the timeframe to write off the debt can be short (the period between being informed of the financial difficulties of the debtor and the composition itself). Creditors who fail to write off the bad debt in time will have a tax obligation in respect of accrual income they have never received, or remission income that was never written off. This result is unfair and leads to unnecessarily high compliance costs. The proposed changes will allow creditors to take bad debt deductions where the debt has been remitted by law (for example, after the debtor is liquidated/bankrupted), or where a debtor company has entered into a composition with the creditors. Key features At present holders of debt can only take bad debt deductions when the debt has been correctly written off as bad. Under the proposed new rules, bad debt deductions will also be allowed if the debt has been remitted by law, or a debtor company has entered into composition with creditors in relation to the debt. If a bad debt deduction is sought following a remission by law or after a debtor company has entered into composition with creditors, the deduction must be taken in the year that the base price adjustment is performed. For clarification, the requirement that the debt be “bad” before any deduction can be taken is unchanged. 4 A composition with creditors is a deed or agreement where the debtor is released from making all remaining payments (for example, when the creditor agrees to accept 70 cents for every dollar owed by the debtor). 46 BAD DEBT DEDUCTIONS FOR HOLDERS OF DEBT – BASE MAINTENANCE (Clause 29) Summary of proposed amendment This is the second of two bad debt measures in this bill. This change will align the tax rules with the current policy settings for taking bad debt deductions by limiting bad debt deductions that can be taken by holders of debt to the true economic cost. Application date The base maintenance changes apply from the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill. As part of these changes, there will also be a rule that will require taxpayers who have taken excess deductions (that is, deductions exceeding the cost of acquisition and any income returned) to return those amounts as income in the 2014–15 year. The changes are also subject to a “savings” provision for taxpayers who are currently in the tax disputes process in relation to any prior bad debt deduction for the debt. Background Under the current rules, a creditor in a financial arrangement who deals in or holds the same or similar financial arrangements can take bad debt deductions for amounts owing even where they have not suffered a cash loss. The following example illustrates this issue. Example In year 1 A lends B $1,000, repayable at the end of year 5. In year 2 C buys the debt off A and only pays $200 to purchase the debt (because B was facing financial difficulties so was considered unlikely to repay the full debt). Assuming the terms of the financial arrangement were not varied, B now owes C $1,000 at the end of year 5. Under the current law if C’s business includes dealing in or holding those financial arrangements, C could arguably take a bad debt deduction for the entire $1,000. This deduction could potentially be taken in the same year that C purchases the debt, even though the financial arrangement does not mature until year 5. If A was a holder or dealer of financial arrangements it will have taken a deduction of $800 for the loss on sale of the debt. 47 While the base price adjustment (a wash-up calculation that is performed when the financial arrangement comes to an end) will square up any excess deductions taken giving an income result where appropriate, the creditor (C in the example) is still able to benefit from a timing advantage (and potentially a permanent advantage). This timing advantage arises because the bad debt deductions could be taken well before income from the base price adjustment is recognised. This result is not in line with the current policy settings for bad debt deductions, and it means taxpayers can take a deduction for an amount greater than the cash/economic loss incurred. The timing advantage also presents a risk to the integrity of the revenue base. The proposed changes will align the tax rules with the current policy settings for taking bad debt deductions by limiting bad debt deductions to the true economic cost. Key features Both original and subsequent holders of debt who carry on a business of dealing in or holding the same or similar financial arrangements will be limited to taking bad debt deductions up to the true economic loss. This means original holders will be able to take bad debt deductions up to the amount lent, and subsequent holders will be able to take bad debt deductions up to the purchase price. Deductions for amounts greater than the economic loss will be allowed if the amounts have previously been returned as income. As an anti-avoidance measure, a holder of debt who deals in or holds the same or similar financial arrangements will only be able to take bad debt deductions for the true money at risk. This means that if the purchase of a debt was funded by a limited recourse arrangement, a bad debt deduction will only be allowed to the extent to which the limited recourse arrangement does not relate to the debt. In certain circumstances taxpayers who have taken bad debt deductions of more than the economic loss before the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill, will be required to return the excess deductions as income in the 2014−15 year. 48 CHARITIES WITH OVERSEAS CHARITABLE PURPOSES (Clause 105) Summary of proposed amendment The bill adds three new charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to the following charities will be eligible for tax benefits on their donations: • Kailakuri Health Care Project – New Zealand Link • Marama Global – Education • Marama Global – Health Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2014. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33⅓% of the amount donated, up to the value of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. The three charitable organisations being added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: • The Kailakuri Health Care Project – New Zealand Link provides low-cost medical services in Bangladesh. • Marama Global – Education provides school facilities and teaching resources in North Korea and Uganda. • Marama Global – Health provides basic and emergency obstetric and maternity equipment, supplies and training in Somalia. 49 FINANCIAL REPORTING (Clauses 109 to 111) Summary of proposed amendments As part of the rewrite of the Financial Reporting Act it is proposed that small and medium-sized companies that are not public issuers of securities, such as bonds or shares, should not have to prepare general purpose financial statements. However, as part of this rewrite, the Government has agreed that companies should have to continue to prepare financial statements, albeit to a lower special purpose standard. Further, Inland Revenue, as the biggest user in New Zealand of financial reports, should proscribe minimum reporting requirements. This will help ensure consistency in the Department’s requests. Application date The objective is for the new rules to apply for the tax year commencing 1 April 2014 or equivalent. However, the application date is activated by the effective date of the repeal of the present financial reporting requirements under the Financial Reporting Act. Key features Subsection 17(2), which currently requires companies to produce a form of financial statements, is being consequentially repealed. New sections 21B and 21C will require companies to prepare financial statements, and will allow, by way of Order in Council, for the setting of requirements for:  who shall prepare financial statements (other than companies who must prepare financial statements); and  what the minimum requirements are for the financial statements for both companies and any other classes of taxpayers. An explicit consultation requirement will be imposed before the Orders in Council can be approved. Consequentially section 22, which deals with the keeping of business and other records is being amended. While nothing has been finalised, the intention is that the financial statements will be simple and based on double entry and accrual concepts, using where possible tax- related figures. Certain notes are likely to be required, including a statement of accounting policies, disclosure of related-party transactions and where necessary, a book-to-tax reconciliation. All of this detail will be subject to full consultation later this year. 50 REMEDIAL MATTERS 51 REMEDIAL CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF INSURANCE BUSINESS (Clauses 2(6) and (13), 32, 33, 36, 44 to 54, 87, 100, 101 and 103(44) to (46) and (54)) Summary of proposed amendment A number of technical remedial changes are proposed to the treatment of general and life insurance business conducted in New Zealand. They clarify various aspects of the taxation rules applicable to general and life insurers. Application date Various dates will apply. These are outlined in the section titled “Detailed analysis”. Key features The changes:  confirm entitlements under section DR 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that life insurers have in respect of claiming a deduction for the life-risk component of life insurance claims tied to reserves that form part of any acquired or transferred insurance business;  establish, under sections DW 4 and EY 5, a method for calculating an opening balance for life and general insurance reserves when the business is transferred into New Zealand;  alter the formula in sections EY 17 and EY 21 which allocates income between a life insurer’s policyholder and shareholder tax base. (a number of consequential amendments result from the proposed change); and  clarify the relationship between sections EY 15 and EY 19 when apportioning investment income from savings product policies between a life insurer’s policyholder tax base and shareholder tax base. The remaining amendments are technical or consequential in nature. Background The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 made significant changes to the way the Income Tax Act 2007 applied to the life insurance business in New Zealand. Changes were also made to the rules affecting the deduction of insurance claims for general insurers. 52 The changes proposed in this bill are part of a programme to ensure that the changes to the taxation of life insurance and general insurance, enacted by the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, work as intended. The changes therefore largely confirm or clarify existing policy settings. Detailed analysis Reserves – impact of the capital limitation on deduction of claims paid on transferred life insurance business (clause 33(2) and (3)) Section DR 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that expenditure for claims related to life-risk connected with the outstanding claims reserve is deductible. Concerns had been raised that the operation of case law in connection with business transfers could have the effect of preventing life insurers from claiming a deduction in connection with meeting an insurance claim for life-risk for life policies connected with a newly acquired block of life insurance business. The change applies from 1 July 2010 or earlier income years that include 1 July 2010. Reserves – setting an opening balance for reserves when general and life insurance business is transferred from non-residents to New Zealand insurers (clauses 36 and 44) Sections DW 4 and EY 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to set out the calculation of an opening balance for reserves for insurance business that is being transferred by a non-resident to a New Zealand-resident insurer. The proposed new rules will require the New Zealand-resident to base the opening value on the closing balance of the non-resident business on the assumption that the non-resident was in fact a New Zealand tax resident. The concern is that insurance business could be transferred from a jurisdiction that does not have a similar commercial or tax regulatory environment and entitlements or taxable income could be over or understated. The change applies from the date of the first financial quarter following the enactment of the bill; this date is most likely to be 1 January 2014. Profit-participation policies – allocation of income between the policyholder tax base and the shareholder tax base (clauses 46, 49 to 54 and 103(44) to (46) and (54)) The formula in section EY 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended by substituting the term “present value (net)” with the term “present value (actuarial net)”. The purpose of the change is to ensure that the claim the shareholder base has on future income derived on investment income is correctly valued. A similar change is being made to section EY 21. The term “present value (actuarial net)” is defined in section YA 1 to be an actuarially determined discount rate based on the expected market returns (actual and assumed), or the face value of the discount period is less than a year. The discount-rate used should be same as the one used by the life insurer for financial reporting purposes. 53 To accommodate the change, consequential changes are being made:  The term “present value (gross)” is being replaced with “risk-free (gross)” in section EY 24.  The term “present value (net)” is being replaced with “risk-free (net)” in sections EY 28, EY 29, EZ 56 and EZ 57. These changes apply from 1 July 2010 and earlier income years that include 1 July 2010. Policyholder base income – non participation policies (clause 45) Section EY 15 is being amended to clarify its relationship with section EY 19. Section EY 15 defines the income that should be allocated to the policyholder base. Section EY 15(2) specifies that policyholder income is limited to the amount provided for in the formula set out in that section. Any excess income becomes shareholder base income under section EY 19. The change applies from 1 July 2010 or income years including 1 July 2010. Other remedial changes Clause Clarification changes Reason Application date 32 Life insurance outside New Zealand The colon “:” is being replaced with an “and” in section DR 3. Improve the logic and interaction of the source rule in section EY 48. From enactment of the bill. 33(1) Deduction for reserves Deductions under section DR 4 are being defined in the context of non-participation policies. To improve the linkages between the rules for non-participation policies and the deduction rule in section DR 4. From enactment of the bill. 47, 48 Incorrect cross-references to reserves Cross-references in sections EY 19(3) and EY 20(2) are being fixed. Both sections refer to sections EY 23 to EY 29. The reference is being changed to sections EY 23 to EY 27. Improve the internal consistency of the Income Tax Act 2007. From enactment of the bill. 87 Policyholder credit account Section LR 1 is being repealed. The operation of section LR 1 is contingent on the effect of a number of memorandum accounts that were repealed when the new life insurance rules took effect. The section no longer has any effect and is being removed. From the 2014 income year. 100, 101 Timing of debit entries to the imputation credit account Sections OB 47 and OP 44 are being amended to clarify the consequences when an imputation Under current law the debit entry is required at the time of the breach or the end of the tax year 31 March. At worst, the law could require two debit entries for the same breach in From 1 July 2010 or earlier income years including 1 July 2010. 54 credit in the imputation credit account of a life insurer is lost because continuity of shareholding is not maintained. The amendment provides that no debit arises at the end of the year. continuity. 55 REMEDIAL AMENDMENT TO THE TIME BAR FOR AMENDMENT OF INCOME TAX ASSESSMENTS (Clause 114) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to clarify that the time bar applies not only to the Commissioner amending an income tax assessment to increase the amount of tax payable, but also to the Commissioner reducing the amount of a net loss. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2002–03 and later income years. Key features The time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which applies to the Commissioner amending an assessment to increase the amount of tax payable, will be amended to ensure it also applies when the Commissioner reduces the amount of a net loss. Background Section 108(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 prevents the Commissioner amending an income tax assessment to increase the amount assessed if four years have passed since the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides their tax return, unless the return was fraudulent, wilfully misleading or failed to mention income of a particular nature or from a particular source. Before the introduction of the income tax self-assessment regime in the 2002−03 income year, section 92(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 clarified that despite the words “so as to increase the amount assessed” in section 108(1), the time bar applied equally to prevent the Commissioner amending an assessment outside the time bar in order to reduce the amount of a net loss under a determination of loss. Section 92(5) was repealed in its entirety as part of the introduction of the income tax self-assessment regime. A replacement provision was not enacted to confirm that a reduction in the amount of a net loss is to be treated as an increase in the amount assessed for the purposes of the time bar in section 108. The amendment proposed in the bill corrects this oversight with effect from the application date for the repeal of section 92(5) so that the original policy intention is restored retrospectively. 56 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL AMENDMENTS The following amendments reflect the recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel following its consideration of submissions on the rewritten Income Tax Acts. The Panel monitors the working of the 2007 Income Tax Act and reviews submissions on what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommends legislative action, when necessary, to correct any problems. Application dates Unless otherwise stated all the amendments will apply retrospectively, with effect from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Minor maintenance items The following amendments relate to minor maintenance items referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel as minor maintenance items and retrospectively correct any of the following:  ambiguities;  compilation errors;  cross-references;  drafting consistency, including readers’ aids – for example, the defined terms lists;  grammar;  punctuation;  spelling;  consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments; or  the consistent use of terminology and definitions.

Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (N o. 3) Commentary on the Bill Hon Todd McClay Minister of Revenue First published in August 2013 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, P O Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (No. 3); Commentary on the Bill. ISBN 0-478-39216-8 CONTENTS Policy changes 1 Overview 2 Arrest at border 3 Adjusting the overseas-based borrower repayment rules 5 Remedial issues 9 Sharing borrowers’ contact details with other agencies 10 Alignment measures 11 Minor technical amendments 12 1 Policy changes 2 OVERVIEW The student loan scheme is a significant Crown asset and a major financial commitment by Government towards supporting those in tertiary education. The amendments contained in this bill, announced as part of Budget 2013, build on the policy changes introduced through Budgets 2010–12 which focused on encouraging personal responsibility for loan repayments and promoting compliance. The bill proposes to enable Inland Revenue to request an arrest warrant for borrowers who persistently default on their student loan obligations and attempt to leave the country. This power will send a strong signal to borrowers that non-compliance is unacceptable and create a strong sanction for persistent defaulters. The bill also contains amendments to speed up repayments from compliant overseas- based borrowers. It achieves this through fixed repayment obligations for overseas- based borrowers and by adding two new thresholds to the overseas-based borrower repayment rules. Correct contact details for borrowers are crucial in ensuring the continued compliance of overseas-based borrowers. An information-sharing agreement was announced as part of Budget 2013 to allow the Department of Internal Affairs to provide Inland Revenue with borrowers’ contact details that it receives as part of the passport renewal process. This sharing is to be limited to contact details of borrowers that are in default of their loan and not those who are compliant. This is because the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 does not explicitly allow for sharing of contact details of borrowers who are not in default. The bill contains an amendment to rectify this. The bill also contains a number of remedial amendments that align the student loan scheme with the treatment of other tax types and measures to ensure the Act works as intended. 3 ARREST AT BORDER (Clauses 8 and 9) Summary of proposed amendments There is a group of borrowers who persistently default on their student loan obligations. The bill makes it an offence for overseas-based borrowers to continue to do so. An arrest warrant can be requested for borrowers if the District Court is satisfied they have committed the offence and are about to leave or attempt to leave New Zealand. Application date The amendments will apply on the date of enactment. Key features Clause 8 inserts new section 162A, making it a criminal offence for a borrower who is in default of their overseas-based repayment obligation and who, having been notified by the Commissioner that they are in default, knowingly fails, or refuses, to make reasonable efforts to pay or to make arrangements with Inland Revenue to pay. Clause 8 also inserts section 162B in the Act. This amendment allows the District Court to issue a warrant if it is satisfied that the person has committed the offence in section 162A and is about to leave or attempt to leave New Zealand. The person must be brought as soon as possible before a District Court which may make a range of orders if it is satisfied that the person is about to leave or attempt to leave New Zealand without making reasonable efforts to pay or without making arrangements with Inland Revenue to pay the amount in default. These orders include:  an order that the person must give security for the payment of the debt;  an order that the person must not leave New Zealand without the written permission of the court;  an order that the liable person must surrender to the court any travel documents or tickets in the person’s possession; and  any other order the court sees fit to make. Clause 9 amends sections 164 to 166 so that the administration of clause 8 is consistent with the other offences addressed in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Background 4 Some borrowers refuse to repay their loans despite having the ability to do so. For this group, applying penalties for overdue payments and potential Inland Revenue debt recovery action does not deter them from defaulting on their loan repayments. The proposed amendment will enable Inland Revenue to apply for an arrest warrant to prevent an overseas-based borrower who is visiting New Zealand from leaving the country if the District Court is satisfied that they have committed the new offence in section 162A. Under the Child Support Act, Inland Revenue can request the District Court to issue an arrest warrant for a liable parent who is about to leave New Zealand with the intent to avoid their obligations. Similar provisions for student loans would send a clear message to all borrowers that non-compliance is unacceptable and there are real consequences for ignoring repayment responsibilities. This is a targeted measure that would be applied to the worst cases of default while acting as a deterrent to the wider group of borrowers. 5 ADJUSTING THE OVERSEAS-BASED BORROWER REPAYMENT RULES (Clause 6) Summary of proposed amendment The bill adjusts the overseas-based borrower repayment rules by introducing a fixed repayment obligation and two new repayment thresholds. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Clause 6 will replace “consolidated loan balance” with “relevant loan balance” in section 110 of the Act. The definition of “relevant loan balance” will ensure that an overseas-based borrower’s repayment obligation does not decrease as their loan balance decreases. Clause 6 will introduce two new repayment thresholds so that borrowers with a relevant loan balance of more than $45,000 but less than or equal to $60,000 will have a repayment obligation of $4,000 and borrowers with a relevant loan balance of greater than $60,000 will have a repayment obligation of $5,000. Background Currently, there is a three-step repayment obligation for overseas-based borrowers, based on their loan balance. Loan balance Amount due per year <=$1,000 The whole balance >$1,000 and <=$15,000 $1,000 >$15,000 and <= $30,000 $2,000 >$30,000 $3,000 As a borrower repays their loan, their loan balance will decrease and their repayment obligation will also decrease. This means that a compliant borrower’s repayment obligation will decrease over time while their ability to pay is likely to be the same. A fixed repayment obligation will ensure that a borrower’s repayment obligation is maintained, even when the loan balance is decreasing. This brings overseas-based borrowers repayment obligations more in line with how commercial loans operate. The proposed amendment will reduce repayment times and the interest cost for compliant overseas-based borrowers. 6 Introducing two new repayment thresholds will ensure more borrowers’ repayment obligations are large enough to cover the interest on their loan. For about 14 percent of overseas-based borrowers (those who have a student loan balance over $50,847), the amount due each year will not exceed the interest charged on their loan. These 14,581 borrowers will continue to see their student loan balance increasing even if they are compliant. The proposed amendment will mean that the proportion of borrowers whose repayment obligation does not cover their interest will reduce from 14 percent to 3.5 percent. Loan balance Amount due per year <=$1,000 The whole balance >$1,000 and <=$15,000 $1,000 >$15,000 and <= $30,000 $2,000 >$30,000 and <=$45,000 $3,000 >$45,000 and <=$60,000 $4,000 >$60,000 $5,000 7 9 Remedial issues 10 SHARING BORROWERS’ CONTACT DETAILS WITH OTHER AGENCIES (Clauses 10 and 11) An information-sharing agreement was announced as part of Budget 2013, that would allow the Department of Internal Affairs to provide contact details of borrowers received from passport renewals. This sharing was to be limited to contact details of borrowers that are in default of their loan and not those who are compliant. This is because the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 does not explicitly allow for sharing of contact details of borrowers who are not in default. Obtaining accurate contact details is crucial for increasing the compliance of overseas-based borrowers. For borrowers who are not in default, obtaining accurate contact details will help Inland Revenue to prevent these borrowers from falling into default. With accurate contact details, Inland Revenue can educate borrowers about their obligations and put early interventions in place. The proposed amendment enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to obtain the contact details of borrowers who are not in default. This will enable Inland Revenue to amend the information-sharing agreement with the Department of Internal Affairs to include borrowers not in default. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. 11 ALIGNMENT MEASURES The definition of “income” for student loan purposes ( Clause 13) The definition of “income” for student loan purposes is largely based on the definition used for Working for Families tax credits. The Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced recently makes some changes to the formula used to calculate company income for Working for Families purposes. The amendment proposed in this bill aligns the definition of “income” for student l oans with the changes to the definition of “income” for Working for Families. The formula will be simplified so that dividend income is subtracted as part of the formula rather than subtracted in a separate section. This ensures that dividend income from a close company is not counted twice as income of the borrower. A second amendment also proposed to clarify that income from the formula cannot be a negative amount. A further amendment also proposes to clarify that only living settlors should be counted when determining the numbers of settlors for a borrower’s trust. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Reduced late payment interest (Clause 7) Un der section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue can take deductions from money payable to a taxpayer who is in default (for example, deductions directly from salary and wages). This includes student loan default payments. Individuals subject to a deduction order for tax debts are relieved of some late payment interest. At present, the legislation provides a different treatment for student loan borrowers as there is no reduction in late payment interest when a loan is under a deduction order. The proposed amendment makes the treatment of late payment interest for student loans consistent with the treatment for tax debts, and reduces the late payment interest charged on overdue student loan obligations by 2 percent when the debt is under a section 157 deduction order. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2013. 12 MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Clause 12 clarifies that Inland Revenue may disclose information to StudyLink (which administers student loan applications) to verify that an applicant for a student loan does not have an unpaid amount on their student loan that makes them ineligible for a student loan. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Clause 5 corrects a drafting error in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013 that caused changes to payment dates for GST six-monthly GST filers to apply only for the 2012–13 tax year. This amendment corrects the error so it applies for the 2013 –14 tax year onwards. App lication date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Clause 4 clarifies the treatment of deductions for borrowers who are in default only. Under the current Act, deductions made for borrowers whose entire loan balance is in default cannot be used to offset the borrower’s default. The proposed amendment allows deductions to be used to offset the borrower’s default. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2012.
Black hole R&D expenditure A government discussion document Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Science and Innovation Hon Todd McClay Minister of Revenue First published in November 2013 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue and the Treasury, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Black hole R&D expenditure: a government discussion document. ISBN 0-478-39218-4 CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1 Proposals to address black hole expenditure on successful R&D 1 Proposal to address black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D 2 How to make a submission 2 CHAPTER 2 Background 4 Black hole expenditure 4 Current tax settings for R&D 5 CHAPTER 3 Black hole expenditure on successful R&D 10 Proposed solutions for first scenario 10 Second scenario 13 CHAPTER 4 Black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D 15 Proposed solution 15 Issues and risks with allowing deductions for black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D 18 1 CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1.1 Budget 2013 announced proposed changes to six areas of ―black hole‖ business expenditure. The proposals were part of the Government’s focus on providing an environment that supports business. This discussion document continues this focus on supporting business growth and innovation by suggesting changes to deal with the ―black hole‖ tax treatment of some research and development (R&D) expenditure. 1.2 Black hole expenditure is business expenditure that is not immediately deductible for tax purposes and also does not form part of the cost of a depreciable asset for tax purposes, and therefore cannot be deducted over time as depreciation. 1.3 Providing tax deductibility, in appropriate circumstances, for capitalised development expenditure that is currently black hole expenditure has the potential to remove or mitigate economic distortions which may act as a disincentive to businesses undertaking R&D. 1.4 The proposals in this document differ from the black hole expenditure changes announced in Budget 2013. One of those proposals will improve the symmetry between the tax treatment of successful and unsuccessful projects by providing immediate deductibility for capital expenditure incurred for the purpose of applying for the grant of a patent or plant variety rights, when no depreciable asset was ultimately created. However, the scope of that proposed change was limited as the current interpretation of the depreciable costs of these assets (discussed in Chapter 2) meant the deductible expenditure was restricted to the legal and administrative costs of seeking to obtain the applicable intellectual property right. 1.5 The proposals in this document go beyond the Budget 2013 proposal announcement, and aim to address black hole R&D expenditure, when the R&D is successful and unsuccessful. Their impact on removing current disincentives to businesses investing in innovation is potentially much greater. Proposals to address black hole expenditure on successful R&D Patents and plant variety rights 1.6 The Government proposes allowing depreciation of capitalised development expenditure that relates to an invention that is the subject of a patent or a patent application, or a plant variety that is the subject of plant variety rights. 2 1.7 Under the Government’s favoured policy option, capitalised development expenditure (that relates to a patent, patent application or plant variety rights, as the case may be) incurred from the date of the release of this discussion document would be allowed to be depreciated over the legal life of the asset to which it relates. Software development 1.8 The Government proposes that the legislation be amended to clarify that capitalised expenditure incurred by a person in the successful development of software for use in their own business is depreciable. This would clarify the law to be in line with the policy intent and the Government’s understanding of current taxpayer practice. To provide certainty for taxpayers, the Government proposes that this amendment be made retrospective to the statutory time-bar. Proposal to address black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D 1.9 The Government proposes allowing a person an immediate tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure they have incurred from the date of the release of this discussion document if: (i) the intangible asset to which the expenditure relates has been derecognised under the accounting rules (other than due to its disposal) before it is used or available for use— (a) in deriving income; or (b) in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income; (ii) the person intended that the expenditure would lead to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ (that is, an asset listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) of the person; and (iii) no deduction has been allowed for the expenditure under any other provision. How to make a submission 1.10 The Government invites submissions on the proposed reforms and points raised in this discussion document. Submissions should be addressed to: Black hole R&D expenditure proposals C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with ―Black hole R&D expenditure proposals‖ in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. The closing date for submissions is 17 December 2013. 3 1.11 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.12 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 4 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 The Government’s Business Growth Agenda emphasises the importance of building innovation to help grow New Zealand’s economy. Innovation creates new sources of economic growth by delivering new products and processes, as well as generating improvements in the quality and cost of existing products and processes. ―Encouraging business innovation‖ is one of the seven key initiatives of the Building Innovation work-stream, which recognises that enabling R&D is a key element in the innovation process. 2.2 The Government wishes to gauge the extent to which the potential for R&D expenditure to receive ―black hole‖ tax treatment is discouraging businesses’ R&D investment. Black hole expenditure 2.3 ―Black hole‖ expenditure is business expenditure that is not immediately deductible for tax purposes and also does not form part of the cost of a depreciable asset for tax purposes, and therefore cannot be deducted over time as depreciation. 2.4 When R&D expenditure that has been capitalised has given rise to an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, the appropriate tax treatment is to allow that expenditure to be depreciated over the life of the asset. When R&D expenditure that has been capitalised fails to give rise to a valuable asset, the appropriate tax treatment, at least in some circumstances, is to allow tax deductions for that expenditure. However, the current tax treatment of capitalised development expenditure leaves the potential for this expenditure to be rendered neither deductible nor depreciable for tax purposes. 2.5 The potential for R&D expenditure to be treated as black hole expenditure results in economic distortions. It can cause a risk-neutral (or risk-averse) investor deciding between two alternative investments offering the same expected pre-tax rate of return, but when one of the investment options carries a risk of black hole expenditure occurring, to prefer the other investment option. Furthermore, businesses may be incentivised to complete projects that (ignoring tax) have been discovered to be inefficient, simply to avoid black hole treatment of sunk capital expenditure. 5 Current tax settings for R&D 2.6 As stated in the Government’s Revenue Strategy, the Government supports a broad-base, low-rate tax system that minimises economic distortions. Under such a tax system, the tax treatment of alternative forms of income and expenditure is as even as possible. This ensures that overall tax rates can be kept low, while also minimising the biases that taxation can introduce into economic decisions. In line with this strategy, the current tax treatment of R&D expenditure in New Zealand is largely consistent with the tax treatment of other forms of business expenditure. Tax deductibility of R&D expenditure 2.7 Expenditure on R&D that is regarded as a revenue expense for accounting purposes is generally deductible for tax purposes. Section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows a person a deduction for expenditure they have incurred on research or development when the expenditure is expensed under paragraph 68(a) of the New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 (NZ IAS 38 Intangible Assets). For the purposes of paragraph 68(a), paragraphs 54 to 67 of NZ IAS 38 are applied. 2.8 A taxpayer who is allowed a deduction under section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is entitled to the deduction in the income year in which they incurred the expenditure (that is, immediate deductibility). Alternatively, in certain circumstances, they may choose to allocate all or part of the deduction (for expenditure that is not interest) to later income years. Although a taxpayer may have a choice over the timing of the deduction, R&D expenditure that is deductible under section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is generally referred to in this document as being immediately deductible. 2.9 Under NZ IAS 38, expenditure on an intangible item is expensed up until the asset recognition criteria are met. The intangible asset recognition criteria require an entity to demonstrate all of the following: (a) The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. (b) Its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. (c) Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset. (d) How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset. (e) The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset. (f) Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 6 2.10 Once all of these asset recognition criteria are satisfied, the immediate deductibility of R&D expenditure ceases and all further development expenditure is capitalised. 2.11 This capitalised development expenditure can only be depreciated (that is, deducted over the life of an asset) for tax purposes once there is ―depreciable property‖ under the Income Tax Act 2007. Expenditure on intangible property may only be depreciated if the intangible property is listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which lists items of ―depreciable intangible property‖. For an item of property to be listed in schedule 14, it must be intangible and have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition. 2.12 In the event that the project does not create a depreciable asset for tax purposes, the development expenditure that has been capitalised will be rendered non-deductible, either immediately or over a period of time. 2.13 Moreover, even if the project does create an asset that is listed in schedule 14, capitalised development expenditure incurred in creating the asset may still be rendered non-deductible, either immediately or over a period of time. As explained below, this may occur because, although the expenditure has given rise to an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, the depreciable costs of the asset have been interpreted to exclude development expenditure. Depreciable patent costs 2.14 An interpretation statement issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue takes the view that the depreciable patent costs (for a taxpayer who has lodged a patent application with a complete specification or had a patent for an invention granted) are limited to the administrative and legal fees incurred in the patent process. 1 According to the Commissioner’s view of the law, capitalised development expenditure relating to the invention that is the subject of the patent (or patent application) is potentially neither deductible nor depreciable for tax purposes. 2.15 Figure 1 illustrates the tax treatment of expenditure incurred both successfully and unsuccessfully in attempting to create a patent. The area marked ―A‖ represents the capitalised development expenditure relating to a patented invention which is currently black hole expenditure. A proposal to make this expenditure depreciable is discussed in Chapter 3. The area marked ―B‖ represents the capitalised development expenditure relating to an invention for which a patent is not obtained which is currently black hole expenditure. A proposal to make this expenditure deductible is discussed in Chapter 4. 1 Interpretation statement ―Income tax treatment of New Zealand patents‖, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 7 (August 2006), p 51. 7 Figure 1: Patent Depreciable plant variety rights costs 2.16 Although the Commissioner’s interpretation statement referred to previously is confined to patents, it is likely that the depreciable costs of plant variety rights would be interpreted in the same way, given that they are both types of intellectual property rights obtained by registration following an R&D process. Depreciable costs of software development for use in own business 2.17 The Commissioner’s views on the income tax treatment of computer software are contained in a 1993 policy statement. 2 The statement applies to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1993. 2.18 In outlining the tax treatment of expenditure incurred on in-house software development, the statement says that ―when the development is completed capitalised costs will be deductible under the depreciation regime‖. This indicates that the policy intent was that capitalised expenditure incurred in the development of software by a business for its own use should be depreciable. 2.19 The Government’s understanding is that taxpayers who have developed software for use in their own business, based on the 1993 policy statement, have been depreciating all of the capitalised development costs. Although this is in accord with the policy intent, some doubt has been expressed about whether this approach is correct under current law. 2 Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 10 (May 1993). 8 2.20 ―The copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software‖ is listed as an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The rights to use listed in schedule 14 relate to licensees. 3 It is only ―the copyright in software‖ that will be relevant to a taxpayer who has self-developed software. 2.21 A taxpayer who develops their own software will own the copyright for that software. The copyright arises by operation of law. It comes into existence automatically when an original work is created. There is no registration process and no fee to be paid to obtain the copyright. 2.22 The question then arises: what are the depreciable costs of ―the copyright in software‖ for a taxpayer who has self-developed software? Arguably, when a business develops software for its own use, there will not be a cost associated with the copyright. There is support in case law for the view that ―software‖ can exist independently from the depreciable software rights set out in schedule 14. 4 Therefore, it is possible to have software that is not depreciable under schedule 14. Other schedule 14 assets 2.23 Note that some of the assets listed in schedule 14 are not created from capitalised development expenditure and are therefore not relevant for the purposes of this discussion document, as it is concerned only with black hole R&D expenditure. This includes the various ―rights to use‖ listed in schedule 14, which are only relevant to licensees. The depreciable cost of these assets for the licensee will be based on the price paid by the licensee to obtain the right to use. Further comment 2.24 The Government is aware that the possibility of development expenditure being treated as black hole expenditure exists. However, the intangible asset recognition criteria seem quite a high bar to satisfy, which suggests that the vast majority of R&D expenditure is already immediately deductible. A taxpayer knows in advance that once they recognise an intangible asset for accounting purposes, concessionary tax treatment under section DB 34 will cease, and that any further development expenditure on the asset will be capitalised. On this basis, it is difficult to envisage that taxpayers would ―prematurely‖ incur substantial capitalised R&D expenditure under current tax settings. 2.25 That said, the inability of a business to depreciate part of its development expenditure could act as a barrier to investment in innovation. The Government is therefore seeking greater understanding of the extent to which black hole development expenditure is a problem in practice by undertaking this consultation. 3 Trustees of CB Simkin Trust v CIR \[2003\] 2 NZLR 315 (CA). 4 Erris Promotions Ltd v CIR \[2004\] 1 NZLR 811 (HC). 9 Consultation questions  What proportion of total R&D expenditure is typically capitalised?  When an R&D project results in an application for the grant of a patent or plant variety rights, how long is the typical time-period spent between recognition of an intangible asset for accounting purposes and the application being made? How much is typically spent on development of the asset during this time?  What types of development expenditure are typically incurred after the point of recognition of an intangible asset for accounting purposes? Sale of successful output from R&D 2.26 Under current tax settings, profits from the sale of assets created from R&D are not always taxed. When the sale of outputs from R&D is untaxed, the seller is deriving black hole income (the opposite of black hole expenditure). Under current tax settings, a large part of the R&D cost of developing such assets is deductible. This, combined with the large scope for deriving untaxed income from the sale of the output from the R&D, means that there is: (i) an existing inconsistency between R&D outputs that are taxed upon sale and those that are not; and (ii) an existing asymmetry when R&D expenditure is deductible but the sale of the resulting R&D outputs is not taxed. 2.27 Allowing even more R&D expenditure to be deductible will exacerbate these inconsistencies/asymmetries. This is perhaps the strongest argument against allowing additional deductions for R&D expenditure. 2.28 Tax does apply when income arises from royalties or from the sale of patent rights or patent applications. 10 CHAPTER 3 Black hole expenditure on successful R&D 3.1 This chapter discusses the situation when capitalised development expenditure has given rise to a valuable asset, but the expenditure is unable to be depreciated over time. There are two different scenarios when this might occur. The first scenario is when the expenditure has given rise to an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, but the depreciable costs of the asset have been interpreted to exclude development expenditure (for example, a patent). The second scenario is when the expenditure has given rise to an asset that is not depreciable for tax purposes (for example, know- how). Proposed solutions for first scenario Patents and plant variety rights 3.2 The Government proposes making capitalised development expenditure that relates to an invention that is the subject of a patent or a patent application depreciable. This could be achieved by amending the Income Tax Act 2007 so the depreciable cost of a patent application and a patent expressly includes capitalised development expenditure incurred in connection with devising the invention, for taxpayers who have lodged a patent application or had a patent for an invention granted. 3.3 It is likely that under any proposal to address black hole R&D expenditure on successful assets, the capitalised development expenditure relating to the invention that is the subject of the patent would become part of the depreciable patent costs. This tax treatment is appropriate if the residual value of the know-how (created by the capitalised development expenditure) is nil at the end of the life of the patent. After 20 years, the taxpayer will still have the know-how, but the invention will have been publicly disclosed and the monopoly rights granted by the patent will have expired. The Government is interested in your view on whether ascribing a value of nil to the know-how at this point is a close approximation to commercial reality. 3.4 The Government also proposes making the capitalised development expenditure that relates to a plant variety that is the subject of plant variety rights depreciable. 3.5 Policy options for making capitalised development expenditure on these assets depreciable are discussed in detail on pages 11-12. 11 Policy options 3.6 Several policy options exist. Under the first two options described below, depreciation deductions for capitalised development expenditure would be restricted to new assets. 3.7 A third option would allow depreciation deductions for existing as well as new assets. Option 1 3.8 The first option is to allow only capitalised development expenditure (that relates to a patent, patent application or plant variety rights, as the case may be) incurred from the date of the release of this discussion document to be eligible for depreciation deductions. This option targets new R&D expenditure. Option 2 3.9 The second option is to allow depreciation deductions for assets created (that is, recognised for tax purposes) from the date of the release of this discussion document. This option would allow all of the capitalised development expenditure relating to the asset (whenever incurred) to be eligible for depreciation deductions. This option would reflect the view that the status quo is a poor outcome under tax policy frameworks. However, it would provide a windfall gain to those who have incurred sunk costs on the development of these assets, have a higher fiscal cost for the Crown, and create boundary issues (as the tax treatment of past expenditure would differ between assets recognised for tax purposes before and after the discussion document’s release). Option 3 3.10 A third option is to allow depreciation deductions for capitalised development expenditure that relates to existing as well as new assets. By targeting existing assets in addition to new innovation, this option would also reflect the view that the status quo is a poor outcome under tax policy frameworks. This option would have a significantly higher fiscal cost for the Crown. It does, however, offer an additional benefit in that it makes it more attractive for someone who currently holds one of these assets (which they have developed) to continue to hold it rather than sell it. This is because currently a purchaser of one of these assets can depreciate the entire purchase cost, which means that such assets are potentially more valuable to purchasers than to the person who has developed them. However, this option would provide a windfall gain to holders of existing self-developed assets who made an economic decision to proceed with developing the asset in the expectation that development expenditure incurred from the point of asset recognition for accounting purposes would be neither immediately deductible nor depreciable. 12 3.11 Under this option, a pro-rated amount of the capitalised development costs of an existing asset would be able to be depreciated over the asset’s remaining legal life, as if the asset had been depreciated from the beginning of its legal life. For example, if the capitalised development costs of a patent were $100,000 and there were five years remaining in the patent’s legal life at the date the policy came into effect, the taxpayer would be able to claim a $5,000 depreciation deduction in each of the five years ($100,000 capitalised development costs / 20-year legal life of a patent). This means that, of the $100,000 that was previously black hole expenditure, $25,000 would be deductible over time and $75,000 would remain black hole expenditure. 3.12 Aside from the potentially significant fiscal cost, the reason why the amount of the capitalised development costs able to be depreciated over the asset’s remaining legal life is pro-rated under the third option is because allowing all capitalised development costs of existing assets to be depreciated would create undesirable boundary issues. It would enable a taxpayer who holds a patent which has a year remaining in its legal life to deduct all of the capitalised development costs of the patent, whereas a taxpayer who held a recently expired patent would not be able to deduct any of the capitalised development costs. This does not seem to be an equitable outcome. 3.13 The Government considers that all three options discussed are an improvement upon the status quo. However, the Government favours option 1. It targets new R&D spending only and does not give windfall gains to those who have incurred sunk costs. Therefore, any fiscal cost incurred as a result of the policy change would be more closely aligned with the Government’s objective of increasing new business R&D. The other options provide limited additional benefit in reducing the bias that those who have incurred sunk costs have towards selling the resulting asset over continuing to hold it. Consultation questions  At the end of a patent’s legal life, is ascribing a residual value of nil to the know-how underlying the patent a close approximation to commercial reality?  Do you agree with the Government’s proposed solution to the problem of black hole development expenditure where a depreciable asset for tax purposes has been created? If not, can you provide your reasons and suggest a better alternative? Software development 3.14 The Government proposes that the legislation be amended to clarify that capitalised expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in the successful development of software for use in their own business is depreciable. This would clarify the law to be in line with the policy intent and the Government’s understanding of current taxpayer practice. To provide certainty for taxpayers, the Government proposes that this amendment be made retrospective to the statutory time-bar. 13 Second scenario 3.15 The second scenario where capitalised development expenditure that has given rise to a valuable asset is unable to be depreciated over time is when the asset created is not depreciable (for example, know-how). 3.16 Under tax depreciation policy frameworks, tax depreciation is meant to approximate true economic depreciation. When an asset does not decline in value over time, the appropriate tax treatment is not to allow depreciation deductions. 3.17 Intangible assets are only depreciable if they are listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For an item of property to be listed in schedule 14, it must be intangible and have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition. Although not an explicit requirement, the assets listed in schedule 14 tend to have finite legal lives that are determined under contract or statute. A finite legal life provides comfort that the requirement for the asset to have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition is met. When an intangible asset does not have a finite legal life (for example, know-how and trademarks) it is difficult to satisfy the finite useful life test. Therefore, the appropriate tax treatment for these assets is that they are not depreciable. 3.18 That a particular intangible asset is non-depreciable for tax purposes should not, however, be taken as an indication that the asset has an infinite useful life. Rather, the asset may have an indefinite useful life. It is this indefinite useful life that presents a problem for determining the basis upon which the capital costs of the asset should be deducted over the asset’s useful life. 3.19 As a result, the Government considers it would not be appropriate to allow depreciation deductions for capitalised expenditure on intangible assets that are not currently listed in schedule 14, as it has not been established that these assets have finite useful lives that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty. New intangible assets can, however, be considered for inclusion in schedule 14 on a case-by-case basis. In deciding whether a new intangible asset should be added to schedule 14, a further relevant consideration is whether there is a low risk of the asset being used in tax avoidance schemes if it is made depreciable. 3.20 At some point in time, the usefulness of a non-depreciable intangible asset may cease. Section EE 39 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows a person to deduct the remaining undepreciated costs of an item of depreciable property that is no longer used. By contrast, when a non-depreciable asset is no longer used, there is no ability to deduct the capital cost of the asset. 14 3.21 However, giving a deduction for the capital cost of a non-depreciable asset when its usefulness ceases is akin to giving a deduction for a capital loss. Our tax system generally does not give deductions for capital losses on investments in other types of non-depreciable assets, such as land and shares. As our tax system does not comprehensively tax capital gains, not giving deductions for capital losses generally means that there is a consistent tax treatment. If capital gains were comprehensively taxed, giving deductions for capital losses may be appropriate as this would ensure a consistent tax treatment. 3.22 Additionally, if a deduction were to be given for the entire capital cost of an asset when its usefulness ceases, the deduction for the expenditure would not be matched with the income derived from the asset. This is undesirable from a policy perspective. It is true that in the year that a depreciable asset’s usefulness ceases it is possible that the taxpayer will have derived little or no income from the asset, while being able to potentially deduct a large part of the asset’s cost. However, with depreciable assets there will, at least, be some sort of matching of income derived with related expenditure while the asset is useful. 3.23 Given these arguments, the Government considers that it would not be appropriate to allow deductions for non-depreciable assets that are no longer useful. Consultation questions  How would you suggest that capitalised development expenditure that has given rise to an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be dealt with?  Are there any other instances of black hole expenditure on successful R&D not covered in this discussion document? 15 CHAPTER 4 Black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D 4.1 This chapter discusses capitalised development expenditure that has not given rise to a valuable asset – either an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, or an asset that is non-depreciable for tax purposes because it does not have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty (for example, know-how). 4.2 Conceptually, unsuccessful expenditure should be tax deductible when it would have led to a depreciable asset if the project had been successful. 4.3 Where the expenditure would have led to a non-depreciable asset if the project had been successful, allowing a tax deduction for unsuccessful capital expenditure would bias investment decisions in favour of these kinds of assets. 4.4 An alternative view is that all such expenditure should be deductible as the capital expenditure has not created any value or enduring benefit. However, this is akin to giving a deduction for a capital loss. As mentioned above, our tax system does not generally provide deductions for capital losses, which generally means that there is a consistent tax treatment, given that our tax system generally does not tax capital gains either. 4.5 As previously discussed, New Zealand’s current R&D expenditure deductibility rules are linked to the accounting rules. Expenditure on R&D is generally deductible for tax purposes up until all the criteria for recognition of an intangible asset in the accounting rules have been met. Once an intangible asset has been recognised under the test in the accounting rules, all further development expenditure is capitalised. The tax rules follow this treatment. Proposed solution 4.6 As well as a test for recognising an intangible asset, the accounting rules contain a derecognition test for an intangible asset. This test is found at paragraph 112 of NZ IAS 38, which provides that: An intangible asset shall be derecognised: (a) on disposal; or (b) when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 16 4.7 The Government proposes allowing a person a tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure they have incurred if the following three conditions are met:  The intangible asset to which the expenditure relates has been derecognised under the accounting rules (other than due to its disposal) before it is used or available for use— - in deriving income; or - in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income.  The person intended that the expenditure would lead to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ (that is, an asset listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) of the person.  No deduction has been allowed for the expenditure under any other provision. Timing of deductions 4.8 There are two main options for the timing of deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure:  allow an immediate deduction for the unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure; or  depreciate the unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure over the estimated useful life of the asset the development expenditure was aimed at creating. 4.9 Depreciating the unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure over the estimated useful life of the unsuccessful asset is, theoretically, an economically neutral treatment. By contrast, an immediate deduction (or spreading it over a shorter period than the asset’s estimated useful life) is non-neutral to the taxpayer’s advantage. 4.10 Depreciating the unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure over the estimated useful life of the asset the development expenditure was aimed at creating is therefore, in theory, preferable. However, in practice, there are a number of reasons why allowing an immediate deduction may be preferred, including the following:  Allowing an immediate deduction is consistent with the current treatment for depreciable assets that are written off, where the remaining undepreciated costs are deducted on write off. If the proposed rules did not match this treatment, there would be an incentive to develop uneconomic assets to the depreciable asset stage in order to write them off and obtain the immediate deduction.  Solutions implemented for other black hole expenditure problems have involved allowing an immediate deduction. There is a strong case for consistency of approach. 17 4.11 For these reasons, the Government proposes allowing an immediate deduction for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure. 4.12 However, the case for allowing an immediate deduction for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure becomes less compelling the longer the period that the asset would have been valuable, had it been successfully created. 4.13 In 2012, an amendment was made to the Income Tax Act 2007 allowing an immediate deduction for capitalised expenditure incurred in unsuccessful software development. The period that software is expected to be valuable generally ranges between one and four years, depending upon whether the software is designed for a single-year application or longer. It was considered that the relatively short life of software made allowing an immediate deduction for expenditure on unsuccessful software development the appropriate policy. 4.14 By comparison, patents have a legal life of 20 years, and plant variety rights have a legal life of 20 years in the case of non-woody plants and 23 years in the case of woody plants. 5 The longer life of these assets means that allowing immediate deductibility for unsuccessful expenditure would create a greater bias in favour of investing in these types of assets, at the margin. This bias would be strongest in the case of allowing immediate deductibility for unsuccessful expenditure incurred in developing an asset that would not have declined in value over time had the development been successful. Integrity measures 4.15 In the event that a failed asset from an abandoned R&D project (which has had capitalised development expenditure deducted) becomes useful, the Government proposes that the capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a deduction should be clawed back as income. Where the useful asset is depreciable, the clawed-back amount should then be able to be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. 4.16 In the event that a failed asset from an abandoned R&D project (which has had capitalised development expenditure deducted) is sold, the Government proposes that the capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a deduction (or the sale proceeds, if this amount is lower) should also be clawed back. The exception would be when the sale of the failed asset would otherwise give rise to assessable income. In such instances, the Government proposes that the entire sales proceeds should continue to be treated as assessable income. Policy options 4.17 The Government has considered two options for allowing deductions for black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D. 5 Technically, for tax purposes, the legal life of plant variety rights includes the number of whole calendar months during which the person owns the plant variety rights application in relation to which the rights are granted, in addition to the 20 or 23-year term for which the plant variety rights are granted. 18 Option 1 4.18 The first option is to allow deductions only for capitalised development expenditure incurred from the date of the release of this discussion document. Option 2 4.19 The second option is to also allow deductions for capitalised development expenditure incurred before the date of the release of this discussion document, when the asset to which the expenditure relates is derecognised after the date of the release of this discussion document. 4.20 The Government proposes that the policy option chosen to address the issue of black hole expenditure on successful R&D should guide the choice of policy option for addressing the issue of black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D. If only capitalised development expenditure incurred from the date of the release of this discussion document is to be eligible for depreciation deductions in the case of successful R&D, then the Government considers that, for consistency reasons, it would make sense to allow deductions only for capitalised development expenditure incurred from the date of the release of this discussion document in the case of unsuccessful R&D. Consultation questions  Do you agree with the Government’s proposed solution to the problem of black hole development expenditure when no valuable asset has been created? If not, can you provide your reasons and suggest a better alternative?  Do you think that deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure should be immediate or spread over the estimated useful life of the asset the expenditure was aimed at creating? In particular, when we are talking of expenditure that, if successful, would have given rise to an asset with a 20 to 23-year life, do you think that giving immediate deductibility for unsuccessful expenditure is appropriate? Why or why not? Issues and risks with allowing deductions for black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D 4.21 The Government is aware that there are various issues and risks with allowing deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure that do not arise in the case of successful capitalised development expenditure. These are outlined below. 19 Eligibility for the deduction 4.22 Allowing deductions for unsuccessful capitalised expenditure raises the question of how to test whether the expenditure would have led to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ had the project been successful (given that no depreciable asset for tax purposes will have been created). The Government proposes that an intention test could be used, even though this may create practical difficulties as intention is often difficult to prove or disprove. 4.23 An alternative option would be not to limit the deduction to expenditure that would have led to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ if the R&D project had been successful – in other words, allowing a deduction for all unsuccessful R&D expenditure. If the reason for giving a deduction for capitalised R&D expenditure that has not given rise to a valuable asset is that the taxpayer only incurred the capitalised R&D expenditure because they recognised an asset under the accounting rules ―prematurely‖ (that is, they never got to the point where they had a valuable asset at all), then it is arguable that it should not matter whether the taxpayer intended that the expenditure would lead to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ or not. To illustrate this argument, consider the counter-factual situation where the taxpayer had not prematurely recognised an asset under the accounting rules. In this situation the same R&D expenditure would not have been capitalised – it would have been expensed for accounting purposes and deductible for tax purposes, whether or not the taxpayer intended that the expenditure would lead to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖. 4.24 On the other hand, as a general tax principle, the classification of a particular expense as being of a capital nature is not based on whether it actually produces an enduring benefit but, rather, on whether the expense was intended to produce an enduring benefit. Development expenditure that is intended to create an asset is capital in nature. Section DB 34 is concessionary in that it overrides the capital limitation, giving immediate tax deductions for R&D expenditure that is treated as a revenue expense for accounting purposes. 4.25 In reality, the risk of recognising an intangible asset prematurely may be small. R&D expenditure is only capitalised for tax purposes after the taxpayer has demonstrated that all of the intangible asset recognition criteria in the accounting rules are satisfied, as noted in Chapter 2. These criteria are rigorous, which implies that a conservative approach is taken to intangible asset recognition for accounting purposes. Having rigorous asset recognition criteria in the accounting rules makes sense because, generally speaking, the incentive is to recognise an asset as soon as possible. A taxpayer knows in advance that once they recognise an intangible asset for accounting purposes, concessionary tax treatment under section DB 34 will cease, and that any further development expenditure on the asset must be capitalised. This tax treatment is appropriate because the intent of any further development expenditure after the point of asset recognition will be to produce an enduring benefit. 20 Consultation questions  Do you agree that allowable deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure should be confined to expenditure that would have led to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ (that is, an asset listed on schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) if the R&D project had been successful?  Do you agree with using an intention test to determine whether expenditure would have led to an item of ―depreciable intangible property‖ if the R&D project had been successful? If not, can you provide your reasons and suggest a better alternative? Residual know-how 4.26 When an R&D project is abandoned after the point of intangible asset recognition under the accounting rules but before an intangible asset that is depreciable for tax purposes is created, there is a question around how Inland Revenue would know that the taxpayer does not still have valuable know- how (and therefore conceptually should not be allowed a deduction). It would be unsatisfactory for the integrity of the tax system if taxpayers were able to receive deductions for capital expenditure that has created valuable know-how. It would also increase the fiscal cost for the Crown. Consultation questions  Is there a risk that taxpayers might derecognise a valuable intangible asset (bearing in mind that this would involve writing off the asset for accounting purposes too) in order to get an immediate tax deduction?  If this is a material risk, how would Inland Revenue determine whether the taxpayer retained valuable know-how and should be denied the deduction, or whether it was a genuine failed asset and they should be allowed a deduction? If Inland Revenue would have no way of determining this, is this fatal to the policy proposal? Perverse incentives for marginal projects 4.27 Allowing immediate deductibility of unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure would create a perverse incentive for taxpayers not to complete marginal projects because, when the value of exploitation is low or uncertain, immediate deductibility of unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure may be preferred by the taxpayer over depreciation of successful capitalised development expenditure. 21 Consultation question Is this perverse incentive for taxpayers not to complete marginal projects something we should be willing to bear, or is this sufficient reason to prefer depreciating capitalised development expenditure over the estimated useful life of the asset that the development expenditure was aimed at creating? Re-labelling incentives 4.28 Allowing deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure would increase incentives for taxpayers to re-label expenditure in order to obtain a deduction. The risk of taxpayers re-labelling non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure is one of the major concerns associated with providing tax incentives for R&D expenditure. However, there is reason to believe that re-labelling risks would be much lower in the case of providing immediate deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure compared with R&D tax incentives (such as an R&D tax credit). This is because the treatment that would be accorded to any expenditure re-labelled as unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure under this proposal (that is, immediate deductibility) would be no more favourable than that which is accorded to most other non-capital business expenditure. By contrast, in the case of say, an R&D tax credit, a taxpayer could benefit from re-labelling any non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure. 4.29 Therefore, under the Government’s proposed solution to the problem of black hole expenditure on unsuccessful R&D, the only business expenditure that it would benefit a taxpayer to re-label as capitalised development expenditure would be expenditure that is not immediately deductible (such as expenditure that is of a capital nature). Consultation question How significant is the risk of taxpayers re-labelling expenditure as unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure? Risk of breaking up R&D projects 4.30 If deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure are allowed, there may be a risk that taxpayers break up R&D projects to get immediate deductibility of capitalised development expenditure on failed aspects of what is really a single project. 22 Consultation questions  Is the potential for taxpayers to break up R&D projects to get immediate deductibility of capitalised development expenditure on failed aspects of what is really a single project a material risk in practice?  Even if this is a material risk in practice, is this an incorrect outcome from a policy perspective?  Are there any other issues and risks with allowing deductions for unsuccessful capitalised development not covered in this discussion document?

However, taxpayer secrecy rules currently prevent Inland Revenue from sharing information with other enforcement agencies. 1.2 One of the aims of the Government’s Better Public Services reforms is to ensure the public sector undertakes a more collaborative, cross-agency approach to supporting citizens and gaining efficiencies. The Prime Minister recently set 10 challenging results for the public sector to achieve over the next three to five years. 1 Two areas of focus relate to reducing crime rates and reoffending. 1.3 Making better use of information and information-sharing between government agencies has been identified as one means of gaining greater efficiencies and improved outcomes from the public sector. Improved information-sharing between Inland Revenue and other enforcement agencies has been identified as a means to both improve cross-agency collaboration and contribute to the Government’s goals of reducing crime. 1.4 Building on recent reforms to Inland Revenue’s secrecy rules, the Government has considered the possibility of an increased role for Inland Revenue in sharing information with enforcement agencies. This discussion document proposes that Inland Revenue may share information with other enforcement agencies where it might be an advantage in dealing with serious offences. 1.5 Expanding the information Inland Revenue shares with other government agencies is not without risk. The Government recognises that confidentiality is an important aspect of taxpayers’ comfort when providing information to Inland Revenue. There is also a risk of Inland Revenue being distracted from its core tax role. The Government is therefore only considering information- sharing when the benefits to society from such sharing are clear. For the purposes of this round of consultation, that means limiting information- sharing for law enforcement to cases of serious offences. Further information-sharing proposals are likely to be considered. 1 The Prime Minister’s Results for New Zealanders, released on 15 March 2012, http://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/The\_Prime\_Minister's\_results\_for\_New\_Zealanders.pdf 2 1.6 The Government takes very seriously the need for agencies to protect taxpayers’ privacy and secrecy. Therefore strict processes would be required for any increased information-sharing. Inland Revenue has many years’ experience in successfully exchanging sensitive information with New Zealand’s international tax treaty partners and these processes offer a model (which is highly regarded internationally) for domestic exchange of information on serious offence. Purpose of this discussion document 1.7 The Government believes the proposals set out in this document will provide benefits to society. However, it also understands that trust in government use of information is crucial. The Government therefore wishes to canvass public opinion and ensure that any sharing of information follows a process that is acceptable to the public. 1.8 Your views on the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal and, if sharing does take place, when and what controls should be in place are welcomed. 1.9 To support consideration of the proposals, Inland Revenue commissioned research to help inform its advice to Government. The research was designed to obtain the views of a number of stakeholder groups regarding the use of Inland Revenue information to assist law enforcement agencies. An advisory group, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Justice, New Zealand Police, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Victoria University of Wellington and Inland Revenue, oversaw this research project. 1.10 A summary of the research findings is included in Chapter 3 of this discussion document. The full research results can be found at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Summary of proposals 1.11 The Government proposes allowing Inland Revenue to share information with other enforcement agencies:  when the offence is committed by an individual and is punishable by imprisonment of four years or more; or if a similarly serious offence is committed by a body corporate which would be punishable by imprisonment of four years or more if it had been committed by an individual;  when there are reasonable grounds for the agency identifying the possible offence to suspect that a serious offence has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed;  when there are reasonable grounds for Inland Revenue to suspect the information it has is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence of, a serious offence that has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed; and 3  when Inland Revenue is satisfied that: – the information is readily available within Inland Revenue; – it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information; and – it is in the public interest to communicate the information. How to make a submission 1.12 The Government invites submissions on the proposals in this discussion document. 1.13 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Justice and New Zealand Police to contact you about your submission to discuss the points raised. 1.14 Submissions should be made by 21 May 2013 and be addressed to: Sharing Inland Revenue information to support law enforcement C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email: targetingseriouscrime@ird.govt.nz Readers may also wish to access the online forum: http://targetingseriouscrime.ird.govt.nz which has been launched in tandem with this discussion document. 1.15 Submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you think any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act, you should indicate this clearly. 4 CHAPTER 2 Background In addition to assessors and officers being sworn to secrecy, other precautions are taken to protect the taxable value of a man’s property becoming known. Clutha Leader, Volume VI, Issue 343, 7 May 1880, Page 3 2.1 The effective administration of the New Zealand tax system relies on the voluntary compliance of taxpayers. Critical to this compliance is taxpayers having trust in Inland Revenue that taxpayers’ information will not be disclosed inappropriately. However, to operate the tax system efficiently, Inland Revenue sometimes needs to disclose information to taxpayers and third parties when it is reasonable to do so. An appropriate balance is needed in situations when these principles are inconsistent. 2.2 Provisions protecting taxpayer confidentiality have been in place for over 130 years, since the introduction of the Property Assessment Act 1879. The Court of Appeal has said that the tax system ...rests on the assurance provided by stringent official secrecy provisions that the tax affairs of taxpayers are solely the concern of the Revenue and the taxpayers and will not be used to embarrass or prejudice them. 2 2.3 Today, the current secrecy rules in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, continue to provide a strict rule of taxpayer secrecy. They provide that, as a general starting point, Inland Revenue officers must maintain (and assist in maintaining) the secrecy of all matters relating to various tax Acts administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Further, section 6 of the Tax Administration Act states that taxpayer confidentiality forms a key part of the integrity of the tax system. 2.4 At the same time, the Tax Administration Act recognises that the duty to maintain secrecy cannot be absolute and so there is a list of targeted exceptions to the general secrecy rule. There is also a general exception which provides that disclosure is permitted if it is for the purpose of carrying into effect the Inland Revenue Acts and certain other tax-related legislation. 2.5 The first specific statutory exception to tax secrecy was introduced in 1946, in relation to international double taxation agreements. 3 The Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 contained further statutory exceptions, including permitting sharing with the then Department of Statistics. 4 2 Knight v Barnett (1991) 13 NZTC 8014 (CA) at 8,016. 3 Land and Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act 1946, section 5(5). 4 Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 section 13(4). 5 2.6 For most government agencies, the Privacy Act 1993 regulates information- sharing between agencies. The Privacy Act contains an express exception to principle 11 (which prevents disclosure) permitting disclosures made in order to “avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law”. However Inland Revenue is subject to additional statutory secrecy requirements, and therefore the Privacy Act “maintenance of the law” exception does not apply. Example scenario: GST refund audit resulting in identification of possible investor fraud In an investigation of a GST refund it becomes apparent that a taxpayer is lending funds on aggressively structured terms to high-risk borrowers at artificially ramped-up prices. Investors therefore have a false view of the profitability of the company. Under the current rules, Inland Revenue cannot share this information. Under the proposed rules, Inland Revenue would be able to provide information on the transaction, and associated parties to the transaction, to the Police and the Financial Markets Authority on the basis of there being reasonable grounds to suspect a fraud is being committed. Current exchanges of Inland Revenue information 2.7 While the general rule regarding taxpayer information is one of strict secrecy, there are a number of targeted exceptions to this rule. In relation to these targeted exceptions, Inland Revenue currently has information-sharing agreements with more than 20 other government departments. 2.8 Under these agreements, Inland Revenue can provide information to agencies such as:  the Accident Compensation Corporation, to identify ACC levy payers, and to calculate and collect premiums and residual claims levies;  the Ministry of Social Development, to help the Ministry identify people who qualify for a community services card, identify benefit overpayments, and locate debtors and recover benefit overpayments;  the Department of Internal Affairs, to assist in its role of administering charities;  the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Labour), to verify entitlement to parental leave payments;  the New Zealand Customs Service, to ensure interest is applied correctly to the student loans of New Zealand and overseas-based borrowers, and to help locate and contact child support defaulters;  the Ministry of Justice, to enable it to locate people with outstanding fines and enforce payment; and  Statistics New Zealand, for statistical purposes. 6 2.9 Information can be matched for verification of various entitlements of private individuals or for statistical purposes. 2.10 There are currently no provisions in the Tax Administration Act, nor any agreements in place, that permit information to be shared or provided in relation to serious offences. There is no law presently allowing Inland Revenue to make agreements generally in relation to serious crimes. As noted, the “maintenance of the law” exception to principle 11 in the Privacy Act 1993, which allows other agencies to disclose information regarding criminal offending, is not available to Inland Revenue. There is provision for sharing with the New Zealand Police in relation to action taken by the New Zealand Police under section 98(1) of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009. This is however, a highly specified and limited information-sharing provision, relating to actions to recover criminal assets. 2.11 In August 2011, the Ministry of Justice released a paper, Strengthening New Zealand’s resistance to organised crime, an all-of-government response, which identified the need for improved domestic and international information-sharing, legal assistance and coordination. 2.12 While Inland Revenue participates in cross-agency prevention and detection of organised crime, it is unable to share taxpayer-specific information with other participant agencies under the current legislation. Inland Revenue’s role as participant in these situations is limited to sharing general technical expertise on matters such as company structuring or legal issues. Example scenario: Providing wage and salary information to support investigation of immigration crime Labour and immigration investigators at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment begin an investigation into individuals suspected of people trafficking. This involves foreign nationals being brought into New Zealand under false pretences to work illegally for New Zealand employers in conditions that fall well short of minimum labour standards. Under the proposed rules, provided an applicable memorandum of understanding was in place, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment could request relevant wage and salary information held by Inland Revenue. This could provide crucial evidence to disprove the validity of employment agreements signed and statements made by the employers to conceal the offending. 7 Australian position on sharing information to combat serious offences 2.13 In Australia, legislation passed in 2010 allows information held by the Australian Tax Office to be disclosed to specified law enforcement agencies to combat serious offences (defined as offences that carry a sentence of more than 12 months and can be tried by jury). 5 Information can also be disclosed to taskforces and Royal Commissions. Previously, the Australian position was to allow information to be disclosed to law enforcement agencies, but this information could not be used for the prosecution of offences. This restriction has now been removed. 2.14 According to Australian officials, the most common circumstance in which information is provided under the Australian provision is following a request by an enforcement agency (rather than proactive sharing by the Australian Taxation Office). 2.15 The Australian legislation also governs the use of information once it has been disclosed to a law enforcement agency and sets out penalties for misuse of the information. Disclosure is permitted to authorised law enforcement agency officers when the disclosure is for the purpose of:  investigating a serious offence;  enforcing a law, the contravention of which is a serious offence; or  making, proposed or possible making, of a “proceeds of crime” order. 2.16 Disclosures are also permitted to:  an authorised Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) officer for the purpose of performing ASIO’s function under subsection 17(1) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979;  a Project Wickenby officer, or a court or tribunal when the disclosure is for or in connection with a purpose of the Project Wickenby Taskforce 6 ;  a taskforce officer of a prescribed taskforce, or a court or tribunal where the disclosure is for, or in connection with a purpose of the prescribed taskforce;  a Royal Commission (if the Letters Patent declare that the Royal Commission is one to which disclosure is permitted) where disclosure is for the purpose of the Royal Commission conducting its inquiry;  a State or Territory Royal Commission, commission or board of inquiry (if the regulations declare that disclosure is permitted) where disclosure is for the purpose of: – investigating a serious offence; 5 Tax Laws Amendment (Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information) Act 2010 (Cth). 6 The Project Wickenby Taskforce is a cross-agency taskforce comprising eight Australian federal agencies, including the Australian Taxation Office. The key aims of the Taskforce are to address international tax evasion in the Australian tax system and to deter, detect and disrupt internal tax evasion and money laundering. 8 – enforcing a law, the contravention of which is a serious offence; or – the making, or proposed or possible making, of a “proceeds of crime” order. 2.17 The Australian Project Wickenby Taskforce provides an example of the effectiveness of tax authorities working with other law enforcement agencies. While largely tax fraud-focused, the Taskforce has also achieved significant results in dealing with money laundering and recovering proceeds of crime through inter-agency cooperation and information-sharing. The Taskforce’s activities include intelligence-sharing, tax audits, criminal investigations, prosecutions and education programmes. International conventions regarding domestic information-sharing 2.18 In response to increasing concerns over money laundering, the Financial Action Taskforce on Money Laundering (FATF) was established by the G-7 Summit held in Paris in 1989. FATF, which includes New Zealand, was given the responsibility of examining money-laundering techniques and trends, reviewing actions which had already been taken at a national or international level, and setting out further measures to combat money laundering. 2.19 In April 1990, FATF issued 40 recommendations which were intended to provide a comprehensive plan of action to fight money laundering. In 2001, a further eight special recommendations in relation to terrorist financing were added. In October 2004 FATF published a ninth special recommendation further strengthening the agreed international standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. 2.20 A thorough review of the recommendations was completed in February 2012 with the publication of the revised FATF recommendations. The revised recommendations have been extensively amended for a variety of purposes including: to deal with threats such as financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to allow a risk-based approach to regulation and compliance; and to place greater emphasis on effectiveness of implementation of the standards. 2.21 The revised recommendations are intended to strengthen global safeguards and protect the integrity of the financial system by providing governments with stronger tools to take action against financial crime. Sharing Inland Revenue information on serious offences would be consistent with the goals of FATF as information sharing is a key aspect of the FATF recommendations. 2.22 New Zealand is also a party to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC). This convention requires participant parties to operate within their domestic capability to combat organised crime, and co-operate internationally to protect the international system from exploitation by organised criminal groups and networks. 9 2.23 In addition, New Zealand is a party to other multi-lateral treaties and involved in international forums which set or monitor best practices relevant to combating organised crime – for example, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering, concerned with implementation of the FATF recommendations in the Asia-Pacific region. 2.24 The New Zealand model has been identified as out of step with current international practices, which involve a high degree of cooperation between revenue authorities and law enforcement agencies, and use tax information in the detection and prosecution of both tax and non-tax crimes. 2.25 The OECD has identified New Zealand as unique in that prosecutions are often carried out directly by agencies such as Inland Revenue, the New Zealand Police or the Serious Fraud Office. The Secretariat has invited comment from New Zealand about what is essentially the tension between inter-agency prosecution co-operation and tax secrecy legislation. This discussion document focuses on that tension. 10 CHAPTER 3 Public attitudes to information-sharing 3.1 In 2010 Inland Revenue partnered with Colmar Brunton and the Chair of e- Government at Victoria University of Wellington to conduct research to better understand the public’s views on information, confidentiality of information and information-sharing between agencies. 7 3.2 Following the initial research project, Inland Revenue has undertaken further research specifically investigating attitudes towards sharing Inland Revenue information to improve the Government’s response to serious crime. The initial research project – public attitudes to information-sharing in the course of providing online services 3.3 The initial project took a qualitative research approach to explore attitudes of New Zealanders towards the collection, management and sharing of personal information, specifically in the course of providing online services. The project was carried out by researchers from Victoria University of Wellington, Inland Revenue and Colmar Brunton. A project advisory group consisted of representatives from Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development, the State Services Commission and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. 3.4 The project undertook a review of national and international research in the field and carried out semi-structured interviews with Inland Revenue staff about the conditions and future directions of providing online integrated public services. There were then 10 intensive focus group sessions with a total of 63 members of the public. Key findings 3.5 Most research participants had a positive attitude towards information- sharing, believing the practice enabled better public services and increased service effectiveness. The majority considered the Government’s information-sharing intentions and practices to be benign, and most placed high trust in the Government and its agencies. 3.6 However, some thought greater information-sharing increased the power imbalance between government and citizens, and eroded trust. Participants with a high dependency on social services, and Māori, Pasifika or self- employed participants were more likely to hold these attitudes. 7 Public attitudes to the sharing of personal information in the course of online service provision (Lips, Eppel, Cunningham & Hopkins-Burns, 2010). 11 3.7 Although participants were prepared to provide personal information to organisations in return for improved public services or other personal or collective benefits, they saw the need for government agencies to play by the rules by using the information provided only for its intended purpose and asking clients for consent. 3.8 Participants had little knowledge of how their personal information was stored, used or shared by government agencies. Further, they believed that greater sharing of information occurred than actually does in practice. 3.9 The accuracy of the information government agencies collected was of concern, particularly information used to categorise clients or determine their eligibility for social services. 3.10 Sensing a lack of transparency or encountering incompetent staff during a service interaction made participants uncomfortable and contributed to a desire for greater control over their personal information. 3.11 Participants supported information-sharing between agencies that were related by their roles and responsibilities, such as a social service cluster between Inland Revenue, Work and Income, and Housing New Zealand. 3.12 Participants shared personal information with government agencies to obtain a public service. Similarly, participants expected information-sharing between agencies to occur in order for them to obtain a public service – not for the explicit benefit of government agencies. Conclusions 3.13 The study suggested the context in which information-sharing between government agencies occurs is particularly important. 3.14 Findings indicated that information-sharing between government departments and agencies should occur with the customer in mind. Ideally the context within which personal information is shared should feature the following characteristics:  be transparent and have clearly defined boundaries;  be customer-centred and give the customer control;  be relevant to the specific public service cluster;  occur as part of a multi-channel service delivery strategy; and  relate to the customer’s service need. 12 Specific research on information-sharing in relation to dealing with serious crime 3.15 Inland Revenue partnered with an external research firm to conduct interviews and an online survey. The purpose of the research was to better understand how Inland Revenue’s involvement in information-sharing to support the Government’s response to serious crime could affect perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. 3.16 To support the research, an advisory group was established, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Justice, New Zealand Police, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Victoria University of Wellington and Inland Revenue. 3.17 Participants included senior government officials, experts in tax, law, media and information communication technologies, tax agents and intermediaries, and members of the business community. 3.18 The study employed a mixed-method approach, combining qualitative in- depth interviews with an online survey. In relation to identifying and/or stopping serious offending, the research sought to understand what information-sharing activities or practices are considered acceptable, the types of information that should be shared, and if increased information- sharing would have an adverse effect on the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system. 3.19 Four hypothetical information-sharing scenarios were developed for this study. The first involved Inland Revenue sharing information with New Zealand Police after discovering a serious offence during an audit. The second involved Inland Revenue sharing taxpayer information with members of a taskforce, and the third involved sharing a set of risk assessment scores with the New Zealand Police. The final scenario involved Inland Revenue supporting the Department of Internal Affairs by providing expertise and information. 3.20 The scenarios were deliberately designed to test the boundaries of acceptability of Inland Revenue’s involvement in cross-government information-sharing actions. These scenarios were not proposals but a way to determine what was and was not considered acceptable by the public. 3.21 Details about the research can be found at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. 3.22 Overall, the research found that Inland Revenue’s participation in information-sharing actions to address serious crime was considered to be acceptable if it was “fit-for-purpose”. If the Government proceeds with this approach a number of concerns raised by the research participants must be addressed. These include balancing the:  individual’s right to privacy with the social benefits to society;  nature of the serious crime with the type and breadth of information requested; 13  authority of the information with the ability of Inland Revenue to supply it; and  the intended and potential use of the information with the risk of error and its misuse. 3.23 It is also clear from the interview and survey data that cross-government information-sharing to address serious offending is an all-of-government issue and is not specific to Inland Revenue. Further, legislation must underpin any fit-for-purpose information-sharing action and this should signal the permission, controls and transparency the public requires. 3.24 Finally, tax secrecy does not appear to be a significant concern when considering Inland Revenue’s involvement in cross-government information- sharing to address serious crime. However, the potential impact on citizens’ trust in Inland Revenue and subsequent impact on the integrity of the tax system would need to be considered. Provided the Government communicates that Inland Revenue will share specific taxpayer information only under specific circumstances, both trust and integrity will be maintained in spite of selectively relaxing tax secrecy regulations to identify and stop serious crime. 14 CHAPTER 4 Information-sharing and protection of private information 4.1 Key issues in balancing information-sharing with protection of private information are setting a threshold for the definition of serious offences and having robust processes around that threshold to respect privacy. 4.2 The proposal is to allow Inland Revenue to release information only:  in relation to serious offences, being those punishable by imprisonment of four years or more, or, if committed by a body corporate is punishable by a fine only, but that would be punishable by imprisonment for four years or more if committed by an individual;  when there are reasonable grounds for the agency identifying the possible offence to suspect that a serious offence has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed;  when Inland Revenue considers there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the information is relevant in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or be evidence of, a serious offence that has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed; and  when Inland Revenue is satisfied that: – the information is readily available within Inland Revenue; – it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information; and – it is in the public interest to communicate it. Information released for serious offences only 4.3 We propose that New Zealand take a similar approach to that taken in Australia, 8 namely that disclosures to defined law enforcement agencies are permitted but only in relation to serious offences. 9 The Government considered and rejected a list of specified offences in relation to which Inland Revenue could share information as being impractical and hard to maintain. Instead, we propose a simple threshold of a serious offence. This would be when the offence is committed by an individual and is punishable by imprisonment of four years or more; or if a similarly serious offence is committed by a body corporate which would be punishable by imprisonment of four years or more if it had been committed by an individual. 8 As set out in chapter 2. 9 In Australia a serious offence is defined as one which carries a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or greater. We consider this threshold is somewhat low. 15 4.4 The threshold represents a judgement on what society views as a “serious offence”. A four-year threshold aligns with the threshold test for the offence of participation in an organised criminal group (set out in section 98A of the Crimes Act 1961). The four-year period is also consistent with the definition of a “serious crime” contained in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. 4.5 The threshold also includes offending carried out by bodies corporate. As a body corporate cannot be imprisoned, the threshold for “serious offending” by a body corporate is aligned to the penalty that would apply if the offending were carried out by an individual. 10 Therefore offences are treated equally, regardless of whether committed by an individual or a body corporate. 4.6 The test for releasing information should be as consistent as possible with the production order framework in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012. The agency requesting information (or Inland Revenue in the case of proactive disclosures) must therefore have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a specified person has committed, is committing, or will commit a serious offence, before a disclosure can be made. 4.7 Where the request is made by an agency to Inland Revenue, the burden for identifying reasonable grounds will fall on the agency making the information request. The requesting agency is best placed to make this assessment and will therefore be responsible for making the assessment. In then making a request, the agency is doing so on the undertaking that they are satisfied that reasonable grounds exist. Where Inland Revenue is making a proactive disclosure, Inland Revenue would be responsible for satisfying itself that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that a serious crime had been, was being, or would be committed. 4.8 Some cases will occur when a serious offence is suspected and information is shared by Inland Revenue but ultimately a person may not be charged with that serious offence but a lesser offence which may not have a maximum term of imprisonment of four or more years. Inland Revenue’s information would still be available for use by the enforcing agency in these cases. The alternative, that the information could not be used when a lesser charge is ultimately brought, is unattractive because the decision to share should be made on the information reasonably available at that time rather than after the event. 10 This approach is consistent with that taken to categorise offences for procedural purposes in the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 – see the section 6 definition of a category 3 offence. 16 Agencies Inland Revenue proposes to share with 4.9 The Government proposes allowing Inland Revenue to share information with any government agency that prosecutes offences meeting the proposed serious offences standard. This could potentially include a range of agencies, in addition to the New Zealand Police (for example, the Ministry of Primary Industries, the Department of Internal Affairs, the New Zealand Defence Force and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment). However, in practice, the majority of any sharing would be done with the New Zealand Police and those agencies prosecuting serious offences in the financial sector. 4.10 To give the public comfort that Inland Revenue will not conduct widespread taxpayer-specific information-sharing, a further filter is proposed, namely that information can be shared only when Inland Revenue and the other agency have a published memorandum of understanding. 4.11 It is expected that the number of cases of sharing will ramp up slowly to ensure that systems and processes can be established and tested for robustness. The actual number of cases when Inland Revenue will share information is hard to judge, but using information-sharing for criminal proceeds asset recovery purposes as a base case, the likely number is 400 to 600 cases per year from New Zealand Police. The Police are expected to be the most significant user of the proposed change in policy. International sharing of information on serious offences 4.12 By virtue of New Zealand’s double tax agreements, Inland Revenue is currently able to share information with certain foreign tax authorities. Further, New Zealand may provide and seek from other countries formal mutual legal assistance for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal matter pursuant to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992 (MACMA), which allows requests to be made under that Act, or on the basis of any relevant Convention or treaty covering mutual assistance, or where a foreign country is simply prepared to provide assistance. 4.13 The MACMA allows New Zealand to receive requests from all countries. It also allows for a broad range of assistance to be provided, including the registration of foreign restraining or forfeiture orders against the proceeds of criminal activity perpetrated in another country. 4.14 It is proposed that Inland Revenue be able to provide to other countries information about serious offences in accordance with the MACMA and any relevant treaty. This would be pursuant to a request made from the “Central Authority” in the foreign country to our Attorney-General. This would be either on request under MACMA or another regime or, in appropriate cases, on Inland Revenue’s initiative under a non-MACMA regime. The best way this could be managed is through using Crown Law as the channel for this communication rather than setting up multiple channels which may have infrequent use. 17 Reasonable grounds 4.15 When the serious offence standard is met, it is proposed that Inland Revenue must also consider whether there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the information is relevant in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or there is evidence of, a serious offence that has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed. 4.16 This is broadly consistent with the production order regime in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012, which allows for the provision of evidence or any other item, tangible or intangible, of relevance to the investigation of the offence. 11 It is slightly broader in that it is clear that information can be provided in relation to the prevention and detection of offences reflecting that the nature of Inland Revenue’s information is more likely to indicate an offence or possibility of an offence, rather than be clear evidence of an offence. 4.17 In determining whether the information Inland Revenue holds is relevant, it may be necessary for Inland Revenue to seek further details from the requesting agency. In addition, sufficient information will need to have been provided to ensure that a match is made to the correct individual or entity regarding which information is sought. There is also a question about whether Inland Revenue can then retain this information and use it for more general tax purposes. 4.18 Examples of the information that Inland Revenue may share under requests include:  Information Inland Revenue holds on a specified person: This may include their IRD number, entity information, the taxes for which they are registered, income history, tax payment history (including any compliance issues), types of income, expenses, asset and liability information, and actions taken or planned to be taken in relation to the specified person. The information provided may relate to a victim of a serious offence rather than the perpetrator of the offence.  Information Inland Revenue holds on other persons or entities that are associated with, or related to, the specified person: This may include information necessary to understand beneficial ownerships or the nature of the structures the specified person is involved with.  Information Inland Revenue holds that is aggregated, derived or inferred that is relevant to the specified person (or associated or related persons): This may include judgements about compliance behaviour, and judgements on possible approaches by the specified person to compliance with tax and other legal obligations. Information shared would include documents Inland Revenue may have that would support another agency’s enforcement action. 11 This test is also consistent with that used in the UK when considering whether a production order should be issued for HMRC information. 18 4.19 As noted in Chapter 3, research has indicated that overall, the sharing of information by Inland Revenue was seen as acceptable by research participants, as long as the information shared is fit-for-purpose. A requirement that information must be suspected to be of value in relation to the serious offence in question helps to ensure any information provided is fit-for-purpose. 4.20 Information such as the post-analysis suspicious transaction reports received by the New Zealand Police from financial institutions is considered to meet the reasonable grounds threshold for Inland Revenue to release information to the New Zealand Police. In these cases the goal of the New Zealand Police will be to improve their intelligence around a possible serious offence. Example scenario: Investigation of missing person suspected to be a probable homicide victim During a missing person investigation, enquiries indicate that it is unlikely the person has gone missing of their own volition but rather that it is likely the person has been the victim of foul play. A body has not been located. Under the proposed rules, New Zealand Police could request that Inland Revenue check for any tax activity in relation to the missing person on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to believe a homicide has been committed. Any information provided on the individual’s tax activity (or lack of activity) would need to be relevant to the investigation. Practicality of releasing the information 4.21 A final test is proposed to ensure the appropriate use of Inland Revenue’s resources. The test is essentially one of balancing the benefits of releasing information and the costs of preparing that information for release. Information would be provided only when:  the information is readily available within Inland Revenue;  it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information;  it is in the public interest to communicate it; and  the resources are available to Inland Revenue. Ensuring transparency of information-sharing and good process 4.22 Section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 states: Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, whether of the person, property, or correspondence or otherwise. 19 4.23 A primarily administrative decision-making approach for release of information is proposed. The decision about whether the serious offence requirement is met will lie with the agency identifying the serious offence. This could be Inland Revenue but the most common case will be another agency, such as the New Zealand Police. In relation to the information being of value and practical to disclose, it is proposed that Inland Revenue will make this decision. The administrative approach is consistent with the Australian model for this type of disclosure. 4.24 The key advantage of the proposed process is its efficiency, as decisions can be made quickly and at low cost. However, to ensure appropriate accountability it is proposed that if the information provided by Inland Revenue is used in a prosecution by another agency, at the time criminal disclosure obligations are triggered, the alleged offender must be informed that information was provided by Inland Revenue. This would enable the affected taxpayer (the alleged offender) to challenge the decision to release the information if they wish. At this point the Court may consider the evidence is inadmissible, either due to a problem with the release of the information or on other Evidence Act 2006 grounds (as is standard in the existing criminal disclosure and evidence admissibility processes). 4.25 This approach would have three benefits:  preserving the affected person’s privacy interests and rights under section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990;  ensuring that judicial scrutiny of the process is available when the information provided is used, but not burdening the judiciary with every information request or provision; and  providing a mechanism to ensure that decisions to release information are robust and appropriate by allowing for decisions to be reviewed. 4.26 In addition, should an individual have concerns about how their information has been treated they will be able to either use the internal complaint procedures of the agency concerned (Inland Revenue and/or the relevant enforcement agency) or seek assistance from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Ensuring robust administrative processes 4.27 It is proposed that there be a legislative requirement on agencies that a memorandum of understanding be entered into before Inland Revenue is permitted to share information. This will ensure appropriate processes and protections are clearly agreed between the parties before any sharing takes place. Each memorandum will make clear that Inland Revenue will not approach information release in an ad-hoc manner but rather with reasonable and robust decision-making processes being in place in both agencies. There will be requirements around security and on-use of information. 20 4.28 Bulk transfer of information is not proposed. Information will instead be provided on a case-by-case basis by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue takes very seriously its legal obligations to protect taxpayers’ secrecy and privacy rights. These rules are rigorously applied unless Parliament has sanctioned the release of certain tax information to other agencies for the greater public good of all New Zealanders. 4.29 Pursuant to international double taxation agreements, Inland Revenue has had many years of experience exchanging taxpayer and other sensitive information with New Zealand’s tax treaty partners. The team responsible for conducting such exchanges is very skilled in handling sensitive material and treating it accordingly. 4.30 New Zealand’s tax treaty exchange of information programme has recently been examined in detail by the OECD and the Global Forum and is highly regarded internationally. The process for dealing with exchanges of information internationally therefore offers a suitable model to follow when considering sharing Inland Revenue information domestically with relevant New Zealand enforcement agencies. 4.31 Inland Revenue and the relevant partner enforcement agencies will be required to follow the rules for sharing serious offence information (including using it only for the nominated specific purposes). Any breaches of those agreed rules would be treated as serious, and appropriate sanctions would be applied accordingly, as is currently the case for other privacy or secrecy breaches. 4.32 It is proposed that dedicated liaison points be established in each relevant agency with suitable oversight by appropriately qualified senior officer(s) that would conduct the actual exchanges of information. Only a few key personnel in each agency would have the power to engage in sharing information with a partner agency’s liaison team. In this way, consistency of approach and management can be assured and a good working relationship built up between relevant partner agencies to quickly address any operational issues that might arise. 4.33 Appropriate IT encryption solutions can be used to ensure that the physical transmission and sharing of protected data is done in a lawful way and that any loss of data in transit is avoided. 4.34 To support a transparent process, it is also proposed that Inland Revenue’s Annual Report outlines the sharing of information that has taken place. Inland Revenue would work with the Ministry of Justice to establish the details of such reporting. 21 Legislative framework 4.35 Two possible alternatives have been considered for the legislative framework to govern the proposed sharing:  an information-sharing agreement authorised by Order in Council under part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993; or  enacting a new stand-alone framework in the Tax Administration Act (a new specific exception to section 81). 4.36 The Privacy Amendment Act 2013 amended the Privacy Act 1993 and the Tax Administration Act to improve public service delivery by facilitating information-sharing between government agencies when there is a public service benefit. It allows information-sharing agreements to be authorised by Order in Council following a mandated process of consideration and consultation, including with the Privacy Commissioner. 4.37 The Tax Administration Amendment Act 2013, allows personal information about an identifiable individual to be supplied by Inland Revenue, when an information-sharing agreement authorised by an Order in Council in accordance with the Privacy Act 2013 is in force. This acts as an exception to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act in respect of information about individual taxpayers, but not information about taxpayers that are non- individuals, such as companies. While it is expected that the majority of information-sharing under this proposal will relate to individuals, more generally consideration is being given to a further amendment to the Tax Administration Act to apply the Privacy Act framework (or something similar) to information-sharing about non-individuals. 4.38 The Government’s preference is to use part 9A of the Privacy Act, recognising that an additional amendment to the Tax Administration Act may be necessary to enable the sharing of non-individual taxpayers’ information in the same manner. 4.39 This information-sharing proposal falls within the framework contained in the Privacy Act. That framework offers appropriate consultation, oversight and protections. The Government prefers not to see further proliferation of individual rules for information-sharing between government agencies, preferring a consistent approach. A consistent approach also ensures that citizens can more easily access and understand the rules under which their information is able to be shared. 22 Sharing in practice 4.40 As Inland Revenue does not often come across serious crimes in the course of its day-to-day business, the most common example of information-sharing would be as a result of a request from the New Zealand Police or other enforcement agency when they suspect a serious offence has been committed, is being committed or will be committed. 4.41 Inland Revenue’s financial focus means that, on the rare occasions serious offences are seen in the course of the department’s activities, these offences tend to be financial in nature. However, sometimes Inland Revenue also becomes aware of non-financial crimes such as smuggling or drug offences. 4.42 This financial focus will also drive the type of information that is sought from Inland Revenue and, to an extent, the types of serious offences in relation to which information is sought. For example, it is more likely that Inland Revenue would have information that would assist the investigation of financial crime such as serious fraud or money laundering, rather than information that would assist in cases of serious physical offences. 4.43 An example of the type of offence Inland Revenue does occasionally discover is a recent investigation into PAYE offending. This investigation, carried out in relation to suspected tax offending, provided evidence suggesting that a businessman had set up complex business and tax structures, with appropriate cut-offs through a professional trustee company, to orchestrate tax evasion. This tax evasion was addressed as part of Inland Revenue’s enforcement activities. However, the investigation also disclosed probable and significant fraud against another major government department and, incidentally, also a trustee. (The trustee was potentially liable to Inland Revenue for the PAYE on the basis of knowledge attributable to the trustee but actually committed by a dishonest accomplice of the businessman.) Inland Revenue was unable to advise the other department and the trustee which meant the businessman could not be stopped and the transactions could not be raised with other government enforcement agencies. Example scenario: Income suppression resulting in identification of suspected wildlife smuggling During a tax audit investigation it becomes obvious that significant funds flowing through a taxpayer’s bank account are not related to the core business. Further investigation reveals the potential for this taxpayer to be involved in smuggling wildlife out of New Zealand. This is potentially an offence under section 44 of the Trade in Endangered Species Act 1989. Under the proposed rules, Inland Revenue could inform the Department of Conservation of a suspected offence. Inland Revenue could then provide bank account information and records of statements made by the taxpayer in interviews to the Department of Conservation to assist with the investigation into the suspected offence. 23 Protections for citizens 4.44 The Government takes very seriously the need for agencies to protect citizens’ privacy and to manage their information securely. Equally, government agencies need to be able to use and share information when appropriate, to deliver services and meet the needs of citizens, both individually and collectively as a society. 4.45 The controls and processes set out in this document have been designed to minimise any risk of a privacy breach occurring as a result of the proposed information-sharing. Sharing can only occur in a narrowly defined set of circumstances, requires a memorandum of understanding to be in place between Inland Revenue and the recipient agency, and will be carried out by a single small experienced team within Inland Revenue. Responsibility for sharing will sit with designated senior personnel in each involved agency. 4.46 Citizens have a number of rights and options available to them in terms of ensuring their information is treated appropriately, which will apply in relation to information shared under the proposed new rules:  Individuals have the right under the Privacy Act 1993 to seek access to information held about them by an agency, and to seek to have that information corrected if it is not accurate.  If an individual has concerns about how their information has been treated they are able to either use the internal complaint procedures of the agency concerned (Inland Revenue and/or the relevant enforcement agency) or seek assistance from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.  When information is provided under the proposed rules to an enforcement agency, and that agency proposes to use the information in a resulting prosecution, that information must be disclosed under the usual Criminal Disclosure Act 2008 obligations, and any dispute about the provision of the information will then be handled by the courts under the provisions of that legislation.  Inland Revenue officers who knowingly disclose information other than in accordance with the legally permitted exceptions to the secrecy rule face potential criminal liability under section 143C of the Tax Administration Act. 4.47 In the event that, despite the protections in place, a privacy breach does occur, designated senior personnel in the relevant agencies will meet immediately to assess the issue and manage the response. This is chiefly to ensure that any affected individuals are identified as quickly as possible and all necessary steps are taken to minimise and/or mitigate any risk to those individuals. If there is considered to be a risk of on-going breaches, information-sharing will be immediately suspended. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner will be notified and involved where this is appropriate. 24 Questions for submitters 4.48 Submissions on any of the matters outlined in this chapter are welcomed, including:  whether it is reasonable to define a “serious offence” as one being punishable by imprisonment of four years or more;  the approach of making information available to all enforcement agencies rather than simply the New Zealand Police;  how information Inland Revenue receives from enforcement agencies to support their requests for information should be treated;  whether it is acceptable to share tax information with international agencies;  whether the proposed Privacy (Information-sharing) Bill framework is an acceptable mechanism for the proposed information-sharing, alongside a possible further amendment to the Tax Administration Act to extend its coverage to non-individuals; and  whether it is reasonable to take a primarily administrative decision- making approach for release of information (compared with using court orders or requiring Ministerial approval) with alleged offenders being informed of the information being released if it is used in a prosecution (allowing any challenge to be undertaken to the admissibility of the material as evidence at this point). 25 CHAPTER 5 Benefits and risks of increased information-sharing 5.1 This chapter discusses whether the benefits of taxpayer secrecy outweigh the costs of not sharing information in relation to serious offences. Benefits from increased information-sharing 5.2 The role of Inland Revenue has become increasingly complex. Correspondingly, the information held by Inland Revenue about individuals, families, relationships and personal lives has generally become more detailed. Inland Revenue manages sensitive information such as information on personal income, family relationships, child support and savings. People have a reasonable expectation that the information they provide will be treated confidentially. The Government does not intend to change this default position. It is considering whether that expectation of confidentiality should apply to information which may be relevant to the detection, prevention and prosecution of serious crime. 5.3 Possible benefits of increased information-sharing in relation to serious offending include:  A reduction in offending: Society as a whole would benefit if those committing offences such as serious fraud were apprehended and stopped earlier or the offending was prevented altogether.  Increased government effectiveness: Tax secrecy may maximise tax revenue but this may be at the cost of the integrity of other government functions, such as preventing fraud, protecting investors, and preventing harm to vulnerable individuals and groups in society.  Better use of specialist resources: If more information were shared by Inland Revenue, other agencies could use their own resources more efficiently and conduct their investigations in a more timely and efficient manner. The availability of additional information may also, in some cases, result in investigations not being pursued against individuals or entities as the further information discloses that no offending is in fact occurring. This is both a more efficient use of specialist resources and potentially reduces the period of intrusion of law enforcement agencies into citizens’ affairs.  Alignment with international tax information-sharing norms: There is increasing pressure internationally for greater information- sharing in order to combat organised and financial crimes. In relation to domestic information-sharing, New Zealand is currently out-of-step with international norms. This has the potential to adversely affect New Zealand’s international agreements, result in New Zealand being on grey and black lists, and make it more difficult for New Zealanders to do business internationally. 26  Increased fairness: Inland Revenue currently shares information to reduce social welfare abuse, but does not share information to prevent other crimes such as significant white-collar crime. This could be seen as discriminatory. It may also affect perception of fairness across the tax system and the fairness of government more generally. Improving the Government’s response to organised crime 5.4 The Government has an on-going programme of responding to organised crime. Currently, improvements are being made in the areas of:  information-sharing;  mutual legal assistance both domestically and internationally;  protections against misuse of legal structures such as use of companies and trusts to alienate or disguise beneficial ownership;  protection against bribery and corruption, money laundering and cyber- crime;  investigation and enforcement; and  protection against identity crime. 5.5 Inland Revenue’s view is that the proposed amendments to the current secrecy rules could significantly increase the effectiveness of its contribution to the Government’s response to organised crime. This conclusion is based on Inland Revenue’s recent participation in a criminal taskforce. Inland Revenue’s inability to share information affected the taskforce’s efficiency by:  not being able to provide relevant contextual information; and  reducing the scope for Inland Revenue to be an effective part of the taskforce’s efforts to achieve its goals. 5.6 Having access to Inland Revenue’s information would have contributed to the taskforce achieving a speedier result. Revenue impact 5.7 The Government does not see a tax revenue benefit from the information- sharing proposals. In fact, it is likely that tax revenue will be reduced to the extent that tax currently is paid on financial offences. However, any reduction in revenue is likely to be offset by revenue gains from reduced financial crime, some of which may be against the Government or against taxpayers who report less income as a consequence of the crime. On balance, the fiscal implications of this proposal are most likely neutral to the Crown. 27 Likely costs of increased information-sharing 5.8 The main risk is to voluntary compliance as taxpayers, both those who are committing serious offences and others, reduce their compliance with tax obligations because they find information-sharing by Inland Revenue unacceptable. 5.9 Inland Revenue believes that the impact on voluntary compliance by those who are committing serious offences is likely to be small. Its judgement is that those who commit crime tend to commit crime across all their responsibilities as citizens, including tax. 5.10 Based on research conducted by Inland Revenue, it is likely that only a small minority will disagree with the proposals and, as a result, attempt to modify their tax compliance. However, most taxpayers are likely to consider increased information-sharing improves both the fairness of government and the tax system. 5.11 There is some risk that information-sharing could result in a secrecy breach. This could bring information-sharing more generally into disrepute. A related point is that any information-sharing also carries a risk of sharing inaccurate information or information about the wrong individual or entity. However, officials have assured the Government their emphasis will be on the integrity of process and they will work closely with the Privacy Commissioner. Conclusion 5.12 The Government believes the benefits of information-sharing with other enforcement agencies can be supported in the case of serious offences. The proposed information-sharing has several potential benefits, such as increased fairness, reduction in offending, increased government effectiveness and better use of specialist resources. The risks, chiefly the risk of reducing voluntary compliance, are likely to be small, and are outweighed by the potential benefits of the proposal. 5.13 The proposal is consistent with the key “fit-for-purpose” features identified by research participants as necessary to ensure sharing was within acceptable bounds. 12 It is less consistent with the features identified in the earlier research. In relation to the factors summarised at paragraph 3.14, we consider the proposal demonstrates transparency, defined boundaries and is relevant to the specific public sector cluster that is responsible for enforcement. Factors relating to customer control and service needs are not the focus of this discussion document. 12 See chapter 3. 28 Example scenario: Investigation of identity fraud against Inland Revenue highlighting wider identity offence Inland Revenue identifies an individual who has defrauded Inland Revenue using false identities. During investigation of the individual, Inland Revenue discovers that the same identities have been used to perpetrate frauds against other institutions including banks, government agencies and retailers. Under the proposed rules, Inland Revenue could inform the New Zealand Police of the individual and provide relevant supporting information, including a list of those other taxpayers who may have been defrauded. Questions for submitters 5.14 Submissions on any of the matters outlined in this chapter are welcomed, including:  possible other benefits of information-sharing by Inland Revenue to prevent serious offences; and  the judgement that the risks of Inland Revenue sharing information are minor if sharing is limited to serious offences.
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME 1 The Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, Desiring to conclude an Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, Have agreed as follows: 2 Article 1 PERSONS COVERED This Agreement shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 3 Article 2 TAXES COVERED 1. This Agreement shall apply to taxes on income imposed on behalf of a Contracting State, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. 2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income all taxes imposed on total income, or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, and taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises. 3. The existing taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are in particular: (a) In New Zealand: the income tax (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”); (b) In Viet Nam: (i) the personal income tax; and (ii) the business income tax (hereinafter referred to as “Vietnamese tax”). 4. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes which have been made in their respective taxation laws. 4 Article 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term “Viet Nam” means the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam; when used in a geographical sense, it means its land territory, islands, internal waters, territorial sea and airspace above them, the maritime areas beyond territorial sea including seabed and subsoil thereof over which the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam exercises sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in accordance with national legislation and international law; (b) the term “New Zealand” means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (c) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (d) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (e) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (f) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (g) the term “competent authority” means: (i) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; and (ii) in the case of Viet Nam, the Minister of Finance or an authorised representative; (h) the term “national”, in relation to a Contracting State, means: (i) in the case of Viet Nam, any individual possessing the nationality of Viet Nam and in the case of New Zealand, any individual possessing the citizenship of New Zealand; and 5 (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State; (i) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean New Zealand or Viet Nam as the context requires. 2. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. 6 Article 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of domicile, residence, place of registration, place of incorporation, place of management, or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State or any local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the individual’s status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual’s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which the individual has an habitual abode; (c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; (d) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. If the State in which the place of effective management is situated cannot be determined, or the place of effective management is in neither State, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement in accordance with Article 24 the Contracting State of which the person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purpose of the Agreement, having regard to its places of management, the place where it is registered or incorporated and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Agreement. 7 Article 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop; (f) a warehouse; and (g) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 6 months. 4. The term “permanent establishment” likewise encompasses the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise for such purpose, but only if activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within a Contracting State for a period or periods aggregating more than 6 months within any 12 month period. 5. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if: (a) it carries on activities in that State which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or (b) it operates substantial equipment in that State. 6. For the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3 and 4, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 8 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage or display of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage or display; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 9 applies – is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or (b) habitually maintains in the first-mentioned State a stock of goods or merchandise from which he regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of the enterprise; or (c) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 9. An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other Contracting State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise, and conditions are made or imposed between that enterprise and the agent in their commercial and financial relations which differ from those which would have been made between independent enterprises, the agent will not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph. 9 10. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other Contracting State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. 10 Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, any natural resources, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. 5. Any right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. 11 Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to: (a) that permanent establishment; or (b) sales in that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through that permanent establishment. It is understood that the profits of an enterprise shall include profits attributable to sales of goods and merchandise referred to in this subparagraph only when the competent authority of the Contracting State in which a permanent establishment of the enterprise is situated considers that the enterprise has entered into an arrangement in relation to the sales of those goods or merchandise to avoid taxation of those profits in that Contracting State. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the business of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices. 12 4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude such Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article. 5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 6. Where: (a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident’s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 8. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. 13 Article 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. 14 Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 15 Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which holds directly at least 50 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and (b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, mining shares, founders' shares or other rights participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other Contracting State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other Contracting State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other Contracting State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other Contracting State. 6. No relief shall be available under this Article if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that 16 is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. 17 Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other Contracting State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base, or with (b) activities referred to in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 7. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment or a fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or a fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last- mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 7. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the interest, the 18 creation or assignment of the debt-claim or other rights in respect of which the interest is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the person which is the beneficial owner of the interest or the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. 19 Article 12 ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright (including the use of or the right to use any copyright of literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works, sound recordings, films, broadcasts, cable programmes, or typographical arrangements of published editions), patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trade-mark, or other like property or right; (b) the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; (c) knowledge or information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience; (d) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (c); or (e) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other Contracting State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base, or with (b) activities referred to in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 7. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent 20 establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 7. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the royalties, or with the creation or assignment of the rights in respect of which the royalties are paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the person which is the beneficial owner of the royalties or the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. 21 Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or comparable interests in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of real property situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Agreement affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. 22 Article 14 INDEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State unless such services are performed in the other Contracting State and: (a) the individual is present in the other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 12 month period commencing or ending in the taxation year concerned; or (b) a fixed base is regularly available to the individual in the other State for the purpose of performing the individual’s activities. If the provisions of subparagraphs (a) or (b) are satisfied, the income may be taxed in that other State but only so much of it as is attributable to activities performed during such period or periods or from that fixed base. 2. The term “professional services” includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants. 23 Article 15 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other Contracting State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 12 month period commencing or ending in the taxation year concerned, and (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and (c) the remuneration is neither borne by nor deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 24 Article 16 DIRECTORS’ FEES Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 25 Article 17 ENTERTAINERS AND SPORTSPERSONS 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived from activities performed in a Contracting State by entertainers or sportspersons if the visit to that State is wholly or mainly supported by public funds of one or both of the Contracting States. In such a case, the income is taxable only in the Contracting State in which the entertainer or the sportsperson is a resident. 26 Article 18 PENSIONS Pensions and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. 27 Article 19 GOVERNMENT SERVICE 1. (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than pensions) paid by the Government of a Contracting State or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government or local authority shall be taxable only in that State. (b) However, such payments shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that Contracting State and the individual is a resident of that Contracting State who: (i) is a national of that Contracting State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that Contracting State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles 15, 16 and 17 shall apply to payments in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Government or a local authority referred to in paragraph 1. 28 Article 20 STUDENTS 1. Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. 2. Remuneration which a student or business apprentice who is or was formerly a resident of a Contracting State derives from an employment which the student or business apprentice exercises in the other Contracting State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the income year concerned shall not be taxed in that other State if the employment is directly related to the individual’s studies or apprenticeship carried out in the first-mentioned State. 29 Article 21 OTHER INCOME 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to the income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other Contracting State. 30 Article 22 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. In Viet Nam, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: (a) Where a resident of Viet Nam derives income or gains which under the law of New Zealand and in accordance with this Agreement may be taxed in New Zealand, Viet Nam shall allow as a credit against its tax on the income, or capital an amount equal to the tax paid in New Zealand. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the Vietnamese tax on that income, profits or gains computed in accordance with the taxation laws and regulations of Viet Nam. (b) Where a resident of Viet Nam derives income or gains which in accordance with any provision of the Agreement are taxable only in New Zealand, Viet Nam may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident in Viet Nam, take into account the exempted income or gains. 2. In New Zealand, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: (a) Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Vietnamese tax paid under the laws of Viet Nam and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Viet Nam (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. (b) Where in accordance with any provisions of the Agreement income derived by a resident of New Zealand is exempt from tax in New Zealand, New Zealand may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income. 3. For the purpose of paragraph 2(a) of this Article: (a) the tax paid in Viet Nam on dividends to which paragraph 2 of Article 10 applies, on interest to which paragraph 2 of Article 11 applies, and on royalties to which paragraph 2 of Article 12 applies, shall be deemed to include an amount of tax specified in paragraph 3(b) of this Article when such tax would have been payable as Vietnamese tax but for an exemption from or a reduction of tax granted for that year or any part thereof as a result of the application of the provisions of Vietnamese law designed to provide tax incentives to promote foreign investment for development purposes. 31 (b) For the purpose of sub-paragraph 3(a) of this Article, the amount of tax paid deemed to be paid in Viet Nam on dividends to which paragraph 2 of Article 10 applies, on interest to which paragraph 2 of Article 11 applies, and on royalties to which paragraph 2 of Article 12 applies, shall be deemed to be 5 per cent of the gross amount of such dividends to which subparagraph 2(a) applies, 15 per cent of the gross amount of such dividends to subparagraph 2(b) applies, 10 per cent of the gross amount of such interest and 10 per cent of the gross amount of such royalties. 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a) of this Article, a New Zealand resident deriving income from Viet Nam, being income referred to in that paragraph, shall not be deemed to have paid Vietnamese tax in respect of such income where: (a) the New Zealand resident is a financial institution or is associated with a financial institution; (b) the competent authority of New Zealand considers, after consultation with the competent authority of Viet Nam, that it is inappropriate to do so having regard to: (i) whether any prearrangements have been entered into by any person for the purpose of taking advantage of paragraph 3(a) for the benefit of that person or any other person; (ii) whether any benefit accrues or may accrue to a person who is neither a New Zealand resident nor a Vietnamese resident; (iii) the prevention of fraud or the avoidance of the taxes to which this Agreement applies; (iv) any other matter which either competent authority considers relevant in the particular circumstances of the case, including any submissions from the New Zealand resident concerned. 5. The provision of paragraph 3 of this Article shall only apply for a period of 10 years after the date on which the Agreement enters into force. 32 Article 23 NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to individuals who are residents of the other Contracting State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to its own residents. 3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 6 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected. 5. The provisions of this Article shall apply only to the taxes covered in this Agreement. 33 Article 24 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person who is a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of the competent authority of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. 34 Article 25 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy. 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. 35 Article 26 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. 36 Article 27 ENTRY INTO FORCE Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other through diplomatic channels of the completion of the procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Agreement. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of January following the calendar year in which the Agreement enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any taxation year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (b) in Viet Nam: (i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, in relation to taxable amounts as derived on or after the first day of January following the calendar year in which the Agreement enters into force, and in subsequent calendar years; and (ii) in respect of other Vietnamese taxes, in relation to income, profits or gains arising on or after the first day of January following the calendar year in which the Agreement enters into force, and in subsequent calendar years. 37 Article 28 TERMINATION This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the Agreement shall cease to have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of January following the calendar year in which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any taxation year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; (b) in Viet Nam: (i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, in relation to taxable amounts as derived on or after the first day of January following the calendar year in which the notice of termination has been received, and in subsequent calendar years; and (ii) in respect of other Vietnamese taxes, in relation to income, profits or gains arising on or after the first day of January following the calendar year in which the notice of termination has been received, and in subsequent calendar years.

That means a person’s liability for tax should be as clear and as certain as possible, especially in New Zealand where the tax system is based on self-assessment. This issues paper focuses on the taxation of land disposal provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, in particular section CB 6, which is causing some considerable uncertainty for taxpayers, their agents and Inland Revenue. 1.2 Section CB 6 deals with land acquired for the purpose of, or with the intention of disposal, and the taxation of income derived from disposing of the land. If a taxpayer acquires the land with the intention or purpose of disposal and subsequently disposes of the land, any profit made from the disposal is taxable. 1.3 The uncertainty is caused by the timing of when the taxpayer’s intention or purpose should be determined. The Courts have held that intention or purpose should be tested when a taxpayer has acquired the land in question (known as the date of acquisition). However because the definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act 2007 includes estates and interests in land, and the taxpayer acquires different interests and estates in “land” at different times under a typical sale and purchase agreement, which are then merged when the title is registered, neither the legislation nor common law have provided sufficient clarity over which interest in “land” the date of acquisition should apply to. 1.4 As a result, taxpayers may be unable to self-assess whether gains made from a disposal of land should be returned as taxable income. Often taxpayers are only made aware of a tax liability as a result of an Inland Revenue audit. 1.5 There are two possible ways of interpreting section CB 6:  The “first interest interpretation” whereby the date of acquisition is the date when the first interest (equitable or legal) in land arises under an agreement for the sale and purchase of land (the “first interest” interpretation). Under this interpretation the date of acquisition is likely to be either the date the sale and purchase agreement is entered into or the date when the conditions of the agreement are fulfilled (that is, the purchaser is able to enforce the agreement).  The “disposal” interpretation whereby the date of acquisition is dependent on the interest or estate that is disposed of and when the taxpayer acquired that particular interest or estate in land. This can occur at any point in the agreement. 1.6 There are potentially numerous dates of acquisition in each interpretation, as shown in the following diagram. 2 1.7 The two different interpretations have sometimes resulted in taxpayer uncertainty about which date to apply to their land transaction(s) and, in some cases, unintended tax outcomes. This can be a particular problem when land has been purchased off the plans and the land title has not yet been registered. This is exacerbated if agreements for the sale and purchase of land span a number of months or years or if the interest in land is assigned or disposed of to another person before the title transfer is registered. 1.8 From a tax policy perspective, the “first interest” interpretation, whereby the intention or purpose of the taxpayer is tested on the date the first interest (equitable or legal) arises in a sale and purchase agreement, is the preferred interpretation as it results in greater certainty and therefore is more economically efficient. It is the initial decision-making that informs how a person intends to use the property, and it would be unusual for a property speculator to enter into a sale and purchase agreement unless they thought it very likely that the purchase and its subsequent disposal would be profitable. 1.9 This issues paper discusses:  the reasons for the “first interest” interpretation being preferred over the “disposal” interpretation;  the arguments for and against the possible phases that the date of acquisition could be set at in the first interest interpretation (either when the agreement is entered into, or the agreement becomes unconditional and the purchaser can seek enforcement of the agreement); and  whether further guidance is needed on evidential issues that may arise due to the date of acquisition falling at the earlier phases of a sale and purchase agreement. 1.10 It is acknowledged that if the Government chooses to clarify the date of acquisition, taxpayers will have the opportunity to alter their behaviour under either interpretation to avoid evidence of having an intention or purpose of resale. It may also capture some taxpayers for whom the policy is not intended. However, this risk already exists under the current legislation and if the legislation is sufficiently clarified, greater transparency should benefit all parties. 1.11 As mentioned above, this issues paper focuses on section CB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 however, the date of acquisition affects most of the land provisions in subpart CB. Therefore clarifying the date of acquisition in section CB 6 will be a positive step towards clarifying most of the land 3 taxing provisions in sections CB 7, CB 9, CB 10, CB 14, CB 15, CB 18 and CB 19. Suggested options 1.12 This paper suggests two possible options for determining a date of acquisition, based on events/phases of an agreement for the sale and purchase of land − either: Option 1 when an agreement for the sale and purchase of land is entered into; or Option 2 when an agreement for the sale and purchase of land becomes unconditional and the equitable remedy of specific performance of the land transfer is available to the purchaser. 1.13 We welcome views on these two options and also whether a legislative amendment is needed that allows for evidence presented before and after the date of acquisition to be considered when determining what the taxpayer’s intention was on the date of acquisition. Application date 1.14 For ease of administration and in the interests of fairness, if the Government does decide to clarify the date of acquisition following feedback on the options presented here, we suggest that the date of application for any legislative option (that is, for new acquisitions as opposed to new disposals) be prospective from the date of Royal assent of the relevant tax bill.

In particular, section CB 6 deals with land acquired for the purpose of or with the intention of disposal, and the taxation of income derived from the disposing of the land. Therefore if a taxpayer acquires the land with the intention or purpose of disposal and subsequently disposes of the land, any profit they make from the disposal is taxable. 2.2 The legislative history of section CB 6 is lengthy, as the profits made from the sale or disposition of real property were first considered to be a source of “business income” in the Land and Income Assessment Act 1891. The Appendix to this paper provides further background information on the history and treatment of this provision. 2.3 The policy intent of this section is to capture property speculators, who can be described as persons who buy and sell land with the intent or purpose of making a profit without necessarily developing or improving the land, and relying instead on chance, trend or volatility of the property market to provide financial gain. 2.4 This was clarified in Hansard when the Land and Income Assessment Act 1908 was amended by the Land and Income Assessment Amendment Act 1912: 1 This is not an alteration in the law, but for the purpose of making the present Act clearer. Persons who speculate in land are liable to assessment for income tax on the profits from buying and selling the land. 2.5 The key distinction between section CB 6 and a capital gains tax is the subjective element, as the tax burden only falls on those who have the necessary intention or purpose to use land as if it were a trading asset. In this way the section attempts to distinguish between those who hold land as a capital asset and those who hold it as a revenue item. The economic rationale is that if a person is consciously transacting so as to make gains from buying and selling land without being taxed on these gains, it would be inefficient for them to divert work effort away from taxable activities towards this task. 2.6 Although this issues paper focuses on section CB 6, the date of acquisition affects most of the land provisions in subpart CB. Therefore clarifying the date of acquisition will also increase certainty in relation to most of the following land-taxing provisions:  section CB 15 clarifies when land is acquired by associated persons for most of the land provisions in subpart CB;  sections CB 7, CB 9, CB 10, and CB 14 clarify when the 10-year period begins for a business dealing in land (including land 1 (29 August 1912) 159 NZPD 624. 6 development, subdivisions, and change of land under the Resource Management Act 1991); and  sections CB 18 and CB 19, which clarify when land is acquired for the purposes of the residential and business exemption. The issue: applying different dates of acquisition 2.7 The uncertainty this issues paper seeks to address is caused by the timing of when the taxpayer’s intention or purpose should be tested. The Courts have held that the relevant time for determining a taxpayer’s purpose or intention is at the time the taxpayer acquired the land. 2 The appropriate time at which to consider a taxpayer’s intention or purpose under this provision is the date of its acquisition of the land. 2.8 However there is minimal case law to provide sufficient guidance on when acquisition actually occurs. 2.9 The tax case Beetham v CIR held that land is acquired when the parties to an agreement become bound by the contract to purchase and to sell that is, when the contract becomes unconditional, and an order for specific performance of the land transfer is available. 3 2.10 However Bevin v Smith, a non-tax case held that under the general law a purchaser acquires an equitable interest in land if specific performance in its wider sense (for example, caveat or damages) is available to protect the purchaser’s rights under the contract. 4 Specific performance in this case means all the equitable remedies are available to protect the interest of the purchaser under the contract, so it is a question of whether equity will, by injunction or otherwise, prevent the vendor from dealing with the property in a way that is inconsistent with the contract of sale. 2.11 The interpretation of these two cases (and those that followed) has resulted in a number of differing views over when land is acquired. 2.12 Furthermore because the definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act 2007 includes estates and interests in land, and the taxpayer acquires different interests and estates in “land” under a typical sale and purchase agreement which are then merged when the title is registered, neither the legislation nor common law have provided sufficient clarity over which “land” the date of acquisition should apply to. Possible interpretations of section CB 6 2.13 There are two reasonable interpretations of this section. The first is that the date of acquisition is the date when the first interest (equitable or legal) in land arises under an agreement for the sale and purchase of land (the “first interest” interpretation). The date of acquisition would therefore fall in one of the initial phases of a sale and purchase agreement, either: 2 AnzamcoLtd (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522 (HC). 3 72 ATC 6042, see also Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028, Annalong Pty Ltd v FCT 72 ATC 4141. 4 \[1994\] 3 NZLR 648. 7  the date the agreement was entered into (even if the agreement was still conditional); or  the date when all the conditions of the contract had been fulfilled and the purchaser can seek an order from the Court requiring the specific performance (that is the transfer of the land title) of the agreement (most commonly known as when the agreement goes “unconditional”). 2.14 A different interpretation is when the date of acquisition is determined by the “land” that is being disposed of (the “disposal interpretation”). Here, the date of acquisition would fall on the date the taxpayer acquires the interest or estate that is then subsequently disposed of. This can occur at different times under the agreement depending on how “disposal” is interpreted, but is more than likely to be the later phases of a sale and purchase agreement, that is either settlement or registration or in the alternative the date the agreement goes unconditional. For example:  If the taxpayer, after acquiring a legal fee simple estate, subsequently disposes this legal fee simple estate, the land is acquired when the legal fee simple estate (the title transfer) is registered by the Registrar- General of Lands under the Land Transfer Act 1952. It is only at this time the taxpayer is able to deal with the land in an absolute sense and is able to dispose of the land, or alternatively, create new interests in land.  If the taxpayer disposes of a lesser interest − for example, a legal easement, the date of acquisition is when the legal fee simple is acquired by the taxpayer. As described above, this date is when the land title is registered. 8 2.15 The following diagram illustrates and explains the different phases of a typical sale and purchase agreement. The basic four phases of a sale and purchase agreement are: Conditional agreement – when the contract is entered into, an equitable interest is created in favour of the purchaser. Specific performance in the wide sense (injunction, caveat or otherwise) is available to prevent the vendor dealing with the property inconsistently with the contract. Unconditional agreement – with the exception of the payment of the purchase price, any conditions of the agreement (such as finance, solicitor’s checks and other findings, building report and LIM reports) have been fulfilled. The equitable remedy of specific performance in the “narrow sense” (an order requiring the transfer of title) is available to the purchaser. Settlement – purchaser either pays, gives or makes available the purchase price to the vendor and there is a conveyance of the title to the purchaser. Registration of title – documentation evidencing the purchaser’s right to the legal estate is registered under the Land Transfer Act, an act conferred by the Registrar-General of Lands and the legal estate is acquired by the purchaser. Note:  The time periods between the phases may vary.  When an agreement is subject to “true conditions precedent”, a binding agreement will not be formed until the conditions are satisfied. An agreement that contains “conditions subsequent” is a binding contract. 2.16 These two interpretations have resulted in taxpayer uncertainty over which date to apply to their land transaction(s) and, in some cases, has had unintended tax outcomes. This has been a particular problem in situations when “land” is bought off the plans and a land title has not yet been registered. 2.17 The uncertainty in the law is also exacerbated by the fact that agreements for the sale and purchase of land may span over a number of months or years, and interests in land can be assigned to another person before the purchaser’s name is registered on the title. 9 2.18 The following example shows how the tax outcomes may differ depending on the interpretation that is applied. Example A Tom and Sally are nearing retirement. They decide to sell their Christchurch house and retire in Tauranga. They buy a house off the plans in a new subdivision in Tauranga and enter into a sale and purchase agreement with Peter the developer. The sale and purchase agreement for the Tauranga house is conditional on their Christchurch house being sold and the Tauranga house being completed. Six months later, Tom and Sally enter into a sale and purchase agreement for their Christchurch house, this agreement is conditional on the Christchurch buyer receiving finance. Shortly after, the Christchurch buyer receives finance, and the Tauranga house is completed. However, before settlement of the Tauranga house occurs, Tom is diagnosed with cancer. Tom and Sally re-evaluate their circumstances and decide to move to Wellington for Tom’s treatment and to be closer to family members. Tom and Sally re-advertise the Tauranga house through Peter the developer in the hope of finding a buyer. Fortunately, Tom and Sally are approached by Rachael, who is keen to buy a house in the new Tauranga subdivision. Rachael enters into an agreement with Tom and Sally to purchase the Tauranga house as soon as the title is transferred from Peter. Tom and Sally stand to make a $5,000 profit, due to increasing property values and high demand in the Tauranga area. Settlement of the Tauranga house occurs and the title is simultaneously transferred and registered from Peter, to Tom and Sally, and then to Rachael. Potential tax treatment under “disposal” interpretation The land disposed of is the legal estate in fee simple. This interest is acquired when the title transfer is registered from Peter to Tom and Sally. Tom and Sally’s intention or purpose on this date is to dispose of the Tauranga house to Rachael therefore the $5,000 profit will be subject to tax. Potential tax treatment under “first interest” interpretation Tom, Sally and Peter did not have any conditions precedent in their sale and purchase agreement that indicated the parties did not intend to be bound by the contract at the time it was entered into. Therefore, under this interpretation an equitable interest has arisen in favour of Tom and Sally on the date they entered into the sale and purchase agreement for the Tauranga property. Tom and Sally’s intention or purpose on this date was to live out their retirement in the Tauranga property. Therefore, their $5,000 profit will not be subject to tax. 10 Preferred interpretation from a tax policy perspective 2.19 A fundamental consideration of a coherent, broad-base, low-rate tax system is that taxes should be efficient through minimising distortions and impediments to economic growth. This “efficiency” consideration also needs to be weighed against the opportunity for tax planning and providing a sustainable revenue base for the Government. 2.20 It is acknowledged that if the Government chooses to clarify the date of acquisition, taxpayers will have the opportunity to alter their behaviour under either interpretation to avoid evidence of having an intention or purpose of resale, or may capture some taxpayers for whom the policy is not intended. However, this is a risk that already exists under the current legislation and if the legislation is sufficiently clarified, greater transparency should benefit all parties. 2.21 We consider that a “first interest” interpretation is the most appropriate interpretation from a tax policy perspective and results in greater certainty and economic efficiency than the “disposal” interpretation, for the reasons discussed below. Increase in land value and certainty of tax liability 2.22 A person’s intention regarding the land may change between the date the agreement was initially entered into and a subsequent date, such as the date of registration. This concern is illustrated in the example above. If the person’s intention is to purchase the property for resale, a “first interest” interpretation means that it is clear from the outset that any subsequent increase in value will be taxable. 2.23 A “disposal” interpretation, on the other hand, means that a person must wait until a later date (for example, registration) to determine whether the land is revenue-account property. They must account for tax not only on asset appreciation going forward, but also any increase in value in the past – between entering the contract and the date of registration. There could also be an argument that it should only be from the date the intention was changed. Distortion of behaviour and the lock-in effect 2.24 As noted above, the choice of interpretation can also lead to behavioural distortions. Under the “disposal” interpretation, a person desiring certainty may delay entering into a sale and purchase agreement until the title is nearly ready, as intention would be determined on the date of registration. This could increase certainty but, in doing so, may influence the person’s behaviour if they otherwise would have entered into the agreement on an earlier date. 2.25 A further distortion that occurs under the “disposal” interpretation, and where land values are increasing, is that there is an incentive for the taxpayer to defer disposing of the land (the lock-in effect) until title is acquired. However, if land values are decreasing, there is an incentive for the taxpayer 11 to dispose of the land before title is acquired, and to state that the land was acquired for the purpose of resale in order to claim a tax loss. Under the “first interest” interpretation, such distortions do not arise because the intention is determined at the earlier phases of the sale and purchase agreement. Impact on property market 2.26 In addition, the disposal interpretation could produce arguably an inefficient outcome for the property market. Consider, for example, the development of an apartment complex that will take a number of years to complete. The developer may not proceed with construction unless a number of the apartments have been pre-sold. If purchasers are unwilling to enter into an arrangement until a date closer to completion and registration, because they need certainty about their tax liability, the developer may lack sufficient capital (or means to secure capital) to proceed with the development. There may also be an incentive for the purchaser to require a lower price (operating as a risk margin) to compensate for the uncertainty. However, this situation may not arise in practice because the price and the willingness to enter into a contract are influenced more by non-tax factors. Other factors to consider under the “first interest” interpretation Agreements not in writing or registered on the land title 2.27 Although most disposals of estates or interest in land are executed through a sale and purchase agreement, not all disposals require a sale and purchase agreement/written form of a contract, or need to be registered on the land title. For example, leases and assignments of a lease do not need to be registered on the title, and in some circumstances may not need to be evidenced in writing. Therefore a date of acquisition test which is based on the phases of a sale and purchase agreement may appear to be limited to only disposal in these agreements. 2.28 However, the underlying principle of the first interest interpretation where the date is based on the first interest that arises in an agreement (either the date the agreement is entered into or the date the agreement goes unconditional and the Court can order specific performance of the legal title transfer) is still relevant in these types of disposals. This is because there must be some form of agreement between the parties, irrespective of whether it is or is not evidenced in writing or registered (or not) on the title. Options to acquire land 2.29 The definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act 2007 includes “options to acquire land”. If the Government decides to clarify the legislation to reflect one of the dates under the first interest interpretation, then:  if the date of acquisition is the date the agreement was entered into, then for an option, this is the date the option was granted; or  if the date of acquisition is the date the agreement goes unconditional, in the case of an option this is the day that the option is exercised. 12 CHAPTER 3 Possible dates of acquisition Summary of proposals The date of acquisition would be either:  Option 1 – the date the agreement for the sale and purchase of “land” is entered into; or  Option 2 – the date when all the conditions of the agreement for the sale and purchase of “land” have been fulfilled. 3.1 As mentioned in the previous chapter, the first interest interpretation is the preferred interpretation from a policy perspective as it provides greater certainty and is more economically efficient than the disposal interpretation. 3.2 Under the first interest interpretation there are two possible options for the date of acquisition: Option 1 − the date the agreement is entered into (even if the agreement was still conditional); or Option 2 − the date when all the conditions of the agreement had been fulfilled (that is, the date the agreement goes unconditional). Indicative characteristics of each option 3.3 To provide guidance, the following are indicative characteristics (but by no means exhaustive) of when either date may occur. Option 1 – the date the sale and purchase agreement is entered into  the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is signed by the vendor or purchaser (including nominees or agents); or  the “Date” indicated on a binding sale and purchase agreement, which is then subsequently signed by the parties to the agreement; or  the date a binding oral agreement for the disposal of land was agreed to by the parties, which has then been subsequently actioned by part performance of the agreement and if required later, evidenced by a memorandum; or  the date the first equitable estate or interest in land is acquired under a binding agreement for the sale and purchase of land and specific performance in the wider sense of all equitable remedies is potentially available to the purchaser (such as injunction or award for damages). Option 2 – the date the sale and purchase agreement goes unconditional  the date when all conditions agreed to by the parties, subsequent to the entering into the sale and purchase agreement are all fulfilled; or 13  the date an equitable estate or interest in land is acquired under a binding sale and purchase agreement, and specific performance in the strict sense is potentially available to the purchaser (that is, a Court order requiring the agreement to be performed in accordance with the terms of the agreement by ordering the transfer of the land title). The advantages and disadvantages of either option 3.4 There are numerous advantages and disadvantages that arise for both these options. These are summarised and discussed briefly in the table below. Option 1 Date agreement is entered into Option 2 Date agreement goes unconditional Decision-making by taxpayer – is there a decision that the taxpayer needs to make at this point of the agreement? A clear decision is required by the taxpayer to enter into the agreement, even if documentation is signed by an agent or a nominee of the taxpayer. No clear decision required at this stage. Active steps may be required by the taxpayer to ensure the conditions are fulfilled – for example, instructing solicitors. Clarity of date (bright line) – is the date at which this point of the agreement is clearly distinguishable or marked? Clear bright line of the date that agreement is entered into in most circumstances. The line is less clear in circumstances when there has been part-performance before an actual agreement is drawn up or signed. Equitable bright line, as the taxpayer at this point has acquired an equitable interest and the Court could order specific performance in the wide sense – for example, an injunction/caveat or an award for damages. The date in which conditions are fulfilled is not as clear, as conditions are usually fulfilled by third parties. Equitable bright line as it is at this point that the Court could order specific performance in the strict sense – for example, ordering the transfer of the land title. Evidence – is there sufficient evidence to support the taxpayer’s intention? Likely to be minimal evidence to prove the taxpayer’s intention or purpose. More evidence is available to either prove or disprove the taxpayer’s intention, particularly if third parties are engaged as there is likely to be documentation to support that engagement. For example, there may be a short-term finance agreement which could indicate that the taxpayer is not intending to retain the land. 14 Decision-making at phases of the sale and purchase agreement 3.5 As the policy intent of section CB 6 is to capture property speculators, arguably the most appropriate time to assess a taxpayer’s intention and purpose should be when a person decides to enter into a sale and purchase agreement. It is the initial decision-making that informs how a person intends to use the property. It would be unusual for a property speculator to enter into a sale and purchase agreement unless they thought it very likely that the purchase and its subsequent disposal would be profitable. 3.6 Generally speaking, there are no clear or additional decisions or actions made by the taxpayer at any other time in the agreement except perhaps the decision to engage third parties to carry out the conditions of the agreement. Bright line 3.7 One of the key advantages of option 1 (the date the agreement was entered into) is that there is more likely than not a clear date or “bright line” of when the agreement was entered into. For example, the date when the sale and purchase agreement was signed (by either or both parties). 3.8 For option 2 (the date the agreement goes unconditional), the fulfilment of the conditions in a sale and purchase agreement is usually achieved through other mechanisms and often by third parties (such as obtaining finance from a bank, or a LIM report from the local council). Arguably, at that time, the taxpayer’s decision to purchase the property, for whatever reason, has already been made. 3.9 Potentially there are also bright lines available at both stages in the form of equitable remedies as noted in chapter 2 − that is, the equitable remedy of specific performance (either in a wide or strict sense). Evidence 3.10 The main disadvantage of having the date of acquisition at the early stages of a sale and purchase agreement is the practical difficulty in providing evidence to prove or disprove a taxpayer’s subjective intention. 3.11 This is less of an issue under option 1 (the date the agreement goes unconditional) than option 2, as being able to take third party information into account may assist the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in determining what the taxpayer’s actual intention for the land is. 3.12 A possible legislative solution to address this problem is discussed in the next chapter. 15 CHAPTER 4 Evidence of intention or purpose 4.1 As noted in the previous chapter, one of the main difficulties associated with the date of acquisition being set at the earlier phases of a sale and purchase agreement is the problem of providing evidence of a person’s subjective intention or purpose. 4.2 Currently, if the taxpayer disputes a Commissioner’s assessment of their tax liability or vice versa, the statutory burden of proof requires the taxpayer to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the Commissioner’s assessment is incorrect. In the context of section CB 6, this means that the taxpayer has to prove on a balance of probabilities that they had no intention or purpose to dispose of the land when they acquired the land. 4.3 The practical concern is that if the date of acquisition is marked at the earlier phases of an agreement for the sale and purchase of land, both the taxpayer and the Commissioner may have little evidence to prove or disprove the taxpayer’s intention at this time. 4.4 This evidentiary problem does not impact on providing certainty in relation to determining the date of acquisition, but it does present practical implications, particularly for the Commissioner, who has to determine what the taxpayer is thinking at a specific point in time. 4.5 A suggestion to address this practical concern is to legislatively allow the Commissioner and taxpayer to consider and submit evidence that is before and after the date of acquisition, albeit introducing an objective element to this provision. Therefore if a dispute were to progress through to the challenge procedures, the relevant deciding authority in considering what the taxpayer’s intention was, will ask “what is the taxpayer’s intention or purpose using all the reasonable information available to me?” 4.6 It is arguable that this is already the situation, given that the Courts have held that although purpose or intention is to be determined on a subjective basis, it must be determined on the totality of the evidence. 5 4.7 However it is suggested that by providing a legislative provision to this effect, it will clearly reaffirm the common law position and ensure that the Court can consider the totality of the evidence before and after the date of acquisition not just the totality of the evidence at the date of acquisition. 4.8 We welcome feedback on this suggestion. 5 Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028, see also National Distributors Ltd v CIR \[1989\] 3 NZLR 661 (CA). 16 APPENDIX History of section CB 6 The profits made from the sale or disposition of real property were first deemed to be a source of “business income” in the Land Income Assessment Act 1891. It was introduced at a time when New Zealand had extensive immigration due to a booming export market, and there was high demand for land for settlement. However, since much of the freehold land in New Zealand was tied up in large estates, the Government undertook extensive land reforms to free-up land for genuine settlers. The high demand and the scarcity of available freehold land created the prime opportunity for property speculators to make a profit from the purchase and disposal of real property, without the property speculator necessarily improving or developing the land. The Government sought to discourage this behaviour by introducing a provision to tax gains from the disposition of land, if the land was acquired for the purpose of disposing of it at a profit. 6 The initial purpose of this provision was clarified by the Minister of Finance, Hon James B Allen, when the Land and Income Assessment 1908 Act was amended by the Land and Income Assessment Amendment Act 1912: 7 This is not an alteration in the law, but for the purpose of making the present Act clearer. Persons who speculate in land are liable to assessment for income tax on the profits from buying and selling the land. Legislative history of section CB 6 Due to its introduction in the late 1800s, the legislative history of what is now section CB 6 is lengthy. Over the years this provision for the taxation of property disposition profits (the “provision”) has been amended by:  extending the provision to cover both real and personal property, 8 then dissected into two separate provisions covering real and personal property; 9 and  adding a new subsection (now section CB 6(3)) to apply to land “whole or part of any land... or the whole or part of any such land together with other land”. 10 The following paragraphs highlight some of the key changes during the provision’s extensive legislative history. Removal of the “profit-making purpose” requirement A key element in the earlier taxation of the property disposition provision was the “profit-making purpose” requirement, that is, a person would be taxed if the property was acquired for the purpose of selling or disposing of it at a profit. 11 This profit- 6 Land and Income Assessment Act 1912, section 54. 7 (29 August 1912) 159 NZPD 624. 8 Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1951, section 10. 9 Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973, section 8(2). Section 88(1)(c) deal with personal property only and new provisions sections88(1)(cc) and 88AA dealt with the disposition of land. 10 See Income Tax Act 2007 section CB 6(3). 11 Land and Income Tax Act 1916, section 85(c). 17 making purpose element ensured the provision specifically targeted property speculators, rather than capturing “everybody”. The profit-making purpose requirement was later removed by the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. 12 The explanatory note on the bill indicates that the provision was being extended to apply to all classes of property and it appears the profit-making element was removed during the drafting of this amendment. The effect of this amendment meant the provision only required a “purpose to dispose” and the provision had widened to capture any person with the necessary purpose, not just property speculators. Therefore although the profit-making element was removed, the provision still intended to tax the gains and profits derived from the sale of land when the taxpayer’s business was dealing in land or the land was acquired for resale. The insertion of “intention” As mentioned above, originally the provision only required the person to have a “purpose of disposal”. However the additional subjective element of intention was inserted at the recommendation of the Taxation Review Committee, which was in 1967 assigned the task of carrying a comprehensive review of the New Zealand tax system. The Taxation Review Committee was of the view that the provision needed to be strengthened: 13 First, where the question to be decided is whether a taxpayer has acquired property for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it the Courts have held that in law there is a distinction between purpose and intention. This has enabled taxpayers to argue successfully that, although their intention on purchasing property may have been to sell part of it at some later stage, their purpose in acquiring the property was not to sell it but to use it in some way. That being so, profits derived from the sale of part or even all of the property were not assessable for tax. The Committee considers that the distinction between “purpose” and “intention” is artificial and should be removed. The Minister of Finance, Sir William Rowling, in a Cabinet paper on the relevant bill confirmed that the amendment would reinforce the income tax law relating to income from dealings in real property: 14 It has always been intended that, where a person buys property with the purpose or intention of later selling at a profit, he should be assessable for tax, but Court decisions have negated this objective in some circumstances. A new whole/part/any subsection The introduction of “intention” also strengthened a new subsection to cover situations when land that is disposed of constitutes the whole or part of any land (now subsection CB 6(3)). 12 Land and Income Tax Act 1954, section 88(c). 13 Taxation Review Committee Report of the Taxation Review Committee, (1967) chapter 44, para. 659. 14 Briefing paper to Cabinet HO 744. This was approved for inclusion in the 1973 amendment bill in a Cabinet decision made 30 July 1973 \[CM 73/34/23 refers\]. 18 According to an Inland Revenue Head Office Circular, this subsection was recommended as a direct result of the Australian case Moruben Gardens, 15 when the Australian High Court held that it was necessary for there to be a clear “identity” between the estate or the interest acquired, and the estate or interest disposed of. The whole/part/any subsection and the test of “purpose and intention” sought to circumvent this decision. The definition of “land” A further key change to the taxation of property profits provision in the 1973 Act was the inclusion of a definition of “land”. The new definition of land included any estate or interest in land (whether legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal) and any option to acquire land or any such estate or interest in land (but not including a mortgage). Previous provisions only referred to “real property”, “property”, “land or any interest therein”, “real or personal property or any interest therein”. This amendment has been considered by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants as an effective widening of the ambit of the provision: 16 This new definition of “land” had a number of effects:  It clarified the statutory meaning of the term “land” (i.e. including any estate, whether legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal) applied to the land speculation provision.  It was drafted using words (i.e. “any estate or interest in land”) that linked it up with the definition of “estate” or “interest” in land contained in section 2. This clarified the application of the broader definition of “interest in land” to the land speculation provision.  Accordingly any option to acquire land or an interest in land was within the purview of the new section 88AA. However despite the new definition in the 1973 Act, the definition of “land” that would have applied in the absence of any specific income tax at definition is likely to have derived from the definition of land in the Interpretation Act 1888: “land” includes messuages, tenements, hereditaments, houses, and buildings, unless there are words to exclude houses and buildings, or to restrict the meaning to tenements of some particular tenure: From a historical perspective, it appears that Parliament had contemplated that any interest, estate or right in real property disposed of in a business context should be subject to tax. Currently “land” for the purposes of section CB 6(1) includes any estate or interest in land, including those estates and interests specifically mentioned in section YA 1. The definition of land in the Income Tax Act 2007 uses the legal concept of land (that is, a bundle of tangible and intangible rights a person holds in land) as opposed to the ordinary usage of the word “land”, the “dirt” or geographical area of soil. This definition reflects the doctrine of tenure, in that all land (in the geographical soil/dirt sense) in New Zealand is owned by the Crown, and an individual can only own interests or estates in the land. 15 Moruben Gardens Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1972) 46 ALJR 559; 3 ATR 225; 72 ATC 4147 (HC). 16 Letter from Aylton Jamieson (NZICA) to Inland Revenue Brochure on property purchased “off the plans”, 5 March 2010. 19 The Property Speculation Tax Act 1973 Another piece of legislation targeted at the profits from property disposal was the Property Speculation Tax Act (the PST Act). The PST Act was introduced in 1973 and was designed to deter property speculation at a time when the country was suffering from high inflation and a shortage of housing. Although the taxation of property disposition provisions in the 1954 Act and the PST Act overlapped, the 1954 Act provision had wider implications and covered more than just property speculators. The PST Act did however provide a definition of the date of acquisition: “Date of acquisition” in relation to the acquisition of land by any person and subject to sections 11 and 12 of this Act, means the date on which possession of the land is given and taken in respect of that acquisition or, in any case where possession is not taken by that person or where no right to possession exists, the date on which the land becomes vested in that person. The PST Act however was short lived and repealed in 1979 by the Government on the grounds that it was irrelevant and not needed due to the taxation of property disposition provisions in the Land and Income Tax Act. The relationship between the Income Tax Act and “other” law In light of the core provisions contained in Part A of the Income Tax Act 2007, if the legislation wants to treat a transaction differently from “other” law (such as land law or contract law) it does so clearly. For example, contract and insurance law underpins life insurance contracts, however the Income Tax Act 2007 has specific life insurance rules to deal with income derived from these transactions. In the context of section CB 6, the laws of equity, land and contract underpin the taxation of these transactions. The interaction between equity, land and contract law in land transactions For a contract for the disposition of land to be enforceable, its terms and conditions must be set out in writing and be signed by the parties. 17 The normal commercial practice is for the parties to the contract to execute a standard form of an agreement for sale and purchase. Where an agreement is subject to “true conditions precedent”, a binding agreement will not be formed until the conditions are satisfied. 18 An agreement that contains a condition subsequent is a binding contract. 19 For example, the commonly used Real Estate Institute and Auckland District Law Society standard form of agreement provides that conditions in the agreement are conditions subsequent, unless the agreement “expressly provides otherwise”. A consequence for the parties entering into a binding contract for the sale and purchase of land is that the rules of equity provide for an equitable interest to arise in favour of the purchaser. If the rules of equity and the law of contract are in conflict, 17 Property Law Act 2007, section 24. 18 Scott v Rania \[1966\] NZLR 527. 19 Waitata Holdings Ltd v Mansfield (High Court, Nelson; M3/00; 9 August 2000). 20 section 99 of the Judicature Act 1908 provides for the rule of equity to prevail provided the matter applies to substantive law. 20 The Court has held that an equitable interest is “not carved out of a legal estate, but impressed upon it”. 21 The key question in determining whether an equitable interest has arisen in favour of the purchaser is “will equity protect the rights of the purchaser’s interest under the agreement?” The equitable remedies available are the ability to compel a transfer (specific performance) or grant, or to restrain a party from dealing with the land in a manner which is inconsistent with the contract. 22 Therefore in brief, the purchaser obtains a right to enforce the contract: 23 Now, the foundation of the doctrine of specific performance was this, that land has quite a character of its own, that the real meaning between the parties to a contract for sale of land was not that there should be a contract with legal remedies only, and that the purchaser should get the land, and should not be put off in an ordinary case by offering him damages. That is the main part of the doctrine of specific performance - that the purchaser is actually to get the land. In Re Transphere, McLelland J held that the absolute ownership of the property cannot be precisely divided into a legal estate and an equitable estate. 24 The equitable interest impressed on the legal estate is conditional on completion of the contract. During the period between the contract being formed and settlement being completed, the vendor holds the legal estate under a constructive trust for the purchaser. On settlement of the purchaser’s obligations, it appears that it is at this time that the rights attaching to the equitable interest then relate back to the point in time when the purchaser is able to obtain specific performance. A purchaser is able to divest the right to enforce the contract in any of the following ways:  by the purchaser expressly declaring himself or herself to be trustee of the equitable interest for a beneficiary; 25  by an express assignment by the purchaser to another, either in equity or under a statutory provision; 26  by a purchaser’s direction to his or her trustee requiring the trustee to hold the property on trust for another; 27  by a purchaser releasing, surrendering, or disclaiming his or her interest; 28 or 20 Mayor of Dunedin v Searl (1915) 34 NZLR 861. 21 DKLR Holding Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) (1982) 149 CLR 43 at 474; 40 ALR 1 at 35 per Brennan J.

Current problem 1.2 A “deregistered charity” refers to an entity that has been removed from the Charities Register by the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services (formerly the Cha rities Commission). 1.3 Recent high-profile cases involving deregistered charities particularly where the entity continues in existence have shown that these entities can face a range of complex tax consequences that can be retrospective, transitional and prospective in nature. These consequences give rise to questions such as when should the entity start its life as a tax-paying entity; how should the entity treat its depreciable property or financial arrangements when it becomes a tax-paying entity, and what tax provisions should apply to the entity going forward. 1.4 The nature and extent of the potential tax consequences ultimately depends on the underlying reason why the entity was deregistered. These consequences may be more onerous (and may involve retrospective tax liabilities) if the deregistered charity is found never to have had a “charitable purpose” or had ceased being charitable in purpose at some time in the past, compared with the situation when a deregistered charity has simply failed to file the required annual return with Charities Services. 1.5 Current tax law does not adequately deal with the full range of tax consequences facing deregistered charities. This gives rise to additional compliance costs and stress for a group that, in general, is under-resourced and unsophisticated in terms of administrative functions. 1.6 For these reasons, and given the significance of the charitable sector in providing social services in New Zealand and the importance of ensuring the associated tax concessions are correctly targeted, we do not consider the status quo to be sustainable. Suggested solution 1.7 We acknowledge that addressing the problems with the tax treatment of deregistered charities may require a mix of both legislative and operational measures, and that Inland Revenue and Charities Services would need to work together to ensure a seamless and robust process for deregistered charities to follow. 1.8 Given the range and complexity of the potential tax consequences that could face deregistered charities, officials seek feedback on the solution suggested in this paper and, in particular, whether a legislative approach is an appropriate way to address the matter or whether additional measures would be helpful. 2 1.9 Under the suggested solution, specific legislative rules would:  clarify how the general tax rules, including the company, trust or other entity - specific regimes, apply to deregistered charities;  establish the opening values of any depreciable property or consideration for any financial arrangements held by a deregistered charity when it becomes a tax- paying entity;  prescribe specific timing rules for the application of the taxing provisions; and  apply from the 2014–15 income year. 1.10 T he suggested solution should help to ensure that the charities-related tax concessions are correctly targeted and desired policy intentions are met. 1.11 This means that the majority of former charities that have in good faith tried to meet their registration requirements should find that the solutions proposed will provide them with greater certainty about their tax obligations. On the other hand, the very small minority of deregistered charities that have wilfully refused to meet their registration requirements will face onerous tax consequences under the proposals outlined in this paper. 1.12 Officials invite submissions on the suggested solution and any other proposals that would address the stated problem. Submissions will be taken into account when we make recommendations to the Government on any necessary legislative changes. These changes would be included in a tax bill introduced in Parliament later this year. Submissions 1.13 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. Submissions should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to contact the submitter to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.14 Submissions should be made by 23 August 2013 and be addressed to: “Deregistered charities” C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.15 Or emailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Deregistered charities” in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. 1.16 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Submitters who consider that their submission or any part of it should properly be withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 3 CHAPTER 2 Registration process under the Charities Act 2.1 In New Zealand, registration of charities began on 1 February 2007. Charities Services is responsible for determining whether an entity can be registered as a “charitable entity” under the Charities Act 2005. 2.2 Although registration is voluntary and non-registration does not mean that the entity is not charitable in purpose, there are a number of benefits to registration. In particular, registered charities can qualify for charities-related tax concessions in the Income Tax Act 2007, and they may be eligible for greater funding as some funders have policies that only support charities that are on the Register. Registration requirements 2.3 To be registered as a “charitable entity” an entity must meet the requirements in section 13 of the Charities Act 2005. It must:  be established and maintained for exclusively charitable purposes. A “charitable purpose” is defined in section 5(1) of the Charities Act and includes: “...every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community.”;  not be carried on for the private financial benefit or profit of an individual;  restrict its distributions upon winding-up to charitable purposes;  have a legal name that is not misleading or offensive; and  have proposed officers that are qualified by virtue of section 16 of the Charities Act 2005. 2.4 The Charities Act 2005 also requires all registered charities to file an annual return with Charities Services. An annual return includes both a complete annual return form and financial accounts. On-g oing monitoring processes 2.5 Registration under the Charities Act 2005 is not necessarily a permanent status. An entity must continue to qualify for registration in order to remain on the Charities Register. Charities Services assesses the eligibility of entities to remain registered if there is cause to open an investigation or a monitoring review. 2.6 Charities Services may open an investigation in response to specific information – for ex ample, a complaint, adverse information received about an entity’s activities, a negative media report, a Court judgment relating to a similar type of charity, or concerns identified by Charities Services at the time of registration. Charities 4 Services also proactively monitors entities it identifies to be a medium to high- compliance risk, some of which proceed to investigation. 2.7 Alternatively, Charities Services may open an investigation because of information provided by the entity itself. This includes:  notification of changes to its rules which mean its purposes are no longer charitable;  notification of changes to its winding-up clause which means the winding-up clause no longer meets on-going registration qualification criteria;  an annual return that shows spending on activities that are not related to its charitable purpose; and  an annual return that indicates someone is receiving a private financial benefit. 2.8 In Chapter 3 we discuss the importance and significance of registration as a charitable entity for tax purposes. 5 CHAPTER 3 Charities-related tax concessions 3.1 As mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of registration is that the entity will be entitled to charities-related tax concessions under the Income Tax Act 2007. 3.2 The charities-related tax concessions are:  an income tax exemption;  a fringe benefit tax exemption; and  recognition as a “donee” organisation for the purposes of the donation tax relief provisions. This means donors to a registered charity are eligible to receive certain tax credits on their donations. 3.3 Although Charities Services determines whether an entity qualifies for registration as a charitable entity, Inland Revenue administers charities-related tax concessions. Generally, Inland Revenue accepts Charities Services’ decision so that registration will, in most cases, lead to tax-exemption or “donee organisation” status. Income tax exemption 3.4 A charity must be a “tax charity” to be eligible for an income tax exemption on charitable grounds. 3.5 A “tax charity” is defined in section CW 41(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 as the following: A trustee or trustees of a trust, a society, or an institution, registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005; A trustee or trustees of a trust, a society or an institution who, before 1 July 2008, commenced the process of registering with the Charities Commission but had not completed its registration; or A trustee or trustees of a trust, a society, or an institution that is or are non-resident and carrying out its or their charitable purposes outside New Zealand, and which is approved as a tax charity by the Commissioner in circumstances where registration as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 is unavailable. 3.6 Under section CW 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007 a tax charity is exempt from income tax on its non-business income. In general, a registered charity will be treated by Inland Revenue as qualifying for this exemption because the requirements of registration correspond to the requirements of section CW 41. 3.7 Under section CW 42 a tax charity is exempt from income tax on business income it derives either directly or indirectly so long as that income is applied to charitable purposes within New Zealand, and no person with some control over the business 6 activities of the charity is able to direct or divert income derived from the business to their benefit or advantage. Registration as a charitable entity is not therefore sufficient in itself to qualify for the business income tax exemption. Registered charities must also meet the “in New Zealand” and “no direct control” requirements. 3.8 For completeness, the business income tax exemption can apply to income derived by the registered charity either directly (in other words, the business activities are carried out by the charity itself) or indirectly (where the business activities are carried out by an entity separate from the charitable entity). These separate entities do not need to be registered under the Charities Act 2005. The registered entity is not itself conducting the business operation, but the operation is being run, for example, by a company that carries on the business solely for the registered entity’s benefit. Although these companies are not also required to be registered, if they also have charitable purposes, they may do so. Fringe benefit tax exemption 3.9 Registered charities may also be entitled to an exemption from fringe benefit tax (FBT) on non-cash benefits paid to their employees who are employed in the non- commercial operations of the charity. 3.10 Under section CX 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 a “charitable organisation” that pro vides fringe benefits to its employees will in general not need to pay FBT unless:  the employee receives the benefit mainly in connection with their employment; and  the employment involves a business whose activity is outside a charity’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 3.11 A “charitable organisation” is an association, fund, institution, organisation, society or trust to which section LD 3(2) or schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies. In other words, a “donee organisation” qualifies as a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT exemption. 3.12 In theory, all registered charities could meet the requirements of “donee organisation” status and so they could qualify for the exemption from FBT. Recognition as a “donee organisation” 3.13 Donors who make cash donations to donee organisations are entitled to tax concessions based on their donation. These concessions are contained in section DB 41 (the company donation deduction), section DV 12 (the Māori authority donation deduction) and section LD 3(2) (the individuals’ donation tax credit) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3.14 A “donee organisation” is defined in section YA of the Income Tax Act as: An entity described in section LD 3(2) or an entity listed in schedule 32 of that Act. 7 3.15 In section LD 3(2) a donee organisation includes any society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Schedule 32 contains a list of 80 organisations whose charitable purposes are largely carried out overseas. 3.16 As previously mentioned, most registered charities will meet the requirements to be a donee organisation, provided their funds are applied to charitable purposes mainly in New Zealand (or overseas, if the entity is a schedule 32 entity). 3.17 In Chapter 4 we discuss the implications when an organisation no longer meets the criteria of a “charitable entity” and becomes deregistered. 8 CHAPTER 4 Deregistration process 4.1 Section 32 of the Charities Act sets out the grounds for deregistration. Charities Services may deregister a charitable entity if:  it is no longer “qualified for registration”;  there has been a “significant or persistent failure” to comply with its obligations under the Charities Act or any other Act;  there has been a “significant or persistent failure by any one or more of the officers of the entity to meet their obligations under the Charities Act;  it has engaged in “serious wrongdoing”; or  it has requested that it be deregistered. 4.2 However, deregistration will not happen without the entity being given the chance to have its say on the matter. What is meant by “qualified for registration”? 4.3 A charity is no longer qualified for registration if it fails to meet any one of the requirements of registration specified in Chapter 2. What is meant by “significant or persistent failure”? 4.4 A charity may be deregistered if there has been a “significant or persistent failure” by the entity, or one or more of its officers, or one or more of its collectors to meet its obligations under the Charities Act or any other Act. 4.5 The obligations specified in the Charities Act include the duty:  of telephone and internet collectors to disclose the charity’s registration number when asked for it (section 39);  to notify changes to the Charities Unit (section 40);  to provide annual returns that include both a complete annual return form and financial accounts (section 41); and  to assist Charities Services when it asks for information while carrying out its functions (section 51). 4.6 The obligations specified under any other Act may relate to matters that indicate a significant failure by an entity in its operation as a charity. 9 4.7 The most common reason for compliance action in relation to “significant or persistent failure” is the failure to file an annual return (annual return form and a set of financial accounts). What is meant by engaged in “serious wrongdoing”? 4.8 Section 4(1) of the Charities Act 2005 defines “serious wrongdoing” as: (a) unlawful or a corrupt use of the funds or resources of the entity; (b) an act, omission, or course of conduct that constitutes a serious risk to the public interest in the orderly and appropriate conduct of the affairs of the entity; (c) an act, omission, or course of conduct that constitutes an offence; or (d) an act, omission, or course of conduct by a person that is oppressive, improperly discriminatory, or grossly negligent, or that constitutes gross mismanagement. 4.9 Charities Services considers that the types of activities that may be considered to be serious wrongdoing under section 4(1)(b) and (d) to include:  persistent failure to keep proper financial records;  filing financial reports that are largely inaccurate;  inability to account for the way public donations are used;  presenting largely inaccurate information to the public about the charity’s purpose or activities;  money laundering;  allowing funds to be used to assist illegal activities or terrorism;  making or allowing private financial profit;  persistently working outside the rules of the charity; or  knowingly allowing an officer who does not qualify in terms of the Charities Act to remain as an officer, unless a waiver has been granted. Notice of deregistration 4.10 Under section 33 of the Charities Act, Charities Services must give the entity notice in writing of its intention to remove it from the Register. The notice must include the reason and give the entity at least 20 working days after the date of the notice to reply with an objection. If Charities Services proceeds to deregister the entity, it will advise it in writing, fully explaining the decision. 10 4.11 A deregistration decision applies going forward. It is not possible to set an effective date of deregistration retrospectively. 4.12 The following details will be shown on the Register after an entity has been deregistered:  the name of the charity and its registration number;  the reason for deregistration; and  the effective date of deregistration. 4.13 In all cases when a charity wishes to go back on the Register after it has been der egistered, it will need to follow the application process in full. Deregistration – statistics 4.14 Since the Charities Register opened, 3,902 charities have been deregistered. The table be low provides statistics on Charities Services’ deregistration decisions, as at November 2012. Deregistration decisions Number Failure to file annual return 2,489 Voluntary deregistration 1,375 Non-charitable purposes 24 Serious wrong-doing 3 Did not meet the registration requirements 4 Did not produce evidence of charitable purposes 7 4.15 Although the most common reason for deregistration is the failure to file an annual return, there are likely to be fewer instances of these types of deregistration in the future. Until recently, Charities Services automatically deregistered charities if they had failed to file one annual return. 4.16 Under a new approach, registered charities will be given more opportunity to file their annual returns. They will be served with two reminders before being issued a Notice including all of the relevant measures that might be taken if the annual return is not supplied. This would include the $200 administrative penalty, publication of a notice on the Register (or elsewhere) and, in cases of “significant or persistent failure” to comply with the Charities Act, deregistration. If at the expiry of that further time, an annual return is still not filed, the processes for each of the relevant measures can be implemented (such as the imposition of the administrative penalty or the issuance of the Notice of Intention to Remove). 4.17 In the next chapter we describe the tax consequences of deregistration. 11 CHAPTER 5 Tax consequences of deregistration 5.1 In general, the tax consequences that arise when a charity is deregistered depend on the reasons for deregistration. As mentioned earlier, a charity can be deregistered for a variety of reasons. Consequently, it is important to take account of the specific circumstances of each deregistration in order to determine the likely tax consequences. 5.2 The possible consequences for income tax, fringe benefit tax (FBT) and donee organisation status are set out below. Income tax consequences 5.3 Once deregistration has occurred we need to determine what income tax provisions apply to deregistered charities and when they apply. What tax provisions apply? 5.4 In general, the tax treatment of an entity follows its legal form, and the activities that it undertakes. In the absence of another tax exemption applying to the entity, corporate entities will be subject to the company rules and trustees of a trust will be subject to the trust rules. An entity can also elect to become a Māori authority if it meets the relevant criteria. 5.5 There are also transitional income tax consequences when a tax-exempt entity becomes a tax-paying entity. These include determining the opening value of any depreciable property and consideration for any financial arrangements. 5.6 The Income Tax Act 2007 provides transitional tax rules in certain circumstances. Th ese are:  When a “charitable trust” is no longer eligible for income tax exemption on charitable grounds – A charitable trust is a trust whose income has been or is exempt from income tax under sections CW 41(1) or CW 42(1 ). Section HC 31 specifically provides that income derived on or from the date on which the charitable trust loses its charitable status will be subject to tax. The provision also requires a calculation to be made in order to establish the cost price of property and to determine any consideration for financial arrangements. The calculation is required to be undertaken on the date on which the charitable trust “lost” its charitable status. (Determining when a charitable trust has “lost” its charitable status is discussed below.)  When a trust or company elects to become a Māori authority. Section HF 9 provides for the consequences of a change in entity status for the purposes of the Māori authority rules. In general, any retained earnings, accumulated profits and capital reserves held by the trust or company on the date of change will not be subject to tax when it is subsequently distributed. 12 5.7 The current tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 do not adequately provide for the full range of transitional scenarios for deregistered charities. In particular:  Section HC 31 is limited in that it does not apply to charitable trusts that never had a charitable purpose.  There is no equivalent section HC 31 provision for incorporated entities and so it is unclear how incorporated bodies should transition to the general tax rules.  Section HF 9 has the effect of exempting from income tax the accumulated “charitable income” of a deregistered entity but we question whether this is the appropriate policy outcome in all cases involving deregistered charities. (See discussion later in this chapter on the accumulation of charitable income.) When do the taxing provisions apply? 5.8 In most cases, the taxing provisions will apply from the effective date of deregistration – that is, the date the entity is removed from the Charities Register. 5.9 Ho wever, it may sometimes be necessary to apply the taxing provisions from an earlier date. This will arise when the underlying reason for deregistration is because the entity was found never to have had a “charitable purpose”. In these circumstances, the taxing provisions can be applied from the date on which the entity was established. 5.10 In deciding whether to apply the taxing provisions from the date on which the entity was found never to have had a charitable purpose, Inland Revenue will take into account the specific circumstances surrounding the entity’s charitable status before the “tax charity” rules (which included the registration requirement) were introduced from 1 July 2008. This would include, for example, did the entity receive confirmation from Inland Revenue that it was entitled to the charities-related income tax exemption before 1 July 2008. Inland Revenue will also look at voluntary deregistrations when there is concern that the deregistered charity may never have had a charitable purpose or may have ceased to be qualified for registration at some point in the past. 5.11 We consider that clearer guidance is required to allow deregistered charities to determine when the taxing provisions should apply. Fringe benefit tax exemption consequences 5.12 The FBT consequences for a deregistered charity depend on the reasons for deregistration. It is possible that the FBT exemption could continue to apply to the deregistered charity without interruption. 5.13 If a deregistered charity is found not to have a charitable purpose either by Charities Services or the Courts, Inland Revenue’s current practice is to accept that the charity does not have a charitable purpose for tax purposes. This means the deregistered charity must meet the other requirements implicit in the definition of “charitable organisation” for FBT purposes. If the deregistered charity has a benevolent, cultural 13 or philanthropic purpose, or meets the requirements to be added to schedule 32, it will likely continue to be eligible for the FBT exemption. 5.14 If the deregistered charity was deregistered because it has persistently failed to file an annual return (in the absence of specific investigation into its activities) it may continue to be eligible for the FBT exemption, as registration per se is not a requirement of the FBT exemption. 5.15 The continued application of the FBT exemption when a deregistered entity has engaged in “serious wrong-doing”, as described in Chapter 4, has been raised as a concern. Even so, we consider that the current requirements of the FBT exemption (that there is no private pecuniary gain) and the penalties regime in the Tax Administration Act 1994 should allow Inland Revenue to revoke the FBT exemption and to effectively deal with deregistered charities that continue to engage in “serious wrong-doing”. We also note that the number of cases that have involved serious wrong-doing is small. Donee organisation consequences 5.16 Similarly, there is always a possibility that a deregistered charity can continue to qualify for donee organisation status even after deregistration. The donee organisation consequences for a deregistered charity depend on the reasons for deregistration. 5.17 If a deregistered charity is found not to have a charitable purpose either by Charities Services or the Courts, the entity may still be a donee organisation if it meets the other donee organisation requirements. This includes, for example, if it has benevolent, cultural or philanthropic purpose, or meets the requirements of being added to schedule 32. 5.18 The concern raised above about the FBT exemption being applicable even in cases of serious wrong-doing is equally applicable here. 5.19 There may be flow -on consequences for donors who have made cash donations to a deregistered charity. If the entity does not meet or has never met the donee organisation requirements then these donors should not have been eligible for any donation tax relief that had been claimed. Under current tax law, Inland Revenue can reverse previous donation tax relief claims. In practice, this requires Inland Revenue to approach each donor for evidence of the amount and circumstances of their gift, which can be onerous. 5.20 In deciding whether to reverse donation tax claims, Inland Revenue may consider the circumstances around the charity’s deregistration and the donor’s knowledge of those circumstances, as well as a variety of other factors. These could include the amounts involved, the capacity of Inland Revenue’s audit and collections staff, and the implications for current and future compliance, and integrity of the tax system for all taxpayers. 5.21 We consider it appropriate that Inland Revenue should continue to have the discretion to make decisions on whether to reverse donation tax relief claims in deregistration 14 situations. Even so, we are interested in your views on the specific circumstances in which it would be appropriate to reverse donation tax claims. Periods of non-registration 5.22 There have been cases when an entity has been deregistered and then subsequently re- registers with Charities Services, giving rise to periods of registration and non- registration. Under current tax law the deregistered charity is required to file tax returns for any periods of non-registration. 5.23 This gives rise to both complexity and costs for deregistered charities and Inland Revenue. Consequences of deregistration – accumulation of income 5.24 W e have also identified a problem where the assets of a deregistered charity can be applied towards non-charitable purposes without giving rise to a taxable event. This problem arises because the current tax law (legislation and case law) supports the ability of charities to accumulate their income for future use, and there is no symmetry required between the income tax exemption and the payments to charitable purposes, either in amount or timing. 5.25 Although there is a requirement for a deregistered charity that “winds-up” to distribute its assets and income to charitable purposes, there is no such requirement when a deregistered charity continues its operations. In part this question obviously revolves around what use the assets are put to after deregistration. 5.26 Other countries specifically addressed this problem by requiring deregistered charities to apply any accumulated “charitable income” (and assets) to charitable purposes or risk being subject to tax. In Canada, when a charity is deregistered, it must transfer all its remaining property to a donee organisation within one year or be subject to a revocation tax. In Australia, all charitable income amounts must be transferred to another donee organisation. 5.27 This issue raises the question of the appropriate treatment to apply to a deregistered charity. There is a range of possibilities for addressing this issue and we welcome submissions on this specific point. CHAPTER 6 Suggested solution 6.1 This chapter explores a possible solution to address the current tax consequences for deregistered charities identified in the previous chapter. 6.2 Our suggested solution is for a specific set of rules to deal with the income tax treatment of deregistered charities where the entity continues in operation. The suggested new rules would:  clarify how the general tax rules, including the company, trust and other specific entity regimes apply to deregistered charities;  establish the opening values of any depreciable property or consideration for any financial arrangements held by a deregistered charity when it becomes a tax- paying entity;  prescribe specific timing rules for the application of the taxing provisions; and  apply from the 2014–15 income year. 6.3 A specific set of rules is preferred for reasons of clarity and coherency. Clarifying the general tax rules 6.4 Section HC 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides a useful model for formulating rules to clarify how the general tax rules, including the various entity regimes, could apply to deregistered charities. This provision specifically deals with circumstances when an existing trust enters the tax base. Establishing the opening values for depreciable property and financial arrangements 6.5 Section HC 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also provides a useful model for formulating rules for establishing the opening values of any depreciable property or consideration for any financial arrangements held by a deregistered charity when it becomes a tax-paying entity. Prescribing specific timing rules 6.6 In most cases, the taxing provisions will apply from the effective date of deregistration – that is, the date the entity is removed from the Charities Register. This date usually applies on a prospective basis. However, it may sometimes be necessary to apply the taxing provisions from an earlier date. This will arise from the following circumstances:  when the underlying reason for deregistration is because the entity was found never to have had a “charitable purpose” by Charities Services or the Courts, or 16  when the charity has voluntarily deregistered and Inland Revenue has concerns that it was never charitable in purpose or ceased to be charitable at some point in the past. In these circumstances, the taxing provisions can be applied from the date on which the entity was found not to have a charitable purpose. 6.7 In deciding whether to apply the taxing provisions from the date on which the entity was found not to have a charitable purpose we should also take into account the specific circumstances surrounding the entity’s charitable status before the “tax charity” rules (which included the registration requirement) were introduced from 1 July 2008. This would include, for example, whether an entity had received confirmation from Inland Revenue that it was entitled to the charities-related income tax exemption before 1 July 2008. 6.8 We suggest prescribing specific timing rules for the application of the taxing provisions. These timing rules would cover five distinct circumstances. Situation Timing A charity that came into existence after 1 July 2008 has been deregistered by Charities Services. Deregistered charities in this situation would be subject to tax on income earned from the effective date of deregistration. A charity that came into existence after 1 July 2008 has been deregistered because it was found by Charities Services or the Courts not to have a charitable purpose. Deregistered charities in this situation would be subject to tax on income earned from the date on which the entity was found not to have a charitable purpose. A charity that came into existence after 1 July 2008 has voluntarily deregistered and Inland Revenue has found the entity not to have had a charitable purpose. Deregistered charities in this situation would be subject to tax on income earned from the date on which the entity was found not to have a charitable purpose. Before 1 July 2008 Inland Revenue had confirmed that the charity was entitled to the charities-related income tax exemption and Charities Services (or its predecessor) has either declined its application or deregistered the charity, after 1 July 2008. Deregistered charities in this situation would be subject to tax on income earned from 1 July 2008. Before 1 July 2008 the charity made a self- assessment that it was eligible for the charities- related income tax exemption and Charities Services (or its predecessor) has either declined its application or deregistered the charity after 1 July 2008. Deregistered charities in this situation would be subject to tax on income from 1 July 2008. Such charities might be required, however, to provide evidence to Inland Revenue that they were eligible for the charities-related income tax exemption before 1 July 2008. 17 6.9 These rules do not address the specific issue that arises when a charity is deregistered solely because Charities Services (or its predecessor) formed a view that the entity was charitable in purpose but later changed its mind and deregistered the entity. For reasons of equity and consistency, an entity should be able to rely on the prevailing view of Charities Services, if it has in good faith complied with all of the information requirements of registration and no other reason for deregistration exists. This would suggest limiting deregistration to the date on which Charities Services changed its view, with the consequential effect of minimising retrospective tax liabilities. 6.10 In addressing this issue, however, it is important to balance these equity considerations with protecting the revenue base and the integrity of the charities registration process. Charities Services (and Inland Revenue) should retain the ability to enquire into deregistration situations in order to determine if there had been any disqualifying behaviour on part of the charity. We are interested in submitters’ views on how this issue could be addressed while ensuring that there are adequate mechanisms in place to protect the revenue base. Periods of non-registration 6.11 The suggested solution would apply to determine the tax treatment to apply to periods of non-registration. Other possible solutions 6.12 The suggested solution focuses solely on improving the existing tax rules in the Income Tax Act to ensure they can effectively deal with the current problems with the tax treatment of deregistered charities. Even so, we acknowledge that a mix of both legislative and operational measures may be required, and that Inland Revenue and Charities Services may need to work closely together to ensure a robust process for deregistered charities. This might involve giving Charities Services a wider range of tools to apply during the deregistration process. This could include, for example, the ability to set a retrospective date of registration such as to deal with broken periods of registration in appropriate circumstances. 18 Questions for submitters We welcome your views on the following specific matters:  Whether legislating for the suggested solution outlined in this paper is an appropriate way to address the current problems with the existing law?  What other solutions are there for resolving the current problems for deregistered charities?  Whether the prescribed timing rules cover all potential deregistration scenarios?  How should we deal with deregistration situations where a deregistered charity has acted in good faith and has complied with all of the information requirements of registration and is later found not to have a charitable purpose?  How should the issue of accumulated income and assets of a deregistered charity be addressed?  What specific circumstances would warrant a reversal of donation tax relief in deregistration situations?

This paper discusses the consequences of this development from a taxation perspective. 1.2 Cabinet has agreed, as part of a much wider range of financial reporting reforms, that all active companies should continue to prepare financial statements. While most of these companies will soon have no obligation to prepare general-purpose financial statements, they will still be required to prepare financial statements at least to a special-purpose level. 1.3 Inland Revenue, as the biggest user of financial statements in New Zealand, will administer the setting of minimum requirements for these financial statements. Proposals to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 for this purpose are currently before Parliament. 1 This legislation will set up a framework to allow Orders in Council to mandate who should prepare financial statements and to what degree of detail. 1.4 These financial statements, which can be prepared to any level above the minimum specified by Inland Revenue, will obviously also be available for other purposes and users. 1.5 The discussion in this paper is not limited to companies, although the formal proposals will apply only to companies from years commencing 1 April 2014 onwards. This paper discusses which companies will be required to prepare financial statements and the minimum degree of detail that they will need to provide. Indicative thinking on how this might be extended to non-corporate business taxpayers is also discussed, but formal consultation on this is scheduled for next year. 1.6 Compliance implications are a major consideration. We do not anticipate any material increase in compliance costs for companies affected by these changes. Overall, because of the removal of the general-purpose reporting requirement as part of the wider company financial reporting reforms, it is anticipated that compliance costs will decrease. However, we accept that it is only medium-sized companies that are presently complying with the general-purpose rules which will potentially enjoy this decrease. Other companies that currently prepare financial statements should not be significantly affected. 1 Clauses 110 and 111 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 2 1.7 Inland Revenue officials are participating in the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ SME Working Group which is recommending an accounting framework for special-purpose financial statements for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It is too early to know exactly how this will integrate with Inland Revenue requirements, but it seems that compliance with that framework will mean Inland Revenue’s minimum requirements are likely to be exceeded. How to make a submission 1.8 Submissions are invited on:  the proposal to exclude non-trading companies that are presently not required to file tax returns from the preparation requirement; and  the level of detail that is suggested for the financial statements. 1.9 The Minister of Revenue will be required under the proposed legislation to ensure that adequate consultation has taken place before he makes a recommendation that the Orders in Council be approved. The proposals in summary  Who would be affected: – For periods commencing 1 April 2014 and later, all active companies that do not have a statutory obligation to prepare general-purpose financial statements should prepare financial statements to at least a special-purpose level.  Minimum suggested requirements: – They should be based on double entry cost-based accrual accounting. – They should include a balance sheet and profit and loss, and specified supporting notes and/or schedules should also be available. – Where reasonably possible, tax values can be used for the determination of income and expenditure, and the preparation of the balance sheet. – A statement of accounting policies and changes should be part of the financial statements. – They should include, if necessary, a financial statements to taxable income reconciliation. – Certain related-party transactions should be scheduled (but only for periods commencing 1 April 2015 and later). – While disclosure of the IR 10 key points is proposed, there is scope for judgement on the level of detail beyond this. 3 1.10 The phasing out of the Financial Reporting Act requirements for companies depends on the introduction of proposals suggested in this paper. This will be arranged so that it is seamless. 1.11 Inland Revenue indicatively suggests that non-corporate businesses should also be required to prepare special-purpose financial statements, perhaps for periods commencing 1 April 2015 and later. However, this is not part of the formal proposals in this paper, but rather, an indication of our current thinking. Comments on this are welcome, but formal consultation will take place next year. 1.12 Submissions on this paper should be made by 20 December 2013 and can be addressed to: Financial reporting C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy and Strategy Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Financial reporting” in the subject line. 1.13 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 4 CHAPTER 2 The Financial Reporting Bill and its consequences 2.1 The Financial Reporting Bill, currently before Parliament, proposes to reform the requirements of companies to prepare financial statements. This is part of a wider range of reforms that include the removal of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 requirements for companies other than large companies or companies that are issuers to prepare general-purpose financial statements. 2.2 However, this does not mean these companies will no longer have to prepare financial statements. Cabinet has agreed, as part of the process that led to the Financial Reporting Act rewrite, that it is appropriate that companies that no longer have to prepare general-purpose financial statements should continue to prepare financial statements expressly designed to meet Inland Revenue’s needs, but to a lower minimum level than general-purpose financial statements. 2.3 Further, Cabinet agreed that Inland Revenue should mandate this and should specify the minimum requirements for these financial statements, and that these statements could be special-purpose financial statements. While one obvious purpose of these financial statements would be to satisfy Inland Revenue requirements, they could also have other uses – both for management and owners, and for financiers and other creditors. Inland Revenue’s current position 2.4 Inland Revenue is New Zealand’s biggest user of financial statements. Financial statements are the basis for taxpayers preparing the summary form – the IR 10 – of which 700,000 are filed each year by about 550,000 active businesses. This form is used for Inland Revenue purposes, but is also very important for Statistics New Zealand for business statistical purposes. 2.5 Inland Revenue regularly requests financial statements for compliance risk review, investigations and for debt collection. There are also occasions when financial statements of New Zealand taxpayers are requested by our tax treaty partners. Thus, for relevant taxpayers, it is reasonable for Inland Revenue to expect these taxpayers to prepare financial statements and to make them available upon request. 2.6 These requests will typically be under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Subsection 17(1) presently allows Inland Revenue to request financial statements under its general powers. Subsection 17(2) currently contains an explicit requirement that companies must make available upon request: “balance sheets, ... profit and loss accounts and other accounts, and statements of assets and liabilities”. 5 Tax Administration Act amendments 2.7 The new requirements could be set by way of Act of Parliament (legislation), Order in Council or Inland Revenue determination. A balancing act is required between ensuring that there is enough external review of the requirements before they are mandated, and ensuring that they can be amended in a reasonably flexible way. Orders in Council, which are approved by Cabinet, provide an appropriate balance. 2.8 Because requirements will be mandated by Order in Council there should also be sufficient flexibility to impose different requirements on different classes of taxpayer. An example would be the different requirements placed on individuals whose business income is schedular payments – refer below. Over time, the initial requirements can be refined and could lead to increased use of the flexibility that Orders in Council provide, following proper consultation. 2.9 The Tax Administration Act is being amended to create a framework for the Orders in Council under new sections 21C and 21D. This process explicitly includes a requirement for the Minister to be satisfied that consultation has taken place to ensure that private-sector views have been considered in the preparation of the requirements. As well, subsection 17(2) of the Tax Administration Act will be consequentially repealed. 2.10 These financial statements would not have to be held in hard copy, as long as they are prepared as part of the tax return process. Further, there would be no requirement to annually file these financial statements with Inland Revenue. Rather, as indicated above, they would form the basis from which the IR 10 is prepared and filed and they would be available to Inland Revenue upon request. 2.11 One of the eventual outcomes of this project is that the minimum reporting requirements will be consistent across similar types of taxpayers. 2.12 In suggesting that Inland Revenue mandate the minimum reporting requirements, it is not attempting to set itself up as an arbiter of accounting standards – this is not Inland Revenue’s role. Inland Revenue’s main interest is in the receipt of the correct amount of tax and compliance with its third-party obligations. 6 CHAPTER 3 Who should prepare financial statements and to what level 3.1 This chapter contains the specific proposals upon which submissions are sought. They are proposed to apply from years commencing on or after 1 April 2014 to active companies that will not then have a statutory obligation to prepare general- purpose financial statements. Chapter 4 discusses the detail that might apply to non- corporate businesses in the future. To what level should the financial statements be prepared? 3.2 We suggest that the minimum requirements for these financial statements would be relatively straightforward historical cost, double-entry, accrual-based financial statements that would constitute special-purpose financial statements. Where appropriate (for example, for depreciation) the financial statements can be based on taxation-based amounts and concepts. Information to be disclosed would be sufficient to allow, where relevant, the preparation of the IR 10, and to allow a review of the entity’s performance. 3.3 Notes to the financial statements or separate schedules would include a statement of accounting policies and detail of related-party transactions. Where accounting profit and taxable income are different, a reconciliation would also be required, but tax values could be used wherever appropriate in the financial statements – for example, for depreciable assets or for farmers’ fencing expenditure. 3.4 Obviously the use of tax values in financial statements would not be appropriate where they did not follow the cash-based amounts. An example of this would include the ownership of a look-through company (LTC) where the cash could be dividends or loans, but the taxable values would be a proportion of the LTC’s taxable income. Another example would be the difference between cash and taxable income from say a listed PIE. These should be adjusted for in the tax reconciliation. However, this discussion is only relevant where the relevant asset (for example, the LTC or the PIE) is included as part of the taxpayers’ financial statements. 3.5 In reality, the minimum financial reporting requirements for companies would likely be only slightly more extensive than the present requirement of the Financial Reporting Order 1994, which presently applies to small companies. 3.6 Requirements would be principles-based, although some detail would be required. This is because it is inappropriate for Inland Revenue to attempt to set the format of financial statements or tell accountants the specific detail of what should be in financial statements. Rather, it is envisaged that Inland Revenue would set the principles and some of the detail and then rely on the judgement of the person preparing the financial statements. The proposed detail about the level of reporting and associated disclosures is contained in the Appendix. 7 3.7 Given the potential complexity of related parties’ information that we are asking for (see the Appendix) we propose that this requirement apply for tax years commencing on or after 1 April 2015. As a result of our preliminary discussions with software providers, we do not anticipate that any other of the information would be technically difficult to provide. 3.8 For medium-sized companies that are complying with the present requirement to prepare general-purpose financial statements, compliance costs should decrease as these are replaced by special-purpose financial statements. This compliance cost- saving has been factored into the proposed replacement of the Financial Reporting Act discussed above. 3.9 Current Tax Administration Act requirements that all taxpayers should have sufficient records to support their tax returns will be continued. 3.10 Inland Revenue officials are participating in the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ SME Working Group which is developing a recommended accounting framework for special-purpose financial statements for SMEs. It has yet to be determined exactly how this framework will match with the minimum requirements that Inland Revenue is contemplating. 3.11 However, it seems very likely that if financial statements are prepared in accordance with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ SME framework, they will exceed Inland Revenue’s minimum requirements. The Inland Revenue requirements for financial statements would be minimum requirements – taxpayers would be free to include additional disclosures if they choose, and to comply with the framework, or even produce partially or fully GAAP-compliant 2 financial statements if they want to. 2 Generally accepted accounting principles. 8 CHAPTER 4 Non-corporate business that could prepare financial statements 4.1 This consultation is concerned with the company position, which is more immediately important given the wider objective of removing the present general- purpose requirement from years commencing 1 April 2014 onwards. However, Inland Revenue has done some preliminary thinking about which non-corporate business could be required to prepare financial statements. While this thinking is nowhere near final, comments are invited on the following:  From the tax year commencing 1 April 2015 or equivalent, subject to a minimum threshold, other taxpayers that are in business such as sole traders, partnerships and limited partnerships, and trusts could also be required to prepare special-purpose financial statements. Regardless of the attribution of partnership transactions to partners, the partners would not be required to also prepare financial statements in respect of their partnership interests (which also includes LTC and special partnership interests).  The minimum threshold for these other businesses should be such that micro- businesses should have no financial reporting obligations. However, it would seem that views of what a micro-business is vary considerably. We suggest that the GST registration threshold ($60,000 turnover or expenses, but ignoring sales or purchases of capital assets and other balance sheet transactions) is an obvious starting place. This would exclude about 40 percent of the 550,000 active IR 10 filers. However, we are very open to discussion on this.  Comment is specifically invited on whether natural individuals who derive schedular payments could usefully be exempted from this preparation requirement if their expenses are small compared with their income – say, expenses of less than 10 percent of income. 4.2 Except at the margin, we believe that most of these taxpayers are presently preparing financial statements and so there should be minimal compliance costs involved. However, we acknowledge that this is dependant on the selection of an appropriate threshold. We recognise there will be varied private-sector views about this. We welcome feedback on this now, in advance of more formal consultation on the matter, which is scheduled for next year. 9 APPENDIX Proposed minimum financial reporting requirements These are the proposed minimum financial reporting requirements for special-purpose financial statements (SPFR) for companies that are in the tax base. These minimum requirements are high-level and, while financial statements and accompanying schedules must be prepared to at least these minimum requirements, they may be prepared to a higher standard or even be general-purpose financial statements, so long as the required information is provided. If they are prepared to a higher standard that is recommended by a professional accounting body or by the External Reporting Board, items specifically footnoted on page 10 would not be explicitly required. The minimum requirements proposed are:  The financial statements should consist of a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement which shall be appropriately detailed.  They should be based on double-entry historical cost-based financial statements prepared using accrual concepts.  Where reasonably possible, tax values can be used for the determination of income and expenditure, fixed assets and depreciation, and the balance sheet.  A statement of accounting policies and changes thereto that is sufficiently detailed that a user can understand the material policies that have been applied or changed in the preparation of the financial statements.  Comparable figures for the last year should be disclosed.  The financial statements or supporting schedules should show: – The relevant (for that taxpayer) IR 10 key points. – A fully detailed financial statement to taxable income reconciliation. – A reconciliation of tax losses and movements therein for the year including loss offsets and subventions, if any. – Related party transactions, except for:  casual sales and purchases, and other immaterial irregular non-remuneration transactions; and  transactions that are between New Zealand tax-resident companies that have a common balance date and are part of the same wholly owned group. – Notes should detail (qualifying companies are exempt from the first two requirements, look-though companies are exempt from all three of these requirements):  the available subscribed capital (shareholders’ funds that can be returned tax-free to shareholders in qualifying circumstances) per class of shares issued;  any amount of realised capital gains that could be distributed tax-free upon the liquidation of the company; and  a reconciliation of opening to closing imputation credits. 10 – If a forester, a statement of cost of bush as at balance date and a reconciliation of movements. – If a specified livestock owner, detail of livestock valuation methods, valuations and calculations for taxation purposes. – A reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ equity, and loans or current accounts to/from the owner and related parties. – An appropriate note detailing “Exceptional items” – box 26 of the IR 10. – An appropriately detailed taxation-based fixed asset and depreciation schedule. – Interest should always be grossed up for resident withholding tax. – Dividends should be grossed up for imputation credits to the extent that the dividend is taxable and the credits are usable to reduce the taxpayer’s tax liability for that year. 3 – All realised and unrealised gains and losses that are recorded in the financial statements should be recorded in the profit and loss. 3 Exception  When cash (and therefore book) and tax will never directly match (for example, portfolio investment entity and foreign investment fund income, entertainment expenditure) the financial statements should reflect the cash based position with the adjustment to the tax position being part of the book-to-tax reconciliation. Explanation and comment (in no particular order):  The financial statements can be GST-inclusive or GST-exclusive, so long as the end result is “net taxable income”. However, where the taxpayer is registered for GST, GST-exclusive financial statements are strongly recommended.  Taxpayers are welcome to use a higher financial reporting standard if they desire, or to disclose more information, so long as there is an appropriate reconciliation back to “net taxable income”. For example, land and improvements may be included at valuation (and from Inland Revenue’s perspective it does not matter who does the valuation, so long as the fact of revaluation is disclosed). Further, taxpayers may adopt specific financial reporting standards for part or all of their financial statements.  “Appropriately detailed” has been deliberately left open for the judgement of the person preparing the financial statements. For example, the sales and trading stock purchases of a corner grocer are likely not to be broken down in lines, whereas, for a livestock farmer, sales and purchases of livestock will be detailed. However, in both cases a detailed listing of other expenditure will be expected. Where there is insufficient detail Inland Revenue has the power to ask for more detail. Further, the key points for the IR 10 should be part of the financial statements or the supporting schedules. 3 Not required if the financial statement has been prepared to a higher standard than recommended by a professional accounting body or the External Reporting Board. 11  A fully detailed financial reporting profit to tax reconciliation is mandatory, except when there are no adjustments. For example, this will detail any movements in non- deductible provisions on a line-by-line basis and allow for the reversal of any non- taxable gains and/or losses.  Related-party transactions except as specified, must be disclosed with appropriate supporting information – to/from, for, and the dollar amount. This should include remuneration, rents, dividends and interest. In this context, “related party” is as used in the IR 10 and its associated material.  The requirement to take all realised and unrealised gains and losses to the profit and loss account, is to ensure that that the profit and loss statement is comprehensive and that these items are not be separately taken directly to shareholders’ equity.  The IR 10 currently requires dividends to be recorded net of imputation credits. Consideration is being given to changing the IR 10 from the 2014–15 year to allow, in appropriate circumstances, dividends to be grossed up by any attached imputation credits.

This Interpretation Statement applies where:  a non-resident, situated outside New Zealand, receives a supply of immigration services from a New Zealand–based immigration advisor for the purpose of obtaining a residency visa; and  the non-resident comes to New Zealand during the period that the immigration services are performed. 2. Immigration services can include many different types of services. The scope of this Interpretation Statement is limited to visa application services provided to a non-resident individual. This Interpretation Statement does not consider:  services other than visa application services (eg, it does not consider the position where services are provided to a person to help them find employment in New Zealand); or  visa application services provided to a company on behalf of an individual. Summary 3. This Interpretation Statement considers whether a supply of visa application services can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k) when a non-resident visa applicant visits New Zealand during the visa application process. 4. GST is typically charged at 15% on services supplied in New Zealand (standard- rated). However, in certain circumstances GST will be charged at 0% (zero- rated). The amount of GST charged on a supply is determined at the time of the supply. 5. Visa application services may be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). To zero-rate under s 11A(1)(k), the recipient of the supply must be a non-resident and outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. 6. The focus of this Interpretation Statement is the requirement that the visa applicant be outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. In most cases, if the visa applicant comes to New Zealand during the visa application process, then the entire supply of services will need to be standard- rated. With some sorts of supplies it may be possible to apportion the different parts of a supply and charge different rates of GST. However, this is unlikely with visa application services because in most cases the necessary distinction will not exist between the different parts of the supply to make it reasonable to separate them. 7. The exception is where periodic payments are made for the services. A single supply may be treated as successive supplies if there are periodic payments under s 9(3)(a). The Commissioner considers that for payments to be considered ―periodic‖ they would need to have the following characteristics:  The payments need to be recurring and made at regular, fixed intervals. The payments must form a pattern of recurrence.  The intervals between payments do not have to be of exactly the same duration.  The payments do not need to be for precisely the same amount.  The payments are made as part of the regular course of events and not on isolated occasions. NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 3  The payments need to arise from an antecedent obligation. (Section 9(3)(a) will apply only where the periodic payments are set out in an agreement or enactment.) The Commissioner‘s view is also that two payments could not sensibly or commercially be regarded as periodic. 8. If the supply of visa application services is deemed to be successively supplied, then each part of the supply will be treated as if it were a separate supply. The correct GST rate needs to be determined for each successive supply. Only the successive supplies where the visa applicant is in New Zealand will be standard- rated. The other successive supplies will be zero-rated. 9. There are two further requirements for s 11A(1)(k) to apply. The first is the services cannot be supplied in connection with any New Zealand land or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand (other than as specified). The second is the services cannot be an acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand. These two factors are unlikely to be relevant in the situation covered by this Interpretation Statement. 10. Examples are included at the end of this Interpretation Statement. Introduction 11. Visa application services can be provided to a non-resident in three situations:  The first is where the non-resident remains outside New Zealand while any services are being provided by the immigration advisor. In that case, the services provided by the advisor will be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k).  The second is where the non-resident is in New Zealand while the services are being provided by the immigration advisor. In that case, any services provided by the advisor will be standard-rated.  The third is where the non-resident comes to New Zealand during the period in which the services are being provided by the immigration advisor. 12. The focus of this Interpretation Statement is the third situation. Visa application process 13. Visa applicants can apply for a visa themselves or they can use an advisor. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) is the New Zealand government agency that issues visas to those wishing to immigrate to, or work in, this country. Applicants for a skilled migrant or investor visa must provide information to INZ about their background and qualifications. This part of the process is called an ̳Expression of Interest‘. It is a self-assessment by the applicant to establish eligibility and is based on a points system. If the applicant achieves a certain number of points, INZ invites the applicant to apply formally for a visa. This part of the process is called an ̳Invitation to Apply‘ and is a formal verification by INZ of the applicant‘s eligibility. 14. Not all visa applications require this two-stage process. Some visas allow for a residence application to be submitted directly. Examples include an investor plus visa, a student visa, a work to residence visa and a visitor visa. An investor category applicant must file a detailed business plan with INZ. 15. If INZ approves a skilled migrant or investor visa application by issuing an approval in principle, the applicant must pay a migrant levy to INZ. The applicant then has a limited time to visit a New Zealand representative office outside NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 4 New Zealand to have the applicant‘s home country passport stamped with the visa. The applicant has a further time limit in which to come to New Zealand for the designated purpose. Immigration service contracts 16. A registered immigration advisor or a lawyer may supply immigration services to help a person obtain a visa. No standard contract for providing immigration services to overseas clients exists. Advisors or lawyers may choose to provide their services in a variety of ways with different conditions and payment options. A written contract is usually involved. The form of the contract will usually determine the GST implications of the supply bargained by the parties: Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA); Chatham Island Enterprises Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA); CIR v Capital Enterprises Ltd (2002) 20 NZTC 17,511 (HC); and CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd (2005) 22 NZTC 19,126 (CA). 17. Some visa applicants may come to New Zealand during the process. However, there is no common pattern among applicants. Their reasons for coming to New Zealand may or may not relate to the services or involve direct contact with the advisor. Analysis 18. To determine whether a supply of visa application services can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k), the following questions need to be considered:  When is a supply of visa application services zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k)?  Is it possible to apportion a supply of visa application services?  Are the services provided under an agreement that provides for periodic payments? 19. This statement will also consider what needs to be done if GST is later found to be payable. When is a supply of visa application services zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k)? 20. A supply of goods and services is charged at the rate of 15% on a supply in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person: ss 2(1) ―taxable supply‖, 5 and 8(1). 21. The existence and nature of any supply is usually determined by the contract: Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR, Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC) and CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA). 22. However, under s 11A a supply of services may be charged at the rate of 0% in certain circumstances. The only subsection relevant to the supply of exported visa application services is subs (1)(k). Section 11A(1)(k) provides that a supply of services will be zero-rated where: (k) subject to subsection (2), the services are supplied to a person who is a non- resident and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are— (i) supplied directly in connection with— (A) land situated in New Zealand or any improvement to the land; or (B) moveable personal property, other than choses in action or goods to which paragraph (h) or (i) applies, situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed; or NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 5 (ii) the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity, to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand; or 23. Subsection (2) is not relevant to the present facts. Accordingly, four requirements must be satisfied for the services to be zero-rated:  The recipient of the supply must be a non-resident at the time the services are performed.  The recipient must be outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed.  The services cannot be supplied in connection with any New Zealand land or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand (other than as specified).  The services cannot be an acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand. 24. The first requirement is that the recipient must be a non-resident. The requirements for residency are set out in s 2(1) of the Act and s YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007). As the recipient is seeking a visa to come and live in New Zealand, it is assumed the residency requirements will not have been satisfied. The scope of this Interpretation Statement has been limited to situations where the recipient is a non-resident. 25. The scope of the Interpretation Statement has also been limited to visa application services. So the exceptions for services supplied directly in connection with land or moveable personal property and for services which are restraints (provided for in s 11A(1)(k)(i) and (ii)) are not relevant. 26. Therefore the main issue is whether the second requirement, that the person is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, is satisfied. The Commissioner considers the requirement to be ―outside New Zealand‖ will be satisfied by a lack of physical presence in New Zealand. 27. The second requirement also specifies the person who receives the services must be outside New Zealand ―at the time the services are performed‖. Understanding when the services are performed is therefore a crucial step in determining whether a supply can be zero-rated. When are the services performed? 28. The phrase ―at the time the services are performed‖ could mean:  the point in time when the person starts providing the services; or  the period during which the person provides the services; or  the point in time when the services are completed. 29. The Commissioner considers the phrase refers to the period during which a person provides the services. This is because:  The more natural meaning of the words ―at the time the services are performed‖ refers to the whole performance of the services.  This interpretation is consistent with the destination principle, one of the key principles underlying the Act. The destination principle focuses on where the services are consumed to determine how they are treated for GST purposes. Applying this principle, the taxation of the services should be determined for the period in which the services are consumed. NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 6  This interpretation is more consistent with the purpose of the exception in s 11A(3) for a minor presence in New Zealand by a company or unincorporated body. 30. Each of these reasons is considered in more detail below. Ordinary meaning 31. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles (6 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) defines ―time‖ and ―perform‖ to mean: time ► I 1 A finite extent of continued existence, e.g. the interval between two events, or the period during which an action or state continues; a period referred to in some way. II Time when: a point in time; a space of time treated without ref. to duration. perform 1 verb trans. Carry out, fulfil (a command, promise, undertaking etc.). 2 a verb trans. Execute, accomplish, do, (any action, operation, or process undertaken or ordered). ► b verb intrans. Do or carry out any action, operation, or process undertaken or ordered; do (badly, well, etc.). 32. The word ―time‖ can mean either a passage of time or a definite point in time. To ―perform‖ can either mean to carry out or do something, or to fulfil or accomplish something. 33. Arguably, the more natural meaning of the words ―are performed‖ refers to the whole period during which services are performed. At any point during that period, it would be true to say the services ―are \[being\] performed‖. If instead the words had been ―at the time the services have been performed‖, arguably it would have been more open to conclude that the intended meaning was the point in time when the services were completed. However, care must be taken in interpreting statutory words based on tense: Public Trustee v McKay (Minister of Health) & Anor \[1969\] NZLR 995 (CA) and R v Lewis & Anor \[1975\] 2 NZLR 490 (CA). Destination principle 34. Before enactment of the Act, a discussion document was prepared entitled Administration of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Government discussion document, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, March 1985). The document stated at paragraph 32: Place of Supply 32. For goods or services supplied by registered persons to be subject to the GST, the supply must take place, or be deemed to take place, in New Zealand. ... The place of supply of services will, in general, be the place where the supplier of the service is based. Provision will be made to ensure that the GST is not levied on services performed in New Zealand for recipients outside New Zealand. This means that the following services will not be subject to the GST: ... • advertising and professional services, and transfers and assignments of rights, provided to a recipient outside New Zealand. \[Emphasis added\] 35. In 1999, the Act was reviewed. One of the areas the review considered was exported services. The resulting report, entitled GST: A Review (Government discussion document, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, March 1999), restated the broad purpose of the Act: The destination principle 9.3 The broad aim of GST is to tax at a single rate all final consumption that takes place in New Zealand. This is known as the ―destination principle‖ and means that all supplies of goods and services in New Zealand, regardless of whether they are supplied to New Zealand residents or tourists, are taxed at the standard rate of 12.5 percent \[now 15%\]. NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 7 36. Therefore, under the destination principle supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed: see also GST and Imported Services: A challenge in an electronic commerce environment (Government discussion document, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, June 2001). The destination principle is reflected in ss 8 and 11A. Section 8 levies GST on a supply (except an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Section 11A zero-rates supplies of services that are consumed outside New Zealand. 37. The destination principle means that a supply of services consumed in New Zealand is standard-rated and a supply of services consumed overseas is zero-rated under s 11A. Section 11A(1)(k) treats consumption as occurring outside New Zealand if the person receiving the supply is non-resident and outside New Zealand when the services are performed. By implication, consumption in New Zealand takes place if the person is resident in New Zealand or physically present in New Zealand when the services are performed. Residency for individuals is measured by physical presence and by enduring ties (the latter referred to as having a permanent place of abode; s 2(1) of the Act and s YD 1 of the ITA 2007). 38. As Parliament‘s purpose is to impose GST on consumption in New Zealand, it is unlikely Parliament intended ―at the time the services are performed‖ to refer to the point in time when the services started. It is unlikely Parliament intended a person who was outside New Zealand at the precise moment the services started, but in New Zealand for the remaining period the services were being provided, would be considered to have consumed the services outside New Zealand. 39. Similarly, Parliament‘s purpose to impose GST on consumption in New Zealand is not met if the visa application services are treated as being performed only at the point in time at which they are completed. It is inconsistent with the destination principle to treat consumption as occurring outside New Zealand if a person is in New Zealand for the entire period the services are being provided, except for the day the services are completed. The Commissioner considers the visa application services are performed, and consumption occurs, during the entire period in which those services are being provided. 40. However, there may be other types of supply where services are performed, and consumption occurs, only on the completion of the services. In those circumstances, subject to any other requirements of the Act being met, if the non-resident recipient is outside New Zealand when the services are completed, the supply will be zero-rated. In giving effect to the destination principle, the nature of the particular supply must be determined to establish where consumption occurs. Exception for minor presence 41. Section 11A(3) also supports the conclusion that the phrase ―at the time the services are performed‖ in s 11A(1)(k) refers to the period during which the services are being performed. Section 11A(3) provides: (3) For the purpose of subsection (1)(k), (1)(l) and (1)(ma), and subsection (1)(n) as modified by subsection (4)(b), outside New Zealand, for a company or an unincorporated body that is not resident, includes a minor presence in New Zealand, or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. 42. This section provides an exception to the requirement in s 11A(1)(k) that the recipient of the supply must be outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. The exception only applies to non-resident companies or unincorporated bodies who have a minor presence in New Zealand or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. This exception does not apply to natural persons. NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 8 43. There would not seem to be much need for this exception if the words ―at the time the services were performed‖ referred to a single point in time. If the words refer to a single point in time, and if the company has a minor presence on any other day, then the services would still be zero-rated and the company would not need to rely on the exception to maintain zero-rating. The minor presence exception would apply only if the company had a presence in New Zealand on the one day the services were taken as having been performed. The need to legislate for the exception is more consistent therefore with the words meaning the whole period during which the services are performed. 44. There is some support for this analysis in the discussion of the amendments made by the Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act 1989 in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 9 (October 1999). Under the heading ―GST – Treatment of exported services‖, the new s 11(2B) (now s 11A(3)) is discussed and the following example given (at 14): Example 6 A New Zealand advertising firm is asked by an Australian company to prepare a media campaign for a new product that the company wants to release first in Australia and then in New Zealand. The New Zealand firm is responsible for coming up with ideas and implementation of the campaign. As the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand they may be zero- rated under \[section 11A(1)(k)\]. If a staff member of the non-resident company came to New Zealand for a short period to facilitate the implementation of the media campaign this should not affect the zero-rating of the services because the presence of a \[sic\] the staff member would generally be considered to constitute a minor presence in terms of \[section 11A(3)\]. 45. The example suggests that ―at the time the services are performed‖ means during the planning and implementation of the campaign. The staff member‘s presence in New Zealand is effectively connected with the supply of those services but their presence is minor, so zero-rating is not lost. 46. Accordingly, it seems more likely that in enacting s 11A(3) Parliament intended to address the situation where a non-resident company or unincorporated body has a minor presence in New Zealand during the time services are performed. Conclusion 47. The Commissioner considers the phrase ―at the time the services are performed‖ refers to the period during which a person provides the services. Is it possible to apportion a supply of immigration services? 48. For a supply to be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k) a person must be both physically absent from New Zealand and a non-resident during the period in which the services are being performed. So if a person enters New Zealand during the period in which the services are being performed, does that mean the whole supply must be standard-rated or can the supply be apportioned into zero-rated and standard-rated parts? 49. The Commissioner‘s view is that, on the facts outlined in this Interpretation Statement, it will generally not be appropriate to apportion the supply for the reasons explained below. No apportionment available under ss 5(14) and 10(18) 50. Sections 5(14) and 10(18) specifically deal with apportioning parts of a supply. However, neither section is applicable in this case. 51. Section 5(14) provides: NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 9 (14) If a supply is charged with a tax under section 8, but section 11, 11A, 11AB, 11B, or 11C requires part of the supply to be charged at the rate of 0%, that part of the supply is treated as being a separate supply. 52. Section 5(14) applies only after it has been decided that a supply can be apportioned into zero-rated and standard-rated parts under a substantive provision. (See IS 08/01, ―GST - role of section 5(14) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in regard to the zero-rating of part of a supply‖, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 5 (June 2008): 8). The wording of s 5(14) is inconsistent with the provision applying before reference has been made to the specific zero-rating provisions. The purpose of s 5(14) is not to apportion a supply, but to deem the apportioned part of a supply to be a separate supply. 53. Section 10(18) provides: (18) Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. 54. Section 10(18) is also not a general apportionment provision: CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 (CA). Section 10(18) applies where a part of a supply is taxable and a part of the supply is not. Section 10(18) cannot apply to apportion a supply that has a zero-rated part and a standard-rated part because both parts are taxable. (A zero-rated supply is still a taxable supply; it is just taxed at 0%.) No relevant apportionment words in s 11A(1)(k) 55. Subparagraph (ii) of s 11A(1)(k) contains the apportionment words ―to the extent that‖. Subparagraph (ii) stipulates that those services outlined in the substantive part of the provision are not entitled to zero-rating if they are supplied in connection with the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity, to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand. 56. By contrast, the substantive part of s 11A(1)(k) (that states that services can be zero-rated if they are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed), contains no apportionment language. Parliament could have chosen to insert apportionment words into the substantive part of the section, but did not do so. Apportionment words appear in other paragraphs in s 11A: paras (b), (c), (ma), and (o) and ss (4). 57. The lack of any words of apportionment in the substantive part of the section suggests that Parliament did not intend for there to be an ability to apportion a supply under s 11A(1)(k). No general ability to apportion on these facts 58. The courts have held there is a general ability to apportion zero-rated parts of a supply under the Act where, on the facts, there is a true distinction between parts of a supply. This general ability to apportion is not reliant on ss 5(14) and 10(18) or apportioning words in the specific provision. 59. Tipping J in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140 (HC) and Hansen J in Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR suggest there is a general ability to apportion zero-rated parts of a supply. In Auckland Institute of Studies Hansen J stated at \[25\]: Principles of apportionment \[25\] Tipping J derived some assistance from s 10(18) in considering the apportionment of zero- rated and standard rated supplies in C of IR v Smiths City Group Limited (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140, the only New Zealand case to have considered the issue. It concerned the sale of a commercial property, part of which was dedicated to use as a car sales yard, the balance being unused land. The parties claimed the transaction to be zero rated as the business supplied was a going concern. In the course of an appeal against the finding of the Taxation Review Authority that NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 10 the one-third of the property comprising bare land should not be zero rated, Tipping J said at p 9,144: ―If an apportionment or severance argument is raised the Authority must decide as a matter of fact and degree whether there is in the transaction under scrutiny a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion accordingly.‖ As to the basis on which an apportionment should take place, he said: ―The only assistance, on the material to which I was referred, seems to derive from sec 10(18) which, as earlier noted, provides that where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates the supply shall be deemed for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. That of course relates to the distinction between a supply which is taxable and one which is not. It would seem logical however to apply the same approach to a supply which is in part liable for tax at the standard rate and is in part zero rated.‖ \[Emphasis added\] 60. Th is suggests the general approach to apportioning zero-rated and standard- rated parts of a supply is similar to the ability under s 10(18) to apportion taxable and non-taxable supplies. 61. Hansen J went on to consider several UK VAT cases and then summarised the principles as follows at \[36\]: I take the following key principles from this review of the authorities: (a) In determining whether a supply may be apportioned for GST purposes, it is necessary to examine the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to determine whether there is a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion them accordingly. (b) The enquiry is to determine whether one element of the transaction (or consideration given) is a necessary or integral part of another or whether it is merely ancillary to or incidental to that other element. (c) A service will be ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. 62. Therefore, there is a general ability to apportion zero-rated parts of a supply from the standard-rated parts. However, this ability to apportion is restricted to circumstances where, as a matter of fact and degree, a sufficient distinction exists between the different parts of the transaction (or consideration) to make it reasonable to separate them. 63. It may be possible in certain circumstances to separate the parts of a supply based on the hours worked or the nature of the work done and the amount charged for such work. However, a sufficient distinction must exist between the different parts to make it reasonable to separate them. 64. Such a distinction is unlikely to be present in the circumstances outlined in this Interpretation Statement. Generally all of the services are performed as part of one supply – the supply of services to facilitate obtaining a visa. Services provided under an agreement that provides for periodic payments 65. Another possible way that a supply of services may be treated as separate supplies, so that standard-rating applies to some parts and zero-rating to other parts, is under s 9(3)(a). Under that section a single supply may be treated as successive supplies if the services are supplied under an agreement which provides for periodic payments. 66. Section 9(3)(a) provides: (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) or subsection (2), — (a) where goods are supplied under an agreement to hire, or where services are supplied under any agreement or enactment which provides for periodic payments, they shall be deemed to be successively supplied for successive parts of the period of the agreement or the enactment, and each of the successive supplies shall be NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 11 deemed to take place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier: 67. Section 9(3)(a) applies to ―services ... supplied under any agreement ... which provides for periodic payments‖. Where there are periodic payments, under s 9(3)(a) the services are treated as being successively supplied for successive parts of the period of the agreement. Each of the successive supplies will have a separate time of supply. At each successive time of supply it is necessary to determine the correct GST rating to apply to the relevant successive supply. If the requirements of s 11A(1)(k) are satisfied for one instance of a successive supply, then that supply must be zero-rated. If the requirements of s 11A(1)(k) are not satisfied for a successive supply, then that supply must be standard- rated. What is the effect of s 9(3)(a)? 68. There are potentially two ways that s 9(3)(a) can be interpreted. 69. The first is that s 9(3)(a) treats the successive supplies of visa application services as being a single supply, with the payments being either entirely standard-rated or entirely zero-rated, depending on whether the non-resident applicant was inside or outside New Zealand at the time of the first payment. This argument is based on s 9(3)(a) being no more than an extension of the mechanics of s 9(1). It is arguable that Parliament‘s purpose with s 9 was to create a series of rules that determined the time of a supply. Section 9(3)(a) is therefore part of s 9 for the purpose of providing time of supply rules and it does not create separate supplies. The outcome of this interpretation is that s 9(3)(a) does no more than determine when the tax is payable in respect of a successive supply: CIR v Capital Enterprises Ltd. The timing of any tax payable under the single supply would not affect its rating. 70. The second interpretation is that s 9(3)(a) moves beyond timing to deem a single supply to be ―successive supplies‖ with each successive supply being standard- rated or zero-rated depending on whether the non-resident visa applicant was inside or outside New Zealand at the time of each successive supply. 71. Support for this interpretation can be found in the plain language of s 9(3)(a). Section 9(3)(a) contains the word ―deemed‖ twice. It deems the payments to be ―successively supplied for successive parts of the period of the agreement‖ and it also deems the supplies ―to take place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier‖. This suggests that s 9(3)(a), in deeming a supply to be made up of successive supplies, moves beyond time of supply to create a series of supplies. Under such an approach the successive supplies should be considered separately from the original supply as if they were single supplies. 72. The view in the commentary on the GST rate change released in 2010 is that under s 9(3)(a) the applicable rate of GST is determined at the time of supply for each successive supply: see “Changes to the Goods and Service Act 1985 to help businesses transition to the new GST rate: A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue (10 August 2010)” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010): 72: Option of general time of supply or successive supplies rule The second instance arises because some suppliers of what are arguably successive supplies (for example, utilities and phone line rentals) account for GST on the basis of when the invoice is issued rather than when payment is due or received. Technically, the GST rate on a successive supply should be determined by when the payment is due or received rather than when the invoice is issued. Under normal circumstances this makes no difference but with a rate change some suppliers are uncertain about whether a September NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 12 invoice, for example, would need to be charged at 12.5% or at 15% as this could be dependent on whether the customer paid or was required to pay before 1 October. \[Emphasis added\] 73. The GST Advisory Panel website (< www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/how-do-i- determine-which-gst-rate-use-125-or-15-over-transition-period> accessed 8 February 2012) seemed to take the same approach: The rule in s.(9)(3)(a) as set out above varies from the general time of supply rule by providing that where services are successively supplied, then each such successive supply shall be deemed to take place when any payment becomes due or is received, which ever (sic) is the earlier. This recognises that where services are supplied over time, and are paid by way of instalments, it is more appropriate to recognise the time of supply for GST purposes as the earlier of the date when each payment is either due, \[or\] it is paid. 74. Further, commentary on the introduction of s 9(3)(aa) in Public Information Bulletin No 150 (July 1986) stated that : The amending legislation now also deems a separate supply to occur in respect of contracts which provide for the periodic or progressive supply of goods and which also provide for progress payments related directly to the degree of performance of the contract. \[Emphasis added\] 75. While, s 9(3)(aa) does not deal with the same issue as s 9(3)(a), the issues are similar. As a result, it is arguable that the commentary from the Public Information Bulletin applies to both paragraphs. 76. This interpretation is also consistent with the destination principle. As mentioned above, under the destination principle, supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where they are consumed. If the first interpretation is accepted this would mean that taxpayers could lock-in zero-rating even when the non- resident applicant comes to New Zealand simply because they were outside New Zealand when the first payment was made. This outcome would be inconsistent with Parliament‘s purpose. 77. Similar concerns would arise if Parliament wanted to change the GST rate. Under the first interpretation, taxpayers who are making payments under a long-term contract (possibly spanning years) could continue to apply an earlier GST rate simply because the first payment was made at the lower rate. 78. It is therefore the Commissioner‘s view that s 9(3)(a) is more than just a timing provision. It has the effect of deeming a single supply to be successive supplies with each successive supply being standard-rated or zero-rated depending on whether the non-resident visa applicant was inside or outside New Zealand at the time of supply. What are periodic payments? 79. Section 9(3)(a) applies to periodic payments. ―Periodic payments‖ is not a defined term in the Act. Therefore it is necessary to consider the following to assist with its interpretation:  The ordinary meaning of the term ―periodic payments‖.  How the courts have interpreted ―periodic payments‖ or similar phrases.  Statutory context. Ordinary meaning 80. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles (6 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) defines ―periodic‖ to mean: periodic ...2 Characterized by periods; recurring or reappearing at regular or any intervals (of time or space); intermittent; 81. It also defines ―regular‖, ―recur‖ and ―intermittent‖ to mean: NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 13 regular ... A adjective. 3 Characterized by the presence or operation of a definite principle; steady or uniform in action, procedure, or occurrence; esp recurring or repeated at fixed times, recurring at short uniform intervals. recur ... 5 Of an event, fact, state, etc.: occur or appear again, periodically, or repeatedly. intermittent... A adjective. That ceases for a time; occurring at intervals; not continuous. 82. Accordingly, ―periodic‖ has two ordinary meanings:  recurring at regular intervals;  recurring intermittently. 83. Based on the definition of ―regular‖, regular intervals may be, but need not be, uniform intervals. Further, the ordinary meanings do not mention a minimum number of recurrences for something to be periodic. 84. In summary, the term ―periodic‖ has various possible ordinary meanings. The meanings range from requiring regular payments to payments made intermittently. Accordingly, the ordinary meaning of the term ―periodic‖ in s 9(3)(a) indicates it could apply to either regularly recurrent payments or intermittently recurrent payments. Case Law 85. The term ―periodic payments‖ has not been judicially considered in the context of s 9(3)(a). However, that term and similar words have been considered in other contexts. The consideration of similar words may be useful in determining the meaning of ―periodic payments‖ in s 9(3)(a). New Zealand Cases 86. There are three New Zealand decisions of relevance: Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391 (TRA), Blackledge & Ors (Centrepoint) v Social Security Commission & Anor (HC Auckland CP 81/87, 17 February 1992) and McElroy v Director-General of Social Welfare (1992) 9 FRNZ 366 (FC). Case L67 considers the meaning of ―periodic supply‖ and ―periodic payment‖, whereas Blackledge and McElroy consider whether services were supplied periodically, as opposed to whether payments are periodic. The Commissioner does not believe that ―periodic‖ would necessarily take on a different meaning depending on whether it relates to services, supplies or payments. The word itself is not a term of art; it is the ordinary meaning that is of importance in interpreting s 9(3)(a). 87. In Case L67 a taxpayer sold some sections of land at auction. Deposits were paid and the taxpayer returned GST on the amount of those deposits, not on the full purchase price of the sections (the remainder of the purchase price was due on settlement). The issue before the court was whether GST was payable on the full purchase price of the sections at the time of sale at auction or on settlement. The taxpayer argued, amongst other things, that the land was supplied progressively to the purchasers under s 9(3)(aa)(i), so that each supply was deemed to take place whenever any payment became due or was received, or an invoice was issued. 88. This argument failed for a number of reasons. However, the Commissioner‘s submission that, even if there was a supply of a good, the payments were not ―paid in instalments or periodically and in relation to the periodic or progressive supply of those goods‖ is relevant here. 89. Barber DJ discussed counsel for the Commissioner‘s submission as follows (at 1,397): Mr Panckhurst then submitted that even if an equitable estate were ―a good‖ and the transfer of such an equitable estate were ―supply‖ as defined by the Act, consideration is not paid, in NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 14 the present instance, in relation to such supply and therefore the necessary relationship contemplated by sec 9(3)(aa)(i) does not exist. In other words, he submitted that the requirements of the subsection as to the mode of supply, and the relation of payment thereto, still need to be met; and he submitted that the present case does not fit within these requirements. He referred to the definition of ―progressively‖ in the Oxford English Dictionary as including: ―in a progressive manner; in the way of progression or progress; by continuous advance; step by step; gradually; successively; ...‖ That Dictionary gives the following definition of ―periodically‖: ―at regularly recurring or definite intervals ... from time to time; every now and then.‖ Mr Panckhurst submitted that the terms ―periodically‖ and ―progressively‖ envisage a number of stages and a pattern of recurrent supply which do not sit easily with the passing of two different interests in the same stage. He submitted that, in the context of the section, those terms envisage the transfer of similar goods over a period of time, not the passing of different interests in the same goods, namely, the intangible chose in action and a legal interest. \[Emphasis added.\] 90. Barber DJ concluded (at 1,397): I agree with the submissions and arguments put forward on behalf of the respondent. The method of sale of sections by the objector cannot be regarded as a progressive or periodical supply of goods for which payment is in instalments or periodically and in relation to the periodic or progressive supply of those goods. There is no consideration for the initial passing of an equitable estate to the purchaser. The deposit is 10% of the purchase price of the section and is paid as a part payment of that total price. The deposit is not ―the consideration for that supply‖ or the consideration for any supply, it is part of the total consideration for the supply of a parcel of land. There is no relationship between the value of each of the two steps in the transaction, namely deposit and value of the agreement, and final payment and value of the title. There is no sufficient relationship between payments and each step. There is no progressive or periodical supply of a good because the initial creation of an equitable estate is a chose in action which, by definition, is not a good. I do not think it matters that different interests (equitable and legal estates) are involved at different stages. However, only two steps are involved. The transaction cannot sensibly or commercially be regarded as a progressive or periodical supply of anything. There is no gradual, or step by step, approach of supply — only two steps. \[Emphasis added.\] 91. Barber DJ agreed with the submission that the term ―periodic‖ envisages a number of stages and a pattern of recurrent supply. Although Case L67 only discusses ―periodic‖ in s 9(3)(aa)(i), not s 9(3)(a), the Commissioner‘s view is that a discussion about the meaning of ―periodic‖ in this paragraph is relevant to an inquiry into the meaning of that same word in a neighbouring paragraph of the same subsection. 92. In Blackledge Tompkins J was asked to decide whether the provision by a trust of food, clothing and shelter was income under s 3 of the Social Security Act 1964. The definition of ―income‖ included ―services supplied periodically...‖. His Honour concluded that ―periodically‖ meant ―regularly over a period, not on only isolated occasions‖ (at 26). 93. McElroy also concerned the interpretation of s 3 of the Social Security Act 1964 and the phrase ―periodical payments of money‖. Inglis J applied the decision in Blackledge and held that ―periodical‖ and ―periodically‖ did not mean ―recurring at regular periods or intervals in the sense of once a week or once a month but rather as meaning happening as part of the regular course of events and not happening ...on isolated occasions‖ (at 369-70). 94. Case L67 also confirms that two steps could not commercially or sensibly be regarded as ―periodical‖, because in that case there was not a gradual step by step approach to supply. (See also the decisions of the Court of Appeal in CIR v Parsons (No. 2) \[1968\] NZLR 574, 586 and the Labour Court in New Zealand (with exceptions) Woollen Mills, etc, IUOW v Cavalier Bremworth Limited (1990) 3 NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 15 NZELC 97,664. The context was different in both cases; however, each reached the view that payments made on only two occasions could not be considered ―periodic‖.) 95. In summary, the New Zealand cases tend to indicate that ―periodic‖ or ―periodically‖ mean the following:  Step by step, gradual.  Pattern of recurrence.  Regularly over a period, not on isolated occasions.  Not recurring at regular periods or intervals, in the sense of once a week or once a month, but happening as part of a regular course of events. The cases also suggest that two payments could not sensibly or commercially be regarded as ―periodic‖. United Kingdom Cases 96. Jones v Ogle (1872-73) L.R. 8 Ch. App. 192 \[CA\] considered the meaning of the phrase ―periodical payments in the nature of income‖ in s 2 of the Apportionment Act 1870. Selbourne LC held (at 198): ...they must be payments which are made periodically, recurring at fixed times, and not merely variable periods, or in the exercise of the discretion of one or more individuals, but from some antecedent obligation. 97. Russell Vaught v Tel Sell UK Limited \[2005\] EWHC 2404 (QB) also concerned s 2 of the Apportionment Act 1870. This case suggests a periodic payment must be one which falls due at predetermined intervals, the amount of which is fixed at the outset and does not vary. 98. Ward LJ in BJ Rice & Associates (A firm) v Commissioner of Customs and Excise \[1996\] BVC 211 \[CA\], considered the meaning of a similar phrase, ―payable periodically‖, in a similar context to s 9(3)(a). Ward LJ concluded that ―payable periodically‖ means at regular intervals rather than irregular intervals. However, this decision may be of limited value for a number of reasons. First, Ward LJ‘s comments were obiter. The definition of ―payable periodically‖ was not an issue the court needed to decide. Further, he was attempting to draw a distinction between two different concepts in the United Kingdom VAT legislation – ―payable periodically‖ and ―from time to time‖. This distinction is not present in the New Zealand legislation. Arguably, the existence of the phrase ―from time to time‖ influences and limits the interpretation that can be given to ―payable periodically‖. 99. These United Kingdom cases tend to suggest that ―periodical payments‖ recur at fixed, predetermined intervals and must stem from some antecedent obligation. Canadian Cases 100. The Canadian courts have also considered the meaning of the phrase ―periodic payment‖. In No 427 v Minister of National Revenue 57 DTC 291 (Tax Appeal Board), the court was asked to consider whether a payment was a ―periodic payment‖ under the definition of ―income‖ in the Income Tax Act 1952. Chairman W.S Fisher Q.C held (at 294): I am of the opinion that it is not necessary for all of the payments to be identical in order to qualify them as periodic payments, so long as they are specifically provided for in the decree and occur periodically, that is, at fixed times, and so long as they arise from some antecedent obligation – (in this case, the former relationship of husband and wife) – and are not payable at variable periods which can be varied at the discretion of individuals.... NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 16 101. In R v Jean Guay 75 DTC 5044 (Federal Court of Canada) the court concluded that ―periodic payments‖ do not need to take place at intervals of equal duration. ―Periodic‖ suggests ―something which recurs from time to time but not necessarily at precise or regular intervals‖ (at 5,047). 102. The Canadian cases suggest that ―periodic payments‖:  Recur from time to time, but not necessarily at precise, equal or regular intervals.  Do not need to be for identical amounts.  Occur at fixed times from an antecedent obligation. Summary of the case law 103. While no definitive statement exists in the case law on the meaning of the term ―periodic payments‖, some consistent themes emerge. The New Zealand cases suggest the term means payments made as part of the regular course of events and not on isolated occasions. Case L67 suggests a pattern of recurrence is required and that two payments would not be enough. The United Kingdom cases suggest the payments (both the intervals and the amount) should arise from an antecedent obligation and occur at pre-determined fixed times. The Canadian courts suggest the payments do not need to be identical or made at intervals of equal duration, but they must take place at fixed times and arise from an antecedent obligation. Statutory context 104. In trying to understand the meaning of ―periodic payments‖ in s 9(3)(a), it is useful to consider the surrounding sections of the Act to see whether they can provide any statutory guidance as to the intended meaning. Section 9(1) 105. The clearest contextual indication regarding the minimum number of payments required to be ―periodic‖ is found in s 9(1). Under s 9(1), the time of supply is triggered on the receipt of ―any payment‖ in respect of a supply. ―Any payment‖ obviously contemplates a part payment. The part payment may take the form of an initial deposit or instalment of the consideration for the supply. However, if ―periodic payments‖ were to be interpreted to include every situation where two payments were made, then the scope of the general time of supply rule in s 9(1) would be significantly reduced. It seems unlikely that Parliament would have intended this outcome. 106. For example, the consideration for a supply might be payable by way of a 10% deposit with the balance of the consideration payable in a lump sum on performance of the services. Section 9(1) triggers the time of supply for the entire supply when the deposit is paid. In CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446 (HC), Salmon J said (at 13,457-13,458): Section 9 of the Act provides that a supply is made at the time ―any payment is received by the supplier‖ if an invoice has not been issued at that time. The words ―any payment‖ include the payment of a deposit: Case R11 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,062. Accordingly, a supplier who is a ―registered person‖ will take into account, in fixing the amount of the deposit under the contract, that he or she may have to account to the Commissioner for GST from the time the deposit is received. 107. It seems more consistent with s 9(1) that s 9(3)(a) does not apply to supplies involving the payment of deposits with the balance paid later in a lump sum. Accordingly, if only two payments are provided for in a contract for visa application services, the Commissioner considers it unlikely the payments are NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 17 periodic payments. If that is the case then the visa application services will not be successive supplies under s 9(3)(a). Section 9(3)(aa) 108. Section 9(3)(aa) is part of the same subsection as s 9(3)(a). Therefore the words used in para (aa) may be interpretively relevant to words used in para (a). 109. Section 9(3)(aa) provides: (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) or subsection (2), — ... (aa) where and to the extent that— (i) goods are supplied progressively or periodically pursuant to any agreement or enactment which provides for the consideration for that supply to be paid in instalments or periodically and in relation to the periodic or progressive supply of those goods; or (ii) goods and services supplied directly in the construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of a building or an engineering work are supplied pursuant to any agreement or enactment which provides for the consideration for that supply to become due and payable in instalments or periodically in relation to the progressive nature of that construction, manufacture, or extension— those goods and services shall be deemed to be successively supplied, and each such successive supply shall be deemed to take place whenever any payment in respect of that supply becomes due, is received, or any invoice relating only to that payment is issued, whichever is the earlier: 110. Unlike s 9(3)(a), ss 9(3)(aa)(i) and (ii) use the words ―progressively‖ and ―progressive‖ as well as ―periodically‖. It could be argued that in both ss 9(3)(a) and 9(3)(aa) ―periodic‖ should therefore be treated as having a meaning distinct from the meaning of ―progressive‖. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles (6 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) defines ―progressive‖ to mean ―\[p\]roceeding by stages in a series; successive‖. 111. This definition suggests a progressive supply would be a single supply made in a number of stages. Arguably, if ―progressive‖ is intended to capture supplies related to the progress of the delivery of that supply, then ―periodic‖ should be limited to agreements for regular on-going payments, where payments are due at particular times unrelated to delivery of the supply. 112. However, the contrary view can also be argued. ―Periodic‖ is used in several places in s 9(3)(aa) and, in fact, the order of ―periodic‖ and ―progressive‖ is reversed in one place. ―Periodic‖ is also contrasted with ―instalment‖. Section 9(3)(aa)(ii) applies to periodic payments or instalments paid ―in relation to the progressive nature of that construction, manufacture, or extension‖, envisaging that it is possible to have a periodic payment made in relation to the progressive nature of construction. These features of the wording suggest it was not intended to be read in a highly technical way, but that the two words ―periodic‖ and ―progressive‖ mean the same thing or at least have a degree of overlap. Under this interpretation, where ―progressive‖ and ―periodic‖ have the same or similar meaning, it is arguable that a ―periodic‖ payment could take place at irregular intervals depending on the stages and steps in the progressive supply and that these irregular intervals could still be considered ―periodic‖. 113. On balance, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusion on the meaning of ―periodic‖ from considering the words in s 9(3)(aa). NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 18 Statutory context summary 114. Section 9(1) suggests that two payments would not be sufficient to constitute ―periodic‖. Section 9(3)(aa) does not provide enough guidance on the meaning of ―periodic‖ to reach any clear conclusions. Conclusions on the meaning of “periodic payments” 115. Drawing from the ordinary meaning, case law and statutory context, a number of characteristics may be identified that suggest what a periodic payment is:  The payments need to be recurring and made at regular, fixed intervals. Recurring payments at irregular intervals may also suffice, but that will depend on the other characteristics of the payments as to whether they can be said to be truly ―periodic‖.  The payments must form a pattern of recurrence.  The payments do not need to be for precisely the same amount.  The payments are made as part of the regular course of events and not on isolated occasions.  The payments need to arise from an antecedent obligation. (Section 9(3)(a) will apply only where the periodic payments are set out in an agreement or enactment.) Two payments could not sensibly or commercially be regarded as periodic. Treatment of successive supplies 116. As has been explained above, the operation of s 9(3)(a) has the effect of treating the successive supplies as if they were separate supplies. At each successive time of supply, the correct GST rate must be determined for the relevant supply. If visa application services are supplied under an agreement which provides for periodic payments, ss 9(3)(a) and 11A(1)(k) apply as follows:  If the visa applicant is outside New Zealand when the first time of supply is triggered, the immigration advisor can zero-rate the first payment. If the visa applicant stays outside New Zealand the subsequent successive supplies can also be zero-rated.  The services are deemed to be supplied for the relevant successive parts of the period of the agreement. The periods may relate to steps in the process, such as the application for the Expression of Interest and the application for the Invitation to Apply. The time of supply for each of the successive supplies is the earlier of when a payment becomes due or is received for that supply.  The correct GST rate for each successive supply must be determined. If the visa applicant is outside New Zealand during the period in which the services are performed for a successive supply, then that supply would be zero-rated. If the visa applicant is in New Zealand at any point during the performance of the services for the successive supply, then the supply must be standard- rated.  If a successive supply is initially zero-rated but the visa applicant comes to New Zealand during the performance of the supply, that supply will need to be standard-rated. The provisions discussed at \[117\] to \[129\] will need to be considered. What needs to be done if GST is later found to be payable? 117. If a non-resident comes to New Zealand during the period that the visa application services are being performed and apportionment (as explained at \[48\] NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 19 to \[64\] above) and s 9(3)(a) do not apply, then the GST treatment of the payment for the supply may need to be changed. 118. For example, an applicant makes a one-off payment to an immigration advisor for a supply of visa application services. The supply is zero-rated because it is assumed the requirements of s 11A(1)(k) will be satisfied and the applicant will remain outside New Zealand during the period the services are being performed. However, if the applicant comes to New Zealand during this period, the entire supply will have to be standard-rated. The immigration advisor may have already returned the payment on the basis that the supply is zero-rated. The treatment of the supply and the payment will therefore need to be changed. The immigration advisor will have to pay additional GST as a result. This section discusses what needs to be done to account for the additional GST. 119. There are three options if the supply subsequently has to be standard-rated:  In some circumstances, s 25 will allow the immigration advisor to issue a debit note to the visa applicant to reflect the increased GST.  If the increased GST is less than $500, the immigration advisor can include it in a subsequent GST return.  Otherwise, the immigration advisor has to notify the Commissioner of the error by submitting sufficient details to enable the Commissioner to amend the assessment. 120. The three options are discussed in more detail below. Section 25 121. Section 25 may apply where there has been a change in the consideration for a supply. In some circumstances, the change in the rate of GST chargeable on a supply will result in a change in the amount of consideration. Whether the consideration changes will depend on whether the contract provides that the consideration will increase if the GST payable increases. If the contract says the amount payable is a particular amount ―plus GST‖ and the rate of GST increases from 0% to the standard rate, then the consideration will change too and s 25 will apply. Conversely, if the contract says the consideration, including GST, is a particular fixed amount, then an increase in the rate of GST will not result in a change to the consideration and s 25 will not apply. If the requirements of s 25 are satisfied, then the immigration advisor may be able to issue a debit note to the visa applicant reflecting the increase in consideration. 122. This view is based on the following sections in the Act. Section 25 provides (as relevant): 25 Credit and debit notes (1) This section shall apply where, in relation to the supply of goods and services by any registered person,— ... (b) the previously agreed consideration for that supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise; or ... and the supplier has— (d) provided a tax invoice in relation to that supply and as a result of any 1 or more of the above events, the amount shown thereon as tax charged on that supply is incorrect; or (e) furnished a return in relation to the taxable period for which output tax on that supply is attributable and, as a result of any 1 or more of the above events, has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax on that supply. NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 20 123. Paragraph (b) applies where the previously agreed consideration for a supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise. ―Consideration‖ is defined in s 2(1): consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body 124. Section 10(2) provides that the consideration is the aggregate of the value of the supply and the GST charged. Therefore, the consideration includes the GST. If the contract is worded so that a change in GST would result in a change of consideration, s 25(1)(b) will be triggered. Such a result may be caused by the standard-rating of a supply that had previously been zero-rated. 125. When s 25 applies, a debit note could be issued to the visa applicant to reflect the change in the GST rating of the supply. The immigration advisor would then need to account for the increased GST in the return for the taxable period in which the debit note was issued. No use of money interest would normally be payable as the extra GST would be due only once the debit note had been issued. Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 126. Alternatively, if the additional GST is less than $500 for a single return, then the additional GST may be included in a subsequent return under s 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The requirements of s 113A will need to be satisfied. Amended return 127. There is no specific statutory procedure if the requirements of s 113A of the TAA or s 25 of the Act are not satisfied. Instead, the immigration advisor would have to notify the Commissioner of the error by submitting sufficient details to enable the Commissioner to amend the assessment pursuant to s 113 of the TAA. (See para 33 of SPS 07/03 ―Request to amend assessments‖ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 5 (June 2007): 11.) 128. Use of money interest would normally apply from the return period in which the original GST liability arose. Summary 129. Section 25 may apply to reverse the incorrect zero-rating of a supply. However, s 25 will not apply in all circumstances. If the additional GST is less than $500 for a single return and the requirements of s 113A of the TAA are satisfied, then the additional GST may be included in a subsequent return. If neither s 25 nor s 113A of the TAA apply, then the immigration advisor would have to notify the Commissioner of the error by submitting sufficient details to enable the Commissioner to amend the assessment. Conclusion 130. A supply of visa application services may be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k) where the supply is:  to a person who is a non-resident at the time the services are performed;  to a person who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed;  not supplied in connection with any New Zealand land or moveable personal property (other than as specified) situated in New Zealand; NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 21  not an acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand. 131. If there is only one payment for the supply of visa application services and the visa applicant comes to New Zealand during the period that the services are being performed, then the supply will have to be standard-rated. Different parts of the supply can be apportioned only where, as a matter of fact and degree, a sufficient distinction exists between the different parts to make it reasonable to separate them. This is considered unlikely in the present circumstances. 132. However, if the visa applicant comes to New Zealand during the visa application process, the whole supply might not need to be standard-rated. This occurs if the single supply of visa application services is treated as successive supplies under s 9(3)(a). A single supply may be treated as successive supplies if there are periodic payments. The Commissioner considers certain characteristics will need to be present for a payment to be ―periodic‖. If there are periodic payments, each of the successive supplies will have a separate time of supply. At each successive time of supply, the correct GST rate must be determined for the relevant supply. The correct rate for each successive supply will be determined by whether the recipient is in New Zealand at any time during the performance of that supply. If the requirements of s 11A(1)(k) are satisfied, then the supply must be zero-rated. If the requirements of s 11A(1)(k) are not satisfied, then the supply must be standard-rated. 133. If the visa applicant comes to New Zealand during the period that the services are being performed (and apportionment and s 9(3)(a) do not apply), then the GST treatment of the payment for the supply may need to be changed. The provisions discussed at \[117\] – \[ 129\] above would need to be considered. Examples 134. The following examples have been included to help explain the application of the law. The examples used reflect the current immigration processes. In the event these processes change, provided the changes are not material, the substantive results would remain the same. However, if the changes are more fundamental, then the matter would need to be further considered and a different outcome might apply. 135. As noted at \[23\] above, there are four requirements that must be satisfied before a supply of visa application services can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). The following examples only consider the requirement that the person be outside New Zealand when the services are performed. For the purposes of the examples, the other requirements are assumed to have been satisfied. Example 1 – Applicant remains outside New Zealand for the entire visa application process 136. Rafa lives in Pakistan. She enters into a contract with a New Zealand–based immigration advisor to help her apply for a skilled migrant visa. She remains outside New Zealand for the entire visa application process. The supply of visa application services will be zero-rated. Example 2 – Applicant signs contract outside New Zealand and remains outside New Zealand for the entire visa application process 137. Katerina lives in Sweden. She wants to immigrate to New Zealand under a skilled migrant visa. She comes to New Zealand to meet with an immigration lawyer. Katerina has some initial discussions with her lawyer and then returns home to NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 22 Sweden. She signs the lawyer‘s contract in Sweden and remains outside New Zealand for the entire visa application process. 138. The supply of visa application services will be zero-rated as Katerina was outside New Zealand during the time the services were performed. Example 3 – Applicant has a ―GST inclusive‖ contract and enters New Zealand during the visa application process 139. Oscar lives in Ireland and wants to immigrate to New Zealand. He enters into a contract with a New Zealand–based immigration advisor to assist him in obtaining an investor visa. The contract provides that there is one lump sum payment for the services provided by the advisor. The payment is to be made after the visa has been granted. The contract provides that the price is ―GST inclusive if any‖. Oscar comes to New Zealand during the visa application process to look at housing and schooling for his family. 140. Since there is only one payment, and Oscar has come to New Zealand during the process, the entire supply will have to be standard-rated. Given the contract provides that the price is ―GST inclusive if any‖, the immigration advisor will have to account for GST. The tax fraction will need to be applied to the GST inclusive amount to see how much GST is included in the price. With the GST rate at 15% the tax fraction is 3/23. Example 4 – Applicant has a ―plus GST if any‖ contract and enters New Zealand during the visa application process 141. Felix lives in Spain. He wants to immigrate to New Zealand under a skilled migrant visa. He enters into a contract with a New Zealand–based immigration lawyer to assist in obtaining the visa. The contract provides for a one-off payment at the start of the services. The price is ―plus GST if any‖. During the visa application process, Felix comes to New Zealand to talk to his lawyer about the visa application process. As a result, the entire supply must be standard- rated. The change in the GST rate increases the consideration payable under the contract. 142. The advisor can issue a debit note to Felix under s 25 to reflect the increased consideration. The advisor has to account for the increased GST in the return for the taxable period in which the debit note is issued. Example 5 – Applicant has ―GST inclusive‖ contract and enters New Zealand during the visa application process. GST difference is less than $500. 143. Diego lives in Mexico. He wants to immigrate to New Zealand under a skilled migrant visa. He enters into a contract with a New Zealand–based immigration lawyer to assist in obtaining the visa. The contract provides for a one-off payment of $3,000 at the start of the services. The price is ―GST inclusive if any‖. During the visa application process, Diego comes to New Zealand to look at houses, so the entire supply must be standard-rated. Applying the tax fraction to the GST inclusive price of $3,000 the GST on the supply comes to $391.30. With the GST rate at 15% the tax fraction is 3/23. 144. As the difference in the amount of GST is less than $500, the lawyer may be able to include the additional GST in a subsequent return under s 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. NOTE THIS STATEMENT HAS EXPIRED AND IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY 23 Example 6 – Applicant has ―GST inclusive‖ contract and enters New Zealand during the visa application process. GST difference is greater than $500. 145. James lives in South Africa. He enters into a contract with a New Zealand–based immigration lawyer to assist in obtaining an investor visa. The contract provides for a one-off, up-front payment of $7,000. The price is ―GST inclusive if any‖. During the visa application process, James comes to New Zealand to talk to his lawyer about the visa application process and so the entire supply must be standard-rated. 146. There is no specific statutory procedure because the difference in the amount of GST to be paid is greater than $500. Instead, the lawyer would have to notify the Commissioner of the error by submitting sufficient details to enable the Commissioner to amend the assessment for the period in which the original payment was made. Use of money interest would normally apply from the return period in which the original GST liability arose. Example 7 – Applicant has contract which provides for monthly payments. Applicant enters New Zealand during the visa application process 147. Hua lives in China. She wants to immigrate to New Zealand under the investor category. She needs help applying for an investor visa so she enters into a contract with a New Zealand–based immigration advisor. The advisor estimates the visa will take nine months to obtain. The contract provides for monthly payments. Hua remains outside New Zealand during the six months it takes to prepare and file the Expression of Interest. It then takes three months from February to the end of April for the Invitation to Apply to be prepared and processed. Hua comes to New Zealand for a week during March. 148. The immigration advisor will need to determine the correct GST treatment for each of the monthly successive supplies. The advisor will need to determine for each month whether Hua is in, or will be in, New Zealand. In the current case, the immigration advisor will have to account for GST at the standard rate on the successive supply during the month that Hua is in New Zealand. For all the monthly successive supplies that Hua remains outside New Zealand, the supplies will be zero-rated.

This principle requires supplies of goods and services to be taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. Almost all countries with a GST or value added tax (VAT) system apply this principle. 1.2 Accordingly, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) requires services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed to be zero-rated. Zero-rating of services essentially allows suppliers to claim input tax deductions in relation to the services provided and charge GST to the consumer at a rate of zero percent. 1.3 This rule ensures that GST does not form part of the costs to overseas consumers. Further, it ensures that services are not double taxed, once by the jurisdiction in which the services are supplied and taxed a second time by the jurisdiction where the services are consumed. Problems 1.4 Two problems have been identified with the rule that zero-rates services if they are supplied to non-residents who are off-shore.  The zero-rating rule requires the supplier to have knowledge of the whereabouts of the non-resident consumer during the period in which the services are supplied. However, this is not always practically possible, as the non-resident may visit New Zealand in the period on a matter that may or may not be related to the provision of services. In this situation the supplier may be unaware of the non-resident’s presence in New Zealand and mistakenly zero-rate the service.  The application of the residence test can result in a determination that services are zero-rated becoming incorrect. This can occur because the residence rule essentially backdates a person’s residency status. Suggested solutions 1.5 We suggest that services to non-residents remain zero-rated even if a non- resident visits New Zealand during the period of service, as long as that visit is not in direct connection with the services performed. 1.6 We also suggest that the retrospective application of the tax residency rules be switched off in relation to the application of the zero-rating rule. 2 1.7 The paper seeks readers’ views on the suggested solutions, any wider implications of the solutions and how they might work in practice. Draft interpretation statement 1.8 The two problems discussed in this paper were identified from submissions received in response to a draft Inland Revenue interpretation statement, GST on immigration services released in April 2012. 1 1.9 The draft interpretation statement considered whether the supply of immigration services can be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k) of the GST Act when a non-resident visits New Zealand over the period during which the services are performed. 1.10 Immigration services can include many different types of services. The Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007 provides a wide definition of immigration advice as: ... using, or purporting to use, knowledge of or experience in immigration to advise, direct, assist, or represent another person in regard to an immigration matter relating to New Zealand, whether directly or indirectly and whether or not for gain or reward. 2 1.11 The Act specifically excludes the provision of information that is publicly available, and other non-specific immigration advice (for more information see section 7, Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007). The Act requires that individuals who provide immigration advice must be licensed unless explicitly exempt under that Act. 3 1.12 The scope of the draft interpretation statement was limited to visa application services provided to a non-resident individual. The statement concluded that immigration services may be zero-rated, provided the recipient of the supply is a non-resident and remains outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. If the recipient comes to New Zealand over the period during which the services are performed, the entire supply of services must be standard-rated, unless it is possible to apportion the supply. 1.13 The issues raised in response to the draft interpretation statement and the solutions suggested in this paper have wider implications. Therefore, the problems and suggested solutions have been framed in general terms and are not specific to the immigration service industry. The following chapters explain the relevant zero-rating rule, the difficulties raised and the suggested solutions in detail. Next steps 1.14 Submissions will be taken into account when officials report to the 1 The interpretation statement GST on immigration services is available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2013-ip-gst-treatment-immigration-is.pdf.

It requires services to be zero-rated if they are supplied to a non-resident who is off-shore. Four requirements must be satisfied before the service can be zero-rated:  The recipient of the supply must be a non-resident at the time the services are performed.  The recipient must be outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed.  The services cannot be supplied in connection with any New Zealand land or moveable property situated in New Zealand.  The services cannot be an acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity, to the extent that the activity would have occurred within New Zealand. 2.3 The first two requirements are relevant for the analysis of matters discussed in this issues paper. Exception for non-resident companies or un-incorporated bodies 2.4 Section 11A(3) of the GST Act provides an exception to the requirement that the recipient of the supply must be outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. The exception applies only to non-resident companies or unincorporated bodies. It does not apply to natural persons (individuals). 2.5 The exception states that the recipient of the supply will be deemed outside New Zealand if the recipient’s presence is minor or the presence is not effectively connected with the supply. 4 When are services performed? 2.6 The zero-rating rule in section 11A(1)(k) of the GST Act requires that the recipient of the supply must be a non-resident who is outside New Zealand “at the time the services are performed”. In the case of a supply that occurs over a period of time (such as immigration services) the time the services are performed is interpreted as the period during which the supplier provides the 4 Section 11A(3) of the GST Act. 5 services. This can be considered to be the period between the time the services commence and the time the services are completed. 5 2.7 There are two main policy reasons why the rule looks at the period of supply in determining the status of the recipient and therefore whether services are zero-rated or standard-rated. 2.8 First, the requirement is consistent with the destination principle. As stated previously, the principle requires that goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where they are consumed. A practical way of determining whether services are consumed in a particular jurisdiction is to look at the person’s resident status and presence during the period the services are supplied. For example, if the recipient is a resident and present in New Zealand during the period of service, that recipient is considered to have consumed that service in New Zealand and the services will, therefore, be standard-rated. 2.9 Secondly, there would be clear avoidance opportunities if the status of the recipient was determined at one particular point of time – that is, at the time of invoicing or payment for services. For example, in order to avoid tax, the recipient could ensure he or she is out of New Zealand at the one point of time when the person’s status was determined. 2.10 However, assessing the tax status of the transaction over the period that the service is being performed can be difficult in practice and lead to uncertainty over the price paid (or received) for the service. The effect of the rule is that it requires the supplier to have knowledge of the recipient’s physical location and the recipient’s residence status during the period of service. This can be particularly difficult if the service is provided over an extended period of time. These issues are discussed in the following chapters. Apportionment of a supply 2.11 It is also worth noting that, if there is a single supply (no distinction between parts of the supply) there is no ability to apportion the supply between a portion that would be standard-rated, and a portion that would be zero-rated. 6 So if there is a single supply of services to a non-resident who is off-shore, the supply is required to be zero-rated if the recipient enters New Zealand during the period of service. 2.12 The courts have held that there is a general ability to apportion zero-rated parts of a supply under the GST Act where, on the facts, there is a true distinction between parts of a supply. However, this ability to apportion is restricted to circumstances when, as a matter of fact and degree, a sufficient distinction exists between the different parts of the transaction to make it reasonable to separate them. 7 5 Inland Revenue draft interpretation statement GST on immigration services, pg 5. 6 Section 11A(1)(k) of the GST Act contains no apportionment provisions. 7 Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC). 6 2.13 The draft interpretation statement concluded that it is unlikely the visa application services would be able to be apportioned, as generally all of the services are performed as part of one supply (the supply of services to facilitate obtaining a visa). 8 However, following external consultation it was considered that, in particular cases, there might be some scope for apportionment. 2.14 Section 9(3)(a) does, however, allow a supply of services to be treated as successive supplies. The section deems a supply to take place successively where there is an agreement for periodic payments. In this case, it would be necessary to determine the correct GST treatment for each successive supply. 9 Example 1 Jane, a non-resident who is off-shore, receives immigration services from a New Zealand-based immigration consultant. Jane agrees to monthly payments over the four-month period of service. During the second month of service, Jane travels to New Zealand and receives direct advice from the consultant. 2.15 In example 1 the consultant is able to zero-rate the services supplied during the first, third, and fourth months the services were supplied, as Jane was off- shore during these times. However, the consultant is required to standard- rate the supply during the second month of service, as Jane was present in New Zealand during that time. 8 Inland Revenue draft interpretation statement GST on immigration services, pg 10. 9 Inland Revenue draft interpretation statement GST on immigration services, pg 12. 7 CHAPTER 3 Determining location 3.1 As we have stated, in order for services to be zero-rated the supplier must have knowledge of the location of the recipient at the time the services are performed. However, this may not always be possible such as in situations where the non-resident visits New Zealand during the relevant period of services on a matter unrelated to the services being provided. Knowing whether the non-resident consumer is in New Zealand 3.2 This issue concerns the second requirement of section 11A(1)(k) of the GST Act: The recipient must be outside New Zealand at the time services are performed. 3.3 In certain situations the supplier may not be aware that the recipient is in New Zealand during the time the services are performed. This can often occur when services are performed over an extended period of time. Example 2 Jim, a non-resident, applies for a visa to work and live in New Zealand. The visa application process takes six months to complete. During this period Jim visits New Zealand to view some property that he would like to purchase. The immigration consultant is unaware of Jim’s visit to New Zealand, and therefore, zero-rates the immigration fees charged to Jim. 3.4 In example 2 the immigration consultant is inadvertently in breach of the GST Act as the immigration fees are zero-rated despite Jim’s presence in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. This does not appear to be a fair or appropriate outcome as it is not reasonable to expect that the consultant would have knowledge of Jim’s presence in New Zealand. 3.5 Although example 2 specifically relates to the immigration industry it is conceivable that this situation may arise for other suppliers that provide services to non-residents, especially when services are provided over a prolonged period of time. 3.6 It is also worth noting that if the consumer was a non-resident company or unincorporated body, the exemption under section 11A(3) could apply, as the presence in New Zealand is not effectively connected to the suppy. 8 Suggested solution 3.7 Officials suggest that services supplied to non-residents remain zero-rated even if a non-resident visits New Zealand, as long as the non-resident’s presence in New Zealand is not in connection with the services performed. 3.8 This approach is aligned with the exemption for non-resident companies and unincorporated bodies under section 11A(3) of the GST Act. However, the requirement, under section 11A(3), that the non-resident consumer has a minor presence in New Zealand should not in our view apply to individuals. An individual who is in New Zealand for a purpose related to the services being provided can be regarded as consuming the service in New Zealand, compared with a representative of a large non-corporate whose presence may not be reflective of the overall presence of the corporate. 3.9 To the extent an alignment with section 11A(3) is proposed, it may be unclear whether the non-residents presence in New Zealand is in “connection” with the service. Therefore, officials suggest that the non- resident’s presence in New Zealand would only qualify for the exemption if the presence was not in “direct connection” with the service. Scenario One of Jim’s visa requirements is that he has a job offer from an accredited employer. Would a visit to New Zealand for a job interview qualify as a visit that is connection with the immigration services performed? 3.10 Officials consider that in the above scenario, and if Jim was acting independently (on his own accord without the involvement of the immigration consultant), Jim’s visit would not be considered to be in direct connection with the services being performed. However, if the immigration consultant was involved in the interview process, the visit could be in direct connection with the services performed. Ultimately, whether or not the exemption will apply will be based on the facts of the particular case. Australian approach 3.11 Similarly to New Zealand’s current zero-rating rule, the Australian legislation makes no explicit exemption for a minor presence which is not in connection with the services provided. 3.12 The Australian legislation states that supplies are GST-free if the supply: is made to a recipient who: (a) is not an Australian resident; and (b) is not in Australia when the thing supplied is done; 9 other than a supply directly connected with goods situated in Australia when the thing supplied is done, or with real property situated in Australia. 10 3.13 However, in an Australian tax ruling “not in Australia” is interpreted more broadly: ... “not in Australia” should be interpreted in the context of the supply in question. The expression “not in Australia” requires in our view that the non-resident or other recipient is not in Australia in relation to the supply. 11 3.14 This suggested approach in this paper is broadly aligned with the Australian approach. Further considerations 3.15 In addition to the suggested rule, we have considered whether a “reasonably foreseeable” test is required, similar to the test in section 11A(2)(a) of the GST Act. That is, if the tax treatment could be based on whether it was reasonably foreseeable at the time the services were performed that the non- resident was not present in New Zealand, and if present, the presence was not in connection with the services being supplied. 3.16 A “reasonably foreseeable” test could bring greater certainty when determining the tax treatment of supplies. However, officials are aware of the difficulty in applying a subjective test and it is expected that, with the suggestions we are making, in the majority of situations a test of this nature may not be necessary. Submissions on this point would be helpful. Submission points 3.17 Officials would like to get a better understanding of whether this issue is a problem in practice, particularly outside the immigration service industry. If this is a problem in practice, is the suggested solution appropriate to resolve the problem. Would it be workable in practice, or likely to create unnecessary uncertainty in its application? 10 A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999, 38-190. 11 Goods and Services Tax Ruling 2004/7, paragraph 184. 10 CHAPTER 4 Residency and GST 4.1 This chapter deals with the interaction between the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) residency rules and section 11A(1)(k) of the GST Act. An issue specifically arises when the ITA residence rules backdate a person’s residence status to a time before services are performed, which can result in services being incorrectly zero-rated. Application of the income tax residency rules 4.2 This issue concerns the first requirement of section 11A(1)(k) of the GST Act: The recipient of the supply must be a non-resident at the time services are performed. 4.3 For the purposes of section 11A(1)(k), w hether or not a natural person is a resident for New Zealand tax purposes depends on one of two tests being satisfied:  the 183-day test; or  the permanent place of abode test. 12 4.4 The satisfaction of either test results in a non-resident becoming a New Zealand tax resident. However, the 183-day test is the relevant test in regard to this issue, and is located in section YD 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The rule states that a person is a New Zealand tax resident if that person is personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12 - month period. Furthermore, section YD 1(4) states that in these circumstances, a person is treated as being a resident from the first of the 183 days. 4.5 The retrospective application of this rule can mean that although a non- resident may not qualify for New Zealand tax-resident status until after services have been performed, the person’s actual residence status is backdated to the first day of their arrival in New Zealand. This could be before the services were performed. This would mean that a previously correctly zero-rated supply would now have to have been standard-rated as the consumer is considered to be resident for tax purposes for the period during which the services were performed. 12 A “non-resident” is defined in the GST Act as “a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand”. Consequently, the definition relies on the definition of “resident” in the GST Act, which in turn relies on the meaning of “resident” in the Income Tax Act 2007 under sections YD 1 and YD 2. 11 4.6 This situation is illustrated below: Example 3 : 1 January 2013 David lives in Canada and decides to visit New Zealand for three months (91 days). 1 April 2013 David returns to Canada and decides to migrate to New Zealand. He engages an immigration adviser to obtain a visa. David remains outside New Zealand for the entire time that the services are performed. The immigration service fees are zero-rated as they are provided to a non-resident who is located off- shore. 1 August 2013 David is granted a visa. 1 October 2013 David arrives in New Zealand to live on a permanent basis. 1 January 2014 David has been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in aggregate in the last 12 months and is deemed to be a resident for tax purposes from 1 January 2013. This now means that the immigration adviser has incorrectly zero-rated their services to David. 4.7 In example 3 , the GST treatment of the supply will need to be revisited. This does not appear to be an appropriate outcome given the fact that the service provider is unlikely to be aware upfront of whether or not the non-resident will become a resident after the services have been provided. This leads to unnecessary uncertainty for the supplier. Suggested solution 4.8 Officials’ preferred solution to this problem is that the retrospective application of the tax residence rules be switched off in relation to the application of section 11A(1)(k) of the GST Act. This would mean that the recipient’s residence status would still be based on the 183-day rule, but the recipient’s status as a New Zealand tax resident would apply on a prospective basis (from day 183 as opposed to day 1). 4.9 If the suggested solution is applied to example 3 , for the purposes of section 11(A)(1)(k) of the GST Act, David would be deemed to be a resident from 1 January 2014. Consequently, the immigration consultant would no longer be required to revisit the zero-rated immigration fees. Submission points 4.10 Officials would like to get a better understanding of whether this issue is a problem in practice, and if so, whether the suggested solution is appropriate to resolve the issue.

The review follows the recent lease inducement and lease surrender payments reforms introduced in Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 to the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 1 1.2 The review is two-fold. First, the paper considers the current tax treatment of land-related lease transfer payments in light of the recent lease surrender payments reform, and suggests making them taxable to remove current distortions. 1.3 The paper further examines the overall tax treatment of land-related lease payments. The current rules have been implemented separately for particular payments over a long period of time, and because similar payments can be treated differently, results can be inconsistent for taxpayers. 1.4 The paper suggests generic income, deduction and timing rules for all land- related lease payments. This should provide a more consistent and coherent tax treatment of these lease payments that is in line with New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate tax framework. Land-related lease transfer payments 1.5 A land-related lease transfer payment is generally received by an exiting tenant (transferor) from a new incoming tenant (transferee) for the transfer or assignment of a lease. For income tax purposes, the payment is generally tax deductible to the incoming tenant under the depreciation rules and non- taxable to the exiting tenant. 1.6 As part of extending the lease inducement payments reform to include lease surrender payments, a further policy problem involving the current tax treatment of lease transfer payments was identified. The current non-taxable status of lease transfer payments in tandem with the proposed lease surrender payments reform distorts the commercial decisions of the exiting tenant. 1.7 It would be more tax advantageous for the tenant to exit a lease by transferring the lease to a third party for a tax-free payment rather than surrendering it to a landlord for a taxable payment even though there is no economic difference between the two from the tenant’s perspective. Treating similar payments differently for income tax purposes distorts business decisions, resulting in economic inefficiency and unfairness. 1 The Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill was before Parliament at the time this officials’ paper was published. If implemented, these payments would be treated as taxable to the recipient and deductible to the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007 from 1 April 2013. 2 1.8 To remove this distortion, we suggest that lease transfer payments be made taxable. Land-related lease payments 1.9 Following the above suggestion to make lease transfer payments taxable, we consider the overall tax treatment of land-related lease payments should be reviewed for a more consistent and coherent tax treatment of these payments. 1.10 There are a number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 that specifically provide for the tax treatment of certain land-related lease payments for income, deduction and timing purposes. However, these provisions are not comprehensive, and can result in inconsistent and incoherent outcomes for taxpayers. 1.11 These provisions in the Act may produce gaps, which mean that similar payments can be treated differently. Some taxpayers may treat certain payments as a revenue account item and others as a capital account item. Suggested approach 1.12 To treat land-related lease payments consistently and coherently for income tax purposes, we suggest that generic income, deduction and timing rules for these payments be introduced. 1.13 Under these new rules, any land-related lease payment would be treated as deductible to a payer and taxable to a recipient under the Income Tax Act 2007. Note that payments derived by a tenant of residential premises would be excluded from the new rules. 1.14 The rules would apply only to a land right (leases or licences of land) if the land right has a term of less than 50 years. This way, payments made in relation to a land right that lasts 50 years or more, such as a permanent easement, would be treated similarly to payments made in relation to a freehold estate. 1.15 A separate timing rule would also be introduced to spread the income and deductions over the term of the relevant land right. 1.16 The new rules would change the tax treatment of some land-related lease payments from the status quo. Some payments that are currently non-taxable to the recipient would become taxable under new rules. For example, lease transfer payments (which are currently generally non-taxable to tenants) would become taxable, as suggested in this paper. Also, certain payments that are now generally non-deductible to the tenant would become tax deductible – such as lease modification payments. 3 1.17 Moreover, the new rules would rationalise the existing rules in light of the proposed changes to lease inducement and lease surrender payments. Under the current rules, income from lease premium payments may be spread over six years whereas income from lease inducement payments would be spread over the term of the lease. The suggested new rules would spread lease premium income over the term of the lease. 1.18 Rationalising the existing rules would result in a more consistent and coherent tax treatment of land-related lease payments in line with New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate tax framework. It would also improve fairness and business efficiency. 1.19 The technical details of the suggested reforms are discussed more fully in Chapter 4. Submissions 1.20 You are invited to make a submission on the suggested reforms raised in this issues paper, in particular:  Should non-taxable lease transfer payments be made taxable in light of the recent lease surrender payments reform contained in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill?  Are there any aspects of the suggested new income, deduction and timing rules for all land-related lease payments that do not adequately meet the objective of this review – that is, providing a more consistent and coherent tax treatment of land-related lease payments?  Are transitional issues arising from the suggested new rules adequately addressed?  Are there any aspects of the suggested new rules that will create unwarranted compliance costs? 1.21 Submissions will be taken into account when we make recommendations to the Government on any necessary legislative changes. How to make a submission 1.22 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. Submissions should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to contact the submitter to discuss the points raised, if required. 4 1.23 Submissions should be made by 4 June 2013 and be addressed to: Land-related lease payments C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Land-related lease payments” in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. 1.24 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Submitters who consider that their submission or any part of it should properly be withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 5 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 In July 2012, an officials’ issues paper, The taxation of lease inducement payments, was released, seeking feedback on proposals to deal with revenue risks associated with the tax treatment of lease inducement payments. The tax treatment of generally deductible but non-taxable lease inducement payments created an opportunity for taxpayers to substitute tax deductible rent payments with non-taxable cash lease inducement payments. 2.2 During public consultation on the proposals, concerns around another type of land-related lease payment – lease surrender payments – were raised. Lease surrender payments are regarded as “black hole” expenditure (non-deductible business expenditure) to a commercial tenant when they are made to a landlord. 2.3 Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 to the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill released on 11 December 2012 proposed changes to both lease inducement and lease surrender payments. 2 If implemented, these payments will be treated as taxable to the recipient and deductible to the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007, effective from 1 April 2013. Generally, income and expenditure derived or incurred on these payments would be spread over the term of a lease. 2.4 When the lease inducement and lease surrender payments reforms were added to the bill, the Government stated that there would be a further review of the tax treatment of other land-related lease payments, such as lease transfer payments. 2.5 This issues paper considers the overall income tax treatment of land-related lease payments. The objective of this review is to provide a consistent and coherent tax treatment of land-related lease payments that is aligned with New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate tax framework. The paper therefore suggests further reforms to the tax treatment of land-related lease payments to deal with aspects that distort business decisions. This will improve business efficiency and bring greater fairness to the tax rules. 2 This bill is currently before Parliament. 6 CHAPTER 3 Tax treatment of land-related lease payments 3.1 This chapter examines the tax treatment of land-related lease transfer payments and suggests making them taxable to remove existing distortions. It further examines the overall tax treatment of land-related lease payments more generally and suggests rationalising the rules. Land-related lease transfer payments Current rules 3.2 After a lease begins, a tenant may transfer or assign their lease to another person. Generally, lease transfer payments are consideration received by an exiting tenant (transferor) from a new incoming tenant (transferee) for the transfer or assignment of the lease. These payments generally relate to goodwill that is closely related to a particular site or locality (known as “site goodwill”) and may occur when there is a transfer of business, such as the transfer of a hotel business, from one person to another. 3.3 Under the current tax rules, amounts derived by an owner of land 3 from a lease are taxable under section CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, it does not apply to lease transfer payments. In the absence of a specific provision in the Act, lease transfer payments are typically recognised as a non-taxable capital receipt to the exiting tenant unless they are in the business of leasing property or acquired the lease with a view to sell it. Note that lease transfer payments received by the exiting tenant may be taken into account under the depreciation rules in certain circumstances. 4 3.4 Lease transfer payments are generally tax deductible for the incoming tenant under the depreciation rules. A lease is included in the list of depreciable intangible property in schedule 14 of the Act, being “the right to use land”. Consequently, a tenant can usually claim depreciation deductions for its cost to acquire a lease (i.e. a lease premium or transfer payment) over the remaining term of the lease. Inconsistent tax treatment between similar payments 3.5 As part of extending the lease inducement payments reform to include lease surrender payments to achieve a balanced reform in response to concerns raised in submissions, a further policy problem involving the current tax treatment of lease transfer payments was identified. 3 Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 defines “own” for land as having an estate or interest in land, and therefore includes holding a leasehold estate. 4 For example, if the lease transfer payment received by a tenant is more than the adjusted tax value of the cost of acquiring the lease (lease premium payments), the rules recognise that there has been excess depreciation deducted over the term of the lease. As result, the excess depreciation deductions are clawed back as income. 7 3.6 If the lease inducement and lease surrender payments reforms are implemented and the current tax treatment of generally deductible but non- taxable lease transfer payments is retained, it would be tax advantageous for a tenant to exit a lease by transferring the lease to a third party for a tax-free payment rather than surrendering it to a landlord for a taxable payment. The tax advantage of receiving a non-taxable lease transfer payment would distort a tenant’s commercial decisions when exiting a lease. An example of the problem is illustrated below: Example On 1 April 2014, a landlord and a tenant enter into a 10-year lease. After three years, the landlord expands its business to retail, by setting up a subsidiary company. The landlord wishes the tenant to exit the lease so that the subsidiary company can use the premises to carry on its retail business. If the landlord pays a lease surrender payment to the tenant, the payment would be taxable to the tenant and deductible to the landlord under the proposed rules in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (proposed new sections CC 1C and DB 20C). To induce the tenant to exit the lease, the subsidiary company and the tenant enter into an agreement to transfer the lease. The subsidiary company pays the tenant $100,000 for the transfer. Under the current rules, the lease transfer payment of $100,000 is deductible to the subsidiary company over the remaining seven years under the depreciation rules. The lease transfer payment is non-taxable to the exiting tenant. The exiting tenant is $28,000 ($100,000 x 28%) better off than receiving a lease surrender payment from the landlord. 3.7 Although lease transfers and lease surrenders are different in form, from the exiting tenant’s perspective there is no economic difference between surrendering the lease to the landlord and transferring it to a third party. The effect is the same – the tenant exits the lease and receives consideration for it. The exiting tenant is indifferent between receiving a lease surrender or a lease transfer payment. Treating similar payments differently for income tax purposes distorts business decisions and results in economic inefficiency and unfairness. Rationale for change 3.8 The McLeod tax review in 2001 considered the income tax base in New Zealand. Instead of introducing a traditional capital gains tax, it found that the tax base should continue to be protected by dealing with specific capital gains issues as they arise. There are a number of situations when Parliament modified the judicially delineated capital/revenue boundary to address a particular risk to the tax base. Examples include redundancy payments, 5 5 Section CE 1(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 8 payments received for restrictive covenants 6 and exit inducements, 7 capital contribution payments 8 and most recently, proposed changes to lease inducement payments included in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 3.9 Along with the proposed changes to lease surrender payments, the capital- revenue boundary for lease transfer payments should be modified so that similar payments are treated the same for income tax purposes – that is, treated as taxable to the recipient and deductible to the payer. As a result of this proposal, the exiting tenant would be taxed on a lease transfer payment received from the new tenant that is currently not taxed. 3.10 Retaining the current tax treatment of lease transfer payments would continue to distort commercial decisions of tenants when exiting a lease. Reforms are necessary to maintain the robustness and integrity of the tax system. 3.11 The suggested changes to the tax treatment of lease transfer payments are part of a balanced package of reforms including lease surrender payments. Making lease transfer payments taxable would result in a more consistent and coherent tax treatment of different types of payments received by a tenant when they exit the lease regardless of their legal form. Land-related lease payments 3.12 Following the above suggestion to make lease transfer payments taxable, officials consider the tax treatment of land-related lease payments more generally should also be reviewed for a more consistent and coherent tax treatment of these payments. Overview of current law 3.13 Land-related lease payments that are revenue in nature, such as amounts derived in the ordinary course of business (that is, the business of leasing property), are treated as income and are therefore taxable. 9 Unless specifically taxed under the Income Tax Act 2007, 10 payments that are capital in nature, such as receipts derived outside the ordinary course of business, are not treated as income and are therefore not taxed. 3.14 Under the general permission in section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, expenditure incurred in deriving income, or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income, is deductible. However, the general permission is subject to the capital limitation rule in section DA 2, which prohibits deductions for expenditure of a capital nature. Other specific 6 Section CE 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 7 Section CE 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 8 See sections CG 8, DB 64, EE 48 and the definition of “capital contribution” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 See sections CA 1(2) and CB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Also note that there is a land disposal rule in section CB 6 that if a person acquired land (which includes a lease) with a view to selling or disposing of it, the amount is taxable. 10 For example, lease premium payments are traditionally regarded as capital in nature but taxable under section CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 deduction provisions are subject to the capital limitation rule unless they expressly override it. 3.15 There are also a number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 that specifically provide for the tax treatment of certain land-related lease payments for income, deduction and timing purposes. 3.16 The table below summarises how the current provisions in the Act apply to certain payments for income, deduction and timing purposes. Note that this table includes changes proposed for lease inducement and lease surrender payments contained in Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 to the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill. If implemented, these changes will apply from 1 April 2013. Payment-type Income Deductions Payments relating to a lease or licence to use land such as rents, fines, premiums or other revenues Taxable to a landowner under section CC 1. Income derived in anticipation from fines, premiums, a payment of goodwill on the grant of a lease can be allocated over six years under section EI 7 if the Commissioner approves. Generally deductible if the payment is revenue in nature (such as rent) and the general permission in section DA 1 is satisfied. Unless there is an unexpired portion of the expenditure (section EA 3), the payment is deductible in the year the person incurs the expenditure. The cost incurred for acquiring “the right to use land” is generally tax deductible over the term of the lease under the depreciation rules. 11 Payments for non- compliance with covenant to repair Taxable under section CC 2. Income could be spread over five years if the lessor chooses to under section EI 5. Note that section EI 6 provides a special timing rule for income when the lessor ceases to own land. Generally deductible under section DB 21. A specific timing rule in section EJ 11 may apply, which allows the lessee to either claim the deduction in the income year in which the amount is incurred or spread it over three earlier income years provided the lessee used the land for deriving income. Note that there is a special deduction provision in section DB 22 that deals with restoration costs for a lessor who changes the use of the land. 11 A lease is included in the list of depreciable intangible property in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007, being “the right to use land”. 10 Payment-type Income Deductions Contributions for fit- out costs 12 Taxable under section CG 8. Income is spread over 10 years unless the recipient chooses to reduce, for depreciation purposes, the cost of the new capital asset under section DB 64. Generally deductible if the general permission is satisfied – i.e. a commercial landlord who is in the business of leasing property and the payment is not of a capital nature. 13 Lease inducement payments Taxable over the term of the lease. Generally deductible if the general permission is satisfied. The payment is spread over the term of the lease. Lease surrender payments Taxable in the year of receipt. Generally deductible in the year the expenditure is incurred. 3.17 Also, section DB 18 specifically allows deductions for costs incurred for the preparation and registration, or the renewal, of a lease. Inconsistent tax treatment of payments 3.18 Over the years, tax rules for land-related lease payments have been implemented in an ad hoc manner, which has produced inconsistent and incoherent outcomes for taxpayers. 3.19 Current provisions in the Act may therefore produce gaps, which mean that similar payments can be treated differently. For example, payments for the grant of a lease (lease premium payments) are generally deductible to a tenant but payments to modify or waive terms of a lease (lease modification payments) are generally non-deductible to the tenant. Also, payments for the transfer of a lease (lease transfer payments) are generally non-taxable to an exiting tenant but payments to induce the transfer of a lease (lease inducement payments) would be taxable to an incoming tenant, if the lease inducement payments reform is implemented. 3.20 Moreover, the existing timing rules provided for different types of payments vary because they were developed separately over the years. For example, a landowner receiving lease premium payments may spread the income over six years under section EI 7 instead of over the term of the lease which would be a more rational basis for timing the recognition of this income. These payments are deductible to a tenant making these payments over the term of the lease under the depreciation rules. 12 These payments are generally paid by landlords to prospective tenants to enter into a commercial lease with a specific contractual requirement to spend the amount on fit-out. 13 Note that Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 to the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes to codify deductibility of these costs. 11 Suggested approach for all land-related lease payments 3.21 Together with the lease inducement and lease surrender payments reforms and the suggested reform to tax lease transfer payments discussed in this chapter, the existing tax treatment of land-related lease payments could be significantly improved if the rules are rationalised. 3.22 To treat land-related lease payments consistently and coherently, generic income and deduction rules for these payments could be introduced. 3.23 Under the suggested new rules, any land-related lease payments would be treated as taxable to the recipient and deductible to the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007. Note that payments derived by a tenant of residential premises would be excluded from the new rules. 3.24 Also, as part of this rationalisation, a separate timing rule would be introduced to spread income and deductions over the term of the relevant land right (leases or licences of land). 3.25 To provide certainty about when land-related lease payments are on capital or revenue account, we suggest a 50-year threshold for applying the new rules. For example, the new rules would treat all land-related lease payments, other than rent, made in relation to a “land right” (that is, leases or licences of land) with a term of less than 50 years as income to the recipient and deductible expenditure to the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007. 3.26 In effect, leases or licences that last less than 50 years would be put on revenue account. It is envisaged that the 50-year threshold would mean the new rules would apply to most commercial leases, which generally expire before 50 years. Payments, other than rent, made in relation to a land right that lasts 50 years or more would be treated similarly to payments made in relation to a sale of freehold land. 3.27 As a result of introducing the 50-year threshold, the new rules would change the tax treatment of land-related lease payments from the status quo. For example, payments received by a landowner for the grant of a permanent easement are currently taxable under section CC 1 even though the easement may last indefinitely. These payments would be treated as non-taxable receipts to the landowner under the new rules. Also, some payments that are currently non-taxable to the recipient would become taxable under the proposed new rules – for example, lease transfer payments. 3.28 Another example is the cost of “the right to use land” (that is, a lease premium). These payments, which are currently deductible under the depreciation rules would not be deductible under the new rules if the relevant land right lasts 50 years or more – for example, payments to acquire a lease that lasts 99 years would be non-deductible to a tenant under the new rules. 3.29 The 50-year threshold is consistent with the current 50-year threshold on buildings for depreciation purposes. It would align the tax treatment of the cost of a building that lasts 50 years or more with the cost of acquiring the right to use that building – that is, a lease premium. This would therefore 12 eliminate an existing tension between the cost of a building that is generally non-depreciable and the cost of acquiring the right to use land that is currently generally depreciable. 3.30 Conversely, some payments that are currently non-deductible to the payer would become deductible under the new rules. For example, lease modification payments or other lease-related payments that are generally non-deductible to tenants would be deductible if the lease lasts less than 50 years. 3.31 Rationalising the existing rules would result in a consistent and coherent tax treatment of land-related lease payments that is aligned with New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate tax framework. It would also improve fairness and business efficiency. 13 CHAPTER 4 Technical details 4.1 This chapter considers the technical details of how land-related lease payments would be treated for income tax purposes under the suggested approach. 4.2 If these changes proceed, all land-related lease payment provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 would be replaced with new income, deduction and timing provisions. 4.3 Changes to current provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 are summarised in the Appendix. Income 4.4 Current section CC 1 would be replaced by a new comprehensive charging provision for land-related lease payments. New section CC 1 would broadly apply to treat all land-related lease payments derived by a person as assessable income. 4.5 The new charging provision would apply if the following conditions are met:  a person (the payee) derives an amount in relation to a right (the land right) that is an estate in land or a licence to use land; and  the payee is: – the person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted; or – a person who owns the land right; or – a person who is obtaining the land right; or – a person who used to own the land right; and  the amount is in the nature of rent or the land right has a period of less than 50 years. 4.6 These conditions and exceptions are explained in more detail below. Amount derived by a person in relation to a land right 4.7 Proposed new section CC 1 would apply to a land right that is an estate in land or a licence to use land. The term “estate” is widely defined for land purposes in section YA 1 and includes both an estate and interest in land. 14 4.8 The term “amount” is defined in section YA 1 to include any amount in money’s worth. Accordingly, consideration other than in cash would be included. 14 Section YA 1 provides that “interest” has the same meaning as “estate” for land purposes. 14 4.9 The new rules focus on a land right that payments relate to. Hence, identifying which land right the payments relate to would be crucial in determining the tax treatment. The payee 4.10 The payee is a person who derives an amount in relation to a land right. However, if a person receives an amount on behalf of another person, the existing nominee rules in section YB 21 would apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person. 4.11 A person may derive amounts in different capacities depending on the land right that the payments relate to. For example, a tenant could derive a lease inducement payment from a landlord as a prospective tenant. The same tenant could also derive a lease premium payment from a sub-tenant. Payments relating to land right with period of less than 50 years and rent payments 4.12 Rent payments would be included under proposed new section CC 1 regardless of the term of a land right. 4.13 Other payments that relate to a land right with a term of less than 50 years would be included under new section CC 1. Examples of an amount derived in relation to a land right would include various types of payments including a:  fine;  premium or an inducement payment to enter an agreement for the land right;  payment for the goodwill of a business; 15  payment of the benefit of a statutory licence or privilege;  payment of a liability for the breach of a covenant;  payment for the termination of the land right; and  payment for the transfer of the land right. 4.14 As explained in chapter 3, the 50-year threshold would place a new parameter on what is taxable under new section CC 1. Therefore, determining how many years the relevant land right is for is important when applying new section CC 1. 4.15 Note that the 50-year period would not include the period of renewal or extension. The period of renewal or extension of a land right would be regarded as a period relating to a separate land right. This approach is intended to avoid complexities around the tax treatment of leases that are 15 Note that a payment for the goodwill of a business referred to in existing section CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 relates to the goodwill attached to land rather than personal goodwill. See Romanos Motels Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435 (CA). 15 perpetually renewable (that is, “Glasgow” leases) and modifying the spreading of income or deductions, which is discussed below. “Glasgow” leases 4.16 Leases that last for a certain duration (7, 10 or 21 years) but are renewable in perpetuity by the lessees are commonly referred to as “Glasgow” leases. They are typically for a ground lease only. For example, a tenant pays rent regularly for the ground lease and they own improvements such as buildings. 4.17 The proposed new rules would generally apply to Glasgow leases because their initial fixed term typically lasts less than 50 years. Providing a different treatment for Glasgow leases from other leases is undesirable from a policy perspective because it would distort business decisions when entering into lease arrangements. 4.18 If the improvements on land are owned by a tenant, new section CC 1 would apply only to payments made in relation to the ground lease. Payments relating to the cost of acquiring improvements would be apportioned accordingly. Exclusions Tenant of residential premises 4.19 The income-charging provision in new section CC 1 would not apply to a person who is a natural person (an individual) and a tenant or licensee of residential premises. This is intended to provide symmetry of treatment for payments incurred or derived by a tenant of residential premises. The tenant would not be able to deduct lease payments or rent because they do not meet the general permission in section DA 1 and the private limitation in section DA 2(2) would apply. 4.20 If there is a concurrent use of the land right for residential and business purposes, the amount would be apportioned so that only the amount relating to the business use is taxable. Other exclusions 4.21 In addition, new section CC 1 would not apply to amounts if:  The amount is a compensation payment for loss or injury in relation to a land right.  The amount is royalty under section CC 9.  Provisions relating to forestry, petroleum mining and other mining licences apply, in particular, subparts CB, CT and CU. Land provisions 4.22 New section CC 1 would override the existing land provisions in sections CB 6 to CB 23B to provide a consistent tax treatment of land-related lease 16 payments. In particular, this would clarify the tax treatment of lease transfer payments. Tax treatment of contribution for fit-out costs 4.23 Under the proposed reforms in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, the tax treatment of a contribution for fit-out costs continues to be determined under the existing capital contribution rules in sections CG 8 and DB 64. 4.24 However, excluding contributions for fit-out costs from the new rules would produce some inconsistencies between the existing timing rule for capital contributions (where the taxpayer can elect for the contribution to be income and spread over 10 years, or for the contribution to reduce the depreciable cost base of the relevant property) and the new timing rule (where income is spread over the term of the relevant land right). 4.25 A contribution for fit-out costs is a form of lease inducement provided by a landlord to an incoming tenant. It should therefore be treated as being similar to lease inducement payments that are covered in the new rules. Hence, under the new rules, the payee would be required to pay tax on contribution for fit-out costs under new section CC 1, but would not be required to reduce the depreciable cost base for fit-out under section DB 64. The tenant would be able to claim depreciation deductions over the life of the fit-out. Deductions 4.26 Under the suggested new rules, a matching deduction provision would apply to provide symmetry in the tax treatment of land-related lease payments. To deduct these payments, the following conditions would need to be met:  a person (the payer) incurs expenditure in relation to a right (the land right) that is an estate in land or a licence to use land; and  the payer and the person (the payee) who derives the amount are each one of the following: – the person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted; or – the person who owns the land right; or – a person who is obtaining the land right; or – a person who used to own the land right; and  the land right has a period of less than 50 years. 4.27 These conditions are similar to proposed new section CC 1, except the deduction provision specifies both the payer and the payee. This is to sufficiently protect the tax base. 4.28 Note that deductions are allowed only for the cost incurred in relation to the land right and not for the cost of acquiring improvements on land (in particular, when there is a transfer of a Glasgow lease). Similar to the 17 income provision, expenditure relating to the cost of acquiring improvements on land would be apportioned accordingly. 4.29 This deduction provision would not cover rent payments. These would continue to be deductible under the general permission in section DA 1. Neither is this provision intended to cover any transaction costs. Existing section DB 18 applies to any transaction cost incurred to prepare, register or renew a lease. 4.30 The new deduction provision would override the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). The general permission in section DA 1 would still need to be satisfied and the other general limitations in section DA 2 would also apply. Timing of income and deductions 4.31 The proposed new timing rules for income and deductions would be similar to the timing rule currently proposed for lease inducement payments in clause 32B of the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill. There would, however, be some modifications to the rules, as described below. 4.32 The rules would not apply to rent payments. These payments would be subject to the ordinary rules and be taxable when derived and deductible when incurred unless section EA 3 applies. 4.33 The rules would allocate income and deductions evenly over the term of the land right to which the amount of income or deductions relates (the spreading period). The spreading period for allocating income and deductions would be the period of a land right (which lasts less than 50 years). A period of renewal or extension would be treated as a separate spreading period. 4.34 To avoid complexities around allocating income and deductions to the number of days in an income year, it would be allocated proportionately to the number of months by using the following formula: amount of income or deductions x (number of months in an income year for which the spreading period exists / total number of months in the spreading period) 4.35 This approach is consistent with the straight-line method in the depreciation rules. 4.36 The allocation of income and deductions would depend on the time when the income or expenditure is derived or incurred in relation to the spreading period. The rules would spread the amount derived or incurred before the end of the spreading period evenly over the remaining period of the land right. 4.37 For example, lease premiums and lease inducement payments are generally made at the beginning of a lease, therefore the amount would be spread evenly over the lease. Lease surrender payments that are generally made at the end of a lease would typically be allocated to the income year in which 18 the amount is derived or incurred. This is because there would normally be no remaining period of the land right over which the amount can be spread at the time the lease surrender payments are derived or incurred. 4.38 If the amount is derived or incurred before the commencement of the land right, the amount would be allocated over the spreading period, not to the time when the amount is incurred or derived. If the amount is derived or incurred half-way through the spreading period (for example, as a lease modification payment), the amount would be spread evenly over the remaining period. Example 16 On 1 April 2014, a landlord receives a $100,000 lease premium from a tenant for a 10-year lease. The lease commences on the same day. The landlord and the tenant both have a 31 March balance date. The landlord The $100,000 received by the landlord would be taxable under the proposed new charging provision. The amount of income would be spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2014–15 to the 2023–24 income years inclusive (i.e. $10,000 of income would be allocated to each income year). The tenant The $100,000 incurred by the tenant would be deductible under the new deduction provision. The amount of expenditure would be spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2014–15 to the 2023–24 income years inclusive (i.e. $10,000 of expenditure would be allocated to each income year). 4.39 Note that, under the new rules, the timing of deductions and income would be different for the payer and payee of lease transfer payments, for example. Expenditure incurred by the payer (new tenant) for the transfer of a lease would be spread over the remaining term of the transferred lease. Income derived by the payee (exiting tenant) would be taxable when derived because the payee exits the lease and has no remaining period over which to spread the income. 16 The example is based on an assumption that the new rules apply from 1 April 2014. 19 Example 17 On 1 April 2014, a landlord and a tenant enter into a 10-year lease and the lease commences on the same day. On 1 April 2017, the tenant (transferor) transfers the lease to a new tenant (transferee) for $70,000. The taxpayers have a 31 March balance date. The tenant (transferor) The $70,000 received by the transferor would be taxable under the proposed new charging provision. The entire $70,000 would be taxable in the 2017–18 income year because there is no remaining period over which to spread the income. The new tenant (transferee) The $70,000 incurred by the transferee would be deductible under the new deduction provision. The amount of expenditure would be spread evenly over the remaining term of the lease – from the 2017–18 to the 2023–24 income years inclusive (i.e. $10,000 of expenditure would be allocated to each income year). Disposal of the land right part-way through the spreading period 4.40 An exception would apply to the new timing rule if the person ceases to hold the relevant land right, or the estate in land from which the land right is granted. There would generally be a “wash-up” calculation of income and deductions for a person if the person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, part-way through the spreading period. 4.41 This “wash-up” solution would be almost identical to the one proposed for lease inducement payments in clause 32B of the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Timing of income 4.42 For income, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading rule, the amount of income would be allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period, if:  at the beginning of the balance year, the person holds the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and  in the balance year, the person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted. 17 Ibid. 20 Timing of deductions 4.43 For deductions, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading rule, the amount of deductions would be allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period if:  at the beginning of the balance year, either or both the land right and the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person; and  at the end of the balance year, neither the land right nor the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person. 4.44 Note that if the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted is transferred to an associated person, there will be no “wash-up” calculation for deductions. The remaining amount of deductions would continue to be allocated over the spreading period. This is intended as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent the timing of deductions being accelerated by transferring the land right, or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, to an associated person. 4.45 Note that the general anti-avoidance provision in section BG 1 will also apply to counter any tax-driven transactions that attempt to exploit the new timing provision contrary to the policy intent. 4.46 As proposed in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, the definition of “associated person” applicable to land provisions would apply for the purpose of this timing rule. Relationship with financial arrangement rules 4.47 Leases are currently excluded from the financial arrangement rules because they are excepted financial arrangements. 18 Therefore, the new timing rules suggested in this paper would apply to leases of land. 4.48 However, licences to occupy land are currently regarded as financial arrangements because they are not a lease for the purposes of financial arrangement rules in the definition of “lease” in section YA 1. The existing distinction between leases and licences to occupy (that are commonly used in the context of retirement villages) is considered undesirable from a policy perspective. 4.49 For consistency, we suggest treating licences to occupy land, which are an “occupation right agreement” as defined in section 5 of the Retirement Villages Act 2003, as excepted financial arrangements. This would align the treatment of leases and these licences to occupy land for the purpose of financial arrangement rules. 18 See section EW 5(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Finance leases are excepted from this exclusion; the definition of “finance lease” in section YA 1 applies only to personal property. Hence, a lease of land is an excepted financial arrangement. 21 4.50 In addition to the above suggestion, we would like to receive submissions on whether a wider set of licences (for example, licences to use land) should be treated as excepted financial arrangements. Treatment of certain transactions Consecutive leases 4.51 Under the proposed changes, if two or more land rights are granted to the same person or an associated person and are linked to take effect immediately after one terminates, these land rights would be treated as one land right. An exception to this would be the extension or renewal of an existing land right. 4.52 This suggested treatment of consecutive leases is intended to prevent the timing of deductions being accelerated by entering into multiple leases. A similar treatment is currently applied for the purposes of personal property lease payments. 19 19 See paragraph (d)(v) of the definition of “lease” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 22 CHAPTER 5 Application date and potential transitional issue 5.1 This chapter discusses the application date and a potential transitional issue arising from the implementation of the proposed new land-related lease payments rules. Application date 5.2 These suggested changes, if they proceed, would apply to payments derived or incurred on or after the 1 April date following the enactment of the amending legislation. Disposal of the right to use land acquired before the application date 5.3 Consequential to rationalising the existing rules, the “right to use land” category of depreciable intangible property in clause 5, schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would be repealed. 5.4 If implemented, the new deduction provision would apply to any expenditure incurred for the right to use land (referred to as “the land right” under the proposed new deduction provision) after the application date. Any expenditure incurred for the right to use land before the application date would continue to be deductible under the depreciation rules. 5.5 To accommodate transfers of leases and licences to use land after the application date, a transitional rule would be introduced for a person who acquired the right to use land before the application date. 5.6 Under the proposed rules, if the person disposes of (transfers) their right to use land to another person after the application date and receives consideration for the disposal, the amount of consideration would be treated as income of the person (proposed new section CC 1). The entire amount of consideration would be allocated to the year of receipt because the amount is derived at the end of the spreading period (proposed new timing provision). 5.7 To prevent depreciation recovery income also arising for the person from the disposal of the right to use land, section EE 45 would be amended. The amount of consideration derived for the disposal of their right to use land would not be included for depreciation recovery income purposes under section EE 48. In the year of disposal, the person would be able to deduct a depreciation loss for the adjusted tax value of the right to use land under section EE 48(2). 23 Example – tax implications for disposing of the right to use land acquired before the application date 20 On 1 April 2011, a tenant pays a landlord a $100,000 lease premium to enter into a 10-year lease. After three years, the commercial property market tightens and there is a shortage of commercial premises. On 1 April 2014, the tenant disposes of (transfers) the lease to a third party and receives $150,000 consideration for the disposal. Taxpayers have a 31 March balance date. From 1 April 2011, the tenant is able to deduct $100,000 of lease premium on a straight-line basis over the next 10 years under the depreciation rules. In the 2014–15 income year, the tenant would be required to make the following calculations under the depreciation rules (section EE 48): Amount of lease premium $100,000 Less deductions $30,000 Adjusted tax value (ATV) $70,000 Consideration for the lease $0\* \*Note that consideration would be treated as $0 for the calculation under section EE 48. Section EE 45 would not treat the $150,000 lease transfer payment as consideration. In the 2014–15 income year, the tenant would have a depreciation loss of $70,000 ($70,000 ATV minus $0) for disposing of the right to use land. The tenant would be taxed on $150,000 consideration received from the new tenant for the transfer of the lease (new section CC 1 and the new timing provision). The tenant would therefore have net income from the lease for the year of $80,000. From the 2014–15 income year, the new tenant would be able to deduct $150,000 over the remaining term of the lease under the new deduction and timing provisions. The income tax implications for the tenant and the new tenant is illustrated in the table below: Income year Tenant (transferor) New tenant (transferee) Deduction Income Deduction Income 2011–12 $10,000 – – – 2012–13 $10,000 – – – 2013–14 $10,000 – – – 2014–15 $70,000 $150,000 $21,429 – 2015–16 – – $21,429 – 2016–17 – – $21,429 – 2017–18 – – $21,429 – 2018–19 – – $21,429 – 2019–20 – – $21,429 – 2020–21 – – $21,429 – 20 The example is based on an assumption that the proposed new rules apply from 1 April 2014. 24 APPENDIX The table below summarises changes to current provisions that would occur under the proposed new provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. Section(s) Comment Section CC 1 This section would be replaced by a more comprehensive new section CC 1, as explained in chapter 4. Sections CC 2, DB 21, EI 5, EI 6, EI 7, EJ 11 and clause 5 “the right to use land” in schedule 14 These sections would be replaced with the new income, deduction and timing provisions. Section DB 22 This section relates to a restoration cost relief to landlords who change use of the land. This section would be retained as it is considered still relevant. Reference to sections CC 2, EI 5 and EI 6 in that section would be changed to new section CC 1. Proposed sections CC 1B, CC 1C, DB 20B, DB 20C and EI 4B contained in Supplementary Order Paper No. 167 to the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill If implemented, these sections would be replaced with the new income, deduction and timing provisions. Proposed sections EA(2)(db) and paragraph (bb) of “land provision” in section YA 1 would also be amended accordingly. Section EE 45 This section would be amended for transitional purposes. “Capital contribution” in section YA 1 The existing capital contribution rules would be overridden by the new income provisions.

R&D-intensive start-up companies are particularly affected as:  They expect to be in an ongoing tax-loss position over consecutive periods through the research and development phases.  They do not have other sources of income to apply the tax loss against.  The high-risk nature of R&D investment increases the risk of failure.  In some cases, they do not realise any gain on the investment until they sell the R&D output. 1.3 Consequently, R&D-intensive start-up companies are unable to use their tax losses in a timely fashion, or in some cases, at all, increasing the cashflow problem. 1.4 Requiring taxpayers to carry losses forward is an essential integrity measure in the tax system to protect Government revenues from a number of risks. However, R&D-intensive start-up companies face a unique set of potential market failures and tax distortions that could be reduced by changing the treatment of some of their tax losses. As a possible solution, we suggest allowing R&D-intensive start-up companies to cash out their tax losses arising from qualifying R&D expenditure, instead of carrying these losses forward. 1.5 Allowing these companies to access their R&D tax losses early would help to reduce capital and cashflow constraints, and alleviate biases against R&D arising from current tax settings. Summary of suggested changes 1.6 The suggested changes target R&D-intensive start-up companies. To be eligible, applicants would need to meet the following criteria:  Company (and also group, if the company is part of a group) R&D expenditure on wages and salaries must be at least 20 percent of total expenditure on wages and salaries (the wage intensity threshold).  The company (and also group, if the company is part of a group) must be in a tax-loss position for the applicable income year. 2  The applicant must be a company resident in New Zealand.1 The company also cannot be a look-through company, listed company, qualifying company or special corporate entity. 1.7 The suggested R&D definition is based on the existing New Zealand equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 (NZIAS 38), which is already used in the Income Tax Act 2007. It will be necessary, however, to exclude certain expenditure items and activities from the proposed R&D wage intensity threshold of 20 percent of the total group wage and salary expenditure and/or qualifying R&D expenditure, to ensure correct targeting and neutrality. 1.8 The amount of the loss that can be cashed out under the proposals will be the lesser of:  1.5 times the company’s eligible R&D salary and wage expenditure in the relevant year;  total qualifying R&D expenditure in the relevant year; and  total tax losses in the relevant year. 1.9 Initially, the suggested maximum cap on eligible losses that can be cashed out will be $500,000, which equates to a cashed-out loss of $140,000 at the company tax rate (28%). This cap would rise incrementally each year up to a maximum cap on eligible losses of $2 million. Increasing the cap gradually allows for greater control over any fiscal risk. 1.10 Loss recovery rules would be included to protect the neutrality and integrity of the suggested policy, while also minimising its fiscal risk. These rules would recover the value of the cashed-out loss when a taxpayer derives a return from the sale of:  intellectual property from R&D the company has performed;  some of the shares in the R&D company; or  the R&D company itself (all of its shares).

Innovation creates new sources of economic growth by delivering new products and generating improvements in the quality and cost of existing products. Encouraging business innovation is one of the seven key initiatives of the Government’s Building Innovation workstream, which recognises that R&D is a key element in the innovation process. 2.2 High up-front costs associated with undertaking R&D mean that relative to other investment projects, the profit cycle for innovative projects tends to be much more heavily skewed towards early losses. This can pose a particularly significant barrier to undertaking R&D for innovative start-up companies. Current tax settings for R&D 2.3 The tax system in New Zealand is based on the principle of broad-base, low- rate taxation, as set out in the Government’s Revenue Strategy. 2 This means that alternative forms of income and expenditure are taxed as evenly as possible, to ensure that overall tax rates can be kept low, while also minimising the influence that taxation has over economic decisions. This policy means that the current tax treatment of R&D expenditure in New Zealand is largely consistent with the tax treatment of other forms of business expenditure. Tax deductibility of R&D expenditure 2.4 Expenditure on R&D that is regarded as an expense for accounting purposes is generally deductible for tax purposes. Section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows a person a deduction for expenditure they have incurred on research or development if that expenditure is expensed under paragraph 68(a) of NZIAS 38 Intangible Assets. 2.5 Under section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and NZIAS 38, expenditure on an intangible item is immediately deductible for tax purposes until the NZIAS 38 asset recognition criteria are met. The intangible asset recognition criteria require an entity to demonstrate all of the following:  the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;  its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;  its ability to use or sell the intangible asset;  how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence 2 Available at http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2012/fsr/14.htm 5 of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;  the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and  its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 2.6 Once all of these asset-recognition criteria are satisfied under NZIAS 38, any further development expenditure is capitalised rather than immediately deducted. In certain circumstances, this expenditure can be deducted as depreciation over the life of the asset for tax purposes. Timing of deductions 2.7 The Income Tax Act 2007 also grants special treatment for the timing of deductions for R&D expenditure. Sections EJ 22 and EJ 23 can permit taxpayers to allocate all or part of this deduction granted under section DB 34 to later income years, provided that the relevant taxable income would not have been derived but for the R&D expenditure. There is no limit to the amount of losses that taxpayers can allocate to future income years under this provision. 2.8 This provision was introduced to recognise that many R&D firms introduce additional equity during the R&D process. Without the provision described above, a breach of shareholder continuity would result in the accumulated losses carried forward being extinguished. Instead, taxpayers can allocate the expenditure (that gives rise to the losses) to an income year after the shareholder continuity breach (if any) takes place. Sale of successful output from R&D 2.9 The current tax settings tend not to tax the profits from the sale of successful R&D. This is because the sale of companies (which own the successful R&D) is considered to be a sale of capital and therefore outside the scope of the tax base. The exception to this is income from royalty payments or the sale of patents, which is taxable. Current treatment of tax losses 2.10 The current approach to the treatment of tax losses is to allow loss offsets between companies with a 66 percent common shareholding. Without this rule, losses would be effectively quarantined in the individual company concerned, and income would have to be earned in that company before the tax benefit of the losses could be realised. In reality, this could involve a significant time period. 2.11 Alongside the loss offset rules for “traditional” companies, changes have been made more recently to allow flow-through treatment for limited partnerships and eligible companies that elect to do so. Under these rules losses pass through to their partners and shareholders, thus allowing the tax 6 benefit of the losses to be realised to the extent the partners or shareholders have other taxable income. 2.12 It can be argued that as losses are the inverse of profits, they should be treated symmetrically. In other words, just as profits are liable for a tax payment, losses would be eligible for a negative tax payment (that is, a receipt from the Government). In practice, this is generally achieved through the mechanisms of intra-group loss offsets or loss pass-through provisions. 2.13 Allowing what amounts to a refund inherently involves an element of risk to the tax base as it incentivises the creation of artificial losses as a mechanism for sheltering otherwise taxable income of group companies or partners/shareholders. Under current tax settings, however, this risk will always be capped at the level of the otherwise taxable income. Without this limit there would be greater pressure on other buttressing rules such as shareholder continuity or general anti-avoidance rules. 2.14 The only set of losses that are not used immediately are those where the loss- making company does not have a profit-making company in its group or the partners/shareholders do not have sufficient taxable income to absorb the loss. 2.15 This paper explores whether, in certain circumstances, the Government should allow R&D start-up companies earlier access to tax losses arising from R&D expenditure when no offsets are possible. This would reduce the distortions created when there is an asymmetric tax treatment of tax losses (given wider exacerbating factors affecting these companies noted in Chapter 3). As the current stock of losses for all firms was approximately $45 billion in May 2013, any change from the status quo must be approached with a high degree of caution. 7 CHAPTER 3 Problem definition 3.1 Current tax provisions delay the ability of loss-making businesses to use their deductions as they are required to carry the losses forward. This provides an important integrity measure in the tax system to mitigate the creation of artificial losses. However, these current tax settings create a cashflow problem for certain companies in an ongoing tax loss position. 3.2 This cashflow bias is particularly significant for companies undertaking R&D. This is because:  The natural profit cycle for innovative projects tends to have a longer period of tax loss before making a profit.  Many R&D-intensive companies are carrying on high-risk investment which may never be profitable.  The ultimate cash return may not arise until the resulting capital asset is sold. 3.3 This can increase the cost of investing in R&D rather than in other assets. 3.4 Problems can be compounded for start-up companies undertaking R&D who are already likely to suffer from broader capital constraints as a result of, for example:  Lack of collateral – R&D-intensive start-up companies typically have fewer fixed tangible assets and the intangible R&D assets being created can be difficult to value upfront. This means there is often little in the way of collateral that can be used for debt financing.  Information asymmetry – This arises when lenders have less knowledge than the R&D start-up company about the value of the R&D assets being created and the level of risk associated with their creation. This is especially prevalent for R&D-intensive start-up companies given the novel and/or experimental nature of R&D, and they have no proven track record in successfully developing R&D assets. Consequently, this can lead to less lending to or investment in R&D-intensive start-up companies. 3.5 Empirical evidence shows that small R&D firms have a significantly lower probability of being successful with long-term loan applications than other businesses, 3 and that the probability of success decreases as R&D intensity increases. 4 Venture capital can address some of these problems, but evidence from different countries indicates that small and medium businesses tend to rely on internal equity financing, and prefer to seek bank loans if external financing is required. However, recent evidence indicates that banks in New 3 Freel, M. S. (1999), The Financing of Small Firm Product Innovation Within the UK, Technovation 19, 707–719. 4 Freel, M. S. (2007), Are Small Innovators Credit Rationed?, Small Business Economics 28, 23–35. 8 Zealand are not necessarily well engaged with the financing needs of small start-up businesses and have relatively high levels of risk aversion compared with UK and US banking models in supporting early stage companies or projects. 5 3.6 These factors, and the cashflow problems noted above, may lead to fewer R&D-intensive start-up companies being established and less R&D being undertaken by existing R&D-intensive start-up companies. 3.7 Current tax provisions can also penalise businesses that engage in R&D that ultimately turns out to be unsuccessful. This is because current tax provisions state that losses, in this case from unsuccessful R&D, can only be used going forward if the original owners subsequently engage in a profitable business. The current rules therefore make the use of previous tax losses contingent upon successful innovation or future income earning by the same group of investors. The risk of incurring this potential additional sunk cost is likely to discourage investment in marginal R&D projects further. Summary 3.8 Current tax loss rules increase the cashflow constraint experienced by companies in a tax loss position. However, for R&D-intensive start-up companies, this bias is compounded as a result of longer periods of tax loss for innovative projects, broader capital constraints and difficulties in securing lending or investment. On the other hand, when successful innovation is sold there is generally no taxation impact. 3.9 Other businesses do not normally expect to make significant ongoing losses, nor do they face the same difficulties when seeking lending. Therefore there are strong grounds for continuing the existing treatment for other firms in tax losses, both as a buttress and also because the existing rules do provide a mechanism for losses when there is also taxable income. Submission points  Is this the right characterisation of the problem?  Is this a significant problem in practice (given the existence of look-through companies and limited partnerships)? 5 Boven, R., Harland, C., and Grace, L. Plugging the Gap: An Internationalisation Strategy. (Auckland: The New Zealand Institute, 2010). 9 CHAPTER 4 Suggested policy changes 4.1 The policy solution set out in this paper is to allow loss-making R&D- intensive start-up companies to cash out (that is, obtain early access to) some or all of their tax losses arising from R&D expenditure in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. This should reduce the market failures and tax distortions that can be a deterrent to investment in R&D, and create a more economically neutral outcome for such companies. 4.2 Under this proposal, eligible businesses would be able to cash out the taxable value of their R&D losses in the year they were incurred. In practice, this means that eligible R&D companies would be able to claim up to 28 percent (the current company tax rate) of their tax losses from the Government in any given year. 4.3 Officials suggest that eligibility be targeted to R&D-intensive start-up companies by restricting the refund to:  loss-making companies whose R&D intensity (based on a ratio of R&D expenditure on wages and salaries to total wage and salaries expenditure) exceeds a specified threshold; and  an overall cap on the amount that can be cashed out in any given year. 4.4 We suggest that the threshold for R&D intensity is set at 20 percent, to ensure that the refund is appropriately targeted to highly innovative businesses. Eligible R&D companies would be able to cash out up to 1.5 times their R&D expenditure on salary and wages, provided that this amount does not exceed their total tax losses or total qualifying R&D expenditure in the relevant tax year. In practice, this means eligible businesses would be able to cash out the lesser of:  1.5 times the company’s R&D expenditure on salary and wages;  total tax losses; or  total qualifying R&D expenditure. 4.5 In addition, there would be an overall cap on the amount of losses that would qualify to be cashed out. This would help ensure that the full benefits of the proposal are targeted principally to smaller companies, given the higher relative cashflow benefit the cash-out would have for these companies. It is suggested this overall cap would initially be set at $500,000, eventually rising to $2 million. 4.6 Any losses cashed out under the proposal would no longer be carried forward to be offset against future income. However, taxpayers would still be eligible to carry forward any losses in excess of the amount cashed out. This means that remaining losses would be accorded the same treatment as losses under the current rules. 10 4.7 Several aspects of the eligibility criteria are included within the scope of this consultation, including features of the eligibility criteria, the cap on eligible losses, and the appropriate definition of R&D. We will discuss and be seeking your views on these features in Chapter 5. 4.8 To further reduce risks to the tax base, it is also suggested that the value of any remaining cashed-out losses be recovered upon the sale of any developed intellectual property, shares in the company, or sale of the company itself. These integrity measures are set out in more detail in Chapter 7. Expected benefits 4.9 This proposal is expected to:  provide some relief for the financing and cashflow constraints faced by R&D-intensive start-up companies during the initial loss-making phase of the innovation cycle;  remove a tax distortion against undertaking innovation, making the tax system more neutral for businesses targeted by the policy change; and  remove the risk that any accumulated tax losses of an R&D-intensive start-up will be lost in the event of failure. 4.10 These expected benefits are aligned with the underlying policy rationale set out in Chapter 3. 4.11 It is difficult to quantify the benefits from this proposal in terms of its marginal impact on R&D expenditure or the probability of successful innovation. As noted in Chapter 3, however, there is a relatively strong consensus in the academic and tax policy literature that young R&D- intensive businesses are likely to face difficulties in accessing sufficient capital, so are likely to benefit from this proposed policy change. 4.12 The proposal provides a cashflow benefit to eligible companies as it rebalances tax liabilities from periods of loss to periods of profit. It should be noted that it does not alter a company’s overall expected tax liability as any tax deductions that are taken now can no longer be taken in the future. 6 4.13 Evidence indicates that the proposal should be well targeted to start-ups as those companies that would be eligible for the proposed policy are, on average, younger than other R&D-intensive companies. 7 4.14 In addition, by restricting eligibility of the cash out to those companies above a specified level of R&D intensity means that any tax benefit will be better targeted towards those businesses incurring tax losses due to intensive R&D activity, rather than for other reasons. 6 This assertion is conditional on the R&D company being successful. If the company fails to earn income, the cashed out loss will effectively become a grant as the loss-making company is able to use some of their tax losses. 7 Research and Development Survey 2010, details available at http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/businesses/research\_and\_development/ResearchandDevelopmentSurve y\_HOTP2010/Technical%20Notes.aspx 11 4.15 It is proposed that a cap on the amount of loss able to be cashed out will increase over time. This should help limit the risk that the new policy causes an increase in demand for scientists and engineers, and consequently in their wages, due to the finite supply of these workers in the short term. If that situation arose, part of the potential benefits of the R&D cash-out would be reduced as the cost of carrying out R&D would increase, rather than increasing the amount of R&D performed. A gradual phase-in will therefore help to maximise the potential benefits of the policy change in terms of increased R&D activity. 12 CHAPTER 5 Policy design 5.1 It is suggested that three criteria will determine the eligibility of applicants for a cashed-out loss. Applicants will need to meet the following criteria:  Company (and also group, if the company is part of a group) R&D expenditure on wages and salaries must be at least 20 percent of total group expenditure on wages and salaries.  The company (and also group, if the company is part of a group) must be in a tax-loss position for the applicable income year.  The applicant must be a company resident 8 in New Zealand. The company also cannot be a look-through company, listed company, qualifying company or special corporate entity. R&D wage intensity 5.2 It is proposed that a ratio of expenditure on wages and salaries for R&D to total expenditure on wages and salaries (R&D wage intensity) will be used as one of the eligibility criteria for the cash-out. Under this proposal, companies (and also groups, if the company is part of a group) that spend at least 20 percent of their total wage and salaries expenditure on R&D (as defined in the section below) would be eligible for the cash out, provided they also meet the company and tax loss criteria discussed below. 5.3 Evidence from the Research and Development Business Survey 9 indicates that loss-making R&D-intensive businesses tend to spend a greater proportion of their wage and salary costs on R&D than other businesses, particularly smaller and young businesses. 5.4 One explanation for this is that during the initial loss-making phase of the innovation life cycle, businesses invest a greater proportion of their labour costs in R&D for the initial creation of intellectual property. However, the composition of wage and salary expenditure changes as activities shift towards production and sales, leading to a gradual fall in the proportion of R&D staff (compared with non R&D staff) employed as the business matures. This is supported by evidence from the Research and Development Business Survey, which shows that both older and larger firms have significantly lower ratios of R&D expenditure to total expenditure on salaries and wages. 5.5 Setting a R&D wage intensity threshold (of at least 20 percent) will help to ensure the policy is highly targeted towards assisting R&D-intensive start-up companies. 8 Residents for this policy will not include resident companies that are treated as non-resident under a double tax agreement. 9 Research and Development Survey 2010. 13 5.6 Any expenditure on wages and salaries related to “excluded activities” (listed later in this section) will also not be eligible to be included in the calculation of R&D expenditure on wages and salaries. Contracted R&D 5.7 Under the suggested changes, a business which contracts another entity to undertake R&D services on its behalf will be able to count the outsourced R&D expenditure on wages and salaries towards its calculation of R&D wage intensity, subject to the same excluded activities listed later in the section. In practice, the contracted supplier of R&D will need to provide an invoice to the purchaser which details both the overall R&D wage and salary costs subject to PAYE for the contracted work, and the cost of any other qualifying R&D. Shareholder salaries 5.8 Using expenditure on salaries and wages will enhance the integrity of the policy. While Inland Revenue can monitor a taxpayer’s total expenditure on salaries and wages through the PAYE system, there is no equivalent source of information for other types of expenditure. Consequently, it is proposed that shareholder salaries be excluded from the R&D wage intensity threshold calculation if they are not subject to PAYE. Basing the eligibility criteria on salary and wage expenditure should help to reduce potential abuse of the policy. It is expected that this approach will also ease the compliance and administrative costs of the proposal, given it is based on existing information. 5.9 However, it is recognised that companies incur other expenditure in undertaking R&D beyond that on salary and wages. A proposal to allow some or all of this additional R&D expenditure (based on a multiplier of a firm’s R&D wage and salary expenditure) is discussed later in this chapter. Tax-loss position 5.10 To be eligible to have a tax loss cashed out, a taxpayer must be in a net tax loss position. Eligibility for the cashed-out loss will be restricted to losses incurred in the current income year. For example, taxpayers completing a return for the 2015−16 income year will only be able to access a cashed-out loss for a tax loss incurred in the 2015−16 income year. There will be no ability to cash out tax losses from previous income years. Allowing this would create a significant risk to the tax base as losses could be “mined” from companies with existing losses but no sources of current income. Company and grouping restriction Company eligibility 5.11 Only certain companies will be able to access the cashed-out loss; look- through companies, listed companies, qualifying companies and special corporate entities will be excluded. No other business structures − for example, partnerships or trusts, will be eligible for a cashed-out loss. A corporate partner in a partnership carrying out R&D can be eligible for a 14 cashed out loss, and will be able to include the R&D activities of the partnership as they flow through to the corporate partner. Furthermore, to be eligible a company must be resident in New Zealand and not treated as non- resident under a double tax agreement. These features will enhance the targeting of the proposed policy and reduce its complexity. 5.12 Current tax loss rules can create a cashflow bias for companies in a tax loss position. However, some entity structures already have their own flow- through treatment of tax losses, including look-through companies and limited partnerships. These business structures may therefore not be similarly subject to the issues faced by a company without a flow-through tax-loss treatment as they could have other income to offset their losses against. 5.13 Another issue faced by small R&D start-ups are the particular capital constraints noted in Chapter 3. These are less of an issue for listed companies, as their listing on a stock exchange should give them greater access to capital. 5.14 Restricting cashed-out losses to companies also ensures that tax losses will only be cashed out at the company tax rate, which is currently 28%. This reduces a potentially complex aspect of the proposal, namely that different types of taxpayers are often taxed at different rates. Partnerships would be particularly difficult because their flow-through tax treatment, combined with individual differences in the allocation of tax losses between each partnership’s respective partners, would make attempting to cash out losses at the marginal rate of each partner complex and impractical. 5.15 It is also standard practice in similar tax jurisdictions to restrict R&D incentives to companies only. Both the new above-the-line R&D tax credit in the United Kingdom and the R&D tax incentive in Australia restrict eligibility to companies only. Grouping rules 5.16 We consider that, in determining whether a company meets the criteria for this proposed policy (for example, being in a loss position and having a high R&D wage intensity) the company should be considered together with other companies (and entities) that share similar ownership. Without such a rule, the targeting of this proposal to small, R&D intensive start-up companies could fail. 5.17 In particular, we are concerned with two specific situations:  when an ineligible entity incorporates a subsidiary that might be eligible; and  when a group of shareholders of an ineligible company incorporates a sister company that might be eligible. 5.18 An example of this first situation would be a large firm with a low R&D intensity. It could incorporate a new company and direct that company to carry out its R&D functions. Without a rule to prevent it, that new company 15 would be eligible to have its tax losses refunded, even though the two companies considered as a whole would not be. 5.19 An example of the second situation would be a group of shareholders who own a company that has largely finished some R&D and is now starting to promote a product for sale. These promotion activities will mean the company is likely to fall below the required R&D wage intensity of 20 percent as they take on non-R&D staff. However, if the shareholders incorporate a new sister company to solely carry out promotion, the original company will continue to have a high R&D wage intensity. It would therefore be eligible for the tax loss refund on its R&D spending. Again, this is inappropriate: the two companies considered as a whole would not be eligible. 5.20 The intention is that these grouping rules, as far as practicable, should not impact on genuine small R&D companies. These companies are likely to have a simple corporate structure so we believe this should be achieved. Nevertheless, we would be interested to hear from submitters about:  whether, in practice, a small R&D firm is generally a standalone entity or forms part of a larger corporate group; and  the typical shareholding arrangements of a start-up R&D firm: how many shareholders are there, what percentage of the company do they own, and how does this change over the company’s life? Summary flowchart 5.21 The diagram below summarises the various criteria determining whether an applicant would be eligible for the cash-out proposal. Applicant has spent at least 20% of wages & salaries on qualifying R&D activities? Applicant is in tax loss position for the relevant tax year? Applicant meets the company criteria? (see restrictions) ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR R&D CASHED- OUT LOSS NOT ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR R&D CASHED-OUT LOSS Yes Ye s Yes NoNoNo 16 Company size 5.22 Restricting eligibility to companies below a certain size has been considered, but is not being proposed in this paper. For example, one method of doing this would be to limit eligibility to companies whose turnover is below a certain amount. This approach is not favoured as current eligibility rules should be sufficient to target the policy to small R&D-intensive start-up companies, and this would be another measure of eligibility that Inland Revenue would have to monitor. Definition of R&D Proposed definition 5.23 It is proposed that existing definitions of research and development are used as they are described in the New Zealand equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 (NZIAS 38), and consequently the Income Tax Act 2007. These are:  Research is original and planned investigation is undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.  Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use. 5.24 Experiences from the previous R&D tax credit in New Zealand showed that a new definition created significant compliance and administration costs. While it is important that a narrow definition of R&D is used to ensure that the policy is targeted, in practice this is very difficult. Using the existing definition is simpler for taxpayers already familiar with it for accounting purposes. However, to ensure the policy stays targeted, the level of qualifying R&D expenditure will be limited, based on expenditure on salaries and wages and a multiplier, as outlined in the next section. Submission points Do the eligibility criteria effectively target R&D-intensive start-up companies? Are there any additional eligibility criteria that should be included? Are there likely to be difficulties arising in using these criteria? Are there possible unintended consequences? Is the 20 percent R&D wage intensity threshold appropriate? Do you anticipate any problems with the proposed arrangements for dealing with contracted R&D; either for purchasers or suppliers of R&D? Does the section on grouping rules accurately describe the risks in relation to grouping? Have any situations been omitted? 17 Excluded activities 5.25 Certain activities (noted below) did not qualify directly as part of the R&D definition for the tax credit. Expenditure on these activities was excluded because they took place in a post-development phase, related to routine work, and/or there was an indeterminate relationship between the activity and economic growth. 5.26 Expenditure on such activities will also not be included for the purposes of calculating the qualifying R&D expenditure for a cashed-out loss or for calculating expenditure on wages and salaries on R&D activities for the proposal presented in this paper. The reasons for the exclusion are generally consistent with its wider policy intent, as many of the activities noted below take place later in the R&D process when the R&D company is less likely to be capital and cashflow-constrained. 5.27 The excluded activities for the now repealed R&D tax credit were:  prospecting for, exploring for or drilling for minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal energy;  research in social sciences, arts or humanities;  market research, market testing, market development, or sales promotion including consumer surveys;  quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services;  making cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services;  routine collection of information;  commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities;  activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards;  management studies or efficiency surveys;  the reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information; and  pre-production activities such as a demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs. 5.28 In addition, it is proposed the following activities are also excluded in the suggested changes:  clinical trials; and  the late stages of software development (for example coding). 18 Excluded expenditure 5.29 Some expenses that a taxpayer incurs should also not be included for the purposes of:  determining R&D wage intensity (which is used to determine whether a firm is eligible for the cash-out); and  determining total qualifying R&D expenditure (which is used in calculating the amount of tax losses a firm can cash-out). 5.30 Expenses are excluded on the basis that their inclusion could create an economic distortion, inequity between taxpayers in a similar position, or alternatively endanger the integrity of the proposed policy. Expenditure items that we propose excluding are:  Interest expenses related to R&D. Including interest expenses will encourage debt financing over equity financing.  Purchases of existing R&D assets. This R&D has already been created and would allow taxpayers to artificially inflate their R&D expenditure by buying and selling existing R&D assets.  R&D undertaken offshore. Allowing this expenditure would be undesirable because of potential re-characterisation risks.  Lease payments. These can include an implicit interest payment; allowing this as R&D expenditure but excluding interest expenses is likely to bias leasing over the purchase of capital items with debt. 5.31 We also propose to exclude any expenditure funded by government grants, or research funding, for R&D. This is to ensure that companies are not able to benefit twice by obtaining an additional cash out for research funded by government grants. 5.32 Outsourced R&D will be eligible for the purchaser (but not the provider) subject to the same set of eligibility criteria applying to the purchase as described earlier in the paper. Submission points Recognising that too loose a set of criteria could leave significant scope for abuse and undermine the integrity and durability of the proposal, is the definition of R&D, when combined with the other criteria, sufficiently robust? Are there other definitions of R&D used by companies that could be used for the suggested changes? Would excluding government grants cause specific distortions? If so, what would be the nature and magnitude of these distortions? 19 Determining the amount of tax losses to be cashed out 5.33 Companies that are eligible for the proposal will be able to cash out all or part of their tax losses in the relevant tax year. As with the eligibility criteria, we suggest linking the overall amount that can be cashed out to the company’s salary and wage expenditure on R&D. 5.34 Specifically, we suggest that companies that qualify for the proposal should be able to cash out up to 1.5 times their R&D salary and wage expenditure, provided this amount does not exceed the company’s total tax losses, or its total qualifying R&D expenditure in the relevant tax year. The rationale for linking the amount of the cash-out to a company’s R&D wage and salary expenditure is consistent with the R&D wage intensity criteria discussed earlier. The multiplier of 1.5 which is applied to R&D salary and wage expenditure is intended to help companies cash out losses that are incurred as a result of other R&D expenditure that is not related to salary and wages (such as capital expenditure and overheads). 5.35 In practice, this means companies that qualify for the proposal will be able to cash out the lesser of:  1.5 times their eligible R&D salary and wage expenditure in the relevant year;  total tax losses in the relevant year;  total qualifying R&D expenditure in the relevant year; and  the overall cap on eligible losses for the relevant year (see next section). 5.36 This is illustrated by the examples below. Examples of determining the size of available R&D cash-outs This box contains some numerical examples to illustrate how the size of the R&D cash-out is calculated. Total tax loss R&D-related salary/wage expenditure Total qualifying R&D expenditure Total amount of losses available to cash out Company A $200 $100 $180 $150 Company B $200 $100 $140 $140 Company C $ 50 $100 $180 $50 Company A – The company has spent $100 on R&D wage and salary expenditure so, given the 1.5 multiplier, a total of $150 could potentially be eligible for cashing out. As this amount is less than the company’s total qualifying R&D expenditure (and also its total tax loss) the full $150 is available to be cashed out. Company B – Total qualifying R&D expenditure ($140) is less than 1.5 times the company’s R&D wage and salary expenditure. Therefore the amount of losses available to cash out is limited to $140. Company C – The company’s total tax loss ($50) is less than 1.5 times the company’s R&D wage and salary expenditure and also the company’s total qualifying R&D expenditure. The size of the available cash out is therefore limited to $50. 20 5.37 Companies would still be eligible to carry forward any losses in excess of the amount cashed out to future years. This means remaining losses would be accorded the same treatment as losses under the current rules. Overall cap on eligible losses 5.38 We suggest an incremental increase in the amount of losses to be cashed out over time, with the initial overall cap on eligible losses to be set at $500,000 (equivalent to a cashed-out loss of $140,000 10 ), and rising over time to a cap of $2 million (equivalent to a cashed out loss of $560,000). 5.39 Increasing the cap on eligible losses incrementally reduces its fiscal risk, especially in the early years of the new rules when there will be uncertainty over the response of R&D producers to the changes. Gradually increasing the cap will also help ensure that the benefits of the cashed-out loss will not be reduced by an increase in demand for R&D inputs that will result in an increase in the cost of doing R&D rather than an increase in R&D. 10 If the current company tax rate of 28% is maintained. 21 CHAPTER 6 Administrative process 6.1 The R&D tax losses proposal has similar administrative implications to the now repealed R&D tax credit. In particular, implementation would require changes to the IR 4 company income tax return and a new statement of R&D activity and expenditure. Changes to the IR 4J imputation return would also be required. 6.2 Under the proposed new rules, when a company files its income tax return, it would request its tax losses to be refunded. This will be done through additional key points added to the IR 4 income tax return to show the amount of loss being cashed out and the actual value of the cashed-out amount (once the loss is converted using the company tax rate). 6.3 To determine if a company is eligible for a loss to be cashed out, Inland Revenue would need to know the nature of the R&D activity and the amount of expenditure. This would likely be done by the company filing a statement which details their R&D activity and expenditure within 30 days of the income tax return being filed. 6.4 Once both the company income tax return and statement of R&D is received, both would be put through a comprehensive screening process. Once the initial screening process is complete, either a payment would be made, or the claim would be passed on for further investigation. Applications that are investigated further would either be approved and the appropriate payment made, or declined. 6.5 Inland Revenue would pay out these losses to the company, subject to the rules and criteria for the cashed out loss being met. Companies that do not meet eligibility would be notified and have the full loss carried forward. This process is shown in diagram 1.

The comprehensiveness of the screening process will need to be balanced against greater administration and compliance costs for companies. 6.9 In most instances, it will be possible to make a payment based on the information provided in the statement of R&D, along with other information already held by Inland Revenue (such as PAYE schedules). This will minimise the additional compliance burden placed on taxpayers. In some cases however, further screening and investigation may be needed. Education 6.10 Given that the proposals set out in this paper are new, there is likely to be some uncertainty for taxpayers over how to apply some of the suggested rules above, particularly around the definition of R&D and eligible/excluded activities. Inland Revenue intends to produce guidance material for R&D companies and provide further education through community compliance officers. We want to hear from taxpayers how Inland Revenue can further help address possible uncertainties. Changes to Financial Reporting Standards 6.11 Inland Revenue is aware that the simplification of financial reporting requirements for small and medium enterprises will mean that this policy proposal could impose an additional compliance burden on taxpayers. However, it is important that mechanisms that encourage compliance remain intact. It should be noted that this policy proposal is advantageous for taxpayers. Imputation 6.12 New Zealand’s imputation system creates a design complication if tax losses are cashed out (rather than carried forward). Generally, when companies pay corporate income tax they receive imputation credits and when they receive a refund they get an imputation debit. This means any taxpayer that accesses a cashed-out tax loss would incur an equivalent amount of “imputation debits” (or “negative imputation credits”). 6.13 While imputation debits for refunds are a current feature of the imputation system, a company cannot have a net debit balance at the end of their income year without incurring a penalty. To provide for ongoing imputation debit balances arising from these proposals, Inland Revenue systems will be modified to allow for this. Consultation questions for this section:  What approaches would be helpful to reduce uncertainty about the application process for potential applicants? 24 CHAPTER 7 Neutrality and integrity measures 7.1 A cashed-out loss can be thought of as an interest-free loan from the Government to be repaid from the taxpayer’s future taxable income; it is intended to provide a temporary cash-flow timing benefit when the company is in tax loss. However, if the R&D expenditure never results in a viable product, the interest-free loan effectively becomes a grant. 7.2 If the company or the shareholders make a return on their investment before they have repaid the value of the cashed-out loss, this will lead to an outcome that is concessionary to the taxpayer. In addition to the untaxed receipt, they also retain the benefit of the remaining cashed-out losses that have not yet been repaid. This also creates a fiscal risk. 7.3 R&D companies can make such a return on their investment through the sale of: 11  intellectual property from R&D the company has performed;  all of the shares in the company carrying out the R&D; or  some of the shares in the company. 7.4 If an R&D company is able to sell intellectual property, sell shares in the company, or the company itself is sold, it is highly likely the R&D company will also no longer be constrained to the same degree by the market failures and cashflow constraints affecting small R&D-intensive start-up companies. In this situation, the original policy rationale will no longer apply, as the company will have funds available to pay back the value of the cashed-out loss. Rules are therefore required to recover the value of any remaining cashed-out loss to ensure the correct policy outcome. We therefore seek your views on suggested recovery rules set out below. Sale of intellectual property Third-party sales 7.5 One way of realising a return on an R&D investment is to sell the corresponding intellectual property to a third party. It is proposed that if an R&D company has remaining cashed-out losses that have not yet been repaid, loss recovery income will arise from the sale of intellectual property up to the balance of any remaining cashed-out loss. The amount of the loss recovery income will then be reinstated, to become a loss to be carried forward. 12 This preserves neutrality between companies that sell intellectual property before and after the cashed-out loss has been repaid. 11 Sales include the redemption and buy back of shares. 12 In this situation, even if a breach in shareholder continuity has taken place, the losses will be able to be reinstated. 25 7.6 If the R&D company has already derived sufficient taxable income to repay the balance of the cashed-out loss before it sells its intellectual property, this rule will no longer apply. 13 7.7 This is analogous to the depreciation rules. Depreciation deductions are given for depreciating assets, but to the extent the final sale price is more than the adjusted book value of the asset there is depreciation recovery income. A similar approach is suggested here to ensure the tax treatment of profits and losses is neutral. Sales within the group 7.8 There is also the scenario when the intellectual property is sold to another group company; for example, in advance of an initial public offering of the new company. Currently the value at which the intellectual property is transferred does not matter as there is no tax on its sale. However, when losses are cashed out, we may need to consider whether there needs to be a requirement that transfers must be made at market value. Transfers below market value would enable taxpayers to avoid paying the full extent of any loss recovery income. An alternative option could be to ignore the transfer for tax purposes but move the potential liability to loss recovery income to the new company. 14 Sale of all company shares 7.9 The value of the intellectual property can also be realised through the sale of all shares in the company. As an integrity measure the “loss recovery income rule” will also be extended to the extent that:  a profit is made on the sale of the shares; and  the company has remaining cashed-out losses that have not yet been repaid. 7.10 In such circumstances taxable income will arise to the shareholder, in proportion to their shareholding, and up to the value of the remaining cashed- out losses. It will be taxed at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. 15 13 Income from the sale of patents and supply of “know how” will remain taxable. 14 An equivalent approach could apply to amalgamating companies to ensure that the potential liability for loss recovery income was transferred to the amalgamated company. 15 Due to collection difficulties and the potential loss of taxing rights under a double tax agreement, this income may arise only to resident shareholders. 26 Example 1 A company that has cashed-out losses is sold to Purchaser A. The 1,000 shares in the company were held by Shareholder A (40% share), Shareholder B (40% share) and Shareholder C (20% share). The profit per share on sale is $10. A total of $300 of losses had previously been cashed out and there was also subsequent taxable income of $200 to the company before the sale. The profit made by the respective shareholders is $4,000/$4,000/$2,000. The total loss recovery income, for the remaining cashed-out losses, is only $100 (being $300 less $200). As the loss recovery income is in proportion to the shareholding, Shareholders A and B will each have $40 taxable income and Shareholder C will have $20. This is then taxed at each shareholder’s marginal tax rate. 7.11 As a further integrity measure, all controlling shareholders of the immediate shareholder, whether direct or indirect, will be jointly and severally liable in the event the immediate shareholder does not pay the tax on this income. This is to prevent the company being stripped of assets before the tax falls due. Sale of some company shares 7.12 The focus with the previous integrity measure involving the sale of all shares in the company was to the extent that any taxable income earned by the company was less than the losses cashed out and shareholders made a gain from the sale of their shares, the lesser of the two became loss recovery income. In other words, the appropriate time to claw back any residual timing benefit from the initial cashing out of losses is when a shareholder received a direct benefit from the company. 7.13 While the same principle should apply to partial sales, it becomes more difficult to apply in practice. The nature of R&D-intensive start-up companies is to seek additional capital throughout their life cycle, which means it can be unclear at what point the controlling shareholding actually changed. 7.14 The other difficulty is that to the extent that a part of any remaining cashed- out losses would be repaid as loss recovery income on sale, the total amount of the potential recoverable loss that is held in the company would need to be reduced. 7.15 For these reasons we suggest:  The loss recovery income rule will also apply for the sale of part of the shares in the company, when the proportion of shares sold represents greater than 5 percent of the total shares in the company.  The amount of loss recovery income will be pro-rated for the proportion of shares sold.  The value of remaining cashed-out losses in the company is reduced by the amount of loss recovery income of the shareholders. 27 7.16 An anti-avoidance rule will also be needed to ensure the loss recovery income rule still applies when multiple shareholders separately sell less than 5 percent of their respective shareholdings, but the combined sale represents more than 5 percent of the total shares in the company. Example 2 Shareholder A sells half of its shareholding in the company (equivalent to 20 percent of the total shares in the company). The loss recovery income rule is therefore triggered. As before, a total of $300 of losses had previously been cashed out and there was also subsequent taxable income of $200 to the company before the sale of shares. The total amount loss recovery income is therefore $100, which is adjusted down to $20 reflecting that only 20 percent of the shares in the company have been sold. Shareholder A therefore has taxable income of $20 and the remaining cashed-out losses in the company is reduced by $20. Example 3 Shareholder B sells 10% of its shareholding in the company (equivalent to 4% of the total shares in the company). Given this is less than the 5% threshold to trigger the loss recovery income rule, there is no recovery on sale. 7.17 We recognise that there are practical limitations with this aspect of the suggested loss recovery rules. Claiming loss recovery income back from shareholders who are based overseas would pose collection challenges. Also, correctly assessing loss recovery income arising from the resale of shares (which, having been sold before, will not have the same amount of cashed out losses allocated) will be highly complex. 7.18 Given these difficulties, an alternative option is to keep the cashed-out loss within the company, with recovery income triggered by subsequent profits, a sale of intellectual property or a majority stake in the company itself. Issue of new shares 7.19 The nature of small start-up R&D companies is that they will gain additional shareholders and additional equity funding through the firm’s life cycle. Generally speaking, however, this will involve the company issuing more shares for additional capital. While this will have the effect of both diluting the value of holding of the existing shareholders it will also increase the value of the company as it will have a stronger capital base. Thus the effect of the additional capital on existing shareholders will be balanced. 7.20 It is therefore not proposed that the value of remaining cashed-out losses be clawed back on the issue of new shares by the company and the loss recovery income rule will not apply. The loss recovery income rule will only be 28 targeted at shareholders when the shareholders receive a direct benefit from the sale of their shares. 7.21 We may, however, need to consider whether this rule could be inadvertently or inappropriately used in an initial public offer situation to get around the rule relating to the sale of shares. Submission points Are there possible unintended consequences that have not been captured above? What other measures may be needed to minimise risk to the tax base? Would the proposed loss recovery rules be significantly less complex if the proposed rules governing the sale of company shares were not included, and the loss stayed within the company? If yes, how else could a neutral tax outcome be achieved, with lower complexity, for situations where some of the shares of the company are sold?

The introduction of the fair dividend rate method for foreign portfolio investment and the active income exemption for direct investment have removed barriers to sensible investment choices, and brought New Zealand into line with other OECD economies. 1.2 This issues paper proposes further reform of the international tax system, but this time focuses on investments made by foreigners in New Zealand. It proposes changes to the thin capitalisation rules to ensure New Zealand collects its fair share of tax from such investments. 1.3 Past tax reviews have concluded that some reasonable level of tax can be imposed on foreign investors without unduly affecting incentives to invest. The thin capitalisation rules are one mechanism we use to ensure we do tax this investment. 1.4 The thin capitalisation rules aim to discourage the excessive debt-funding of New Zealand operations of multinational enterprises, by reducing tax deductions for interest in extreme cases. For the most part, the thin capitalisation rules appear to be effective in the standard case of a large multinational, listed on a stock exchange, with subsidiary operations in New Zealand. However, they seem deficient in the case of private equity investment. 1.5 One reason is that the rules currently apply only when a single non-resident controls the New Zealand investment, but private equity investors often work together in groups in a way that mimics control by a single controlling investor. In addition, the rules can also be ineffective when debt funding for an entire global group comes from the ultimate shareholders, rather than from third parties. While listed multinationals are unlikely to be obtaining their debt from shareholders, closely held investment vehicles can more easily do so. 1.6 We are proposing that the thin capitalisation rules for inbound investment be widened to extend to investments that are not controlled by a single non-resident. That is, they would apply to groups of non-residents as long as those investors were acting together, either by explicit agreement or because they were being co- ordinated by some party such as a private equity manager. 1.7 Our primary concern in this situation is the use of related-party debt when overall debt levels are high. To deal with this concern, related-party debt would be excluded from the debt-to-asset ratio of a multinational’s worldwide group for the purposes of the thin capitalisation calculations. When non-residents’ New Zealand debt levels are high, the worldwide debt-to-asset ratio can be used to justify the high level of debt. Excluding related-party debt from the worldwide ratio would ensure the world wide debt ratio could be used to justify high debt levels in New Zealand only to the extent it reflected genuinely third-party borrowing by the worldwide group. 2 1.8 The proposed rule should not affect the use of genuinely external debt, such as a loan from a third-party bank, even when the overall level of debt is high. 1.9 We propose a number of other technical changes to the rules. 1.10 We propose that any changes, if they proceed, would take effect from the income year beginning after enactment of any legislation. 1.11 The proposed changes to the rules are likely to reduce the returns to foreign investors in a limited number of cases (the outcome for affected taxpayers depends crucially on how the foreign tax laws treat the investment). This is a consequence of the fact that we want these investors to pay more New Zealand tax. 1.12 However, on balance we consider that the effect of reduced returns for these taxpayers will not have a significant effect on overall levels of investment and there are likely to be overall net benefits for New Zealand because of the increased tax collection. Since our starting point is that it is sensible to impose some tax on foreign investment, we have designed our proposals to reduce tax deductions for related-party debt that is unduly reducing the effective rate of New Zealand tax, while limiting the effect on other debt. Summary of proposed changes Issue Current rule Proposed rule Foreign controller Must be a single non-resident controller for the rules to apply. Must be a single non-resident controller, or a group of non-residents holding an interest of 50% of or more and acting together. 110% safe harbour Worldwide debt includes all debt of the group. Worldwide debt excludes debt linked to shareholders of group companies. Resident trustee Resident trustee is subject to the rules if the trust is a non-complying trust and more than 50% of settlements are made by a single non-resident. Resident trustee is subject to the rules if more than 50% of settlements on the trust are made by a non-resident, a group of non-residents acting together, or another entity that is subject to the rules. Capitalised interest Capitalised interest is included in assets when the debt-to-asset ratio is calculated. Capitalised interest excluded from assets when a tax deduction has been taken in New Zealand for the interest. Consolidation for outbound groups Individual owner of an outbound group of companies is treated separately from the group. Individual owner’s interests consolidated with those of the outbound group. Asset uplift Some taxpayers are recognising increased asset values as a result of internal sales of assets. Ignore increased asset values as a result of internal sales of assets (exception for internal sales that are part of the sale of an entire worldwide group). 3 How to make a submission 1.13 You are invited to make a submission on the proposed reforms and points raised in this issues paper.

The fair dividend rate method of taxing portfolio investors replaced an inefficient system which favoured investment in certain countries and discouraged investment through mutual funds. 2.3 Then in 2009, the tax treatment of offshore direct investment was reformed. Following the reform, New Zealand multinationals with foreign subsidiaries were no longer taxed on the active foreign income of those subsidiaries, such as income from manufacturing or retail sales. This reduced barriers to global expansion from a New Zealand base. In 2011 this “active income exemption” was extended to direct (more than 10%) but non-controlling interests in foreign companies. 2.4 In tandem with the changes to domestic tax law, the government has also begun a programme of updating our double tax agreements. New Zealand has already obtained substantially lower withholding tax rates for dividends and royalties with Australia and the United States, and is likely to obtain those lower rates with other countries in future. 2.5 The treaty reform provides another reason for multinational enterprises to keep their New Zealand base. However, treaty reform entails reciprocal obligations: the same concessions that have been made to New Zealand investors abroad must also be made to foreign investors here. In some cases this removes an element of protection for the New Zealand tax base. 2.6 This puts the spotlight on the effectiveness of other base-protection measures aimed at non-residents such as thin capitalisation, transfer pricing and non-resident withholding tax. More generally, it has been some time since these sorts of measures were introduced or reviewed, and there are concerns that they are not working as well as they could. 2.7 This issues paper proposes changes to the thin capitalisation rules to ensure New Zealand collects its fair share of tax from inbound foreign investment. The thin capitalisation rules 2.8 In 1997 thin capitalisation rules were introduced to prevent non-residents from allocating an excessive proportion of their world-wide interest expenses against their New Zealand sourced income. The need for such rules arose because interest is deductible at the company tax rate but withholding tax of only 10% or 2% was payable on the corresponding interest income. Equity investment, however faces the full company tax rate. Thus there are inherent incentives for taxpayers to capitalise companies with debt instead of equity. The rules are briefly summarised in the Appendix. 5 CHAPTER 3 Scope of review 3.1 This document highlights a number of respects in which the thin capitalisation rules are currently not operating in the way intended, resulting in too little tax paid in New Zealand. The apparent problems with the rules have been identified by Inland Revenue in the course of its audit work. This document proposes amendments to the law to correct the problems that have been identified. 3.2 The focus of the document is ensuring that more tax is collected in cases where New Zealand-sourced income appears to be escaping tax. That is, the focus is on base maintenance. 3.3 The document will not consider the levels of existing “safe-harbour” debt-to-asset thresholds (60% for inbound investors, 75% for outbound). The safe harbour for inbound investors was reduced to its current level in the 2011-12 tax year, and the outbound threshold has been in operation only since 2009. 3.4 The document will not consider fundamental changes to the treatment of debt held by finance or insurance companies, although this may be reviewed later. 3.5 This document will not consider rules which reclassify debt as equity, such as the “substituting debenture” rule, although this could be a focus for future work. 6 CHAPTER 4 Current problems with the rules and proposed solutions Comments applying to all the proposals in this paper Costs and benefits 4.1 Every proposal in this issues paper will, in a minority of cases, reduce the amount of interest deduction that may be taken. In that way, it will also reduce returns for some foreign investors. Some investors might pull out of New Zealand. An important question is whether or not the potential withdrawal of investment is outweighed by some additional tax revenue. 4.2 The McLeod tax review (“Tax Review 2001”) considered the taxation of foreign investment into New Zealand. The review found that some reasonable level of tax could be imposed on foreign investors without unduly affecting incentives to invest. This is in New Zealand’s best interests. 4.3 However, there is some level at which additional taxes will cause more harm than good. We are therefore interested in your views about the costs of the proposals for taxpayers and investors. Application and transition 4.4 If implemented, we propose the changes would all be applied from the first income year beginning after enactment of the legislation. 4.5 We expect that some investors will change their mix of debt and equity funding accordingly. 4.6 We have attempted to design the proposals so that genuinely external debt funding, which could be difficult to alter, will not usually be affected. This is likely to reduce the effect of changes to the mix. 4.7 Nevertheless, there could be constraints on the ability of companies to substitute equity for related-party debt. We are interested in submissions on this point. Questions we would like you to consider  What is the likely cost of the proposals? The cost might include additional compliance costs, increased funding costs, and the cost of restructuring funding to prevent denial of interest deductions. Your information will be most useful to us if it is quantitative and supported by independent research. It will also be more useful if you can identify which costs are transitional costs and which will persist.  How might taxpayers change their behaviour if the proposals were implemented?  Are there any possible effects of the proposed changes that we have not identified? 7 Problem 1: Single non-resident requirement 4.8 The inbound thin capitalisation rules apply to a resident company only if the company is controlled by a single non-resident (section FE 2(1)(c)). 4.9 The case of a single controlling investor is the most obvious case in which a shareholder can arbitrarily determine the level of debt in the company, unless prevented by a thin capitalisation rule. Subject to any non-tax constraints that might be imposed by, for example, an unrelated lender, a controlling shareholder can classify their investment as either debt or as equity, or any mixture of the two. 4.10 However, there are other cases in which more than one shareholder can explicitly agree between themselves to set the level of debt in a company. 4.11 The risks of New Zealand-sourced income escaping New Zealand tax seem very much the same in these cases as in the single non-resident shareholder case, and this suggests widening the scope of the existing rules. 4.12 At the other extreme from the case of a single non-resident controller, a single shareholder among many shareholders of a listed company will be unable to control the level of debt in the company. It is also very unlikely that the shareholders would explicitly agree between themselves to manipulate the level of debt unless this process was initiated by the company itself, in which case the stapled-stock rule in section FA 2B might well apply. Proposal: Single non-resident requirement 4.13 We propose that the inbound thin capitalisation rules be widened to include companies in which non-residents who are not necessarily associated persons according to the tax definition, but who act together, hold an interest of 50% or more. 4.14 The intention of the change would be to make companies subject to the rules when shareholders can collectively act in the same way as an individual controlling shareholder to determine the level of debt the company will hold. 4.15 What it means to “act together” would not be defined exhaustively in legislation. 4.16 However, acting together will include at least:  explicitly co-operating with each other through a written or tacit shareholder agreement;  being effectively co-ordinated by a person or group of people, such as a private equity manager or managers. 8 Example: James, Henry and Judith each hold one third of the shares in NZ Co and they have a shareholder agreement which determines what they may do with their holdings and regulates certain other actions. The three non-residents are “acting together”. Example: An investment promoter contacts ten people and convinces them to form a consortium to buy out NZ Co. The promoter arranges for a partnership to be legally documented and the ten people contribute their capital, which is used to purchase all of NZ Co’s shares. The promoter effectively administers the partnership and directs its activities. The ten investors are “acting together”. Example: X Co, which manages investments on behalf of foreign investment partnerships, arranges for two partnerships (not legally associated) to incorporate companies. The newly incorporated companies each purchase 49% of the shares in NZ Co. X Co holds the remaining 1%. The companies are “acting together”. 4.17 We would not expect portfolio shareholders of a public company to be acting together and would look to clarify that in any legislation. 4.18 Widening the application of the thin capitalisation rules in this way raises questions about the definition of the “worldwide group” of a company. When there is a single non-resident controller, the worldwide group is the group of the controller. When there is no single controller, it is not clear whose worldwide assets and liabilities should be included in the worldwide group, or to what extent those assets and liabilities should be included. If a bank was one of the parties acting together, there could be further complications because registered banks are subject to separate thin capitalisation rules. 4.19 Therefore, and to avoid significantly increased complexity of the rules, we propose that when there is no single non-resident controller, the worldwide group for the purposes of the 110% safe harbour will be the New Zealand group. On its own, this would negate the extension of the rules to people acting together, because the New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio would always be less than 110% of the worldwide group’s ratio. Further measures to overcome this problem are outlined as part of other proposed changes in this paper. 4.20 An alternative to widening the rules to cover groups acting together would be to widen the rules to cover all companies in which non-residents hold an interest of 50% or more. Using this approach, defining “acting together” would be unnecessary as acting together would not be a consideration. However, such a test could bring in shareholders that are very unlikely to be able to influence the level of debt held by the company (publicly listed companies would need to be explicitly excluded). 4.21 Another alternative approach would be to prescribe specific and exhaustive criteria which would indicate when people would be considered to be acting together. For example, the thin capitalisation rules might apply whenever there was a shareholder agreement. Such an approach is not favoured because of the risk that the specific criteria would be easily circumvented unless there were complex criteria to prevent it. 9 Questions we would like you to consider  Is it preferable to have an “acting together” test, or to include all companies in which one or more non-residents hold a 50% interest, whether or not they are acting together?  If the “acting together” test is preferable, are there other cases where people are acting together which should be explicitly included? Explicitly excluded?  If the alternative is preferable, which cases should be explicitly excluded? Problem 2: Worldwide group is NZ group and worldwide debt is shareholder debt 4.22 Interest is not denied under the thin capitalisation rules if the debt-to-asset ratio of the New Zealand group of a company or trustee is less than 110% of the debt-to- asset ratio of the corresponding worldwide group (section FE 6). 4.23 In some cases the worldwide group is almost the same as the New Zealand group, and so the 110% safe harbour is always available. This allows the non-resident investor to use as much debt, including shareholder debt, as they wish. This is inappropriate. Example: Jan incorporates SPV Co in the Cayman Islands, capitalising it with $90 of shareholder debt and $11 of equity. SPV Co buys NZ Co, capitalising it (using its own funds) with $90 of debt and $10 of equity. The worldwide debt-to-asset ratio is 90.1%. The New Zealand debt-to-asset ratio is 90%, so no interest deductions will be denied. 4.24 The 110% safe harbour contemplates a foreign parent with substantial foreign operations and third-party borrowing, in which case the comparison to a worldwide ratio is more meaningful. Proposal: Worldwide group is NZ group or worldwide debt is shareholder debt 4.25 We propose that when determining the worldwide ratio in the inbound rules, debt will not be counted if it is linked to shareholders of group entities. Example: Jan (see previous example) cannot include shareholder debt when calculating the worldwide debt-to-asset ratio. The worldwide debt-to-asset ratio is therefore 0%. Example: Aus Co owns NZ Co. Aus Co borrows $100 on commercial terms from an unrelated bank. Aus Co has $150 of assets, which is the sole security for the loan. NZ Co has $75 of assets and $52 of shareholder debt. The worldwide debt-to-asset ratio is 67%. The New Zealand debt-to-asset ratio is 69%, so the 110% safe harbour applies. 10 4.26 The intention of the proposal is that the worldwide group test will be used only when it is meaningful – that is, when New Zealand debt levels are being compared to debt levels of a multinational organisation with genuinely external funding. 4.27 Where funding is not genuinely external, and so could effectively be a substitute for equity, there is a reasonable case for using thin capitalisation rules to alter the mix of debt and equity funding. This prevents foreign investors from unduly reducing the effective New Zealand tax rate. 4.28 In contrast, when debt is from truly unrelated parties the shareholder does not benefit from a lower effective tax rate and there is not such a strong case for preventing interest deductions. 4.29 Determining the particular conditions for linking a debt to shareholders is a complex matter. However, our preliminary views are that, we might exclude debt from the worldwide ratio in the following cases:  the debt is owed to a person having an income interest in a group entity; or  the debt is owed to a person that has received funds directly or indirectly from a group entity, a person with an income interest in a group entity, or an associated person, on the condition or expectation of both parties that some or all of those funds would be used to provide the debt. 4.30 The second condition is to prevent back-to-back loans. 4.31 It might also make sense to exclude a debt if security for the debt or a guarantee of repayment comes from outside the worldwide group. These features might indicate that debt has been artificially increased to a level that would not be sustainable if the worldwide group was standing alone. Our instinct is that such an exclusion would be necessary to make the proposal effective, but we are seeking your feedback about cases in which this would not be appropriate. Example: Cayman Co and Bahama Co each own 40% of NZ Co. They also each own 47% of Tiger Co, which is not part of the worldwide group for thin capitalisation purposes. Tiger Co has $100 of assets. NZ Co has $20 worth of assets. NZ Co borrows $20 from a bank. The loan is secured over NZ Co’s asset and Tiger Co’s assets. The loan may not be included in the worldwide group’s debt for the purposes of the debt-to-asset ratio. 4.32 Because it is difficult to anticipate all the ways in which shareholder debt might be transformed into apparently external debt, a specific anti-avoidance rule might be required in addition to the listed exclusions. 4.33 The proposal we are making is an additional restriction on the availability of interest deductions. All the existing restrictions continue to apply, including the inclusion of all debt – from related or unrelated sources – in the New Zealand group calculations. 11 4.34 Overall, the proposal appears to be superior to alternatives we have considered. A real difficulty with the current 110% safe harbour is that it appears to be suitable only for large multinational groups with considerable holdings outside New Zealand and ultimately public shareholdings. 4.35 One option would have been to prohibit the use of the 110% worldwide group test if less than 50% of the worldwide group’s assets were outside New Zealand or the New Zealand group was not controlled by a single non-resident. This would have been a simpler option to administer. However, it would also have arbitrarily denied interest deductions in rare cases of genuinely high levels of external gearing. External borrowing does not reduce the effective New Zealand tax rate for a foreign equity investor, so there is not a strong theoretical case for forcing a reduction of gearing in these cases. 4.36 Abroad, other countries have adopted an “arm’s-length” test, which would allow debt deductions in these sorts of cases as long as it could be demonstrated that an unrelated (non-shareholding) party would be prepared to advance the same amount of debt as has been actually taken on by the domestic operation. In practice, it is difficult to decide what an arm’s-length level of debt is, and we do not favour such an approach. We are also concerned that, in practice, an arm’s-length test is ineffective in preventing excessive interest deductions. We also observe that a 60% debt-to-asset ratio is unusually high for normal multinational businesses. 1 4.37 The proposal we are making will increase compliance costs for some taxpayers. However, the number of people affected is likely to be small. In practice, and particularly since the introduction of specialised thin capitalisation rules for registered banks, the 110% test is relied upon in few cases. Questions we would like you to consider  Is there an economic case for including shareholder debt in the worldwide ratio?  Are the proposed conditions for linking debt to shareholders complete?  Are there common shareholder lending arrangements that we are not aware of which should be addressed by adding additional conditions?  Alternatively, are the proposed conditions for linking debt too broad?  If so, what exceptions might be needed to ensure that external debt is not caught? 1 We looked at a sample of approximately 80 foreign-controlled New Zealand groups who were surveyed by Inland Revenue to obtain financial data. We then obtained worldwide group debt-to-asset ratio from the Orbis database for these companies. Of 64 companies for which data was available, only 2 had a worldwide ratio exceeding 60%. 12 Problem 3: Trusts as main shareholder (non-resident with effective control) 4.38 The thin capitalisation rules apply to a trustee of a non-complying trust settled by a non-resident if the non-resident has made more than 50% of the total settlements on the trust (subsection FE 2(1)(d)). 4.39 They do not apply to other resident trustees. This causes problems in practice. 4.40 For example, suppose a New Zealand business is owned by a resident trustee of a trust, and that the trust has been settled by a resident subsidiary of a foreign company. If the trustee has complied with New Zealand tax obligations, it is a complying trust. The settlor is a special purpose vehicle, has few assets and no interest expenses. The trustee borrows most of its capital directly from the foreign company, but is not subject to the thin capitalisation rules so has unrestricted interest deductions. 4.41 On the face of it, the rules should apply to trustees more broadly than they currently do. Proposal: Trusts as main shareholder (non-resident with effective control) 4.42 We propose that the thin capitalisation rules will apply to a resident trustee if 50% or more of settlements made on the trust have been made by a non-resident or a group of non-residents acting together, or by an entity that is subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules (the rules already apply to any non-resident trustee). 4.43 The intention of the proposal is to prevent a trustee from borrowing on behalf of a group to avoid the application of the thin capitalisation rules. 4.44 It is noted that in the case of a foreign trust earning only foreign-sourced income, there is unlikely to be any interest deduction in the first place, and so the application of the thin capitalisation rules would be of no consequence. 4.45 We expect this proposal to have minimal effect on legitimate business structures. Questions we would like you to consider  Is there any reason that the thin capitalisation rules should not apply to a resident trustee if a majority of the settlements on the trust were made by a non-resident or a person subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules?  Are there some cases in which it would be normal, for non-tax reasons, to use a trust to hold group companies? 13 Problem 4: Problems with individuals or trustees holding NZ groups 4.46 Section FE 3(2) excludes, from the New Zealand group of a resident natural person or trustee, an excess debt outbound company or a member of the New Zealand group of an excess debt outbound company. This means that a natural person or trustee may be considered separately from companies, including CFCs, they own, and not be required to consolidate those interests. 4.47 This is in contrast to section FE 3(1), which ensures that a natural person or trustee must include all associated residents, even companies, in their New Zealand group, and must consolidate the debts and assets of those entities with those of the natural person or trustee (see also section FE 14(2)). 4.48 Section FE 3(1) applies to inbound investors, while section FE 3(2) applies to outbound investors, but there is no obvious basis for distinguishing between the two when it comes to consolidation of companies and non-companies. Proposal: Problems with individuals or trustees holding NZ groups 4.49 We propose that the New Zealand group of an individual or trustee under section FE 3(2)(a) should no longer exclude excess debt outbound companies or those included in a New Zealand group of an excess debt outbound company. 4.50 The intention of the proposal is to require consolidation of an individual’s or trustee’s holdings with holdings of underlying entities, just as is required under section FE 3(1)(a). Questions we would like you to consider  Are there any reasons to treat the New Zealand owner of an outbound group separately from the group?  What difficulties might arise in consolidating the interests of the owner and the outbound group?  Would such difficulties be any different to the difficulties that arise when consolidating interests of an owner and an inbound group? Problem 5: Capitalised interest 4.51 Recall that the debt-to-asset ratio of a group determines whether or not the thin capitalisation rules will limit interest deductions (section FE 6). 4.52 Asset values are determined according to generally accepted accounting practice. In at least the case of International Financial Reporting Standards, this means that asset values must sometimes include capitalised interest costs (NZ IAS 23). 14 4.53 Where a tax deduction has been taken for these interest costs, which is commonly the case, they should in theory be excluded from the asset value for thin capitalisation purposes. Proposal: Capitalised interest 4.54 We propose that capitalised interest expenses should be deducted from asset values, to the extent the expenses have been deducted for New Zealand tax purposes. 4.55 Where a New Zealand tax deduction has been allowed for interest that is capitalised for accounting purposes, it is not appropriate that this be included in the New Zealand group assets. 4.56 Some compliance costs will be imposed by this proposal through having to separate out capitalised interest expenses. However, in previous consultation on capitalised interest expenses – in the context of the financial arrangement rules – we have been advised that it is a straightforward exercise to identify capitalised interest costs. We therefore believe compliance costs should be minimal. Questions we would like you to consider  Are there any capitalised interest costs which should be included in the value of assets for thin capitalisation purposes?  Is our information about the ease of extracting information about capitalised interest costs correct? Problem 6: Asset “uplift” 4.57 As noted in the previous section, the debt-to-asset ratio of a group determines whether or not the thin capitalisation rules will limit interest deductions (section FE 6). Asset values are determined according to generally accepted accounting practice. 4.58 For particular assets, including much intangible property, this means assets will be recorded at cost (less amortisation or impairment). Revaluation of such assets, including internally generated goodwill, is not permitted because a reliable value cannot be determined. In contrast, when money is paid to an unrelated party for an intangible asset, including goodwill, the amount paid is likely to be a more reliable indication of actual value. 4.59 The restriction on revaluations is being circumvented by some groups who report increased asset values following internal reorganisations. In these cases, existing subsidiaries are sold to other group companies for market value, which includes the value of internally generated intangibles. It is questionable whether or not this is permitted under generally accepted accounting practice. In any case, it raises concerns that artificially high debt deductions are being allowed because of unreliable (high) asset valuations. 15 4.60 There may be a case for restricting asset values in cases like these. 4.61 The concerns are likely to be lessened in cases in which the internal organisation coincides with an external acquisition – for instance, when an entire multinational group is purchased by an unrelated party which sets up a new holding company structure in New Zealand. In this case there has been an external purchase and purchased goodwill or other intangible assets are recognised at their fair value. Allocation of that goodwill between entities within the group could still be a concern, however, depending on the details of accounting for the acquisition, and how any resulting asset uplift has been distributed around the worldwide group. Proposal: Asset uplift 4.62 We propose that when the total asset value of a New Zealand or worldwide group increases as the result of the sale of assets between associated persons, the increase will be ignored for thin capitalisation purposes. 4.63 The intention of the proposal is that it will not be possible to revalue assets upwards by means of an internal reorganisation, unless a straightforward revaluation of that asset would be permitted under generally accepted accounting practice. At least for tax purposes, it should not be possible to circumvent normal restrictions on revaluations by buying and selling entities or assets within a commonly controlled group. 4.64 An exception might be made if the sale of assets took place as part of the sale of the entire group to a previously non-associated party, and the increased asset value reflected the fair value of the assets to that party, as determined under generally accepted accounting practice. In this case, the sale to an external party has a cost which can be used as a reliable basis for determining underlying asset values. Whether or not such an exception is practical will depend on the ability to write a sensible rule for determining when the sale of assets is linked to the sale of the entire group. Questions we would like you to consider  Is it common to have internal sales of assets or entities which result in higher reported asset values?  If so, what is the accounting authority for recognising these higher values?  If this proposal is implemented, what difficulties might be involved in practice in identifying and removing increases in the value of assets?  How might we distinguish increases in asset values associated with the sale of an entire worldwide group to a previously unrelated party? 16 APPENDIX Summary of the current legislation New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules limit the tax deductions that may be taken for interest expenditure. There are specific rules for foreign investors, New Zealanders investing abroad, and for registered banks. These rules are summarised in the following sections. The summary is intended to convey the broad thrust of the rules to put the rest of this document in context, but does not discuss the detail of the rules. Foreign investors (“inbound” rules) The inbound rules apply to non-residents directly earning New Zealand income, to New Zealand resident companies controlled by a single non-resident, and to certain resident trustees. They prevent large amounts of debt being concentrated in the New Zealand operations of a foreign-controlled multinational. For example, they might prevent a foreign parent from allocating external debt to New Zealand when it is properly attributable to overseas assets and operations. To work out if any interest deductions that would normally be available are denied, a person subject to the rules must work out the debt-to-asset ratios of their New Zealand group and their worldwide group. The New Zealand group is, crudely speaking, all the operations of the investor in New Zealand. Similarly, the worldwide group is the worldwide operations of the investor. No deductions are denied if:  the New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio is 110% or less of the worldwide group’s ratio; or  the New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio is 60% or less. The intuition for the first condition (the “110% safe harbour”) is that if the New Zealand group of a multinational is no more indebted than the worldwide group, the debt in New Zealand is a rough but convenient proxy for the group’s external debt that is really attributable to New Zealand operations. The second condition (the “60% safe harbour”) is provided to reduce compliance costs. Many companies will have debt-to-asset ratios that are significantly lower than 60% for commercial reasons. Those companies need not undertake worldwide group calculations to justify their debt levels. If neither condition is met, interest deductions will be reduced to the extent they relate to debt above the highest of the 60% (absolute) or 110% (relative) thresholds. The inbound rules are the main focus of this document. 17 New Zealanders investing abroad (“outbound” rules) The outbound rules apply to any resident with a controlling interest in a foreign company and to some residents with non-controlling but significant interests in foreign companies. If a person is subject to the inbound rules, the inbound rules take precedence. The outbound rules prevent a New Zealand-based multinational from concentrating large amounts of debt in New Zealand. For example, they might prevent a New Zealand parent from allocating debt to New Zealand when it is properly attributable to the assets and operations of a foreign subsidiary. The process for working out whether or not interest is denied is almost the same as it is for the inbound rules. In the normal case, a person considers their debt-to-asset percentages and interest is denied to the extent that:  the New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio exceeds 110% of the worldwide group’s ratio; and  the New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio is 75% or more. An alternative set of conditions, based on interest-coverage ratios, may be used in limited circumstances, and there are some exceptions to the rules for smaller businesses. Registered banks These rules apply, as the name suggests, to registered banks operating in New Zealand. They require that banks have a minimum level of non-deductible capital – essentially equity – for tax purposes. If the bank’s debt levels are too high, and so equity levels are too low, interest on the excessive portion is denied. The rules for registered banks override both the inbound and the outbound rules. They are not affected by the changes in this document.
www.ird.govt.nz Policy and Strategy Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand T. 04-890 1500 F. 04-903 2413 6 June 2013 Thin capitalisation review: technical issues 1. On 16 May 2013 the Government announced as part of Budget 2013 that it has agreed to two key elements of the review of the thin capitalisation rules: applying the rules to groups of non-residents who “act together”, and excluding shareholder debt from a company’s worldwide group debt. A brief summary of what was proposed as part of this review is at the end of this note. 2. While the Government has agreed in principle to make those changes, the technical details have yet to be settled (for example, how “acting together” should be defined). This note sets out the views of Treasury and Inland Revenue on these technical issues. 3. We welcome feedback on these matters. Please direct your feedback or any questions you might have to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz. Please provide any feedback by 28 June 2013. Acting together test 4. The issues paper proposed that the thin capitalisation rules would apply if a group of non- residents who are “acting together” owned 50% or more of a company. Acting together would not be exhaustively defined. This is similar to the approach taken in the United Kingdom. 5. Submitters were concerned about the uncertainty such a definition would create. We are therefore considering an alternative. Under this alternative, the thin capitalisation rules would apply if: - 50% or more of the entity’s shares are owned by a group of non-residents who (directly or indirectly) hold debt in the entity in proportion to their equity in the entity; or - the entity has fewer than 25 shareholders and the shareholders have a shareholders’ agreement that sets out how the entity should be funded, and 50% or more of the shares are owned by non-residents; or - 50% or more of the entity’s shares are held by are non-residents that are effectively co- ordinated by a person or group of people, such as a private equity manager or managers. 6. We envisage that proportionality would be the most commonly used test as it is a key indicator of “acting together”. We want the thin capitalisation rules to apply when people are in the position to be able to arbitrarily substitute debt for equity. When debt is held in proportion to equity, the level of debt does not change shareholders’ exposure to the equity risk of the company. The ultimate return to the shareholders will not change if the entity is 20% debt- funded or 80% debt-funded. 7. We are not convinced that shareholders are likely to arrive at proportional debt and equity without a level of coordination. 8. We are aware that the substituting debenture rules use a proportionality test. If we applied a proportionality test in the thin capitalisation rules we would ensure that the substituting debenture rule did not also apply to entities subject to the thin capitalisation rules. 2 9. The fewer than 25 shareholders test is designed to align with the stapled stock rules. Those rules do not apply if a company is not widely held and there is a shareholders’ agreement that is used to staple debt and equity. Not being widely held, in effect, means a company has fewer than 25 shareholders. We expect that if there are 25 or more shareholders and they have agreements that specify how the entity should be funded then the stapled stock rules will generally apply. 10. The test’s third limb is designed to target situations where numerous entities (e.g. partnerships) invest into a New Zealand operation but are all effectively co-ordinated by a single person or group of persons, such as a private equity manager. Our concern is that by providing only bright-line tests (e.g. fewer than 25 shareholders), the thin capitalisation rules could be easily structured around by such a person. Shareholder debt excluded from worldwide group debt proposal 11. The issues paper proposed that shareholder debt be excluded from an entity’s worldwide group debt levels. There are two situations where we expect this rule to have meaningful effect. The first is where the thin capitalisation rules apply because of the acting together test. In that case, the issues paper proposed that the worldwide group of the company would be the same as the New Zealand group. Because of this, excluding shareholder debt is important; there would otherwise never be any denial for a company with shareholders acting together. This is discussed in further detail below. 12. The second situation is where a group of companies has a high level of shareholder debt. The purpose of the worldwide group debt test is to act as a rough but convenient proxy for what a commercial level of gearing is for a group of companies. This purpose is not achieved if a group of companies is financed through shareholder debt because that debt does not face the same constraints as genuine external debt. The gearing level of the worldwide group might be much higher than what an external lender would be comfortable with. 13. We do not expect this to have much impact on publicly listed multinational groups because of consolidation. The ultimate shareholders of the parent company are unlikely to have significant debt with the company and inter-company debt within the group will be removed upon consolidation. Effect of exclusion on those acting together 14. Under the proposals in the issues paper, this rule has a significant impact for those who come within the definition of “acting together”. Due to difficulties in constructing a meaningful worldwide group in such a case, it was proposed that the worldwide group of the entity would be the New Zealand group. 15. This means that debt a shareholder borrows from a third party and pushes down to a New Zealand entity will not be treated as external debt. Equally, debt lent directly from a third party to a New Zealand entity, but secured against a shareholder’s other assets, will also be treated as shareholder debt. In both of these cases the debt will not be counted as debt for the purposes of the 110% test. 16. Several submitters disagreed with this proposal. Submitters considered that genuine third- party debt that is pushed down should be counted in the worldwide group test. For those who provide a guarantee, submitters stated that treating it the same as shareholder debt overstates the value of the guarantee. 17. We have considered these points but ultimately do not agree. A fundamental principle of the thin capitalisation rules is to ensure that a non-resident does not allocate a disproportionate amount of its global debt to its New Zealand operations. However, in the case of non-residents acting together, there is no worldwide consolidation. It would therefore be possible for a non- resident to allocate debt that truly belongs to its other operations to its New Zealand investment. 3 18. A related objective of the thin capitalisation rules is to ensure that the level of debt put into a New Zealand company is commercially viable. As discussed above, the 110% worldwide group test is designed to be a rough but convenient proxy for a commercial level of gearing. If debt is secured against assets unrelated to the New Zealand operation, either because of a guarantee or because debt has been borrowed and then pushed down, there is no guarantee that this objective of a commercial level of debt will be achieved. Effect of rule on widely held entities 19. Submitters were also concerned about the practicality of a widely-held company being required to exclude shareholder debt from its worldwide group. For example, a widely-held company may have publicly issued bonds, some of which may have been purchased by a shareholder. 20. To address this concern, we are considering altering this rule so that debt owed to a shareholder does not have to be excluded if the entity is publicly listed and has publicly traded debt and that shareholder owns less than 10% of the company. Extension of the rules to trusts 21. At present the thin capitalisation rules apply only to trustees of non-complying trusts where more than 50% of the settlements came from non-residents. The rules do not apply to the trustees of other trusts that have been settled by non-residents. This is not appropriate. 22. The thin capitalisation rules generally drive off the ownership interests a person has in a company. This is not possible with trusts as there is nothing directly analogous to a shareholder. 23. This necessarily makes applying the rules effectively to trusts complex. Nevertheless, we believe it important to put effective rules for trusts in place as we are aware of a number of instances where trusts settled by non-residents are used to invest into New Zealand. The thin capitalisation rules would have applied had those investments been made by a company formed by non-residents. Therefore it is an important base protection measure. Non-residents acting together: trusts 24. The alternative “acting together” test described above does not appear to be convertible to trusts. For example, the rule would be ineffective if it referred to people who provided settlements to a trust and extended debt to a trust in proportion. Unlike companies, trusts have no obligation to provide returns to settlors in proportion to the amount settled. Accordingly, a proportionality rule does not seem to work. 25. We therefore propose that, for trusts, the “acting together” test would remain as described in our original issues paper regardless of how it is defined for companies. In practice, this means if the alternative “acting together” is ultimately adopted, there will be two tests: one that applies to trusts and one that applies to companies. Power to appoint trustee 26. In addition to the above, we are also proposing that a trust be subject to the thin capitalisation rules if a person that is subject to the thin capitalisation rules (i.e. is an entity described in section FA 2) has the power to appoint or remove a trustee of the trust. 27. This is an anti-circumvention measure. It is designed to ensure that the thin capitalisation rules apply if a non-resident takes over effective control of a trust (by being given power to appoint the trustee) that was originally settled by a New Zealand resident. We note that linking a trust and a person with power to appoint a trustee is not a novel concept: they are already treated as associated persons (section YB 11). Worldwide group is New Zealand group for all trusts 28. We propose that the worldwide group of any trust (including a trust settled by a single non- resident) will be the same as the trust’s New Zealand group. In addition, similar to the 4 shareholder debt exclusion for companies, any debt extended by a person associated with the trust (such as the trustees, settlor and beneficiaries of the trust) will be excluded from the trust’s worldwide group debt. 29. Practically, this means a trust will not be constrained in how much debt it can obtain from genuine third-party lenders. However, there will be constraints on how much debt the trust can obtain from its associates – 60% (if the total gearing of the trust is 60% or less) or 10% of its genuine third-party debt. 30. This will also apply to any companies that are controlled by a trust that is subject to the thin capitalisation rules. NZ group is trust and companies owned by trust are excess debt entities 31. We are also considering two more technical changes to ensure these changes to the thin capitalisation rules work as intended. 32. The first is that the New Zealand group of the trust should be only the trust. At present the New Zealand group is the trust and, roughly speaking, all New Zealand entities associated with the trust. This is not appropriate; the trust may not have a controlling interest in those other entities and those entities themselves may not be subject to the thin capitalisation rules. 33. Relatedly, a change will also be made so that an entity owned by a trust that is an excess debt entity will itself be an excess debt entity. Otherwise the rules will not work as intended; the trust will be subject to the thin capitalisation rules but any companies owned by that trust may not be (say, for example, if the trustees of the trust are all residents). Securitisation vehicles 34. Several submitters were concerned about the implications for securitisation vehicles of including more trusts in the thin capitalisation rules. 35. In principle we are not convinced that securitisation vehicles should be completely carved out from the rules. We note that, for banks, securitisation vehicles are generally included in the bank’s New Zealand banking group; securitisation vehicles used by banks are already subject to the banking thin capitalisation rules. Moreover, securitisation vehicles are similar in form, although not intent, to a trust that is fully debt financed by a taxpayer and is used by the taxpayer as a vehicle into which to shift assets (e.g. plant and equipment). 36. Nevertheless, we consider the proposal to define a trust’s worldwide group as its New Zealand group should address some of the concerns submitters raised. If the debt in a securitisation vehicle has come from genuine third parties there will be no restriction on the level of debt in the trust, irrespective of whether the on-lending concession applies. 37. Interest deduction denial will only potentially occur if some of the debt in the securitisation vehicle has come from those associated with the trust – which we believe is a proxy for who are the ultimate economic owners of the trust. We think this is appropriate. Capitalised interest 38. We are considering limiting the capitalised interest restriction proposal to assets that are not carried at fair value. Submitters raised that, for assets carried at fair value, capitalising interest has no real impact because of the ultimate requirement that they be carried at fair value. 39. We also discussed the accounting treatment of assets that are not carried at fair value. Submitters informed us that, even then, the value of these asset can be impaired if the value of the asset falls below its book value. However, this impairment will only occur in certain situations. Moreover, even if the value of an asset should be impaired, the impairment does not 5 have to be recorded if it can be offset against off-balance sheet increases in other assets (such as internally generated goodwill). We are not comfortable with this treatment. Asset uplift 40. Submitters were concerned with the proposal to disallow any increases in the value of internally generated intellectual property (IP) following a company restructure. They stated this was a departure from the general practice in the thin capitalisation rules, which simply follows accounting. 41. We have discussed this issue with submitters. We understand that whether or not the value of goodwill and other internally generated IP can be increased following an internal restructure is an accounting grey area. We also understand that, where this occurs, that the uplift must be justifiable. 42. Nevertheless, we are still concerned about asset uplifts as while potentially rare, it is still possible. The reason goodwill and other internally generated IP cannot generally be recognised in a company’s accounts is because it is notoriously difficult to value. We are not convinced that it is possible to accurately measure the value of such IP, short of selling it to a third party at arm’s length. For this reason, our view is that such increases in asset value not be included as an asset for thin capitalisation purposes. 43. We note that as it is rare such a change should cause little difficulty for taxpayers. Impairments recognised outside of New Zealand 44. We also discussed with some submitters an issue that arose in consultation. That is, if a New Zealand group’s assets decline in value and need to impaired, whether it is possible to recognise that impairment in an offshore company (such as an Australian parent) and not in New Zealand. 45. From our discussions, at this stage we are of the view that this cannot occur. We therefore do not consider the need for any remedial change. However, if we become aware of situations where this has happened we will revisit this decision. 6 Appendix – summary of the original proposals The thin capitalisation rules aim to discourage the excessive debt-funding of New Zealand operations of multinational enterprises by reducing tax deductions for interest in extreme cases. The issues paper was released in response to deficiencies identified in the rules – in particular how they apply to private equity investors, and joint-ventures made by non-residents. The issues paper identified that a key reason for the deficiency was that the rules apply only when a single non-resident controls the New Zealand investment. However, other investors are able to work together in a way that mimics a single controlling investor. In addition, the rules were also seen as ineffective when debt funding for an entire global group comes from the ultimate shareholders, rather than from third parties. The paper proposed that the thin capitalisation rules for inbound investment be widened to apply to investments made by groups of non-residents as long as those investors were acting together, either by explicit agreement or because they were being co-ordinated by some party such as a private equity manager. The primary concern in that situation was the use of related-party debt when overall debt levels were high. To deal with this concern, the issues paper proposed that related-party debt would be excluded from the debt-to-asset ratio of a company’s worldwide group for the purposes of the thin capitalisation calculations. When non-residents’ New Zealand debt levels are high, the worldwide debt-to-asset ratio can be used to justify the high level of debt. Excluding related- party debt from the worldwide ratio would ensure the worldwide debt ratio could be used to justify high debt levels in New Zealand only to the extent it reflected genuinely third-party borrowing by the worldwide group. The issues paper also proposed five other changes to the thin capitalisation rules. These are summarised in the table below. Issue Current rule Proposed rule Foreign controller Must be a single non-resident controller for the rules to apply. Must be a single non-resident controller, or a group of non-residents holding an interest of 50% of or more and acting together. 110% safe harbour Worldwide debt includes all debt of the group. Worldwide debt excludes debt linked to shareholders of group companies. Resident trustee Resident trustee is subject to the rules if the trust is a non-complying trust and more than 50% of settlements are made by a single non-resident. Resident trustee is subject to the rules if more than 50% of settlements on the trust are made by a non-resident, a group of non-residents acting together, or another entity that is subject to the rules. Capitalised interest Capitalised interest is included in assets when the debt-to-asset ratio is calculated. Capitalised interest excluded from assets when a tax deduction has been taken in New Zealand for the interest. Consolidation for outbound groups Individual owner of an outbound group of companies is treated separately from the group. Individual owner’s interests consolidated with those of the outbound group. Asset uplift Some taxpayers are recognising increased asset values as a result of internal sales of assets. Ignore increased asset values as a result of internal sales of assets (exception for internal sales that are part of the sale of an entire worldwide group).
