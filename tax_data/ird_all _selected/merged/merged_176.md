Background to Interpretation Statement IS 10/07 This Interpretation Statement is the successor of two exposure drafts: • INS0072: “Interpretation of Sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Care and Management of Taxes” (December 2005). • INS0072: "Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts" - Section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (August 2008). Both exposure drafts were released for consultation. After taking account of the submissions and further consideration, the second exposure draft has been revised and is published as this Statement. The principles and conclusions contained in this Statement are essentially the same as those contained in the second exposure draft. The following are the significant differences between the Statement and the second exposure draft: • The Statement more extensively discusses the relationship between section 6A and the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts and, in particular, what the Commissioner can and cannot do under section 6A. • The Statement contains new paragraphs discussing the three factors in section 6A(3), and clarifies the weight each factor is to be given. • The Statement’s discussion on settlements and agreements states the Commissioner’s position on settlements in multi-party tax disputes, and notes the effect of the Protocol between the Commissioner and the Solicitor General. • The answers given to several examples in the Statement have been extensively revised and, in some cases, a different conclusion reached. This was done so as to identify more clearly the weight that the Commissioner would give particular factors on the facts, and to specifically address matters raised in the submissions. The examples have also been reordered and given new headings. As was proposed in the second exposure draft, two examples have been deleted. A new example 6 has been inserted to deal with the relationship between section 6A and the Commissioner’s binding rulings function. 1 Interpretation Statement IS 10/07 “CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE TAXES COVERED BY THE INLAND REVENUE ACTS” – Section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Introduction 1. A reality of modern tax administration is that the Commissioner must operate the tax system with limited resources. This means that the Commissioner cannot always collect every last dollar of tax owing in every case. As a result, the Commissioner must decide how to best use his resources to maximise the taxes collected and to foster the integrity and effective functioning of the tax system. The Commissioner’s resource allocation and management decisions can affect the integrity of the tax system, including taxpayer perceptions of that integrity. In particular, what may be seen by one taxpayer as flexibility that achieves a practical and sensible outcome could be seen as inconsistency or favouritism by other taxpayers. 2. Before section 6A(2) and (3) were enacted, the Inland Revenue Acts arguably obligated the Commissioner to collect all taxes owing, regardless of the costs and resources involved. According to this view, the Commissioner could decide not to collect taxes owing only if a specific statutory discretion or power authorised him to do so. The possibility that the Commissioner was required to collect all taxes owing (subject only to the specific relief and remission provisions) was problematic, because it: • was an unrealistic obligation given the Commissioner’s limited resources; and • sat uncomfortably with the appropriation and financial accountability requirements under the Public Finance Act 1989 and State Sector Act 1988. 3. As a result, section 6A(2) and (3) were enacted to make clear that the Commissioner is not required to collect all taxes owing. Section 6A(2) provides that the Commissioner is “charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts”. Section 6A(3) provides that the Commissioner has the duty to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. Section 6A(2) and (3) legislatively recognise that the Commissioner exercises managerial discretion as to the allocation and management of his resources. 4. Section 6 was enacted at the same time as section 6A(2) and (3). Section 6 requires the Commissioner, at all times, to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. Section 6A(2) and (3), along with section 6, provide guidance on the exercise of the managerial discretion and ensure the integrity of the tax system is protected. 5. This Interpretation Statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on his “care and management” responsibility in section 6A(2) and his duty in section 6A(3). In the course of doing so, it clarifies the relationship between section 6A (2) and (3) and the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts, including section 6. Factual 2 examples illustrate the principles set out in this Statement: see paragraphs 172– 237 below. Summary 6. The following paragraphs summarise the principles set out in this Statement on: • the “care and management” responsibility under section 6A(2); • the specific duty under section 6A(3); and • the relationship between section 6A(2) and (3) and section 6. Section 6A(2) 7. Section 6A(2) provides that the Commissioner is “charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts”. In doing so, section 6A(2) imposes two interrelated responsibilities on the Commissioner. 8. First, the Commissioner is charged with the "care" of the taxes. This means the Commissioner is responsible for promoting the integrity and effective functioning of the tax system. To discharge this responsibility, the Commissioner must seek to foster the tax system’s capacity to function effectively in light of economic, commercial, technological and other changes. 9. Second, the Commissioner is charged with the "management" of the taxes. This means he is responsible for making managerial decisions in the interests of bringing about the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. The “management” responsibility recognises that the Commissioner makes decisions about the allocation and management of his limited resources. This involves the Commissioner exercising judgement as to the resources he allocates, over time, across the various parts of Inland Revenue and to dealing with particular taxpayers. The “management” responsibility also recognises that the Commissioner often exercises judgement as to how he carries out his functions. 10. Section 6A(2) and (3) were enacted together (along with section 6) to provide the framework within which the Commissioner administers the tax system. Section 6A(3) applies “\[i\]n collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge”. The collecting of taxes is an aspect of the Commissioner’s “management” responsibility. Section 6A(3) clarifies the Commissioner’s overall objective in carrying out his functions in administering the tax system. 11. Section 6A(2) and (3) make clear that the Commissioner is not required to collect all taxes owing regardless of the costs and resources involved. Instead the Commissioner has the duty to maximise the net revenue collected over time. Accordingly, section 6A(2) and (3) may authorise the Commissioner to act inconsistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts only to the extent that they otherwise require him to collect the full amount of tax. Section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow the Commissioner to act inconsistently with any other legislative and constitutional constraints and obligations. Some important implications of this are that the Commissioner cannot: • disregard the requireme nts for the lawful exercise of powers and discretions conferred by other provisions; • alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements; 3 • issue extra-statutory concessions; • administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies; • interpret provisions other than in accordance with statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions; or • act inconsistently with his obligation under section 6 to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. 12. As with the Commissioner’s other powers and discretions, it is for the Commissioner to prescribe which officers have the delegated authority to make decisions pursuant to section 6A(2) and (3). In addition, the Commissioner may, from time-to-time, issue guidelines that set out how Inland Revenue officers are to act under section 6A(2) and (3). Section 6A(3) 13. Section 6A(3) imposes on the Commissioner the duty to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. 14. The Commissioner must discharge the section 6A(3) duty when “collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge”. The word “collecting” could be interpreted narrowly to mean that section 6A(3) only applies after the taxes have been assessed and when the Commissioner seeks to recover those taxes. However, the Commissioner interprets the word “collecting” more broadly. The word refers to the actions the Commissioner takes, before and after the taxes have been assessed, to carry out his functions in administering the tax system. 15. Section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to maximise the net revenue he collects “over time”. The words “over time” require the Commissioner to balance the short and long term implications of the available means of administering the tax system or dealing with particular taxpayers. These words mean that the Commissioner may adopt courses of action that have the effect of forgoing the collection of the highest net revenue: • in the short term, if he considers that this will enable the collection of more net revenue in the longer term; and • from particular taxpayers, if he considers that this will enable more net revenue to be collected from all taxpayers. 16. In addition, section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to have regard to three factors when deciding on which course of action to take. These factors are: • the resources available to the Commissioner; • the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and • the compliance costs incurred by the taxpayers. Section 6A(3) does not prescribe the weight to be given to each factor. The weight to be given each factor depends on the circumstances of the particular case. 4 17. The words “within the law” and “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” affect what courses of action the Commissioner can undertake to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable”. The words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” mean that the Commissioner can carry out the course of action that he considers will “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable” even if it results in less tax being collected than is imposed, or required to be collected, by another provision. The words “within the law” mean that the Commissioner must act consistently with the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. 18. Section 6A(3) is not overridden by a later enacted provision unless Parliament specifically intended the later provision to do so. Section 6 19. Section 6(1) requires the Commissioner, at all times, to use best endeavours to protect the “integrity of the tax system”. Section 6 applies to all of the Commissioner’s functions in administering the tax system. The term “integrity of the tax system” is defined non-exhaustively in section 6(2). 20. Section 6 is not inconsistent with section 6A(2) and (3), because it does not require the Commissioner to collect all taxes regardless of the costs and resources involved. Therefore the Commissioner must comply with section 6 when acting under section 6A(2) and (3). This means that when deciding how he will act under section 6A(2) and (3), the Commissioner must consider, and take into account, the extent to which the available courses of action might undermine, or support, the integrity of the tax system. Legislation 21. Sections 6 and 6A provide: 6 Responsibility on Ministers and officials to protect integrity of tax system (1) Every Minister and every officer of any government agency having responsibilities under this Act or any other Act in relation to the collection of taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts are at all times to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. (2) Without limiting its meaning, the integrity of the tax system includes— (a) Taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; and (b) The rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law; and (c) The rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; and (d) The responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; and (e) The responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and (f) The responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. 6A Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1) The person appointed as chief executive of the Department under the State Sector Act 1988 is designated the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 5 (2) The Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts and with such other functions as may be conferred on the Commissioner. (3) In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner's charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to— (a) The resources available to the Commissioner; and (b) The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) The compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. Legislative History 22. By way of background, the legislative history of section 6A and section 6 will be outlined. This includes discussing two reports that lead to the enactment of section 6A and section 6: • First Report of the Working Party on the Re-organisation of the Income Tax Act 1976, July 1993, Wellington (“the Valabh report”); and • Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance), April 1994, Wellington (“the ORC report”). The courts have treated these reports as relevant legislative history when considering section 6A and section 6: Westpac Banking Corp v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 24 (SC); Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,027 (CA); Fairbrother v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,548 (HC); Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,366 (CA). Paragraphs 35–41 below also note the origins of section 6A in the United Kingdom legislation and case law. Valabh report (1993) 23. In June 1993 the Valabh Committee was asked to (Valabh report, page 1): Report to the Minister of Revenue on the appropriate statutory independence of the position of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and its relationship with the role of the Minister in specifying priorities in, and the nature of, tax administration and enforcement given the Commissioner's accountabilities and responsibilities under the Public Finance Act and the State Sector Act. 24. In its report, the Valabh Committee noted that the Income Tax Act imposed the obligation to pay income tax, and that the Commissioner's statutory functions were directed to the quantification of that liability. It considered that in its “extreme form” the law obliged the Commissioner to “assess and recover all taxes which are due” (Valabh report, page 6). The Committee considered this was an unrealistic obligation that did not match the practice of the Department. Moreover, any such obligation sat uncomfortably with the appropriation and financial accountability requirements of the State Sector Act 1988 and the Public Finance Act 1989. These required departments to focus on the “efficient, effective and economic production of their outputs, the funding for which is appropriated by Parliament” (Valabh report, page 14). The Commissioner was required to act consistently with both enactments. 25. Consequently the Valabh Committee recommended that there should be "legislative recognition of managerial discretion to determine priorities and enter 6 into sensible settlements". It considered that the United Kingdom care and management provision provided “a useful model". This recommendation was accompanied by a note of caution (Valabh report, page 8): Such a change in the legislation would have to be presented and implemented with due care. It would be important to emphasise for instance that the taxes are committed to the Commissioner's charge. Taxpayers may try to take advantage of an apparently increased discretion, and there could be some prospect of greater variability in decisions. Taxpayers are above all entitled to decisions which are correct and consistent. As well, there is always scope for abuse in the administration of the tax system. ... It is important that the professionalism and impartiality of those charged with administering the tax system is not called into question. This could happen if the discretion were extended beyond the limited scope suggested by the Working Party and if the administrative arrangements do not involve adequate guidelines and other safeguards. 26. After the publication of the Valabh report, members of the Court of Appeal in Brierley Investments Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,212 (CA) differed as to whether the Commissioner had “care and management” responsibilities similar to those imposed by the United Kingdom legislation. 27. In Brierley Investments, Richardson J considered that under the tax legislation at that time the Commissioner was obliged to assess and collect all taxes. His Honour held that the income tax legislation proceeded on the “premise” that it was in the interests of the community that the Commissioner ensured that the income of every taxpayer is assessed and the tax paid. The Commissioner could not contract out of those obligations (at page 10,217): Certainly there is nothing in the New Zealand legislation to justify the conclusion that the Commissioner may elect not to assess taxpayers or may elect to charge them with less tax than throughout the assessment and re-assessment period the Commissioner considers due. 28. Richardson J held that this “premise” of the New Zealand legislation meant that, unlike under the United Kingdom legislation, there was “no scope for weighing and balancing management functions against collection responsibilities in respect of particular taxpayers” (at page 10,219). His Honour recognised that in reality limited resources would affect “the nature and the extent of the investigation undertaken to quantify the statutorily imposed liability for tax and the efforts made to pursue recovery” (at page 10,215). 29. Casey J took the opposite view to Richardson J. Casey J considered that the United Kingdom “care and management” jurisprudence was relevant to New Zealand. This was because his Honour could (at page 10,225): ... see no essential distinction between \[the Commissioner’s\] obligations and those of the United Kingdom Commissioners who are charged with the “care management and collection” of tax. Administering revenue acts must require similar duties and administrative discretions in each country in the assessment and collection of tax, calling for the exercise of similar standards of fairness. Casey J accepted that the Commissioner did not have any “dispensing power”, and that it could not be an abuse of power for the Commissioner to collect taxes due. His Honour considered, however, that the duty to collect taxes could not be isolated from the Commissioner’s functions of administering and managing the tax system. Organisational Review Committee report (1994) 30. In light of the recommendations of the Valabh Committee, the Organisational Review Committee (chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson) was set up to investigate the optimal organisational arrangements for the tax system. In its 1994 report, the 7 Organisational Review Committee reviewed and made recommendations about the tax administration structure. 31. Relevant to this Statement is the Organisational Review Committee’s observations on the Commissioner’s obligation to collect taxes. The Committee stated (ORC report, sections 7.2.2 and 8.2): IRD’s legislative objective is not achievable (refer Section 8, Objective of tax administration) An interpretation of the legislation is that IRD is required by the Inland Revenue Department Act to ‘administer’ the Act and, amongst other things, to collect ‘all’ the tax. For many practical reasons, this objective is impossible to achieve. But there is a clear general expectation that IRD will collect the most revenue that it can within certain limitations. Other factors affecting the ability to meet requirements under \[the\] legislation are also relevant such as the exercise of good management, and the need for trade-offs between factors such as compliance costs and information requirements. ... ... The Review Committee agrees with the view of the Valabh Committee that this is not a realistic objective. Clearly, the Commissioner, like other chief executives, is subject to resource constraints imposed by Parliament. So the Commissioner cannot be expected to collect all taxes. The objective of the tax administration function of IRD therefore should be changed to match these current needs and situation. 32. The Committee agreed with the Valabh Committee’s recommendation that there should be legislative recognition of the Commissioner’s managerial discretion (ORC report, section 9.4.2): It is not possible for the Chief Executive of IRD, operating within limited resources, to ensure that every cent of due taxes is collected. Explicit recognition of the management of limited resources in the efficient and effective collection of taxes is required. 33. The Committee considered that the Commissioner’s responsibility for the “management of limited resources in the efficient and effective collection of taxes” was encapsulated by the term “care and management”. It defined this term as (ORC report, Glossary and Commonly Used Abbreviations, page 81): Managerial discretion as to the use of independent statutory powers in a cost effective manner. The Committee recognised that the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 (now repealed) would need to be amended to recognise any “care and management” responsibility. It considered that it was uncertain whether section 4 of the 1974 Act, which provided that the Commissioner was charged with the “administration” of the Inland Revenue Acts, “implies that care and management of limited resources overrides the more specific tasks and duties of the Commissioner defined in the Inland Revenue Acts” (ORC report, Appendix D, pages 24-25). 34. Consequently, the Committee recommended its draft section 4 of the Inland Revenue Act 1976 be enacted. It considered that draft section 4 recognised the Commissioner’s managerial discretion and, at the same time, subjected this discretion to safeguards and guidance. The relevant parts of the draft section 4 were: (1) Every Minister and Officer of any Department having responsibilities under this Act or any other Act in relation to the collection of taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts will at all times use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. (2) Without limiting the meaning of “the integrity of the tax system” it reflects: 8 (i) taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; (ii) the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to law; (iii) the rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; (iv) the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; (v) the responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and (vi) the responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially and according to law. ... . (4) The Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts and with such other functions as may be conferred on the Commissioner. (5) In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts the Commissioner will collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to: (i) the resources available to the Commissioner; (ii) the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (iii) the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. ... . (9) For the purposes of this section “tax” includes any revenue or entitlements covered by the Inland Revenue Acts and “taxpayers” and “taxes” shall be construed accordingly. These parts of the draft section 4 are almost identical to section 6 and section 6A(2) and (3). United Kingdom legislation and case law 35. Both the Valabh Committee and Organisational Review Committee referred to the United Kingdom “care and management” provision. At that time this provision was contained in section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970: 1(1) Income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax shall be under the care and management of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (in this Act referred to as “the Board”), and the definition of “inland revenue” in section 39 of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890 shall have effect accordingly. 36. Section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 was repealed and replaced with section 5 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005. Section 5(1) uses the term “collection and management of revenue”, which section 51(3) provides has the same meaning as “care and management”. 37. The House of Lords considered section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 in Inland Revenue Commissioners v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd \[1981\] 2 All ER 93 (“Fleet Street Casuals case”). In this decision, casual workers in the printing industry had “engaged in a process of depriving the Inland Revenue of tax due on their casual earnings”. The casual workers had falsified their identities and addresses when collecting their pay, so that the Inland Revenue could not assess and collect tax due from them. 9 38. To end this revenue loss, the United Kingdom Revenue entered an arrangement with the casual workers, the Union and the employers. By the terms of this arrangement: • the casual workers would register with the Revenue in respect of their employment in order for future tax to be deducted at source or otherwise assessed, and to co-operate with the Revenue in settling their taxes for the previous two year period; and • the Revenue agreed not to investigate tax liability of these casual workers in years before the past two years. 39. The respondent sought a writ of mandamus to compel the United Kingdom Revenue to act contrary to this arrangement by discharging their statutory duty to assess and collect all taxes owed by the casual workers. In considering the application, the House of Lords held in Fleet Street Casuals that the Revenue had a “wide managerial discretion” under section 1(1) of the Taxes Management Act 1970. Lord Diplock stated that this discretion was inherent in the phrase “care and management” (at page 101): ... the Board are charged by statute with the care, management and collection on behalf of the Crown of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. In the exercise of these functions the board have a wide managerial discretion as to the best means of obtaining for the national exchequer from the taxes committed to their charge the highest net return that is practicable having regard to the staff available to them and the cost of collection. It is worth observing that section 6A(3) is very similar to the duty Lord Diplock stated was imposed by section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. 40. Their Lordships held that the arrangement was within the managerial discretion conferred by section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. Without the arrangement, attempting to collect the taxes from the casual workers would have been unlikely to produce any substantial sums of money (at pages 99-100 per Lord Wilberforce; at page 101 per Lord Diplock). Moreover, the arrangement was likely to lead to a greater collection of revenue, because it brought the casual workers into the taxation system and so enabled their future income to be taxed. As Lord Roskill stated (at page 121): To my mind it is clear beyond argument ... that what was done was a matter of taxes management, and I can see no shadow of dereliction of duty by the \[Revenue\], or any suggestion of improper or unlawful conduct on their part. On the contrary, what they did seems to me to have been a matter of administrative common sense. Instead of wasting public time and money in seeking to collect taxes from persons whose names were unknown and whose ability to pay was therefore equally unknown, they made an arrangement which enabled taxes not hitherto able to be collected or in fact collected, collectable in the future at a cost to the general body of taxpayers of foregoing the collection of that which in reality could never have been collected. 41. Having considered the background to section 6 and section 6A, the rest of this Statement analyses the “care and management” responsibility, and its relationship with section 6A(3) and the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts, including section 6. 10 "Care and management" Two interrelated responsibilities 42. Section 6A(2) provides: The Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts and with such other functions as may be conferred on the Commissioner. 43. Section 6A(2) provides that the Commissioner has two core responsibilities: the "care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts" and "such other functions as may be conferred". This Statement is concerned only with the “care and management” responsibility. 44. The phrase "care and management" is not defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the courts have not given it detailed consideration. The Commissioner considers that the phrase "care and management" means that he has two interrelated responsibilities. 45. The Commissioner is charged with the "care" of the taxes. This means that the Commissioner is responsible for promoting the integrity and effective functioning of the tax system. To discharge this responsibility, the Commissioner must seek to foster the tax system’s capacity to function effectively in light of economic, commercial, technological and other changes. In the context of the current tax system, the promotion of the voluntary compliance system by the Commissioner is consistent with his “care” responsibility. 46. The Commissioner is also charged with the "management" of the taxes. This means he is responsible for making managerial decisions in the interests of bringing about the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. The “management” responsibility also recognises that the Commissioner often exercises judgement about how he carries out his functions and deals with particular taxpayers. The need to exercise judgement arises, for instance, where the Inland Revenue Acts provide the Commissioner with alternative courses of action. For example: • It is left to the Commissioner to design the audit strategy whereby the taxpayers that will be audited are selected. • The Inland Revenue Acts provide the Commissioner with information gathering powers and specify the requirements for the lawful exercise of these powers. The Commissioner exercises judgement as to when he will exercise these powers. • The Inland Revenue Acts may permit the Commissioner to enter into an instalment arrangement, or to institute enforcement proceedings, in order to recover outstanding tax from a particular taxpayer. The Commissioner exercises judgement as to which of the alternative courses of action he will adopt. 47. The “management” responsibility also recognises that the Commissioner makes decisions about the allocation and management of his resources. The Commissioner has limited resources within which to carry out his functions, and this means there will be competing demands on those resources. The Commissioner must reconcile those competing demands. This involves him exercising judgement about the relative resources he allocates, over a period of 11 time, across the various parts of Inland Revenue, and with respect to dealing with particular taxpayers. 48. This analysis of the “care and management” responsibility is consistent with the House of Lords’ decision in Fleet Street Casuals and the legislative history of section 6A(2). 49. In the Fleet Street Casuals case, the House of Lords held that the United Kingdom "care and management" provision conferred on the Inland Revenue Commissioners managerial discretion as to the "best means" of collecting the taxes. Lord Diplock stated (at page 101): ... the Board are charged by statute with the care, management and collection on behalf of the Crown of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. In the exercise of these functions the board have a wide managerial discretion as to the best means of obtaining for the Exchequer from the taxes committed to their charge the highest net return that is practical having regard to the staff available to them and the cost of collection. 50. Similarly, Lord Roskill stated (at page 121) that the Commissioners were entitled to exhibit “administrative common sense” and to make “sensible arrangement\[s\] in the overall performance of their statutory duties in connection with taxes management”. Finally, Lord Scarman stated that the legislation placed income tax under the Commissioners' care and management and, for that purpose, conferred on them "very considerable discretion in the exercise of their powers", and that (at page 111): In the daily discharge of their duties inspectors are constantly required to balance the duty to collect "every part" of tax due against the duty of good management. This conflict of duties can be resolved only by good managerial decisions, some of which would inevitably mean that not all the tax known to be due will be collected. 51. In light of the Fleet Street Casuals case, the Organisational Review Committee defined the phrase "care and management" for the purposes of its report as (ORC report, Glossary and Commonly Used Abbreviations, page 81): Managerial discretion as to the use of independent statutory powers in a cost effective manner. 52. The reference in this definition to the use of independent statutory powers in a "cost effective manner" reflects the main objective intended to be achieved by enacting section 6A(2). The Organisational Review Committee considered that enacting a "care and management" provision would remove (ORC report, Appendix D, Roles of the Commissioner and Chief Executive of IRD, paragraph 36): ... some doubt ... as to the extent to which the present wording of section 4 of the Inland Revenue Department Act, charging the Commissioner with ‘administration’ of the Inland Revenue Department Act implies that care and management of limited resources overrides the more specific tasks and duties of the Commissioner defined in the Inland Revenue Acts. 53. In contrast, the Committee considered that the phrase "care and management" explicitly recognised the Commissioner’s "management of limited resources in the efficient and effective collection of taxes" and his “administrative discretion in the application of finite resources to the collection of taxes” (ORC report, sections 9.4.2 and 9.5.1, and Appendix D, paragraphs 35 and 37). As the ORC report suggests, the Committee considered that a “care and management” provision would legislatively recognise the Commissioner’s need to make decisions concerning the discharge of his functions and how he would deal with particular taxpayers. This is made clear elsewhere in the ORC report (ORC report, Appendix D, paragraph 36): 12 Consistent with good management practice, care and management of limited resources should be applied by the \[Commissioner\] across the full range of functions of tax administration, including functions which are subject to the convention of managerial independence and the statutory independence of the Commissioner in administering the Revenue Acts. Relationship between section 6A(2) and (3) 54. Until now, the focus has been on the meaning of the words “care and management” in section 6A(2). The next issue is the relationship between section 6A(2) and (3). 55. Section 6A(3) provides: In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner's charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to— (a) The resources available to the Commissioner; and (b) The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) The compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 56. Section 6A(2) and (3) are considered together because section 6A(3) provides legislative guidance for the exercise of the “management” responsibility. Section 6A(3) applies “\[i\]n collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge”. The collecting of taxes is part of the “management” responsibility in section 6A(2). As will be discussed, section 6A(3) clarifies the Commissioner’s overall objective in carrying out his functions in administering the tax system: see paragraphs 95–103 below. This position is supported by the legislative history to section 6A(2) and (3). These provisions were enacted together (along with section 6) as a “legislative package” to provide the framework within which the Commissioner administers the tax system. 57. Further, as already noted, section 6A(3) is almost identical to the duty that Lord Diplock in Fleet Street Casuals identified as imposed by the United Kingdom “care and management” provision. In Fairbrother v CIR, Young J noted (at paragraphs 21 and 26) that this similarity was “not a coincidence”. His Honour held that “\[section\] 6A must be regarded as statutory ratification of the approach adopted by the House of Lords in Fleet Street Casuals”. 58. Section 6A(3) is more extensively analysed later in paragraphs 90-135. Relationship with the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts 59. An issue arises about the extent to which section 6A(2) and (3) authorise the Commissioner to act inconsistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts (including section 6). 60. One possible interpretation of the words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” in section 6A(3) is that section 6A(2) and (3) override all other provisions. Under this interpretation, the Commissioner could act inconsistently with any provision if he considers this would maximise the net revenue collected. It is acknowledged that passages in several High Court decisions appear to support this interpretation: see Fairbrother v CIR, at paragraph 26; Raynel v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583, at paragraph 49; Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,758 (HC), at paragraph 71. However, the Commissioner considers 13 that this interpretation is incorrect, because Parliament did not intend section 6A(2) and (3) to override all other provisions. 61. In the Commissioner’s view, the better interpretation is that section 6A(2) and (3) allow him to act inconsistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts only to the extent that they can be seen to obligate him to “collect all taxes that are due regardless of the resources and costs involved” (Fairbrother v CIR (2000), at paragraph 27). This reflects Parliament’s purpose in enacting section 6A(2) and (3). Before these provisions were enacted, the tax legislation at the time arguably required the Commissioner to seek to collect all taxes owing (subject only to the specific relief and remission provisions). Section 6A(2) and (3) were enacted to make clear that the Commissioner was under no such obligation, and that instead he has the duty of maximising the net revenue collected over time. 62. It might be noted that interpreting section 6A(2) and (3) as overriding all other provisions would seem to effectively alter the constitutional framework within which the tax system operates. Instead of administering the legislation as enacted by Parliament, the Commissioner would have an overarching discretion whether to give effect to it. Such an interpretation would seem to permit the Commissioner to maximise the net revenue collected by (for instance): • disregarding legislative requirements or limitations imposed on him by Parliament (eg, by amending assessments to increase the assessed tax liability despite the four-year time limit having been exceeded); or • altering the statutory assessment basis by advising taxpayers to assess themselves other than in accordance with the legislation. 63. The Commissioner considers that Parliament did not intend section 6A(2) and (3) to alter the constitutional framework within which the tax system operates. This is supported by section 6A(3) requiring the Commissioner to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law” (emphasis added). The words “within the law” indicate that Parliament intended to legally constrain the Commissioner’s ability to maximise the net revenue collected: they require him to act consistently with the specific constraints and obligations imposed on him by other provisions. 64. This interpretation is supported by Kemp v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,110. In that decision, the High Court held that the Commissioner could not disregard section 414A(5) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 414A(5) required the Commissioner to obtain ministerial approval before remitting more than $50,000 tax. Robertson J held that section 6A(2) and (3) did not confer a “general dispensing power” on the Commissioner (at page 15,117): I accept the argument of the Commissioner that even if a general power to enter into settlements with taxpayers exists, it would not override the specific requirements laid down by Parliament for the exercise of powers of remission in Part XVI of the IT Act. If this were the case, it would be possible for the Commissioner to avoid the limitations on his discretionary power merely by omitting to take one of the steps specified in sections such as s 414A and then claiming recourse to a general power. To allow such an unbridled discretion can not have been the intention of Parliament. I agree with the Commissioner that this would allow through a “back door” that which does not meet the explicit statutory requirements. Therefore the Commissioner was required to comply with section 414A(5) and, in this case, had acted unlawfully in failing to do so. 14 Implications of conclusions on the relationship between section 6A(2) and (3) and the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts 65. Paragraphs 66-86 below discuss some of the important implications of the Commissioner’s conclusions on the extent to which section 6A(2) and (3) authorise him to act inconsistently with the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. This discussion is intended to assist in clarifying what the Commissioner can and cannot do under section 6A(2) and (3). The important implications discussed are that section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to: • disregard the requirements for the lawful exercise of powers and discretions conferred by other provisions; • alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements; • issue extra-statutory concessions; • administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies; or • interpret provisions other than in accordance with statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions. The relationship between section 6A(2) and (3) and section 6 is another important issue, and this is discussed later in paragraphs 136-150. Commissioner cannot disregard the requirements for the lawful exercise of the powers and discretions conferred by other provisions. 66. It follows from the Commissioner’s conclusions that section 6A(2) and (3) do not affect the requirements for the lawful exercise of the powers and discretions conferred on him by other provisions. If the requirements for the lawful exercise of a particular power or discretion are not satisfied, section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to exercise that power or discretion nevertheless. Similarly section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow the Commissioner to disregard explicit legislative directions or prohibitions on how he must or must not act. Accordingly, section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow the Commissioner to (for example): • exercise search and seizure powers, or to retain seized property, other than in accordance with the provisions governing the exercise of these powers (Singh v CIR (1999) NZTC 15,050); • recover outstanding tax inconsistently with section 176(2)(b), which prohibits the recovery of outstanding tax to the extent it would place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in “serious hardship” (W v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,602, at paragraph 24); or • write-off outstanding tax inconsistently with section 177C(3), which prohibits the writing-off of outstanding tax in certain circumstances (Raynel v CIR, at paragraph 61; Clarke & Money v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,165, at paragraph 25; Rogerson v CIR (2 005) 22 NZTC 19,260, at paragraph 51). 67. In the same way, section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow the Commissioner to carry out courses of action that are unlawful under another enactment or rule of law. For instance, section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to decide 15 not to respond to information requests within the period required by the Official Information Act 1982. 68. Further, section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to carry out actions that he does not have the power to do. For instance, if the Commissioner were prevented from writing off tax under section 177C (which provides the Commissioner with discretion to write off outstanding tax) or any other provision, the Commissioner could not write off that tax under section 6A(2) and (3). However, the Commissioner could decide not to allocate the resources required to collect outstanding tax from a particular taxpayer. This would involve the exercise of the managerial discretion as to the allocation and management of resources. If the Commissioner were to make such a decision, he would not be writing-off the outstanding tax but rather only deciding not to take the steps required to collect the tax. The taxpayer’s liability to pay that tax would remain despite the Commissioner’s resource decision. Commissioner cannot alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements 69. Another implication of the Commissioner’s conclusions is that section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow him to alter taxpayers’ legislative obligations and entitlements. The Commissioner can alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements only if authorised by another provision. For example, section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to: • collect more tax than imposed by the legislation; • amend taxpayers’ assessments other than in accordance with the statutory assessment basis (Vestey v IRC \[1979\] 3 All ER 976); • contract with taxpayers as to their tax liability in future years (Ali Fayed v IR Commrs \[2006\] BTC 70); and • grant legislative entitlements to taxpayers who are not eligible under the legislation (R (on the application of Wilkinson) v IRC \[2005\] UKHL 30). 70. Similarly, the Commissioner cannot advise taxpayers that they are not required to comply with their tax obligations. The Commissioner could not, for instance, direct taxpayers to assess themselves other than in accordance with the statutory assessment basis. Taxpayers’ obligations are imposed on taxpayers by the legislation itself, and the tax liability is payable independently of its assessment: CIR v Lemmington Holdings (1982) 5 NZTC 61,268 (CA); Reckitt and Colman (New Zealand) Ltd v Taxation Board of Review \[1966\] NZLR 1032; Westpac Banking Corp v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,340. This is made clear by section 15B of the Tax Administration Act 1994: 15B Taxpayer’s tax obligations A taxpayer must do the following: (aa) If required under a tax law, make an assessment: (a) Unless the taxpayer is a non-filing taxpayer, correctly determine the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer under the tax laws: (b) Deduct or withhold the correct amounts of tax from payments or receipts of the taxpayer when required to do so by the tax laws: (c) Pay tax on time: 16 (d) Keep all necessary information (including books and records) and maintain all necessary accounts or balances required under the tax laws: (e) Disclose to the Commissioner in a timely and useful way all information (including books and records) that the tax laws require the taxpayer to disclose: (f) To the extent required by the Inland Revenue Acts, co-operate with the Commissioner in a way that assists the exercise of the Commissioner's powers under the tax laws: (g) Comply with all the other obligations imposed on the taxpayer by the tax laws. (h) If a natural person to whom section 80C applies, inform the Commissioner that the person has not received an income statement for a tax year, if the income statement is not received by the date prescribed by section 80C(2) or (3): (i) If the taxpayer is a natural person, correctly respond to any income statement issued to the taxpayer. 71. It follows that if the Commissioner were to inform taxpayers that they are not required to comply with their tax obligations, he would be purporting to suspend the operation of the Inland Revenue Acts. This would be inconsistent with Article 1 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (Imp), which declares illegal the “suspending of laws ... by Regall Authority without consent of Parlyment”. Given the Commissioner is an officer of the Crown and collects the tax as the statutory agent of the Crown (Cates v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,237 (CA)), such a statement would arguably imply that “what was being done was lawful and had legal effect” (Fitzgerald v Muldoon \[1976\] 2 NZLR 615). 72. While the Commissioner cannot purport to alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements, section 6A(2) and (3) do authorise him to decide not to allocate the resources required to collect the full amount of taxes imposed by another provision. If the Commissioner were to make such a decision, with the result that not all taxes are collected, he is not dispensing with the provisions imposing the tax liability. The Commissioner’s resource allocation and management decisions are administrative acts that do not affect the underlying tax liability. Taxpayers are obliged to pay the full amount of tax imposed regardless of whether the Commissioner decides to allocate resources to collect it. Extra-statutory concessions 73. It has been occasionally suggested that section 6A(2) and (3) authorise the Commissioner to issue what are sometimes called extra-statutory concessions. In the United Kingdom, HM Revenue & Customs has issued extra-statutory concessions since at least 1947. It defines “extra-statutory concession” as (“Extra-Statutory Concessions – ex-Inland Revenue” (Concessions as at 31 August 2005), at page 2 available at: HM Revenue & Customs website http://www.hmrc.gov.uk ): ... a relaxation which gives taxpayers a reduction in tax liability to which they would not be entitled under the strict letter of the law. Most concessions are made to deal with what are, on the whole, minor or transitory anomalies under the legislation and to meet cases of hardship at the margins of the code where a statutory remedy would be difficult to devise or would run to a length out of proportion to the intrinsic importance of the matter. This definition indicates that extra-statutory concessions reduce the tax liability otherwise imposed by the legislation, and in this sense they purport to alter taxpayers’ legal obligations and entitlements. 74. As was discussed earlier in paragraphs 69-72, section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow the Commissioner to alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements. Therefore it follows that section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the issuing of extra-statutory 17 concessions. This position is supported by the fact that, despite the well- established practice in the United Kingdom, neither the Valabh report nor the ORC report suggests that it was intended that any New Zealand “care and management” provision would authorise the issuing of extra-statutory concessions. 75. As an aside, it is noted that HM Revenue & Customs considers that the House of Lords’ decision in R (on the application of Wilkinson) v IRC (discussed in paragraphs 83–84 below) indicates that its ability to issue extra-statutory concessions is more limited than previously considered: Finance Bill 2008, Clause 154, Explanatory Note, paragraphs 12–13. As a consequence, section 160 of the Finance Act 2008 (UK) was enacted to enable extra-statutory concessions issued before 2008 to be given statutory effect. Section 160(1) provides that “\[t\]he Treasury may by order make provision for and in connection with giving effect to any existing HMRC concession.” Commissioner cannot administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies 76. The Commissioner’s conclusions also mean that section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise him to administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies. Similarly these provisions do not authorise the Commissioner to avoid or reduce the undesirable effects of legislative obligations imposed on taxpayers or the Commissioner. Legislative errors and deficiencies can be remedied only by Parliament. 77. The House of Lords has taken a similar position with respect to the United Kingdom “care and management” provision. 78. In Vestey v IRC the House of Lords considered section 142 of the Income Tax Act 1952 (UK). As interpreted by earlier courts, section 142 made each beneficiary fully liable for the tax on the total income of the trust. This meant that section 142 imposed double taxation where multiple beneficiaries derived income from a discretionary trust, because it did not provide any means of apportioning the total tax liability amongst the beneficiaries. It was unlikely that the United Kingdom Parliament intended this result. To remedy this apparent legislative deficiency, the United Kingdom Commissioners adopted a policy whereby the total tax liability was apportioned between the beneficiaries. 79. The House of Lords held that the Commissioners had no authority to adopt this policy. The policy “involved ... not one of construction, even one of strained construction, \[of the legislation\] but ... one of rewriting the enactment” (per Lord Wilberforce, at page 983). Although the House of Lords acknowledged that the policy was intended to “mitigate the gross injustice” of the provision, the Commissioners had no authority to act contrary to the provision because it was mandatory (per Viscount Dilhorne, at page 994). No other provision in the tax legislation provided any “statutory support” for the policy adopted by the Commissioners (per Lord Edmund-Davies, at page 1002). 80. Lord Wilberforce identified “fundamental objections” to this policy. The discretion claimed by the Commissioners was inconsistent with Parliamentary sovereignty and with the constitutional maxim that Parliament alone imposes taxes. His Lordship stated (at pages 984-985): Taxes are imposed upon subjects by Parliament. A citizen cannot be taxed unless he is designated in clear terms by a taxing Act as a taxpayer and the amount of his liability is clearly defined. 18 A proposition that whether a subject is to be taxed or not, or, if he is, the amount of his liability, is to be decided (even though within a limit) by an administrative body represents a radical departure from constitutional principle. It may be that the Revenue could persuade Parliament to enact such a proposition in such terms that the courts would have to give effect to it: but, unless, it has done so, the courts, acting on constitutional principles, not only should not, but cannot validate it. 81. His Lordship rejected the Commissioners’ submission that their “general administrative discretion in the execution of” the tax legislation provided the legal basis for the policy (at page 985): When Parliament imposes a tax, it is the duty of the commissioners to assess and levy it upon and from those who are liable by law. Of course they may, indeed, should act with administrative commonsense. To expend a large amount of taxpayer’s money in collecting, or attempting to collect, small sums would be an exercise in futility; and no one is going to complain if they bring humanity to bear in hard cases. I accept also that they cannot, in the absence of clear power, tax any given income more than once. But all this falls far short of saying that so long as they do not exceed a maximum they can decide that beneficiary A is to bear so much tax and no more, or that beneficiary B is to bear no tax. This would be taxation by self-asserted administrative discretion and not by law. ... “one should be taxed by law, and not be untaxed by concession.” 82. Lord Wilberforce acknowledged that the Commissioners had “done their best to devise a system which is workable and reasonably fair”. Nevertheless the Commissioners had no legal authority to remedy the legislative deficiency (at page 986): But whatever system they might devise lacks any legal basis. I must regard this case therefore as one in which Parliament has attempted to impose a tax, but in which it has failed, in the case of discretionary beneficiaries, to lay down any basis on which it can be assessed or levied. In the absence of any such basis the tax must fail. 83. More recently in R (on the application of Wilkinson) v IRC, the House of Lords considered whether the United Kingdom “care and management” provision authorised HM Revenue & Customs to extend to widowers an allowance that the legislation provided only to widows. Wilkinson submitted that the “care and management” provision authorised HM Revenue & Customs to extend the allowance to widowers, and that this should be done to comply with the United Kingdom’s international obligations to eliminate gender discrimination. 84. The House of Lords rejected this submission. It held that the “care and management” provision could not authorise the Commissioners to grant the allowance to widowers. Lord Hoffmann acknowledged that the “care and management” provision conferred on the Commissioners wide managerial discretion as to the best means of collecting the taxes, but this did not (at paragraphs 21–22): \[21\] ... enable the commissioners to concede, by extra-statutory concession, an allowance which Parliament could have granted but did not grant, and on the grounds not of pragmatism in the collection of tax but of general equity between men and women. \[22\] It follows that in my opinion the legislation gave the commissioners no power to act otherwise than to disallow claims for allowances by widowers ... . 85. In Vestey and Wilkinson the House of Lords held that the United Kingdom “care and management” provision does not enable legislative errors and deficiencies to be administratively remedied. This is entirely consistent with the Commissioner’s view of the relationship between section 6A(2) and (3) and the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. 19 Role of the “care and management” responsibility and section 6A(3) in statutory interpretation 86. Another important implication of the Commissioner’s conclusions is that section 6A(2) and (3) do not justify him interpreting other provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts other than in accordance with statutory interpretation principles. For instance, the Commissioner cannot prefer one interpretation, over another competing interpretation, on the basis that it will result in the highest net revenue being collected over time. The other provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts must be interpreted only according to the principles of statutory interpretation contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and in court decisions. Delegation and guidelines 87. As already stated, the “management” responsibility recognises that the Commissioner often exercises judgement as to how he carries out his functions and deals with particular taxpayers. This means that the “management” responsibility is not only relevant with respect to “high-level” managerial decision- making. It is also relevant with respect to the making of day-to-day managerial decisions concerning particular taxpayers. 88. As with his other powers and discretions, it is for the Commissioner to prescribe which officers have the delegated authority to make decisions under section 6A(2) and (3). In addition the Commissioner may from time-to-time issue guidelines so as to ensure that across Inland Revenue there is consistent decision-making under section 6A(2) and (3). These guidelines will assist in protecting the integrity of the tax system as required by section 6, by ensuring “recognition of the relevant criteria and a proper degree of consistency in the exercise of discretions”: CIR v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 (CA). 89. The Organisational Review Committee considered that guidelines would help to ensure that “perceptions of the integrity of the tax system are not diminished”. It noted that particular taxpayers may be concerned about the application of the Commissioner’s authority to enter settlements, and that some taxpayers “may also attempt to take advantage of the apparently increased discretion”. The Committee therefore recommended (ORC report, Appendix D, at paragraphs 48- 49): To ensure the proper and consistent use of managerial responsibility in these areas, the tax administration will be required to refine or develop internal guidelines for the exercise of care and management in the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. The guidelines should be consistent with the objective of maximising net revenue over time according to the law and give guidance to staff on the proper procedures and considerations to take into account as they apply tax law. Section 6A(3): Duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law Overview of section 6A(3) 90. Section 6A(3) provides: In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner's charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to— (a) The resources available to the Commissioner; and (b) The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and 20 (c) The compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 91. Section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to identify the available courses of action for administering the tax system or for dealing with particular taxpayers. These courses of action must be “within the law”. Section 6A(3) then requires the Commissioner to evaluate these courses of action by considering their likely effect on the amount of net revenue collected over time, and by having regard to the three factors in section 6A(3)(a), (b) and (c). 92. Once the Commissioner has identified the course of action that is consistent with the duty to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”, the words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” authorise the Commissioner to undertake that course of action even if it will result in less tax being collected than is imposed, or required to be collected, by the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. 93. In deciding which course of action is consistent with section 6A(3), the Commissioner will generally consider the circumstances of the particular taxpayers or groups of taxpayers concerned. However, the Commissioner may also from time to time issue general statements of policy that set out the course of action he will take in particular types of situations. 94. The text of section 6A(3) is analysed in the following paragraphs. Scope of section 6A(3): “In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge” 95. Section 6A(3) applies when the Commissioner is “collecting the taxes committed” to his charge. Neither the courts nor the Organisational Review Committee has commented on the meaning of the word “collecting”. 96. The word “collecting” could be construed as meaning the actual receiving or taking possession of taxes. Under this narrower interpretation, section 6A(3) would apply only when the Commissioner seeks to recover the taxes assessed as owing, for instance when deciding whether to exercise enforcement powers or instead enter an instalment arrangement. This means that section 6A(3) would apply with respect to the Commissioner’s actions after the tax liability has been assessed, but would not cover his actions before the tax liability has been assessed or that relate to ensuring the correct assessment of tax. 97. It is considered that the better view is that the word “collecting” has a broader meaning: it refers to the Commissioner’s functions that relate to, or enable, the receiving or taking possession of taxes. Under this, more holistic, interpretation section 6A(3) applies to the Commissioner’s functions both before and after the tax liability has been assessed. It would also include a wide range of administrative and support functions undertaken by the Commissioner, and also the Commissioner’s actions that relate to ensuring the correctness of taxpayers’ assessments (eg, the exercise of audit and investigative powers and reassessment powers). 98. The narrower interpretation gives the word “collecting” a meaning it can have in isolation. However, the Commissioner considers that the broader interpretation is to be preferred, because it is consistent with the statutory context and gives better effect to the purpose of section 6A(3). The Organisational Review Committee envisaged that the section 6A(3) duty would be the “overall objective” of the “total tax system” (see ORC report, section 8.2). Section 6A(3) would 21 have this function under the broader interpretation of the word “collecting”, because it would apply to every aspect of the Commissioner’s administration of the tax system. 99. It is relevant to note that the Organisational Review Committee adopted the words “in collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge” as a result of the Valabh Committee’s recommendation that (Valabh report, page 8): Such a change in the legislation \[ie, the adoption of a provision similar to the United Kingdom “care and management” provision\] would have to be presented and implemented with due care. It would be important to emphasise for instance that the taxes are committed to the Commissioner’s charge. Taxpayers may try to take advantage of an apparently increased discretion ... . 100. This indicates that the words “in collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge” were not intended to confine section 6A(3) to the actual receiving or taking possession of taxes. Instead the addition of these words was considered necessary to guard against taxpayers improperly taking advantage of “an apparently increased discretion” brought about by enacting a “care and management” provision (Valabh report, at page 7). 101. This in turn highlights a nuance inherent in the words “in collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge”. The words “committed to the Commissioner’s charge” emphasise that decisions concerning the collection of the taxes are those of the Commissioner alone. These words accordingly make it clear that section 6A(3) does not provide taxpayers with any basis for expecting that they will not be required to comply with their tax obligations. 102. In summary, the words “in collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge” cover all the Commissioner’s functions that relate to, or enable, the receiving or taking possession of taxes. As a result, section 6A(3) applies whenever the Commissioner exercises the managerial discretion conferred by the “care and management” responsibility. 103. It is important to note that this conclusion concerns only the ambit of section 6A(3). It does not directly affect what the Commissioner can or cannot do to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. The conclusions on the meaning of the words “within the law” and “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” in section 6A(3) govern what courses of action the Commissioner can undertake to discharge the section 6A(3) duty: see paragraphs 127-130 below. Duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable 104. Section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable”. 105. The phrase “highest net revenue” is not defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Organisational Review Committee defined these words as “actual revenue less administration (collection) costs” (ORC report, section 8.2, footnote 2). It defined “administrative costs” as the “costs incurred by the tax administration in assessing and collecting taxes” (ORC report, Appendix, “Glossary and Commonly Used Abbreviations”, page 81). 106. The significance of the duty imposed by section 6A(3) was discussed in Fairbrother v CIR. In this decision, Young J noted the similarity between section 6A(3) and the obligation imposed by the United Kingdom “care and management” 22 provision (recognised by Lord Diplock in Fleet Street Casuals). His Honour considered (at paragraphs 26-27) that section 6A(2) and (3) amounted to “statutory ratification” of the House of Lords’ approach in Fleet Street Casuals. Consequently, there was no scope for an argument that the Commissioner was under “an absolute obligation to collect the right amount of tax” in the absence of explicit contrary statutory direction. 107. At the same time, section 6A(3) does not authorise the Commissioner to decide to collect only “some” taxes owing. The duty to collect the “highest net revenue” means the Commissioner is obliged to maximise the net revenue having regard to the relevant considerations in section 6A(3). Section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to compare the available courses of action in terms of their effect on the amount of net revenue that he collects over time, both from the particular taxpayers concerned and from all taxpayers. 108. In making this comparison, the Commissioner must consider the short and long term implications of the available courses of action. This is required by the words “over time” in section 6A(3). The Organisational Review Committee discussed the meaning of the words “over time” (ORC report, section 8.2, footnote 1): The requirement to balance short term and long term considerations, and to have regard to the importance of promoting voluntary compliance, will be important moderating influences in circumstances where the objective may otherwise prompt an unnecessarily vigorous and short-term approach to revenue collection. 1. Over time indicates the obvious need for the tax administration to balance short and longer term implications of possible strategies before deciding on any particular course of action. Over time is intended to capture the concept of net present value (a valuation technique common to business as well as governments) and appears to be the best short and non- technical means of capturing the concept. 109. These comments highlight that the practical effect of the words “over time” is that the Commissioner may adopt courses of action that have the effect of forgoing the collection of the highest net revenue: • in the short term, if he considers that this will enable the collection of more net revenue in the longer term; and • from particular taxpayers, if he considers that this will enable more net revenue to be collected from all taxpayers. Factors the Commissioner must have regard to: section 6A(3)(a), (b) and (c) 110. In determining which course of action is consistent with the duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to have regard to three factors. These factors are: (a) The resources available to the Commissioner; and (b) The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) The compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 111. Section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to consider and balance all three factors listed in section 6A(3). In Raynel v CIR, Randerson J outlined the exercise required by section 6A(3) (at paragraphs 50 and 52): \[50\] These qualifications to the Commissioner's duty mean that the Commissioner is not obliged to take steps to collect revenue regardless of issues of practicality, available 23 resources, and costs incurred. Rather, the \[Commissioner’s\] duty is to be approached on a pragmatic basis with proper regard to the likely benefits and the costs of achieving them. ... . \[52\] ... But the considerations relevant to the exercise of the Commissioner’s duty are not limited to issues of practicality, resources and costs. Importantly, the Commissioner is also required by section 6A(3)(b) to have regard to the importance of promoting compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts. 112. The factors in section 6A(3) provide the framework within which the Commissioner evaluates the short and long term implications of the available courses of action for dealing with particular situations. The word “and” after the first two factors indicates that the Commissioner must have regard to all of the factors when evaluating the available courses of action. 113. Section 6A(3) does not stipulate the weight to be given to each of the factors. It is considered that the weight to be given each factor will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. Thus, in Raynel v CIR Randerson J stated (at paragraph 56): It is difficult and undesirable to give precise guidelines to the Commissioner other than the statutory considerations themselves. It will be a matter for the Commissioner to carry out his duty, having regard to the relevant considerations as they apply in individual cases and circumstances. 114. Randerson J noted (at paragraph 73) that decisions made by the Commissioner pursuant to the “broad managerial responsibilities” given to him “essentially involve the exercise of judgment within the statutory framework”. Consequently the Court would be “slow to interfere” with the proper exercise of the Commissioner’s duties and discretions in relation to the recovery of outstanding taxes. (For similar comments see also Rogerson v CIR, at paragraph 63.) 115. In the following paragraphs, the three factors in section 6A(3) are discussed. “Resources available to the Commissioner” (section 6A(3)(a)) 116. This first factor reflects that the Commissioner has limited resources. It covers the financial, time and human (including technical knowledge and expertise) resources to which the Commissioner has access. This factor includes not only the resources currently “on hand”, but also the opportunity costs of using these resources in terms of current and future competing demands for them elsewhere in the tax system. “Importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts” (section 6A(3)(b)) 117. This second factor consists of two interrelated parts: the promotion of compliance generally and the promotion of voluntary compliance in particular. Section 6A(3)(b) refers to the promotion of compliance by “all taxpayers”, which emphasises that section 6A(3) is concerned with the highest net revenue collected from the tax system as a whole. 118. The relationship between this factor and the amount of net revenue collected is obvious. Greater compliance results in more tax being collected. Greater voluntary compliance increases the net revenue collected by reducing the Commissioner’s administration costs. As the Organisational Review Committee observed, the voluntary compliance model, on which the tax system is based, is the most cost-effective form of tax collecting (ORC report, section 8.2 and Appendix D, paragraph 22). 24 119. As a rule, compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers will be promoted by the Commissioner ensuring that taxpayers perceive that they will be required to comply fully with their tax obligations. In Raynel v CIR Randerson J held (at paragraph 54): Sections 6 and 6A(3)(b) emphasise that there is a broader public interest in the integrity of the tax system and in ensuring that taxpayers meet their obligations. Taxpayers who comply with the requirements of the Inland Revenue Acts are entitled to expect that appropriate and (where necessary) firm action is taken against taxpayers who shirk their obligations. If not, complying taxpayers will justifiably perceive there is a lack of integrity in the system and an unfair burden is cast on those who conscientiously comply with their obligations. As well, as Master Lang pointed out, the voluntary compliance scheme which is central to the proper functioning of the Inland Revenue Acts will be placed in jeopardy unless all taxpayers know that the Commissioner will act firmly and resolutely with those who do not meet their obligations and have no reasonable excuse for doing so. 120. In some situations, the Commissioner might consider that this factor supports “firm action” (e.g. bringing enforcement and bankruptcy proceedings) being taken against non-complying taxpayers – for instance, where there has been a flagrant and on-going failure to comply and where recovery is dubious or is likely to result only in a relatively minor proportion of the overall debt being recovered: Raynel v CIR, at paragraph 55. 121. In other cases, the Commissioner might consider that such “firm action” does not need to be taken against non-complying taxpayers to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable. The Organisational Review Committee recognised this possibility (ORC report, section 8.2): The requirement to balance short term and long term considerations, and to have regard to the importance of promoting voluntary compliance, will be important moderating influences in circumstances where the objective \[i.e., to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law\] may otherwise prompt an unnecessarily vigorous and short-term approach to revenue collection. 122. It is not possible to identify the cases where the Commissioner would take this approach. It can be said that, at the very least, the Commissioner would need to be satisfied that the circumstances of the non-compliance mean that any failure to take “firm action” would not potentially undermine voluntary compliance by all taxpayers and taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. “Compliance costs incurred by taxpayers” (section 6A(3)(c)) 123. The third factor in section 6A(3) covers the costs to taxpayers in assisting the administration of the tax system. This factor does not include the cost of the tax liability. The Organisational Review Committee defined “compliance costs” as (ORC report, Glossary and Commonly Used Abbreviations, page 81): The costs to taxpayers of meeting their obligations under tax law and in meeting the requirements and practices of the tax administration. 124. Excessively high compliance costs can decrease the amount of net revenue collected by discouraging economic activity and endangering voluntary compliance (see ORC report, sections 1.8 and 11.1, and Appendix F, paragraph 51). However, the Organisational Review Committee recognised that taxpayers should expect to incur some compliance costs. This was because voluntary compliance systems (on which the New Zealand’s tax system is based) necessarily require taxpayers to incur some costs in meeting their obligations (ORC report, Appendix F, paragraphs 5 -7). 25 125. In the Commissioner’s view, section 6A(3)(c) requires him to have regard to whether the available courses of action would result in taxpayers incurring increased compliance costs. However, section 6A(3)(c) does not mean that taxpayers should not incur any compliance costs, or that the Commissioner cannot take courses of action that increase taxpayers’ compliance costs. Parliament contemplated that taxpayers would incur compliance costs as a result of them complying with their tax obligations, and due to the Commissioner exercising the powers conferred on him to ensure taxpayer compliance. 126. Section 6A(3)(c) will be primarily relevant in the development of systems and processes for administering the tax system. Consistent with this, the Organisational Review Committee stated (ORC report, section 11.3): The second place to tackle compliance costs is through the operational policies and procedures of the tax administration which have an immediate and direct effect on costs to taxpayers. Any steps that are taken ought to have regard to these considerations in the new proposed objective for IRD \[ie, section 6A(3)\]... . Section 6A(3)(c) will also be relevant with respect to dealing with specific taxpayers. For instance, the Commissioner might consider (having taken account of all other relevant factors) that two or more courses of action are equally open to him. In such a case, if one of those courses of action would result in the taxpayers incurring significantly more compliance costs, but all other things were equal, the Commissioner could take the view that he should not adopt this course of action because it would increase compliance costs unnecessarily. What the Commissioner may do to discharge the section 6A(3) duty: “within the law” and “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” 127. The words “within the law” and “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” affect the courses of action the Commissioner can undertake to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable”. 128. These words were referred to earlier in this Statement when considering the relationship between section 6A(2) and (3) and the other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts: see paragraphs 59–64 above. It was concluded in this discussion that section 6A(2) and (3) make clear that the Commissioner is not obligated to collect all taxes owing if doing so would not maximise the net revenue collected over time. Section 6A(2) and (3) allow the Commissioner to act inconsistently with other provisions only to the extent that they may otherwise be seen to require him to collect all taxes regardless of considerations such as costs and available resources. They do not authorise the Commissioner to act inconsistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts to any greater extent. 129. In light of these conclusions, the Commissioner considers that the words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” mean that the Commissioner may carry out the course of action that he considers will “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable” even if it results in less tax being collecting than is imposed, or required to be collected, by another provision. The words “within the law” mean that the Commissioner must act consistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts in seeking to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable”. 130. It is worth noting that section 6A(3) is not overridden by a later enacted provision unless Parliament specifically intended the later provision to do so. In Raynel v CIR, the High Court held (at paragraphs 63–67) that section 176(1) and (2)(a) were not to be interpreted as overriding section 6A(3). Although section 176(1) 26 and (2)(a) were enacted later than section 6A(3), there was no evidence that Parliament specifically intended the later provisions to override section 6A(3). Further, interpreting section 176(1) and (2)(a) as overriding section 6A(3) was inconsistent with the words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” in section 6A(3). Accordingly, the Commissioner was required to act consistently with both section 176(1) and 2(a) and section 6A(3): see also Clarke & Money v CIR; Rogerson v CIR. Summary of conclusions on section 6A(3) 131. Section 6A(3) requires the Commissioner to identify the various options for dealing with administering the tax system or for dealing with particular taxpayers. 132. Section 6A(3) then requires the Commissioner to determine which option would result in the collecting “over time” of the “highest net revenue that is practicable” from all taxpayers. In making this determination, the Commissioner is required to ascertain the short and long term implications of the available options and to have regard to all three factors listed in section 6A(3). These factors are: • the resources available to the Commissioner (section 6A(3)(a)); • the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts (section 6A(3)(b)); and • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers (section 6A(3)(c)). 133. The practical effect of the words “over time” is that the Commissioner may adopt courses of action that have the effect of forgoing the collection of the highest net revenue: • in the short term if he considers that this will enable the collection of more net revenue in the longer term; and • from particular taxpayers if he considers that this will enable more net revenue to be collected from all taxpayers. 134. The words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” in section 6A(3) mean the Commissioner may carry out the course of action that he considers will “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable” even if it results in less tax being collecting tax than is imposed, or required to be collected, by another provision. The words “within the law” mean the Commissioner must act consistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts in seeking to “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable”. 135. Section 6A(3) is not overridden by a later enacted provision unless Parliament specifically intended the later provision to do so. Section 6: Protection of the integrity of the tax system 136. Another important issue is the relationship between section 6A(2) and (3) and section 6. In paragraphs 143-150 below this relationship is discussed, beginning with an overview of section 6. Overview of section 6 137. Section 6 provides: 27 (1) Every Minister and every officer of any government agency having responsibilities under this Act or any other Act in relation to the collection of taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts are at all times to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. (2) Without limiting its meaning, "the integrity of the tax system" includes – (a) Taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; and (b) The rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law; and (c) The rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; and (d) The responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; and (e) The responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and (f) The responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. 138. Section 6(1) obligates the Commissioner, along with all other officers of Inland Revenue, to use “best endeavours” to protect the “integrity of the tax system”. This obligation must be discharged “at all times” and “in relation to the collection of the taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts”. These words mean that the section 6 obligation must be discharged by the Commissioner in all aspects of his administration of the tax system. 139. Section 6(1) obliges the Commissioner to use “best endeavours” to protect the integrity of the tax system. The phrase “best endeavours” is not defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The courts have held that the phrase “best endeavours” in other legislative contexts is to be given its ordinary meaning of “trying one’s best in all the circumstances”: Association of University Staff Inc v The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Auckland \[2005\] 1 ERNZ 224; Centaur Investments Co Ltd v Joker’s Wild Ltd (2004) 5 NZCPR 675. 140. Section 6(2) identifies six factors that come within the term “integrity of the tax system”. In providing that it applies “\[w\]ithout limiting its meaning”, section 6(2) indicates that the list of factors is not exhaustive. The factors listed in section 6(2) are fundamental principles in tax law: Westpac Banking Corp v CIR. These factors show that the term “integrity of the tax system” is a multifaceted concept. Some factors may be more important or relevant than others, and there may be potential for conflict between particular factors: see Westpac Banking Corp v CIR. 141. There has been little detailed judicial discussion on section 6. In the Supreme Court judgment in Westpac Banking Corp v CIR, McGrath J noted (at paragraph 32): The purpose of s 6 is to incorporate protection of the integrity of the tax system in terms that clearly define what is sought to be protected. The \[Organisational Review\] Committee had earlier observed in its report that tax integrity included the interaction between the total tax community and individual taxpayers. His Honour described (at paragraph 52) section 6 as imposing an “overarching duty on Ministers and departmental officials”. In the High Court decision in Miller v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,243, Baragwanath J stated (at 18,253): \[Section 6\] is a statutory expression of long-settled principles of the common law which impose strict standards of conduct upon those exercising public powers conferred for performance of their functions of serving the community. 28 (See also Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Ltd v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,622, at paragraphs 105–106.) 142. Section 6 does not provide taxpayers with a basis for challenging the Commissioner’s decisions. It does not render amenable to judicial review any conduct (not involving a decision) that might be said to be inconsistent with the obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system. Consequently, section 6 does not provide a means of challenging an assessment; assessments can be challenged only by way of the statutory objection procedure: Russell v Taxation Review Authority (2003) 21 NZTC 18,255 (CA), at paragraphs 34-36; Tannadyce Investments Ltd v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,036, at paragraph 63. Further, section 6 does not create rights enforceable by taxpayers such as those found in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990: Russell v Taxation Review Authority, at paragraph 47. Relationship between section 6 and section 6A(2) and (3) 143. Having provided an overview of section 6, it is now possible to explain more fully the relationship between section 6 and section 6A(2) and (3). 144. Section 6 applies “in relation to the collection of taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts”. These words mean that section 6 will apply when the Commissioner acts under section 6A(2) and (3). 145. As already discussed in paragraphs 59-64 and 127-130 above, section 6A(2) and (3) allow the Commissioner to act inconsistently with other provisions to the extent that they may otherwise be seen to require him to collect all taxes regardless of the costs and resources involved. In the Commissioner’s view, section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise him to act inconsistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts to any greater extent. 146. This raises the issue of whether section 6 is inconsistent with section 6A(2) and (3). In the Commissioner’s view there is no inconsistency. Section 6 does not require him to collect all taxes regardless of costs and resources involved. Instead section 6 requires the Commissioner to do his best in all the circumstances – to use “best endeavours” – to protect the integrity of the tax system when carrying out his functions and duties. This means that, when considering how he will act under section 6A(2) and (3), the Commissioner must consider, and take into account, the extent to which the available courses of action might undermine, or support, the integrity of the tax system as defined in section 6. 147. This is consistent with the case law. The courts have confirmed that the Commissioner must act consistently with both section 6 and section 6A(3). The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal have emphasised that section 6 and section 6A together provide the framework within which the Commissioner administers the Inland Revenue Acts: Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR at paragraphs 32–33; AG v Steelfort Engineering (1999) 1 NZCC 61,030, at page 61,036. In Westpac Banking Corp v CIR, McGrath J held that sections 6 and 6A occupy a “central position in the legislative scheme” (at paragraph 52) and that they were “closely linked” (at paragraph 51): The Commissioner’s duty to have regard to the importance of voluntary compliance, in collecting the highest net revenue practicable, is closely linked to the importance of public perceptions of the integrity of the system. 29 148. Similarly, in Raynel v CIR, the High Court observed that the Commissioner’s obligations in section 6 and section 6A(3) were interrelated in that they reinforced each other (at paragraph 54): Sections 6 and 6A(3)(b) emphasise that there is a broader public interest in the integrity of the tax system and in ensuring that taxpayers meet their obligations. Taxpayers who comply with the requirements of the Inland Revenue Acts are entitled to expect that appropriate and (where necessary) firm action is taken against taxpayers who shirk their obligations. If not, complying taxpayers will justifiably perceive there is a lack of integrity in the system and an unfair burden is cast on those who conscientiously comply with their obligations. As well ... the voluntary compliance scheme which is central to the proper functioning of the Inland Revenue Acts will be placed in jeopardy unless all taxpayers know that the Commissioner will act firmly and resolutely with those who do not meet their obligations and have no reasonable excuse for doing so. 149. The legislative history also supports the view that the Commissioner must act consistently with both section 6 and section 6A(3). The Organisational Review Committee considered that the section 6 obligation should inform every decision made within the tax system (ORC report, section 9.4.1). The Committee recognised that enacting a “care and management” provision made it “all the more important to ensure that perceptions of the integrity of the tax system are not diminished” (at paragraph 9.5.1). Nevertheless it considered that protecting the integrity of the tax system and maximising the net revenue collected were consistent objectives. Protecting the integrity of the tax system was “crucial” to maintaining voluntary compliance (ORC report, sections 8.2 and 9.3; and Appendix D, paragraph 33). The Committee stated (ORC report, section 15.1.4): A key component of obtaining the highest net revenue, by supporting voluntary compliance, rests on taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. Perceptions about integrity are tightly linked to the impartial application if the law and the exercise of the administration’s coercive powers and decision making powers with respect to the affairs of individual taxpayers. 150. In summary, the Commissioner must comply with section 6 when acting under section 6A(2) and (3). This means that when deciding how to act under section 6A(2) and (3), the Commissioner must consider, and take into account, the extent to which the available courses of action might undermine, or support, the integrity of the tax system as defined in section 6. Settlements and agreements 151. The courts have held that, under section 6A(2) and (3), the Commissioner can enter into: • Settlements where taxpayers dispute the interpretation of law or facts on which their liability has been assessed (Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,758 (HC); Accent Management (No 2) v CIR (CA); Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR;AG v Steelfort Engineering; and Fairbrother v CIR). • Agreements as to the payment of outstanding tax, penalties and interest (Raynel v CIR). 152. The courts have explicitly held that the Commissioner can settle litigation on a basis that does not necessarily correspond to his view of the correct tax position if he considers that doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6: Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA); Foxley v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,813. The courts have implicitly suggested that the Commissioner can give effect to settlements by way of an amended assessment, but it is not entirely clear whether this is done under section 6A(2) and (3), or only where authorised by 30 another provision. However, it is clear that the Commissioner can amend an assessment under section 89C(d) to reflect the terms of a settlement: Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA). 153. That the Commissioner can settle litigation might seem inconsistent with the conclusion reached earlier that the Commissioner cannot alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements: see paragraphs 69–73 above. However, the courts have made clear that the Commissioner is not exercising any power to alter taxpayers’ obligations in entering settlements. The courts have held that settlements do not involve the Commissioner “assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws, and the execution of laws, without consent of Parliament”: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (HC) at paragraph 74. 154. In taking this position, the courts have emphasised that settlements are made where the taxpayer’s obligations and entitlements are legitimately disputed and, therefore, the Commissioner will need to undertake litigation to collect the full amount of tax he considers owing. The courts have recognised that the Commissioner may consider, in light of the litigation risk, that the resources required could be better used elsewhere to maximise the net revenue collected. In Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA), William Young P held (at paragraph 15): This \[the Commissioner’s ability to enter settlements\] represents an undoubted shift from the approach adopted in \[Brierley Investments\]. The change in policy is justified by recognition that the Commissioner has limited resources and the function of collecting “over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. Major tax litigation is expensive and places a heavy strain on the human resources available to the Commissioner. The Commissioner must be permitted to make rational decisions as to how those resources can be best deployed. Further, “sensible litigation, including settlement, decisions” must necessarily allow for litigation risk. 155. In holding that the Commissioner is authorised to enter settlements, the courts have given effect to a key outcome intended to be achieved by enacting section 6A(2) and (3). The ORC report shows that it was specifically contemplated that section 6A(2) and (3) would authorise the Commissioner to enter settlements (ORC report, section 8.2): One significant implication from the objective \[that the Commissioner will collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law\] is that IRD will be entitled to enter into compromised settlements with taxpayers, rather than pursue the full amount of assessed tax, in cases where there are legitimate differences of view about the facts in dispute and the costs of litigation are high. 156. The courts have not specifically considered whether the Commissioner can settle tax disputes before litigation or the formal disputes process has started. The Commissioner considers that, in principle, there is no impediment to him doing so. The Commissioner may consider that settling will enable his resources to be better used to maximise the net revenue collected. The Commissioner’s position and responsibilities before litigation or the formal disputes process has started are not inherently different to his position and responsibilities during litigation. However, the litigation processes often results in him possessing more information than he did before. Accordingly, the Commissioner will consider settling before litigation or the formal disputes process has started only if satisfied that he has sufficient information on which to make an informed decision. As with his other powers, the Commissioner will prescribe which officers have the delegated authority to decide whether to settle. 157. The case law is clear that the Commissioner can enter settlements with taxpayers if he considers doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. It is not possible to list all the factors the Commissioner may consider in deciding whether 31 to settle. Ultimately the decision must be determined by consideration of all factors relevant to the particular case. However, the following, non-exhaustive list identifies some of the factors the Commissioner could consider relevant (depending on the circumstances of the particular case): • the resources required to undertake litigation; • the alternative uses of those resources; • the amount of the tax liability at stake; • an assessment of the litigation risk (eg, the likelihood of the Commissioner succeeding); • the implications of the Commissioner succeeding (in whole or part) if litigation is undertaken; • whether settling or litigating would better promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers; • the amount the taxpayer would pay if the Commissioner were to settle; • whether the subject matter of the dispute might be determinative of, or have broader application to, other situations; • whether the Commissioner would be prepared to settle on an equivalent basis with other taxpayers in a similar position; • the uncertainty in the tax system that might be created should the subject matter not be authoritatively determined by the courts; and • the likely effects on taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system of settling or litigating. 158. As already stated, the factors identified above are not exhaustive. Some of these factors may not be relevant and additional factors may be relevant given the circumstances of any particular case. It is for the Commissioner to decide on the appropriate weighting given to the relevant factors in a particular case. 159. Tax disputes sometimes involve several taxpayers. The Commissioner may need to decide whether to settle with each of the taxpayers individually. In such situations, the Commissioner is not required to settle, or to settle on the same terms, with all taxpayers involved in the litigation: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (HC), at paragraphs 79–86; and Accent Management Ltd v CIR (No 2) (CA), at paragraphs 20–22. However, the Commissioner will be aware that consistency of treatment for taxpayers with the same circumstances is an important consideration under section 6A(3) and section 6. Accordingly, in tax disputes involving several taxpayers, the Commissioner will generally settle on an equivalent basis with those taxpayers he considers share the same circumstances. By contrast, the Commissioner may settle on a different basis with those taxpayers he considers are in di fferent circumstances. Different circumstances might include, for example, the taxpayer’s willingness to settle, the timing of the settlement offers in relation to the progress of the litigation proceedings, the state of the case law at the time, and the Commissioner’s perception of the culpability of the taxpayers involved: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (No 2) (CA) at paragraph 21. Because settlements reflect the circumstances of the particular litigation and of the taxpayers, they are not necessarily indicative of how the Commissioner will deal with similar issues in the future. 32 160. In deciding whether to settle litigation, the Commissioner will act consistently with the Protocol between the Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Inland Revenue, dated 29 July 2009 (available at the Crown Law Office website: http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz ). This means that the Commissioner will consult with the Solicitor-General, who is responsible for the conduct of Crown litigation; and that litigation settlements will be jointly approved by Crown Law and Inland Revenue (except where the settlements concern debt matters and summary prosecution in which Inland Revenue solicitors represent the Commissioner). The Commissioner may also consult the Solicitor-General before entering a pre- litigation settlement if the subject-matter is central to a significant dispute in litigation. 161. Finally, where the Commissioner has entered into a settlement or agreement, he will not resile from it except if: • the Commissioner is acting pursuant to a condition in the settlement or agreement that allows him to resile; • the taxpayer has failed to adhere to the settlement or agreement; or • the settlement or agreement was entered into on account of misrepresentations by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer failed to make full disclosure before the settlement or agreement was entered into. Outline of “care and management” principles 162. Before turning to consider the examples, it is helpful to summarise the principles identified in this Statement’s analysis of the “care and management” responsibility. This summary is then used to address the examples. 163. The phrase "care and management" indicates that the Commissioner has two interrelated responsibilities. 164. First, the Commissioner is charged with the "care" of the taxes. This means that the Commissioner is responsible for promoting the integrity and effective functioning of the tax system. To discharge this responsibility, the Commissioner must seek to foster the tax system’s capacity to function effectively in light of economic, commercial, technological and other changes. 165. Second, the Commissioner is charged with the "management" of the taxes. This means that he is responsible for making managerial decisions in the interests of bringing about the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. The “management” responsibility recognises that the Commissioner makes decisions as to the allocation of his limited resources. This involves the Commissioner exercising judgement as to relative resources he allocates, over a period of time, across the various parts of Inland Revenue, and with respect to dealing with particular taxpayers. The “management” responsibility also recognises that the Commissioner often exercises judgement as to how he carries out his functions. 166. Section 6A(2) and (3) were enacted together (along with section 6) to provide the framework within which the Commissioner administers the tax system. Section 6A(3) applies “\[i\]n collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge”. The collecting of taxes is an aspect of the Commissioner’s “management” responsibility. Section 6A(3) clarifies the Commissioner’s overall objective in carrying out his functions in administering the tax system. 33 167. In order to discharge his section 6A(3) duty, the Commissioner must compare the available courses of action as to their likely effect on the amount of net revenue he collects over time. To do this the Commissioner must consider the short and long term implications of each course of action, and have regard to all three factors listed in section 6A(3). These factors are: • the resources available to the Commissioner (section 6A(3)(a)); • the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts (section 6A(3)(b)); and • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers (section 6A(3)(c)). 168. The practical effect of the words “over time” is that the Commissioner can adopt courses of action that have the effect of forgoing the collection of the highest net revenue: • in the short term, if he considers that this will enable the collection of more net revenue in the longer term; and • from particular taxpayers, if he considers that this will enable more net revenue to be collected from all taxpayers. 169. The words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” in section 6A(3) mean that the Commissioner can carry out the course of action that he considers will “collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable” even if it results in less tax being collected than is imposed, or required to be collected, by another provision. The words “within the law” mean that the Commissioner must act consistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts. 170. Some important implications of these conclusions are that section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to: • disregard the requirements for the lawful exercise of powers and discretions conferred by other provisions; • alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements; • issue extra-statutory concessions; • administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies; • interpret provisions other than in accordance with the statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions; or • act inconsistently with his obligation under section 6 to protect the integrity of the tax system. 171. Section 6(1) requires that the Commissioner, at all times, use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. The term “integrity of the tax system” is non-exhaustively defined in section 6(2). The Commissioner must comply with section 6 when acting pursuant to section 6A(2) and (3). This means that when deci ding how to act under section 6A(2) and (3), the Commissioner must consider, and take into account, the extent to which the available courses of action might undermine, or support, the integrity of the tax system. 34 Examples 172. The following examples illustrate the principles set out in this Statement on the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility in section 6A(2) and his obligations under section 6A(3) and section 6. The examples are not intended to state definitively what the Commissioner would do in the particular fact scenarios. Instead the examples are intended to assist readers’ understanding of the Commissioner’s view on: • what he can and cannot do under section 6A(2) and (3); • the decision-making process required by section 6A(3), and • the application of the relevant factors in section 6A(3) and section 6. Example 1: Decision whether to audit The Commissioner has decided not to audit plumbers this year, due to their high degree of voluntary compliance and the low likelihood of identifying any undisclosed income. The Commissioner becomes aware of information that shows XYZ Plumbers has not declared $100,000 of income. In the normal course of events, XYZ Plumbers would not be audited because of the Commissioner's decision not to audit plumbers this year. Can the Commissioner decide to treat XYZ Plumbers like all the other plumbers by not auditing it? 173. The Commissioner could decide not to allocate the resources required to audit XYZ Plumbers. This decision would involve the Commissioner exercising the resource allocation discretion recognised by the “care and management” responsibility. However, before the Commissioner would decide not to allocate the resources required to audit, he would consider whether doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. On the facts of this example, it would seem unlikely that the Commissioner would be acting consistently with section 6A(3) and section 6 by not auditing a taxpayer he has reason to believe has not declared a substantial amount of income. Example 2: Decision not to investigate past years’ tax liability The Commissioner is aware that non-compliance is widespread in a particular industry. To address this non-compliance and to avoid further revenue loss, the Commissioner is proposing to inform the industry members that he will not audit their previous years’ income if they comply with their tax obligations in current and future years. Would the Commissioner’s proposed course of action be a valid exercise of his “care and management” responsibility? 174. Yes: The proposed course of action would involve the Commissioner exercising his discretion as to the allocation of his resources recognised by the “care and management” responsibility in section 6A(2). In Fleet Street Casuals the House of Lords held that the United Kingdom “care and management” provision authorised the Revenue undertake a similar course of action. Before the Commissioner could undertake the proposed course of action, he would need to be satisfied that it is consistent with his obligations under section 6A(3) and section 6. 35 175. On the facts of this example, the Commissioner would balance the cost of auditing and assessing the industry members against the possible tax yield that might result if they were audited and assessed. He would also consider what resources he has available and the competing uses for those resources (section 6A(3)(a)). The Commissioner would have regard to the fact that auditing and reassessing would increase the industry members’ compliance costs (section 6A(3)(c)). However, the Commissioner may give this factor little weight because any additional costs incurred as a result of audit and reassessment would be due to the industry members’ non-compliance. 176. The Commissioner would evaluate the extent to which the proposed course of action would promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance (section 6A(3)(c)), and undermine or support the integrity of the tax system (section 6). Accordingly, the Commissioner would determine the benefits that might accrue from not auditing and reassessing the industry members, such as decreased levels of non-compliance in the particular industry. The Commissioner would balance the benefits against the risk that: • complying taxpayers might consider it unfair if the industry members are not required to pay the full amount of tax; and • that not reassessing and auditing the industry members might encourage non-compliance in other industries. 177. However, on the facts of this example, section 226B might apply. Section 226B was enacted to grant to the Commissioner a specific power to declare business group amnesties. It provides the Commissioner with discretion to “declare an amnesty ... in relation to a group of persons, each of whom carries on a type of activity as the person’s main business”. Section 226B also provides the requirements for a valid amnesty, including that the Commissioner must consider that declaring the amnesty is (section 226B(1)): ... consistent with— (a) protection of the integrity of the tax system; and (b) collection over time of the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. 178. Accordingly, section 226B requires the Commissioner to take account of the same sorts of considerations as outlined in paragraphs 175-176 above. If section 226B does apply to the facts of this example, the Commissioner would declare a business group amnesty rather than undertake the proposed course of action under section 6A(2) and (3). This is because Parliament enacted section 226B for the specific purpose of addressing the situation outlined in the example. It is noted that section 226B imposes specific statutory restrictions on the Commissioner’s ability to investigate, assess or reassess and prosecute persons covered by the business group amnesty (section 226B(8) and (9)). Example 3: Deciding whether to audit where taxpayer discloses undeclared income A taxpayer informs Inland Revenue that he has discovered an invoice representing income that he has inadvertently excluded from his tax return. The taxpayer wants Inland Revenue to agree not to audit the income year for which the return was filed, and states he will undertake to pay any tax liability and penalty resulting from the adjusted income amount immediately. 36 179. In this example the Commissioner could decide: • to audit the taxpayer; or • not to allocate the resources required to carry out the audit, and instead accept from the taxpayer the payment for the increased tax liability and any penalties incurred. 180. In determining which of the above options is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6, the Commissioner would take account of the fact that accepting the taxpayer’s payment would require fewer resources than would be required to carry out the audit (section 6A(3)(a)). This factor would need to be balanced against the risk that the excluded income indicates that the taxpayer has not been complying with his tax obligations and so could have other undeclared income. In considering this factor, the Commissioner would take account of the taxpayer’s compliance history. 181. The Commissioner would also have regard to the likelihood that auditing would increase the taxpayer’s compliance costs (section 6A(3)(c)). However, the Commissioner would give little weight to this factor. Taxpayers who file incorrect assessments should expect to incur additional compliance costs as a result of being audited and reassessed. 182. The Commissioner would have regard to the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers (section 6A(3)(b)). The Commissioner might consider that auditing would promote compliance, because it will better ensure that the taxpayer has complied fully. On the other hand, the Commissioner could take the view that auditing would not promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers. This would be on the basis that the risk of being audited might discourage taxpayers from voluntarily disclosing to Inland Revenue inadvertently excluded income. 183. The Commissioner’s decision whether or not to audit the taxpayer would need to be made after weighing up the above considerations. Example 4: Use of the “care and management” responsibility instead of an existing statutory power Can the care and management responsibility be used instead of an existing power? For example, if a taxpayer did not satisfy the definition of “serious hardship” in section 177A could the Commissioner write-off that taxpayer’s outstanding tax on the basis of hardship under section 6A(2) and (3) rather than under section 177C? 184. No: The Commissioner can write off the debt on the basis of “serious hardship” only if this is authorised by section 177C. The debt cannot be written off under section 6A(2) and (3), even if the taxpayer argues that collecting the debt would cause hardship because, for instance, it would harm the taxpayer’s business. In enacting section 177C, Parliament has specified precisely when such a write-off is to be permitted. Example 5: Exercising statutory discretions To be zero-rated under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, supplies of goods must be exported within 28 days. However, section 11(5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides that the “Commissioner may 37 extend the 28-day period ... if the Commissioner has determined, after the supplier has applied in writing” that either section 11(5)(a) or (b) are satisfied. Taxpayers who regularly seek extensions have complained that the 28- day period is invariably too short and that making applications imposes significant administrative costs on them. They have asked the Commissioner to state that taxpayers who have in the past received extensions will not be required to make applications and can instead automatically zero-rate supplies that satisfy section 11(5)(a) or (b). Can the Commissioner inform these taxpayers that they need not apply in writing to obtain extensions, but rather can automatically zero-rate supplies that satisfy section 11(5)(a) or (b)? 185. No: Section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow the Commissioner to exercise the powers and discretions contained elsewhere in the Inland Revenue Acts if he has not satisfied the requirements for their lawful exercise. 186. Section 11(5) provides the Commissioner with the discretion to extend the 28- day period if he considers that section 11(5)(a) or (b) is satisfied. This discretion can be exercised only after the taxpayer has made an application in writing. If the taxpayer has not made the application, the Commissioner cannot lawfully decide to extend the 28-day period or otherwise zero-rate supplies that have been exported after the 28-day period. 187. On the facts of this example, the Commissioner might consider recommending to the Government that the provision be amended to remove the written application requirement. He may consider this necessary in order to protect the integrity of the tax system. Example 6: Issuing binding rulings A taxpayer applies for the Commissioner to issue a private ruling under section 91E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner proceeds to draft the private ruling in accordance with his view of the correct interpretation of the relevant taxation law. Before the ruling is issued, the Supreme Court delivers a judgment on the relevant taxation law. As a result of the Supreme Court’s decision, the Commissioner now considers the interpretation contained in the draft ruling to be incorrect. The taxpayer considers the Commissioner’s previous interpretation more commercially advantageous to it than the new correct interpretation. It asks the Commissioner not to redraft the ruling in light of the Supreme Court’s decision and instead to issue the ruling immediately. Could section 6A(2) and (3) authorise the Commissioner to issue a binding ruling other than in accordance with his view of the correct interpretation of the taxation laws? 188. No: Section 6A(2) and (3) do not allow the Commissioner to exercise the powers and discretions contained elsewhere in the Inland Revenue Acts if he has not satisfied the requirements for their lawful exercise. This means that section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to disregard the requirements and limitations on his ability to issue binding rulings contained elsewhere in the Inland Revenue Acts. 38 189. If the Commissioner were to issue binding rulings that did not reflect his view of the correct tax position, he would be invalidly exercising his authority to issue binding rulings. Section 91E confers on the Commissioner the authority to issue binding private rulings “on how a taxation law applies, or would apply to a person and to the arrangement ... for which the ruling is sought”. Section 91EH(1)(c) provides that a private ruling must state “\[h\]ow the taxation law applies to the arrangement and to the person”. This means that the Commissioner must, at the time of issuing the ruling, consider that the ruling contains the correct interpretation of the relevant taxation law. In this example, the draft ruling contains the incorrect interpretation of the relevant taxation law. Accordingly if the draft ruling were to be issued without amendment, it would not be stating “how the taxation law applies to the arrangement and to the person”. Example 7: Altering taxpayers’ obligations Under section 79(1) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, a taxpayer is required to provide the Commissioner with a statement where he or she has made gifts in certain circumstances. Under section 79(2), a copy of a gift deed is also required where the gift is created or evidenced by a written instrument. (a) Can the Commissioner decide not to refer to the deeds routinely? (b) If the Commissioner decides not to refer to the deeds routinely, can he direct taxpayers not to send in the deeds? 190. In relation to issue (a): The Commissioner could decide not to refer to the deeds routinely if he considers that the resources required could be better used elsewhere to maximise the net revenue collected. This would involve the Commissioner’s exercise of the managerial discretion as to the allocation and management of resources recognised by the “care and management” responsibility. Before the Commissioner could make this decision, he would need to determine that it would be consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. To do this, the Commissioner would balance the costs of referring to the deeds routinely against the risk that incorrect assessments will be made if the deeds are not referred to routinely. 191. In relation to issue (b): The Commissioner could not direct taxpayers not to send in the deeds. Section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to purport to release taxpayers from the obligations imposed on them by the Inland Revenue Acts. Moreover directing taxpayers not to send in the deeds would be inconsistent with the Commissioner’s obligation in section 6(1) to protect the integrity of the tax system, in particular with “the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law” (section 6(2)(d)). 192. Consequently, on the facts of this example, one appropriate course of action would be for the Commissioner to reallocate resources so that he can deal with the deeds sent in. Alternatively, the Commissioner could consider recommending to the Government that section 79(1) be amended to no longer require the deeds to be sent in. Example 8: Anticipated legislation change A Bill before Parliament provides that all goods and services supplied by a particular industry will be zero-rated for GST purposes. Can the Commissioner decide not to pursue GST that has not been paid by taxpayers in that industry because he expects the Bill will be enacted? 39 193. Yes: The Commissioner could decide, at this point of time, not to allocate the resources required to pursue the unpaid GST that would not be owed if the Bill were enacted, on the basis that he considers that those resources could be better used elsewhere to maximise the net revenue collected. This would involve the Commissioner exercising his managerial discretion as to the allocation and management of his resources recognised by the “care and management” responsibility. 194. Before the Commissioner could decide not to pursue unpaid GST, he would need to determine that it would be consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the legislative change will be retrospective (ie. the supplies made in the preceding three month period would qualify to be zero- rated), he might take the view that not pursuing the GST would decrease his collection costs. Not pursuing the GST would also minimise the taxpayers’ compliance costs, because it would avoid the need for taxpayers to pay the GST and then seek to have it refunded after the Bill is enacted. 195. Under section 6, a decision not to pursue the GST owing might be viewed as inconsistent with the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law (section 6(2)(d)) and the responsibilities of those administering the law to do so “according to law” (section 6(2)(f)). A decision not to pursue the GST owed would involve the Commissioner not enforcing the legislation, in force at that time, which imposes liability for GST. However, the Commissioner might consider that not pursuing the unpaid GST owing under the legislation in force at the time would amount to only a temporary and nominal failure to apply the law given he expects the Bill to be enacted with retrospective effect. 196. The Commissioner could not inform taxpayers that they are not obliged to pay the outstanding GST owing under the legislation in force. Similarly, the Commissioner could not advise taxpayers to assess themselves other than in accordance with the legislation in force. If the Commissioner were to do that, he would be purporting to alter taxpayers’ obligations. Section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to do this. Example 9: Relationship between section 6A(3) and the Commissioner’s recovery obligations Taxpayer A has a history of serious non-compliance, involving repeated failures to pay outstanding tax, comply with the Commissioner’s information requests and to adhere to instalment arrangements. The Commissioner identifies two alternative courses of action for dealing with taxpayer A: he can enter into another instalment arrangement with her or, alternatively, bankrupt her and wind up her company. Taxpayer A considers that another instalment arrangement is required by section 176(1). Section 176(1) provides that “the Commissioner must maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer”. Taxpayer A argues that an instalment arrangement would maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from her, because it means she can continue to operate her company and thereby generate sufficient income to pay the tax. In taxpayer A’s view, bankrupting her and winding up her company would not maximise the recovery of outstanding tax, because she would no longer be earning any income. The Commissioner takes into account taxpayer A’s arguments, but also takes into account the fact that taxpayer A has failed to adhere to past 40 instalment arrangements. The Commissioner considers that this fact indicates that taxpayer A cannot be relied on to adhere to another instalment arrangement, so it is dubious whether another instalment arrangement would recover any outstanding tax. In addition, the Commissioner considers which course of action is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. Having done this, the Commissioner concludes that he should bankrupt taxpayer A and wind up her company. The taxpayer considers that the Commissioner has incorrectly applied the law. She argues that only section 176(1) is relevant and, accordingly, the Commissioner should not have considered section 6A(3) and section 6. Is the Commissioner required to consider section 6A(3) and section 6 along with section 176(1)? 197. Yes: The Commissioner has correctly applied the law. Under section 176(1) the Commissioner is obligated to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer. To act consistently with section 176(1), the Commissioner must compare the amount that each course of action would likely recover from the taxpayer concerned. 198. In addition, the Commissioner must comply with section 6A(3) and section 6 when acting under section 176(1). Section 6A(3) applies in “collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner’s charge” and, therefore, when the Commissioner seeks to recover outstanding tax under section 176(1). Section 6 applies to all aspects of the Commissioner’s administration of the tax system and must be complied with “at all times”. Accordingly, the Commissioner must compare the available courses of action as to their consistency with his: • duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable and having regard to the three factors in section 6A(3); and • obligation to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. 199. On the facts of this example, the Commissioner has concluded that bankrupting taxpayer A and winding up her company is more likely to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from taxpayer A. Taxpayer A’s history of serious non- compliance strongly suggests that she cannot be relied on to adhere to another instalment agreement. 200. Under section 6A(3), the Commissioner has taken into account that entering an instalment arrangement would preserve taxpayer A’s ability to earn income. However, the Commissioner considers that bankrupting her and winding up her company are required to promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers (section 6A(3)(b)), and to protect the integrity of the tax system, particularly taxpayer perceptions of that integrity (section 6(2)(a)). Given taxpayer A’s history of serious non-compliance, a failure to take firm action against her could reduce other taxpayers’ expectations that they will be required to comply and, in turn, this could undermine the voluntary compliance system. Example 10: Statutory prohibitions on the Commissioner The Commissioner is satisfied that section 176(2)(b) applies to taxpayer B. Section 176(2)(b) provides that the “Commissioner may not recover outstanding tax to the extent that ... recovery would place a taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship”. The term ”serious hardship” is defined in section 177A. Can section 6A(3) and section 6 41 authorise the Commissioner to collect the outstanding tax despite section 176(2)(b)? 201. No: Section 176(2)(b) prohibits the Commissioner from recovering outstanding tax to the extent it would cause “serious hardship” to the taxpayer. Section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to disregard explicit legislative directions or prohibitions on how he may or may not act. 202. Section 6A(3) does not override section 176(2)(b) by virtue of the words “notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts”. There is no inconsistency between section 176(2)(b) and section 6A(3). Section 176(2)(b) does not require the Commissioner to collect all taxes regardless of the costs and resources involved. Consequently, section 6A(3) does not authorise the Commissioner to act inconsistently with section 176(2)(b). Example 11: Unfair legislative outcomes A legislative provision can be clearly interpreted and involves no ambiguity. When that provision is applied it has the perceived effect of taxing income twice. The principles of statutory interpretation do not permit the Commissioner to adopt an interpretation that would avoid this result. Can the Commissioner apply the provision in an alternative manner to avoid taxing income twice? 203. No: Section 6A(2) and (3) do not authorise the Commissioner to interpret or apply the legislative provision in a manner that is inconsistent with the statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions. If the legislation interpreted according to those statutory interpretation principles has the perceived or real effect of imposing double taxation, the Commissioner cannot assess the taxpayers on some other basis in order to avoid that effect: Vestey v IRC. 204. In this situation the Commissioner could recommend to the Government that the provision be amended in order to remove the double taxation effect. He may consider this necessary in order to protect the integrity of the tax system. Example 12: Legislative anomalies The Commissioner considers the original purpose and intent of a legislative provision is clear. However, based upon the ordinary (and unambiguous) meaning of its text, the provision’s effect is inconsistent with what is thought to be its purpose and intent. Can the Commissioner depart from the ordinary meaning of the provision and instead apply it in a way that gives effect to its purpose and intent? 205. No: The Commissioner cannot decide that, because the provision results in anomalous outcomes or is otherwise unfair, he will interpret or apply the provision in a way that is not supported by statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions. 206. The Commissioner could recommend to the Government that the provision be amended. He may consider this necessary in order to protect the integrity of the tax system. 42 Example 13: Interpreting ambiguous legislation Can care and management be used in determining the meaning to be applied to a provision that is ambiguous — such as where two constructions of a provision are open based upon the ordinary meaning of the words employed? 207. No: “Care and management” is not a “principle” to be used to resolve ambiguity in legislation. Legislation must be interpreted according to the statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions. However, this does not preclude reference being made to sections 6 and 6A to assist the interpretation in contexts where this would be normal under those principles: see for instance, Westpac Banking Corp v CIR; Raynel v CIR. 208. The Commissioner could recommend to the Government that the provision be amended in order to remove the ambiguity. He may consider this necessary in order to protect the integrity of the tax system. Example 14: Unworkable legislation Where the Act fails to provide a method to calculate the amount of tax in a particular circumstance, does the “care and management” responsibility authorise the Commissioner to “fill the gap” by supplying the calculation method? 209. No: The “care and management” responsibility does not authorise the Commissioner to remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies: Vestey v IRC; R (on the application of Wilkinson) v IRC; NZ Film Services Ltd v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 62,062. The Commissioner must apply the law according to the statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions. The Commissioner can “bridge a hiatus” to make the legislation work as Parliament intended only to the extent he considers the courts would do so: see Northland Milk Vendors Association Inc v Northern Milk Ltd \[1988\] 1 NZLR 530. 210. The Commissioner would recommend to the Government that the provision be amended to provide the calculation method, because he would consider this necessary in order to protect the integrity of the tax system. Example 15: Minor non-compliance by taxpayers A non-resident company proposed to re-purchase and cancel a percentage of its shares. A statement is published in the Tax Information Bulletin states that, based on several assumptions, any payment received by shareholders will not constitute a "dividend" for New Zealand tax purposes. It is later discovered that a (minor) assumption has not been met. As a result, a significant percentage of the New Zealand shareholders may have derived a small dividend. The average amount of tax payable on any such dividend is likely to be less than one dollar and may be zero in some cases. Can the Commissioner decide not to reassess the taxpayers to include any additional tax liability? 211. Yes: The Commissioner could decide not to allocate resources to reassessing the taxpayers if he considers that doing so would be consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. 43 212. On the facts of this example, reassessing the taxpayers would result in the taxpayers’ liability being determined according to law (section 6(2)(b)) and is consistent with taxpayers’ responsibilities to comply with the law (section 6(2)(d)). Reassessing could promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers (section 6A(3)(b)). It might emphasise to taxpayers that they will be expected to comply fully, and encourage them to carefully follow the Commissioner’s published items. 213. However, the costs that would be incurred (both by the Commissioner and the taxpayers) by reassessing are likely to be greater than the additional tax collected (section 6A(3)). Before the Commissioner could reassess the taxpayers, he would need to allocate resources to gathering information, answering taxpayer queries and reviewing taxpayer compliance. The Commissioner could take the view that reassessing would not significantly promote taxpayer compliance, given that the non-compliance here is due to the mistake of the company and not the taxpayers. The Commissioner could also take the view that, since the non- compliance is one-off, minor and inadvertent, he does not need to take firm action against the taxpayers so as to protect taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system (section 6(2)(a)). 214. Therefore, on the facts of the example, the Commissioner would likely consider that section 6A(3) and section 6 support him deciding not to allocate resources to reassessing. It should be noted that the taxpayers would still be liable for the unpaid tax even though they will not be reassessed at this point of time. Consequently, if the Commissioner were to audit and reassess any of the taxpayers at a later date, he potentially would be obligated to include the unpaid tax (subject to any statutory provision preventing this). Example 16: Duty to maximise the net revenue collected The Commissioner has audited HIJK Ltd, a large corporate taxpayer that employs several hundred New Zealanders. The audit indicates that HIJK Ltd’s tax liability is greater than it has been assessed for in the last three income years. HIJK Ltd’s representatives inform the Commissioner that if HIJK Ltd is required to pay this increased tax liability, it will no longer be competitive for it to operate in New Zealand and consequently it would move its operations offshore. Can the Commissioner decide not to amend HIJK Ltd’s assessment on the basis that it will “collect over time the highest net revenue” by ensuring that HIJK Ltd continues to operate in New Zealand? 215. No: The Commissioner would not be acting consistently with section 6A(3) and section 6 if he were to decide not to reassess HIJK Ltd so to ensure that it continues operating in New Zealand. 216. The duty to maximise the net revenue collected in section 6A(3) does not allow the Commissioner to forgo collecting the full amount of tax owing on the basis that doing so might encourage taxpayers to remain in New Zealand. Tax obligations are imposed directly on taxpayers by the Inland Revenue Acts. Accordingly only Parliament may address concerns that tax obligations are detrimental to New Zealand’s economic activity. 217. On the facts of the example, not reassessing is inconsistent with “\[t\]he responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law” (section 6(2)(d)). If the Commissioner does not reassess, HIJK Ltd will not be required to discharge the 44 tax liability Parliament has imposed on it. Not reassessing would undermine taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system (section 6(2)(a)) and would not promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers (section 6A(3)). Other taxpayers will consider it unfair that HIJK Ltd is not required to comply when they are required to do so. If the Commissioner were to not reassess, other corporate taxpayers might consider that they too could avoid their tax obligations by threatening to cease New Zealand operations. Example 17: Treating taxpayers differently An audit of four taxpayers in the same industry revealed that these taxpayers had assessed themselves on the basis of an incorrect interpretation of the law. Two of these taxpayers have been reassessed, with the result that their assessed tax liability has increased. Information suggests that the same issue is likely to be applicable to thousands of taxpayers in the same industry. The Commissioner has decided that these industry-wide taxpayers will not be audited at this time due to resource constraints. In addition, the industry as a whole has agreed to change its practices in future. Can the Commissioner decide to: (a) reverse the two reassessments; and (b) not reassess the remaining two audited taxpayers? Reassessed taxpayers 218. With respect to the two reassessed taxpayers, the Commissioner cannot amend the assessments to reflect the earlier incorrect interpretation of the law. If the Commissioner were to do so, he would not be validly amending the assessments under section 113. Section 113 provides that the Commissioner “may from time to time, and at any time, amend an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness” (emphasis added). Audited, but not reassessed, taxpayers 219. While a final decision would depend on the facts of any particular case, the Commissioner could decide to reassess the audited taxpayers in circumstances such as these. 220. Reassessing the audited taxpayers would involve the Commissioner exercising the section 113 amendment power for the very purpose Parliament enacted it, that is, to ensure the correctness of the taxpayers’ assessments. Reassessing the audited taxpayers would require few resources (section 6A(3)(a)). It would result in the taxpayers complying fully with their tax obligations (section 6(2)(b) and (d)) and, in turn, this would enhance their and other taxpayers’ expectations that they will be required to comply with their obligations (section 6A(3)(b); section 6(2)(a)). 221. It is acknowledged that the audited taxpayers would need to rearrange their affairs once they are reassessed and, as a result, would incur additional compliance costs (section 6A(3)(c)). However, these additional compliance costs will be ultimately due to the audited taxpayers having adopted an incorrect legal interpretation. Consequently, in reaching his decision the Commissioner would give less weight to the compliance cost factor. 45 222. In this example, a decision not to reassess could be seen to potentially undermine the integrity of the tax system, on the basis that: • the Commissioner would be accepting the audited taxpayers’ assessments that he knows are incorrect, and this might compromise taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system (section 6(2)(a)) and not promote voluntary compliance by all taxpayers (section 6A(3)(b)); • the audited taxpayers would not be required to comply with their tax obligations (section 6(2)(b) and (d)); and • the two reassessed taxpayers and other taxpayers might consider it unfair given they have been required to comply with their obligations (section 6(2)(a)). 223. The audited taxpayers may well consider it unfair that they are reassessed while the rest of the industry is not. However, the Commissioner would necessarily take into account the fact that tax obligations are imposed on taxpayers directly by Parliament and, accordingly, taxpayers should expect to comply with them, and that it is the Commissioner’s role to collect those taxes: “\[e\]very ordinarily sophisticated taxpayer knows that the Revenue is a tax-collecting agency, not a tax-imposing authority” (R v Board of Inland Revenue, ex parte MFK Underwriting Agencies Ltd \[1990\] 1 All ER 91, 110) and that the Commissioner’s “primary duty is to collect, not forgive, taxes” (Preston v IRC \[1985\] 2 All ER 327). Example 18: Taxpayer reliance on incorrect Inland Revenue published item The Inland Revenue booklet Qualifying Companies contained a statement that loss-attributing qualifying companies could elect to offset their losses against other group companies’ income, before accounting for any remaining loss to the shareholders. This booklet was subsequently discovered to be incorrect and misleading. The Commissioner is aware that many taxpayers are likely to have relied on the booklet, so their self- assessments will be incorrect. Some of the affected taxpayers have asked the Commissioner not to apply the current interpretation of the law to returns for years before the year in which the error was discovered. 224. It is important to note that the booklet is not a binding ruling, so the Commissioner is not legally bound to apply the interpretation it contains. Nevertheless, the Commissioner could decide not to allocate the resources required to identify, audit and reassess the taxpayers who relied on the booklet. However, before doing so, he would need to determine whether this course of action is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. 225. In making this determination, the Commissioner would take account of: • the likely amount of the increased tax liability (section 6A(3)); and • the resources required to identify, audit, and reassess the taxpayers, and the alternative uses for those resources (section 6A(3)(a)). 226. The Commissioner would also consider the risk that reassessing would be detrimental to taxpayers’ confidence in relying on Inland Revenue publications. If this occurs it might result in increased numbers of incorrect assessments (section 46 6A(3)(b)). The Commissioner would also take account of the possibility that the taxpayers might consider it unfair that they are reassessed given they relied on the booklet and that they will incur additional compliance costs as a result. However, the Commissioner would weigh this consideration against the fact that he is not bound by the booklet (unlike binding rulings). 227. Under section 6, the Commissioner would take into account the following factors in favour of allocating resources required to reassess: • reassessing would result in the taxpayers being required to comply with their obligations (section 6(2)(b) and (d)); • reassessing would enhance taxpayers’ expectations that they will be required to comply fully (section 6(2)(a) and section 6A(3)(b)); and • other taxpayers might consider it unfair if those taxpayers who relied on the booklet are not required to comply fully (section 6(2)(a)). 228. Whether resources are allocated to identifying, auditing, and reassessing the taxpayers who relied on the booklet would be made after the Commissioner has weighed up these factors. 229. If the Commissioner were to reassess the taxpayers, the taxpayers might be liable for use of money interest on the shortfall. The Commissioner would consider remitting this interest if authorised to do so by the relevant remission provision. (Under the Commissioner's current practice, he would remit use of money interest under section 183D where it is established that the taxpayer has relied on an incorrect statement by the Commissioner: see SPS 05/10 "Remission of penalties and interest", published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005)). The taxpayers would not be liable for a late payment penalty on the shortfall if they were to pay that tax by the new due date for payment fixed by the Commissioner. \[Note: It might also be necessary to consider the application of any specific provisions that relieve taxpayers from liability for interest or penalties in specified circumstances, such as where taxpayers have relied on Inland Revenue advice or publications.\] Example 19: Taxpayer reliance on incorrect Inland Revenue advice A taxpayer rang an Inland Revenue call centre to ask whether a specific transaction was subject to GST. The call centre advised the taxpayer that the transaction was not subject to GST. The taxpayer based her assessment on this advice. Later, as a result of auditing the taxpayer, Inland Revenue becomes aware of the transaction and concluded that the taxpayer is required to pay GST on it. The taxpayer informs Inland Revenue of the advice she received from the call centre, and asks that she not be reassessed because she relied on this advice. Can the Commissioner decide not to reassess the taxpayer and instead accept her assessment? 230. On the facts of this example, the Commissioner would be likely to reassess the taxpayer. 231. Reassessing the taxpayer would involve the Commissioner exercising the section 113 amendment power for the purpose Parliament enacted it, that is, to ensure the correctness of the taxpayer’s assessment. Reassessing the taxpayer would require few resources (section 6A(3)(a)). It would result in her complying fully 47 with her tax obligations (section 6(2)(b) and (d)) and, in turn, this would help to enhance taxpayers’ expectations that they will be required to comply with their obligations (section 6A(3)(b) and section 6(2)(a)). 232. By contrast, a decision not to reassess could be seen as likely to undermine the integrity of the tax system, on the basis that: • the Commissioner would be accepting an assessment he knows to be incorrect, and this would compromise taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system (section 6(2)(a)) and not promote voluntary compliance by all taxpayers (section 6A(3)(b)); • the taxpayer would not be required to comply fully with her tax obligations (section 6(2)(b) and (d)); and • other taxpayers might consider this decision to be unfair, given that they are required to comply with their obligations (section 6(2)(a)). 233. It is acknowledged that the taxpayer may consider it unfair that she is reassessed given that she relied on call centre advice, and that she will incur additional compliance costs as a result. There could also be a risk that reassessing her would result in other taxpayers becoming less confident in using Inland Revenue’s call centres. If this occurs, it might result in increased numbers of incorrect self- assessments (section 6A(3)(b)). These considerations are important and the Commissioner would necessarily take them into account. However, the Commissioner could well take the view that they are outweighed by the following factors: • Reassessing would result in the taxpayer complying with her tax obligations. The tax obligations are imposed directly on the taxpayer by Parliament and, accordingly, she should expect to comply with them. • The call centre advice does not alter the taxpayer’s legislative obligations. The Commissioner is not legally obliged to adhere to that advice (unlike binding rulings). 234. If the Commissioner were to reassess the taxpayer, the taxpayer might be liable for use of money interest on the shortfall. The Commissioner would consider remitting this interest if authorised to do so by the relevant remission provision. (Under the Commissioner's current practice, he would remit use of money interest under section 183D where it is established that the taxpayer has relied on incorrect Inland Revenue advice: see SPS 05/10 "Remission of penalties and interest", published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005)). The taxpayer would not be liable for a late payment penalty on the shortfall if she were to pay the shortfall by the new due date for payment fixed by the Commissioner. \[Note: It might also be necessary to consider the application of any specific provisions that relieve taxpayers from liability for interest or penalties in specified circumstances, such as where taxpayers have relied on Inland Revenue advice or publications.\] Example 20: Settling litigation X Ltd proposes to Inland Revenue’s Litigation Management Unit that a tax dispute set down for a court hearing be settled on the basis that X Ltd pays an agreed proportion of the tax claimed in the Commissioner’s 48 Notice of Proposed Adjustment. Would it be a valid exercise of the “care and management” responsibility for the Commissioner to settle on this basis? 235. Yes: The Commissioner could settle with the taxpayer if he considers that doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. The courts have held that section 6A(2) and (3) authorise the Commissioner to settle tax disputes rather than undertake litigation. 236. In determining whether to settle, the Commissioner would have regard to the factors identified in paragraph 157 above, and any other relevant factors. 237. The Commissioner’s decision whether to settle would also be made consistently with the Protocol between the Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Inland Revenue, dated 29 July 2009: see paragraph 160 above.
Interpretation Statement IS 10/08 RETIREMENT VILLAGES – GST TREATMENT This Interpretation Statement considers the legislation as it is before any relevant amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 take effect. When the form of any relevant amendments is finalised, a further item will be issued to address the GST position of retirement villages affected by the amendments. 1 All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. SUMMARY 2 This Interpretation Statement addresses the GST treatment of payments received by retirement villages (the owners and operators of retirement villages) and their entitlement to input tax credits in respect of goods or services acquired for the purposes of operating a retirement village. 3 To determine whether GST is chargeable on supplies made by a retirement village and whether retirement villages are entitled to input tax credits on goods and services acquired for the purpose of operating the retirement village, it is necessary to consider whether the supplies made by a retirement village are taxable or exempt supplies. For this purpose, it is necessary to consider the rights and obligations under contracts entered into between retirement villages and their residents. 4 Retirement villages supply accommodation and care services. The main legal structures used for the provision of occupation rights in a retirement village are sales, leases or licences. Where a unit is sold, a retirement village may have an obligation to re-purchase the unit or they may have an option to purchase the unit. The payments made by residents under their contracts include an entry payment (either the purchase price for a unit, a loan or deposit), a payment that is commonly described as the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”, periodic services fees and termination charges. The nature of the supplies made by a retirement village and the consideration for the supplies are considered at paragraphs 44 to 106. 5 A retirement village may make the following types of exempt supplies: • The supply of financial services (the allotment or issue of a debt security): sections 14(1)(a) and 3(1)(c). The meaning of “debt security” is considered at paragraphs 58 to 61. • The supply of accommodation in a dwelling by way of hire, service occupancy agreement or licence to occupy: section 14(1)(c). The meaning of “accommodation” is considered at paragraphs 79 to 80 and the meaning of “dwelling” is discussed at paragraphs 116 to 145. 6 The Commissioner considers that a retirement village makes a supply of a financial service (the allotment of a debt security) under any transaction where the retirement village accepts an obligation to re-purchase a unit or 2 to repay a loan or deposit. That service is supplied for no consideration. Section 14(1)(a) is considered at paragraphs 111 to 113. 7 As section 14(1)(c) applies to the supply of accommodation by way of hire, service occupancy agreement or licence to occupy, it is necessary to consider whether section 14(1)(c) applies only where the right to occupy a unit in a retirement village is supplied under a lease or licence. For section 14(1)(c) to apply, accommodation must be supplied in a dwelling. If paragraph (f) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” applies to a unit in a retirement village, the unit is a dwelling rather than part of a commercial dwelling. To determine whether paragraph (f) applies, it is necessary to: • identify the consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay for the right to occupy a dwelling; and • determine whether such consideration is for the supply of accommodation. The Commissioner considers that paragraph (f) does not apply to units whose residents have purchased a package of care services; therefore, such units are part of a commercial dwelling so that the supply of accommodation in the units under a lease or licence is a taxable supply. On the basis of contractual arrangements that are currently entered into between retirement villages and residents, paragraph (f) applies to other units in a retirement village so that the supply of accommodation in such units under a lease or licence is an exempt supply. The issue of whether section 14(1)(c) applies to the supply of accommodation in a retirement village is considered at paragraphs 114 to 145. 8 A retirement village may also supply a participatory security under which residents have a right to use the common areas and facilities in the village. If the right to use the common areas under a participatory security that is part of a taxable supply of accommodation is an “associated supply”, section 14(1)(a) does not exempt the associated supply: section 14(1B). An associated supply is treated as a separate taxable supply: section 5(14B). This issue is considered at paragraphs 146 to 156. Input tax credits 9 Whether an input tax credit is allowable on the individual goods and services that go into a retirement village development depends on whether the asset produced using those goods and services is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 10 The principal purpose at the time of acquisition must be ascertained. If at the time land is acquired development plans are not finalised, whether the principal purpose test is satisfied in respect of the land depends on whether the intended use of the land is principally for the making of taxable supplies. There must be objective evidence of the intended use of the land (such as planning applications, feasibility studies and preliminary designs). 11 Where a retirement village includes both dwellings and a commercial dwelling, the dwellings and the commercial dwelling are treated as separate supplies in applying the principal purpose test. Whether the 3 principal purpose test is satisfied in respect of the common areas and facilities depends on whether the retirement village principally supplies exempt supplies of accommodation or taxable supplies of accommodation and other services. The principal purpose test is to be applied to a supply as a whole. Areas within a community centre such as the kitchen, dining room and nursing station that are used exclusively for the purpose of making taxable supplies are not a separate supply for the purpose of the principal purpose test. 12 The principal purpose test is considered at paragraphs 157 to 171. Adjustments 13 If the principal purpose test is not satisfied in respect of goods and services acquired for the development or operation of a retirement village, an input tax adjustment is allowable to the extent that the goods and services are applied for making taxable supplies if: • the goods and services were acquired on or after 1 October 1986; and • GST was charged on the supply of the goods or services; or • the goods are secondhand goods that have always been situated in New Zealand and were acquired by way of sale: section 21E. 14 The extent to which goods or services are applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies may be calculated by reference to the ratio of dwellings to commercial dwellings in a retirement village. However, another method of calculation would be acceptable if the method results in fair and reasonable amounts. 15 Taxpayers have an option of making input tax adjustments on a periodic or annual basis: section 21G(1). However, a one-off input tax adjustment is allowable in respect of goods and services costing more than $18,000 only if the goods and services are wholly applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies and: • the Commissioner consents to a one-off input tax adjustment in respect of goods and services; or • the goods and services are applied for a different purpose as a consequence of a change in the legislation: sections 21G, 21G(1A) and 21H. 16 An asset is a capital asset if it is acquired for retention and use in carrying on a taxable activity. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to consider whether an item is a separate asset. The Interpretation Statement on Residential Rental Properties – depreciation of items of depreciable property provides guidance as to the matters to be considered in determining whether an item is a separate asset. 17 An output tax adjustment is required in respect of goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies to the extent the goods and services are applied for another purpose: section 21(1). An output tax adjustment would be required at one of the following times: 4 • In the first taxable period in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies; • In each taxable period in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies; • In each year in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies: section 21C. 18 Land acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies would be applied for a purpose other than of making taxable supplies when it is determined that a particular part of the land is to be allocated for the construction of dwellings where exempt supplies of accommodation are to be made. This may occur before the land is actually used for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 19 Input tax and output tax adjustments are considered at paragraphs 172 to 192. BACKGROUND 20 A retirement village is a complex that is used for the provision of accommodation to retirees: Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,003 (HC). A central concept of retirement villages is the provision of accommodation: Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,212 (CA). Another feature of retirement villages is the provision of community facilities to residents. Care and other services may also be provided in a retirement village. The services other than accommodation that are provided to residents may vary from village to village. Residents within a retirement village may also receive different levels of care and services. 21 The Commissioner has referred to several sources that contain a broad outline of the legal and financial structure of arrangements between retirement villages and their residents. The Commissioner has also considered a range of contracts used in respect of particular retirement villages. These indicate that the main legal structures used for the provision of occupation rights in retirement villages are sales, leases or licences. The financial structures commonly entered into between retirement villages and their residents may broadly be described as follows: • Generally, residents are required to pay a lump sum payment on entry to the retirement village, which, in legal terms, is either the purchase price for a unit or an interest-free loan or refundable deposit. • The entry payment may include a separate component (commonly known as the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”), which is treated as payment for either the provision of community facilities or for management services. A retirement village may be entitled to take the facilities fee or amenities contribution or it may accrue to the retirement village over a period of years. If the entry payment does not include a facilities fee or amenities contribution, the facilities fee or amenities contribution is payable when the resident leaves the village and is deducted from the amount that is repayable to the resident. 5 • Residents are also required to pay periodic fees, which are a proportionate share of village overheads such as rates, insurance, security, management expenses and maintenance. • An additional payment or a higher service fee is chargeable where residents receive other services such as laundry, cleaning, nursing and meals. • Residents may also be required to pay refurbishment costs relating to their unit when they leave the village. • Residents may be required to pay a termination fee or the legal costs incurred by the retirement village in granting the occupation right. • The amount that is repaid to the resident will often be less than the amount originally paid by the resident. Residents may not be entitled to share in the capital gain on their units and, if they are entitled to do so, a higher entry payment may be required. 22 It is not possible in the context of an Interpretation Statement to address every type of arrangement that may be entered into between retirement villages and their residents. This Interpretation Statement deals with sales, leases and licences (which are the main legal structures used in retirement villages) and the financial structures outlined above. It is hoped that the principles outlined in this Interpretation Statement will be relevant in the majority of cases. LEGISLATION Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 23 Under section 3(1)(c) and (d), the following activities are financial services: (c) The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d) The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: 24 Section 5(14B) provides: If part of a supply of an equity security or participatory security is the supply of a right to receive supplies of goods and services that are not exempt supplies, the supply of the right is treated as being a supply of goods and services made for a consideration. 25 Section 8(1) provides: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 15 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 26 Section 10(2) provides: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,— 6 (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration. 27 Section 10(6) provides: Where and to the extent that any supply of goods and services consists of the supply, to any individual, of domestic goods and services in a commercial dwelling, the value attributable to that part of that supply of domestic goods and services that is for a period in excess of 4 weeks shall be deemed to be reduced to an amount equal to 60 percent of the amount that would, if that part of that supply were chargeable with tax at the rate of 9.0 percent, be the value of that part of that supply of domestic goods and services: Provided that to the extent that any supply is a supply of domestic goods and services, and where that commercial dwelling is a residential establishment, and where the supplier and the recipient have agreed that that supply shall be for a period of or in excess of 4 weeks, or for a number of periods which in the aggregate will exceed 4 weeks, the value attributable to that supply of domestic goods and services shall, from the commencement of that supply, be deemed to be reduced to an amount equal to 60 percent of the amount that would, if that supply were chargeable with tax at the rate of 7.5 percent, be the value of that supply of domestic goods and services. 28 Section 10(18) provides: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. 29 Section 14(1)(a) and (c) provides: The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: (a) The supply of any financial services (together with the supply of any other goods and services, supplied by the supplier of those financial services, which are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services), not being a supply referred to in subsection (1B): .... (c) The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of— (i) Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii) A licence to occupy: 30 Section 14(1B) provides: The following supplies are excluded from the exemption under subsection (1): (a) A supply of financial services that, in the absence of subsection (1)(a), would be charged with tax at the rate of zero per cent under section 11A: (b) A supply described in paragraph (b) of the definition of associated supply: (c) A supply of goods and services which (although being part of a supply of goods and services which, but for this paragraph, would be an exempt supply under subsection (1)(a)) is not in itself, as between the supplier of that first-mentioned supply and the recipient, a supply of financial services in respect of which subsection (1)(a) applies. 31 Section 20(3) provides: Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period— 7 (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following: (i) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) Input tax in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Input tax invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b); and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following: (i) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Input tax paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b), to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount; and 32 Section 21E provides: (1) Section 21F applies if— (a) A person acquires goods and services on or after 1 October 1986 for the principal purpose other than that of making taxable supplies; and (b) The goods and services are applied in a taxable period for a purpose of making taxable supplies either by the person or, if the person is a member of a partnership, by the partnership; and (c) Either subsection (2) or subsection (3) applies. (2) This subsection applies if— (a) Tax has been charged under section 8(1) on the supply of the goods and services made to the person; or (b) Tax has been levied under section 12(1) of this Act on the goods that have been entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by the person. (3) This subsection applies if— (a) The goods are secondhand goods that are supplied to the person by way of sale and the goods— (i) Have always been situated in New Zealand; or (ii) Have had tax levied on them under section 12(1); and (b) The supply is not a taxable supply; and 8 (c) The person has not supplied the goods to another registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996. (4) For the purpose of subsection (1)(a), goods and services are treated as if they were acquired for the principal purpose other than that of making taxable supplies to the extent that— (a) Section 21 or 21I have treated the goods and services as being supplied; or (b) Section 5(3) has deemed the goods and services as being supplied by a person who ceases to be a registered person and the goods or services are subsequently applied by the person, or by a partnership of which the person is a partner, for a purpose of making taxable supplies. 33 Section 21F provides: (1) For the purpose of this Act, the goods and services referred to in section 21E are treated as being supplied in the taxable period to the person or partnership, and the Commissioner must, to the extent that the goods and services are applied, allow the person or partnership to make a deduction under section 20(3) for the tax fraction of the lesser of— (a) The cost of the goods and services, including any tax charged or input tax deduction claimed for the goods and services; and (b) The open market value of the supply of the goods and services. Subsection (1) does not apply to a supply of services provided by an employee. 34 Section 21G provides: (1) A person to whom section 21F applies may make the deduction at either of the following times: (a) In each taxable period in which goods and services are applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies; or (b) In each year in which goods and services are applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies. (1A) Despite subsection (1) and subject to subsection (1B), if section 21F(1) applies to goods that are capital assets with a cost of less than $18,000, the person or the partnership referred to in section 21F(1) may make a single deduction in the taxable period during which the goods are applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies. (1B) Subsection (1A) does not apply to a registered person if the goods referred to in section 21E are applied for a different purpose as a consequence of a change in this Act. (2) If a person makes a deduction at the time allowed by subsection (1)(b), the person must reduce the amount of the deduction allowed under section 21F by the amount of deductions made in earlier taxable periods in relation to the supply. (3) A person may change the time at which the person makes a deduction only with the Commissioner's approval. 35 Section 21H provides: (1) Despite section 21G(1), a person to whom section 21F applies may apply to the Commissioner to make a single deduction in the taxable period in which goods and services are wholly applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to goods and services that— (a) Cost less than $18,000: (b) Are applied for a different purpose as a consequence of a change in this Act. (3) When determining whether to allow a person to make a single deduction, the Commissioner must take the following factors into account: 9 (a) The nature of the goods or services: (b) Whether it is practical to require a deduction at either of the times specified in section 21G(1): (c) Whether the person has previously made an attribution under section 21C(1)(a): (d) Whether the person has previously made a single adjustment under section 21(1), as it was before the enactment of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000: (e) Whether the person has previously made a single deduction under either— (i) This section; or (ii) Section 21(5), as it was before the enactment of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. (4) If the Commissioner allows the person to make a single deduction and the goods and services are subsequently applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies, the person must apply section 21C(1)(a) in the taxable period in which the change occurs. 36 Section 25(1) provides: This section shall apply where, in relation to the supply of goods and services by any registered person,— (a) That supply of goods and services has been cancelled; or (aa) The nature of that supply of goods and services has been fundamentally varied or altered; or (b) The previously agreed consideration for that supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise; or (c) The goods and services or part of those goods and services supplied have been returned to the supplier,— and the supplier has— (d) Provided a tax invoice in relation to that supply and as a result of any one or more of the above events, the amount shown thereon as tax charged on that supply is incorrect; or (e) Furnished a return in relation to the taxable period for which output tax on that supply is attributable and, as a result of any one or more of the above events, has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax on that supply. 37 Section 25(2) provides: Where a supplier has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax as specified in subsection (1)(e) of this section, that supplier shall make an adjustment in calculating the tax payable by that supplier in the return for the taxable period during which it has become apparent that the output tax is incorrect, and if— (a) The output tax properly charged in relation to that supply exceeds the output tax actually accounted for by the supplier, the amount of that excess shall be deemed to be tax charged on a taxable supply made by that supplier and be attributable to the taxable period in which the adjustment is to be made, and not attributable to any prior taxable period: (b) The output tax actually accounted for exceeds the output tax properly charged in relation to that supply, that supplier shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of the amount of that excess. 10 38 The definitions of “associated supply”, “commercial dwelling”, “domestic goods and services”, “dwelling” and “consideration” in section 2 read as follows: Associated supply means— (a) A supply for which the supplier and recipient are associated persons: (b) A supply of a right, under an equity security or participatory security, to receive for no consideration, or consideration at other than the open market value, a supply of goods and services that is— (i) Not an exempt supply; and (ii) Not a supply relating to the control of the issuer of the equity security or participatory security: Commercial dwelling means— (a) Any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse; or (b) Any camping ground; or (c) Any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; or (d) Any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition;— but does not include— (e) A hospital except to the extent that that hospital is a residential establishment: (f) A dwelling situated within a retirement village or within a rest home, where the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy that dwelling: Domestic goods and services means the right to occupy the whole or part of any commercial dwelling, including, where it is provided as part of the right to so occupy, the supply of— (a) Cleaning and maintenance: (b) Electricity, gas, air-conditioning, or heating: (c) Telephone, television, radio, or any other similar chattel: Dwelling means any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: Consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: 39 “Debt security” and “participatory security” are defined in section 3(2) as follows: Debt security means any interest in or right to be paid money that is, or is to be, owing by any person; but does not include a cheque: Participatory security means any interest or right to participate in any capital, assets, earnings, or other property of any person where that interest or right forms part of a contributory scheme (as defined in section 2 of the Securities Act 1978); and includes an interest in a unit trust within the meaning of the Unit Trusts Act 1960; but does not include an equity security, a debt security, money, or a cheque: 40 “Input tax” is defined in section 3A(1) and (2) as follows: 11 (1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means— (a) Tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) Tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) An amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). (2) In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if— (a) The supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) The goods are not supplied by a supplier who— (i) is a non-resident; and (ii) as previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) The goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and— (i) The taxable supplies are not charged with tax at the rate of 0% under section 11A(1)(q) or (r); or (ii) The taxable supplies are charged with tax at the rate of 0% under section 11A(1)(q) or (r) and the goods have never, before the acquisition, been owned or used by the registered person or by a person associated with the registered person. Scheme of the legislation 41 GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services in the course of a taxable activity carried on by a registered person by reference to the value of the supply. Exempt supplies are not subject to GST: section 8(1). 42 The value of a supply is the consideration paid for the supply. Where the consideration relates to both a taxable supply and an exempt supply, it is necessary to identify the portion of the consideration that is attributable to each supply. Only the part of the consideration that is attributable to a taxable supply is subject to GST. 43 In calculating the tax payable in respect of any taxable period, an input tax credit is allowable on goods and services supplied to a registered person in that period, if such goods and services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: section 20(3); definition of “input tax” in section 3A. If the principal purpose test is not satisfied and the goods and services were acquired on or after 1 October 1986, an input tax credit is allowable to the extent that the goods or services are applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies: sections 21E to 21H. An output tax adjustment is required in respect of goods and services acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies to the extent the goods and services are applied for another purpose: section 21(1). 12 Nature of the supply 44 The Court of Appeal in Gulf Harbour Gulf Harbour Development Ltd v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 and CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd (2005) 22 NZTC 19,126 confirmed that the principles in Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 are to be applied in determining the nature of a supply. To determine the nature of a supply, it is necessary to consider the legal rights and obligations entered into between the parties in the light of the surrounding circumstances. The relevant principles were stated by Richardson J in Marac as follows: The true nature of a transaction can only be ascertained by careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out: not on an assessment of the broad substance of the transaction measured by the results intended and achieved or of the overall economic consequences. The nomenclature used by the parties is not decisive and what is crucial is the ascertainment of the legal rights and duties which are actually created by the transaction into which the parties entered. The surrounding circumstances may be taken into account in characterising the transaction. Not to deny or contradict the written agreement but in order to understand the setting in which it was made and to construe it against that factual background having regard to the genesis and objectively the aim of the transaction. Of course the documentation may be a sham hiding the true agreement or its implementation. Or there may be a statutory provision mandating a broader or different approach. But at common law there is no halfway house between sham and characterisation of the transaction, according to the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. (p. 5,098) 45 Where a single supplier makes a supply of a package of services or a package of goods and services, the elements in the transaction may be so closely linked that objectively they constitute a single supply. 46 The principles in VAT cases were adopted in Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685. In that case the principles for determining whether there is a single supply were summarised as follows: \[a\] In determining whether a supply may be apportioned for GST purposes, it is necessary to examine the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to determine whether there is a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion them accordingly. \[b\] The enquiry is to determine whether one element of the transaction (or consideration given) is a necessary or integral part of another or whether it is merely ancillary to or incidental to that other element. \[c\] A service will be ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. \[para 36\] 47 VAT cases decided after the Auckland Institute case clarify that a single supply made up of a number of elements, none of which are the ancillary (in the sense of subservient, subordinate or ministering to) element in the transaction: see College of Estate Management v C & E Commrs \[2005\] 4 All ER 933 Levob Verzekeringen Bv v Staatssecretaris van Financiën \[2007\] BTC 5186. It is necessary to consider the true and substantial nature of the consideration given for the payment. This will identify the core supply (which may consist of a number of supplies that are integral to each other, none of which is the dominant element in the core supply). It 13 would then be necessary to consider whether there are supplies that are ancillary to the core supply: C & E Commrs v FDR Ltd \[2000\] BTC 5277. 48 Viewed in isolation, an ancillary feature of a transaction could be regarded as an independent supply. However, an ancillary feature is not in any real and substantial sense part of the consideration (objectively ascertained) for the payment made. An ancillary feature is a minor, peripheral and non-essential element of the transaction. It is a question of fact and degree whether the relationship between the elements in a transaction is such that the transaction cannot be regarded as a single supply. In British Airways plc v C & E Commrs \[1990\] BTC 5,124 (where the issue was whether in-flight catering was a separate supply from air transport) the court accepted that the supply of food and beverages was not necessary or essential to the supply of air transport but had concluded in-flight catering was merely an optional extra. The cost of the food and beverages was reflected in the price of the ticket but the food and beverages supplied were not in any real and substantial sense part of the consideration (objectively ascertained) for the payment made by passengers. However in Sea Containers Ltd v C & E Commrs \[2000\] BVC 60 the court considered that food and drink provided on day train excursions was a separate supply from the supply of transport. The court considered that the catering was an important part of what the customer was paying for. Its importance was demonstrated by the references in the marketing brochures to “a unique series of lunch and dinner excursions”. 49 Cases in the VAT context establish that in order to determine whether a single supply is made and the nature of the supply or supplies: • It is necessary to identify the essential features of the transaction (the true and substantial nature of the consideration provided for the payment made by the customer). This requires consideration of the contract between the parties. The true and substantial nature of the consideration is to be ascertained objectively. • All the circumstances in which the transaction takes place must be considered. • Whether a separate charge is made or whether a separate price can be identified does not determine the legal nature of the transaction and cannot alter the essential features of the transaction. • Whether the supplies are “physically and economically dissociable” (for example, there is a supply of goods and a supply of services and the price for each supply can be identified) is not determinative. • The individual elements in a supply including several elements do not necessarily determine the nature of an “over-arching single supply”. See C & E Commrs v Wellington Private Hospital \[1997\] BTC 5140; Card Protection Plan Ltd v C & E Commrs \[1999\] BTC 5121 (ECJ); (\[2001\] 2 All ER 143 (HL); C & E Commrs v British Telecommunications plc \[1999\] 3 All ER 961, Dr Beynon v C & E Commrs \[2004\] 4 All ER 1091; College of Estate Management v C & E Commrs \[2005\] 4 All ER 933 Levob Verzekeringen Bv v Staatssecretaris van Financiën \[2007\] BTC 5186. 50 The Commissioner considers that the requirement to consider the transaction from the perspective of a typical consumer or average 14 customer means no more than that the focus is on the supply actually made and not on whether a supply of goods or services could be made separately. In the British Telecom case whether the car could have been supplied without the delivery service was irrelevant. The supply contracted for was the supply of a delivered car. In the Auckland Institute case the supply that students had contracted for was the supply of tuition services. Pre-arrival services (advice on courses to be undertaken, arrangements for accommodation and other matters relating to the welfare of students, immigration formalities and the completion of documentation for enrolment purposes) could have been provided by a third party under a separate contract. However, the court considered that the pre-arrival services (arranging payment of tuition fees, completion of enrolment and application forms) were ancillary to the supply of tuition in that they facilitated the students undertaking a course of study. Therefore, whether a service could be supplied separately is irrelevant in determining whether a single supply is made. The focus is on the supply made under the contract with the customer. 51 A transaction involving the supply of a package of services or a package of goods and services has been treated as a single supply in the following circumstances: • Where one element in a transaction is the dominant element in the transaction and the other elements are ancillary to the dominant element in the sense that they facilitate, contribute to or enable the supply of the dominant element in the transaction. • In the British Telecom case there was a single supply of a delivered car. The supply contracted for was for a delivered car and the delivery of the car enabled the completion of the transaction. In the Card Protection case it was held that there was a single supply of insurance. The essential feature of the transaction was insurance against loss arising from the misuse of credit cards. The other features in the transaction (the maintenance of a register of credit cards, the ordering of replacement cards, a change of address service, lost key location tags and luggage stickers to ensure the quick return of lost keys and luggage) assisted in the administration of the insurance scheme. In the Auckland Institute case the pre-arrival services were ancillary to the supply of tuition services to overseas students in that they facilitated that supply. • No one element in the transaction is the dominant element in the transaction and the elements in the transaction are so closely linked that, considered objectively, they form a single supply. • Examples of such transactions include: the supply of distance learning courses, an essential component of which was the supply of written materials (College of Estate Management); the supply of medical treatment, which required both the exercise of medical skill and the use of drugs (Beynon), the supply of repair services, which required the repair of a vehicle by the replacement of defective parts (CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd (2005) 22 NZTC 19,126 (CA); (2004) 21 NZTC 18,437 (HC)) and restaurant transactions, which include the provision of food and a cluster of features and acts (Faaborg-Gelting Linien A/S v Finanzamt Flensburg \[1996\] BTC 5391). 15 • The transaction includes the provision of minor or peripheral benefits that are optional extras and that are not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which a payment is made. • In the Card Protection case the House of Lords considered that to the extent that the services supplied could not be categorised as insurance, they were ancillary or minor features of the insurance scheme that were not sufficiently coherent to be treated as a separate supply. In Tumble Tots (UK) Ltd v R & C Commrs \[2007\] BTC 5210 it was held that there was a single supply of membership of a club that conferred on a child the right to attendance at classes involving structured physical play and that other benefits received on admission to membership (a DVD, CD, gym bag, membership card, T-shirt, personal accident insurance for a child while attending a class and a subscription for a magazine) did not alter the nature of the supply. 52 Section 5(14) is relevant if (applying the principles outlined above) it is determined that only part of a supply is subject to GST at the standard rate: “Interpretation Statement on GST: Role of section 5(14) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985” Tax Information Bulletin Volume 20 No 5 (June 2008). Essential features of the transaction 53 To determine whether the supply made by a retirement village is the supply of accommodation, it is necessary to identify the essential features of the transaction. This requires consideration of the contract entered into between retirement villages and their residents. 54 Contracts may vary from village to village and not all residents within a particular village receive the same services under their contracts. However, a broad outline of contracts entered into between retirement villages and their residents is possible. 55 Generally under leases or licences in respect of a unit in a retirement village: • Residents have the right to occupy a particular unit and the right in common with other residents and other persons authorised by the operator to use the common areas and facilities of the village. • Retirement village operators are obliged to manage the village, to repair and maintain the village and to provide a security system for the village. • An emergency alarm system is installed in units and an emergency response service is available to all residents. • Residents must pay a loan or deposit which is repayable on termination of occupation. • Residents must also pay periodic fees which are calculated by reference to the costs of operating the village. If residents purchase a package of care services, the periodic fee payable is a higher amount. • A “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” is payable either up-front or on termination of a resident’s occupation. If the facilities fee or 16 amenities contribution is an up-front payment, the retirement village may be entitled to take the payment immediately or it may accrue to the retirement village over a period. If the facilities fee or amenities contribution is payable on termination, it is set off against the loan or deposit repayable to the resident. • Residents may also be required to pay the cost of refurbishing their units on termination of occupation and other termination charges. 56 In some cases, a resident’s contract obliges retirement village operators to supply a package of care services in addition to accommodation. The lowest level care package will typically include daily or weekly visits by a nurse, emergency call monitoring, removal of rubbish from the apartment, weekly cleaning of the apartment, provision of communal transport, organised activities and outgoings, weekly change of towels and bed linen, weekly personal laundry, morning and afternoon teas and the main meal each day. The highest level care package will typically equate to full rest home care. Generally a higher periodic fee is required where a care package is provided. If optional care or other services not included in a care package are supplied to residents at the request of residents, an additional charge is payable. 57 Where a unit is sold to a resident, residents have the right to similar services to those outlined above, including the right to use the common areas and facilities of the village. Generally the retirement village has either an obligation to re-purchase the unit or an option to purchase the unit. Debt security 58 The definition of “financial services” includes the issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance or transfer of ownership of a debt security: section 3(1)(c). 59 In Case S54 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,354 it was held that a “debt security” for GST purposes meant a loan. Therefore, even if a narrow interpretation of “debt security” is adopted, a loan or refundable deposit is a debt security. Most retirement village contracts involve a loan or deposit. 60 However, the definition of “debt security” is not limited to loans or deposits. The essence of the definition of “debt security” in the Securities Act 1978 is that money is deposited with, lent to a person or otherwise owing by that person so that the investor retains an interest in the money or a right to be repaid: Francken v Ministry of Economic Development (High Court, Dunedin; CRI 2008-412-000025; 1 December 2008) para 34. As under the GST Act, for Securities Act 1978 purposes the definition of debt security will be satisfied if under the transaction an investor has an interest in or right to be paid money, regardless of the form of the transaction. In Culverden Retirement Village Ltd v Registrar of Companies \[1997\] 1 NZLR 257, the Privy Council considered that an arrangement under which a unit was sold on the basis that a retirement village would re-purchase the unit at a specified price was a debt security under the Securities Act. 61 As the definition of “debt security” includes an interest in or right to be paid money that is to be owing, a debt security includes a right to be paid money in the future. 17 62 For the purpose of the Securities Act 1978 an allotment of a security is made by a person who offers securities to the public or who confers a right under a security (the issuer). Generally an allotment is made when the contract for the issue of the security is formed. This occurs when the issuer accepts a subscriber’s offer to purchase the security offered by the issuer. In exceptional cases, an allotment could take the form of dispositions of rights or interests. See DFC Financial Services Ltd (in statutory management) v Abel (1991) 2 NZLR 619 and Re Loan and Finance (Dunedin) Ltd (in rec) (1990) 5 NZCLC 66,367; Owers v Braemar Lodge 2004 Ltd (in receivership) (2010) NZCLC 264,677. 63 The issue of a security generally involves the delivery of a document or some act (such as the entry of the holder’s name on the register) that perfects the title of the holder of the security: Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd v Inland Revenue Commrs \[1978\] 1 All ER 248; Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Ltd v Deutsche Hypothekenbank Frankfurt-Hamburg Aktiengesselschaft (2008) NZCLC 262,208. 64 Before the Retirement Villages Act 2003 was enacted, offers of securities by retirement villages (being offers of securities to the public) were subject to the Securities Act: Culverden Retirement Village v Registrar of Companies \[1997\] 1 NZLR 257; Fenton v Pakuranga Park Village Trust Baragwanath J, HC Auckland CP 269/96, (1998) 3 NZConvC 192,681 (CA); Covenant Trustee Co v Ohope Lodge Ltd (Penlington J, 28 April 1993, HC Rotorua M70/90). Therefore, the contractual analysis that applies to public offers applies to retirement village schemes. A contract for the issue of a debt security is formed by a retirement village’s acceptance of a prospective resident’s offer. A debt security is allotted by the retirement village when it accepts the offer. 65 The Commissioner considers that the activities of a retirement village in allotting a debt security to a resident are a service to the resident. “Services” means some action that helps or benefits the recipient: Case S65 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,408; F B Duvall Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,470. When a retirement village allots a debt security to a resident, the retirement village undertakes a contractual obligation to pay money to the resident on termination of occupation. As a result, the resident receives a service (an action that is for the benefit of the residents), being the acceptance of an obligation to pay money. That service is a financial service (the allotment of a debt security under which the residents have a right to be paid money). 66 The Commissioner considers that a retirement village supplies a financial service (the allotment of a debt security) under any arrangement under which residents of a retirement village are entitled to receive repayment of all or part of the lump sum payment paid on entry to the retirement village. This is so whether or not the arrangement is a loan in form. 67 However, the Commissioner considers that a sale with an option to purchase in favour of the retirement village would not be a debt security as any right to receive money would be conditional on the option being exercised when occupation terminates. The most commonly accepted theory in relation to the nature of an option is that it is an offer to sell coupled with a contract not to revoke the offer: Alexander v Tse \[1988\] 1 NZLR 318. The purchase price becomes payable only if a contract for the sale and purchase of a unit is formed when the option is exercised. The 18 Commissioner accepts that in practice a retirement village that holds an option to purchase a unit will invariably exercise the option. However, where an option is granted in favour of a retirement village, the obligation on the part of the retirement village to pay the purchase price and the right of the resident to payment of the purchase price do not arise unless and until the option is exercised. Under an arrangement where a retirement village has an obligation to re-purchase a unit, residents have an absolute right to be paid the purchase price on termination of occupation. 68 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a retirement village supplies a financial service (the allotment of a debt security) under any transaction where the retirement village accepts an obligation to re-purchase a unit from a resident or to repay a loan or deposit. Consideration for debt security 69 The value of a supply is the consideration for the supply: section 10(2). The definition of “consideration” refers to “any payment... in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of a supply”. For the payments to be consideration for a supply, there must be a sufficient relationship between payments and a supply: CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR; Suzuki NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096; The Trustee, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076. The consideration for a supply may comprise a number of payments. In the Trustees Executors case a lease of land provided that in addition to rent, the tenant was required to pay the rates in respect of the land. Chisholm J considered that the payment of rates by the tenant was part of the “consideration” for the supply of the land. 70 If a payment is consideration under contract law, the necessary element of reciprocity in the relationship between payer and payee would be present and there would be a sufficient relationship between the payment made by the payer and a supply by the payee. Consideration under contract law has been defined as “the price for which the promise of the other is bought”: Dunlop v Selfridge \[1915\] AC 847. Therefore, if a payment is consideration for contract law purposes, the payment is consideration for GST purposes. 71 The Culverden case supports the view that under contract law an entry payment is consideration for a debt security (being the price paid for the promise by the retirement village to repay a loan or deposit to residents). In that case, the entry payment was in the form of the purchase price for a unit in the retirement village. In the High Court Morris J considered that the consideration for a debt security (the right to be paid money under the buy-back arrangement) was either the purchaser entering into the restrictive covenant or the original purchase price for the unit, or both. The Court of Appeal considered that the purchase price paid by residents was consideration for the unit and for other rights conferred on residents under their contracts (including the right to be paid money under the buy- back arrangement). That view is consistent with the judgment of the Privy Council which considered that a purchaser acquired two rights for the lump sum payment (the right to occupy a unit and the right, on termination of occupation, to be repaid the purchase price, subject to adjustment). 72 However, the Commissioner accepts that payments received in respect of the supply of financial services do not reflect the true value of the financial 19 services supplied and that for that reason, the principal under a debt security is not to be treated as the consideration for the supply of a debt security. 73 Therefore, the entry payment (the purchase price for a unit, loan or deposit) is not consideration for a debt security. Whether single supply of debt security 74 The Commissioner accepts that the Gulf Harbour case establishes that under the New Zealand legislation the focus is on what in legal terms is supplied and whether the supply satisfies the statutory definition of “financial services”. The Gulf Harbour case involved a sale of shares, which is a bundle of rights and is a single item of property: Re Alex Russell (1968) VR 285. The supply of a share carries with it all the rights that make up the share and results in the shareholder becoming entitled to those rights but the subject of the supply is the share rather than the rights that make up ownership of the share. The rights attached to the share did not determine the nature of the supply made. Therefore, the transfer of a share involved a single supply which was a financial service (being the transfer of an equity security). 75 The amendments made following Gulf Harbour override the Marac principle so far as transactions involving equity securities and participatory securities are concerned. However, the amendments do not apply to debt securities. Therefore, the analysis in Gulf Harbour remains applicable to debt securities. 76 The subject of the supply of a debt security is a debt security. Ownership of a debt security confers only one right on the recipient, the right to be paid money. The right to accommodation and other services are not rights that make up ownership of a debt security. The supply of a debt security does not result in the recipient having the right to accommodation and other services. In Gulf Harbour there was only one element in the transaction (the supply of the share, ownership of which conferred the right to membership of the golf club), which fell within the definition of “financial services”. Therefore, the Gulf Harbour case is distinguishable. 77 In the Culverden Retirement Village case the Privy Council held that a debt security was issued where an agreement for the sale and purchase of a unit in a retirement village required the retirement village to repurchase the unit. The Privy Council did not accept that the debt security was ancillary to the sale of the unit and considered that the purchaser acquired two rights: the right to occupy the unit and the right to be repaid the price paid for the unit (adjusted upwards or downwards according to the length of occupation, the condition of the unit and the movement of the market). In the context of considering whether the transaction involved an “investment of money”, the Privy Council considered that the return received by purchasers for the original purchase price was in the form of the use of the unit (together with necessary services) and in the form of the repayment of all or most of the initial payment. In other words, the true and substantial nature of the consideration provided for the original purchase price (the essential features of the transaction) was both the right to occupy the unit (and associated services) and the right to payment of the repurchase price (the debt security). 20 78 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the supply of a debt security is a separate supply from the supply of accommodation. Accommodation 79 “Accommodation” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (11th ed) as meaning: a room, building or space in which someone may live or stay. 80 “Accommodation” means lodgings; living premises; a place to live; somewhere where someone resides: Byrne v Glasgow Corporation (1955) SLT 9; Butter v Bennett \[1963\] Ch 185; Pulhofer v Hillington \[1986\] AC 484; Owen v Elliott (1990) STC 469; Urdd Gobaith Cymru v C & E Commrs (1997) V & DR 273. Care services 81 Care services are medical and nursing services and assistance with daily living and include the services provided as part of a care package. These services are described in paragraph 56. Whether single supply of accommodation 82 The supply of accommodation in the sense of a place to live is central to the concept of retirement villages and is an essential feature of the transaction between retirement villages and their residents. 83 For the reasons outlined in paragraphs 117 to 134, the Commissioner considers that the right to use the common areas and facilities is part of the dwellings in a retirement village (being an appurtenance belonging to and enjoyed with the dwellings). 84 However, if that conclusion is incorrect, the Commissioner considers that the right to use common areas and facilities is part of the supply of accommodation. 85 Without access to the dwellings over the common areas, it would not be possible to exercise the right to occupy the dwellings. 86 The availability of the recreational facilities in a retirement village may make a retirement village more attractive to prospective residents. However, the motives of the recipient and the way in which a retirement village is marketed are not relevant in determining the nature of a supply: see Gulf Harbour. It is also irrelevant that a retirement village may supply the right to use a Community Centre to non-residents (that is, separately from the supply of accommodation). In Gulf Harbour the Court of Appeal did not accept that the fact that in some cases, membership of a golf club was supplied separately from the supply of shares did not mean that in all cases two separate supplies were made. 87 In Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association v The Queen (2000) GTC 4104 (which concerned a lease under which the tenants were granted exclusive right to a lot on which a vacation cottage could be built and the right to use a golf course, club house, artificial lake and tennis court on the lessor’s property) it was held that the essence of the transaction was a long-term residential lease and that the taxpayer had not made a separate supply of 21 the right to use the recreational facilities and the right to compel the lessor to provide certain services. An analogy can be drawn with the transaction considered in British Airways plc v C & E Commrs \[1990\] STC 124 where the issue was whether in-flight catering was a separate supply from the supply of air transport. It was held that the supply made by British Airways was the supply of air transport of a particular standard and that the supply of food and beverages was an incidental part of the supply of air transport. The right to use the facilities in a Community Centre is ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation in the sense that the right contributes to the supply of accommodation of a particular quality. 88 In Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 17,212 the Court of Appeal noted that rights and services going with accommodation are part of the supply of accommodation (p. 12,216). 89 The amount of the periodic fees is calculated by reference to the costs incurred in operating a retirement village (including administration cost, rates, insurance, maintenance, depreciation, salaries, statutory costs, the costs of providing security, cleaning, gardening in respect of common areas and facilities). Generally the periodic fees include the cost of providing the emergency call response service. The periodic fees may also include an amount to cover the cost of transport services. Alternatively, a separate charge may be made for transport services on each occasion such services are supplied. However, the way in which a payment is calculated does not determine the nature of the supply made for the payment: Motorcorp. 90 The maintenance of the unit and of village facilities is part of the supply of accommodation, being services that make possible the supply of accommodation by keeping the unit and the village facilities in good repair. 91 The Commissioner considers that the supply of care services as part of a care package is not part of the supply of accommodation. Care services do not facilitate, enable or contribute to the supply of accommodation and are not a minor or incidental feature of the transaction. 92 The care services provided under a care package include an emergency response service. An emergency response service is also supplied to residents who do not purchase a care package. The Commissioner considers that where an emergency response service is the only care service provided, that service is a minor or incidental feature of the transaction and is not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration supplied for the payments made by residents. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the emergency response service is part of the supply of accommodation. 93 This view is supported by Wairakei Court Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,202 where it was held that: • the consideration payable by residents of the serviced apartments whose contracts provided for the supply of either full care or partial care was paid for the supply of both care and accommodation; and • the supply of the care component to residents of the villas (which could only be the emergency response service) was at best ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation. 22 94 The Commissioner also considers that the provision of transport services as part of a package of services is a minor or peripheral feature of the supply of accommodation and that the supply of transport services does not alter the nature of the supply made. 95 The Commissioner also considers that any additional optional care or other services supplied at the request of the resident for an additional charge are separate supplies made under separate transactions. 96 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that: • The supply of accommodation is an essential feature of a retirement village contract. • The supply of maintenance services are part of the supply of accommodation, being services that contribute to the supply of accommodation by keeping the unit and the village facilities in good repair. • The right to use the common areas and facilities is also part of the supply of accommodation. It would not be possible to use the units without access through the common areas. The right to use the facilities in a Community Centre are ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation in the sense that the right contributes to the supply of accommodation of a particular quality. • Care services supplied as part of a care package are not part of the supply of accommodation. Care services do not facilitate, enable or contribute to the supply of accommodation and are not a minor or incidental feature of the transaction. Where an emergency call response service is the only care service supplied, that service is a minor or peripheral benefit that does not alter the character of the supply. • Transport services supplied as part of a package of services is also incidental to the supply of accommodation. Transport services are peripheral or minor benefits that do not constitute a supply separate from the supply of accommodation. • Any additional optional care or other services supplied at the request of residents for an additional payment are separate supplies made under separate transactions. Consideration for the supply of accommodation 97 The Commissioner considers that the consideration for the supply of accommodation includes: • the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”; • the periodic fees; and • the refurbishment charge and other termination charges. 98 There is a clear relationship between the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”, the periodic charges and the refurbishment and termination 23 charges and the supply of accommodation. These charges are “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of” the supply of accommodation. “Facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” 99 The facilities fee is either: • An upfront payment that the retirement village is entitled to take immediately or that accrues to the retirement village over a specified period; or • A payment that becomes due on termination and that is deducted from the loan or deposit refundable to the resident. A payment may be made by way of set off: Re Harmony & Montague Tin & Copper Mining Co Ltd (Spargo's Case) \[1873\] 8 Ch App 407. The principle in Spargo’s case applies where there are mutual liabilities and an agreement that these liabilities would be set off: FCT v Steeves Agnew & Co (Victoria) Pty Ltd 9 ATD 259; Lend Lease Corporation Ltd v FCT 90 ATC 4401. The Commissioner considers that the obligation of a resident to pay the facilities fee is a separate obligation from the obligation of the retirement village to make payment under a debt security; therefore, there are mutual debts between a retirement village and the resident. It is also agreed that the facilities fee is to be deducted from the amount repayable to the resident. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” payable on termination is paid when the obligation of residents to pay the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” is set off against the obligation of the retirement village to repay the loan or deposit. 100 Under section 9(3)(a), if goods are supplied under an agreement for hire or services are supplied under any agreement that provides for periodic payments, the time of supply in respect of the goods or services is the earlier of the time when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. Leases or licences of units provide for periodic payments (periodic fees). The “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” is not consideration for a separate supply. 101 The Commissioner considers that in terms of section 9(3)(a): • Where an agreement requires the payment of an up-front facilities fee, a supply is made when the facilities fee becomes payable (generally at the same time as the loan or deposit). If the incorrect amount of output tax on the facilities fee has been paid as a result of early termination, section 25 would apply. Section 25 applies if the previously agreed consideration for a supply has been altered: section 25(1)(b). Section 25(2) would allow the retirement village to make an adjustment in the period during which it has become apparent that the output tax is incorrect. • Where the facilities fee is payable on termination, a supply is made when the facilities fee is set off against the loan or deposit repaid to the resident. On that date (the repayment date), the facilities fee becomes due for payment and payment is received by the retirement village by way of set off. 24 Periodic fees 102 Generally residents who have purchased a package of care services are required to pay a higher amount as periodic fees. In such circumstances the periodic fees are attributable to both the supply of accommodation and to the supply of care services. 103 Under section 10(6) a reduced rate of GST applies to the supply of “domestic goods and services” (being the supply of accommodation including, where they are supplied as part of the supply of accommodation, the services described in paragraphs (a) to (c) of the definition of “domestic goods and services”) in a commercial dwelling. Therefore, where the periodic fees are paid both for the supply of accommodation and for the supply of care services, it would be necessary to determine what proportion of the periodic fees is consideration for “domestic goods and services” for the purpose of section 10(6). Refurbishment costs and other termination charges 104 The Commissioner accepts that if residents have an obligation to refurbish their units on termination of occupation and that obligation is carried out by the retirement village, the refurbishment costs would be consideration for the carrying out of refurbishment work. In Suzuki NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 and in Motorcorp (where an overseas manufacturer had an obligation under the warranty given to the New Zealand importer to repair defective vehicles and the repairs were carried out by the New Zealand importer or its agents at the cost of the overseas manufacturer) the Court of Appeal considered that the reimbursement payment was consideration for the supply of repair services by the New Zealand importer. However, the Commissioner understands that generally residents have an obligation to pay for the costs incurred by the retirement village in refurbishing their units rather than an obligation to carry out the refurbishment of their units. 105 Residents are not a party to any contract for the sale, lease or licence of their units to a new resident. In marketing a unit and obtaining a replacement resident, retirement villages are acting for their own benefit. 106 Whether a lessee has an obligation to pay the lessor’s legal costs in connection with the preparation of a lease depends on the agreement between them. A lessor cannot recover such costs unless the lessor is liable for them: Metcalfe v Venables \[1921\] NZLR 576. Therefore, legal costs in relation to the preparation of a lease or licence (or the termination of a lease or licence) are costs for which the retirement village is primarily liable. A payment to a third party could be consideration. The crucial factor in determining whether a payment is consideration is whether there is a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply: Trustees Executors case. Use of the refundable payment 107 The provision of a loan or deposit interest-free or low interest results in an economic benefit to the retirement village in the form of use of money. However, the definition of “consideration” refers to a payment, act or forbearance. The use of money is not a payment, act or forbearance. 25 Exeter Golf and Country Club Ltd v C & E Commissioners \[1981\] STC 211 supports the view that a loan made at no interest or low interest could give rise to consideration (being consideration otherwise than in money) for the supply of accommodation. The Commissioner accepts that Exeter is not authority in New Zealand. The Exeter case was decided under legislation that did not define financial services and that did not contain a statutory definition of “consideration”. In Gulf Harbour it was considered that as financial services are not defined in the value added tax (VAT) legislation, the approach in Exeter and other United Kingdom cases relating to financial services is not applicable. 108 There are practical difficulties in applying the legislation to value the use of a loan and the time of supply rules in respect of consideration in the form of the use of a loan. Such difficulties may also lead a court to conclude that for GST purposes the use of a loan is not intended to be treated as consideration for a supply. 109 Financial services were exempted because of the difficulty of determining the consideration for financial services. A loan was considered to be an exchange of an asset (the principal) and income from the use of the asset (interest), that is, payments under a loan were considered to be a supply of money (not a supply of goods or services): Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax, Proposed Application of Goods and Services Tax to Financial Services (The Treasury, 1985); Carl Bakker and Phil Chronican, Financial Services and the GST: A discussion paper (Victoria University Press, 1985); Alan A Tait, Value Added Tax: International practice and problems (International Monetary Fund, 1988); Discussion Document on GST & Financial Services (2002). 110 Whether the facilities fee, the periodic fees and the refurbishment and other termination charges are subject to GST depends on whether they relate to the supply of accommodation in a dwelling or commercial dwelling. If the charges are paid for the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling (a taxable supply), they are subject to GST. This issue is considered in paragraphs 114 to 145. Section 14(1)(a) - issue or allotment of a debt security 111 The supply of financial services is an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a). The definition of “financial services” includes the issue or allotment of a debt security: section 3(1)(c). If one of the activities in section 3(1)(c) is carried out by a taxpayer, a service (being a financial service) would be supplied by the taxpayer. This is supported by Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188 and Gulf Harbour Development Ltd v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,192 (HC); (2004) 22 NZTC 18,915 (CA). In those cases the court held that the transfer of a security was a financial service. For the reasons outlined in paragraphs 58 to 78, the Commissioner considers that a retirement village makes an allotment of a debt security under any transaction where a retirement village accepts an obligation to re-purchase a unit or to repay a loan or deposit. 112 Section 14(1)(a) also applies to services that are reasonably incidental or necessary to the supply of financial services. The Commissioner does not accept that the supply of accommodation or other services is reasonably incidental or necessary to the supply of financial services. The reasons are as follows: 26 • “Incidental” means something that is incidental to or is usually associated with another activity or that occurs or is liable to occur in fortuitous or subordinate conjunction with another activity: Canadian National Railway v Harris \[1946\] 2 DLR 545; C & E Commrs v C H Beazer (Holdings) plc (1989) 4 BVC 121. The core activities of a retirement village are the supply of accommodation and care services. Debt securities are supplied to provide funding for the development of a retirement village where accommodation and other services are supplied. Accommodation and care are not generally supplied by financial institutions who supply debt securities. The supply of accommodation and care is not usually associated with, does not arise out of the supply of a debt security and is not liable to occur in conjunction with the supply of a debt security. • “Necessary” means indispensable, expedient or really needed: Shorter Oxford Dictionary; Re an Inquiry under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 \[1988\] 1 All ER 203. The supply of accommodation and care services is not indispensable, useful, expedient or really needed for the supply of a debt security, which are frequently supplied without such services. 113 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a retirement village supplies a financial service under any transaction where the retirement village allots a debt security by accepting an obligation to pay the purchase price on the re-purchase of a unit or to repay a loan or deposit. Such a supply is an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a), being the allotment of a debt security. Section 14(1)(a) does not apply to the supply of accommodation and other services. Such services are not reasonably incidental or necessary to the supply of a debt security. Section 14(1)(c) - supply of accommodation in a dwelling 114 The sale of a unit in a retirement village is a taxable supply. As section 14(1)(c) applies to the supply of accommodation by way of hire, service occupancy agreement or licence to occupy, section 14(1)(c) cannot apply where a unit in a retirement village is sold to a resident. 115 Potentially, section 14(1)(c) applies to the lease or licence of a unit in a retirement village as a lease or licence is a supply by way of hire or licence to occupy. However, for section 14(1)(c) to apply, the supply must be the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. Meaning of dwelling 116 The definition of “dwelling” refers to “any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof”. Therefore, part of a building may be a dwelling. To be a dwelling, a place must be used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual. Appurtenances 117 A dwelling includes “appurtenances belonging to \[the dwelling\] and enjoyed with it”. 118 The Shorter Oxford Dictionary(6 th ed) defines “appurtenance” as follows: 27 1 A minor property, right, or privilege, subsidiary or incidental to a more important one; an appendage. 2. A contributory adjunct, an accessory. 3. The fact or state of appertaining. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary definition indicates that an appurtenance is a “minor property, right, or privilege” that is subsidiary or incidental to a more important one. 119 Historically, it was considered that only rights in respect of land (incorporeal hereditaments) could be appurtenances and that land could not be appurtenant to other land: Lister v Pickford (1865) 34 Beav 576. An incorporeal hereditament is a right over land that does not entitle the owner to possession of the land: Halsbury’s Laws of England Real Property Vol 39(2) para 74. 120 An easement is an incorporeal hereditament and may be an appurtenance. An easement is an interest in land and not merely a personal right: Auckland City Council v Man O’War Station Ltd \[1996\] 3 NZLR 460; Kawau Copper and Sulphur Developments Ltd v District Land Registrar \[1980\] 2 NZLR 529. 121 Later case law established that land can be an “appurtenance”: Trim v Sturminster Urban District Council \[1938\] 2 All ER 168; Methuen-Campbell v Walters \[1979\] 1 All ER 606. In Trim v Sturminster Slesser LJ considered that the word “appurtenance” included nothing that would not pass under a transfer of a house without being specifically mentioned and that this limited “appurtenances” to land within the curtilage and incorporeal hereditaments (p. 516). In Case M64 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,363 Judge Bathgate considered that “appurtenance” will pass with the house, the rights, privileges and accessories to the house. 122 Whether the above interpretation of “appurtenance” is applied depends on the context in which the word is used. If a word or phrase has received a judicial interpretation, that interpretation will be applied to the word or phrase in the same context in subsequent legislation. In the context of legislation that applied to flats that may not have their own curtilage, to be an appurtenance, land need not pass with the transfer or assignment of the flat without being specifically mentioned. It was sufficient if the land is within the building of which the flat forms part or within the curtilage of the building: see Cadogan v McGirk \[1996\] 4 All ER 643. 123 The meaning of “appurtenances” in the context of retirement villages was considered in Norfolk and Wairakei. 124 Norfolk concerned a retirement village consisting of a four-storey building containing 22 apartments with garages underneath. The building took up one-third of the land area and was surrounded by gardens and landscaped grounds, paths and driveways. Access to the apartments was through common areas (corridors, stairwells, driveways, parking areas and the like). Other common areas included community and reception lounges, a library, an activities room, a consulting room, visitors’ car parking spaces, and the gardens and the grounds. Residents were granted occupation licences of the apartments and garages for terms of 99 years. The rights granted under the licence included a right to the use and enjoyment of common areas. 28 125 The Court of Appeal in Norfolk distinguished Trim v Sturminster and Methuen-Campbell v Walter on the basis that all of the land was within the curtilage of the building in which the apartments were situated. The court also considered that shared rights could be appurtenances and that given that the definition of dwelling refers to appurtenances “belonging thereto and enjoyed with” the building or premises, Parliament must have intended appurtenances to include a non-exclusive right to use areas and facilities situated outside four walls of the apartment and garage in respect of which residents had exclusive use. The Court of Appeal said (at page 12,215): In our view the common areas and the facilities upon them, the use and enjoyment of which is promised to the residents of the dwellings in the occupation licences, are appurtenances to the dwellings. On the subject of “appurtenances” Mr Martin referred us to Trim v Sturminster Urban District Council \[1938\] 2 All ER 168 in which it was held that the word “appurtenances” in the definition of “house” in a statute had to be given its natural meaning and could not be extended to cover land outside the curtilage of the house. In that case the land consisted of a house with 10 acres of grassland and cow-stalls capable of accommodating 10 or 12 cows. It is unsurprising that the part of the land which was being farmed was not regarded as an appurtenance. But significantly the Court observed that in the early case of Bryan v Wetherhead (1625) Cro Car 17 “appurtenances” of a house had been held to include its orchard, yard, curtilage and gardens. In another authority referred to by Mr Martin, Methuen-Campbell v Walters \[1979\] 1 All ER 606, it was held that whether land fell within the curtilage of other land was a question of fact and that a paddock physically separated from a house was not within the curtilage of the house and was therefore not an appurtenance for the purposes of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. That case is also clearly distinguishable. In the present case the whole of the land in question is laid out in driveway, paths, gardens and landscaped grounds for the use and enjoyment of occupants of residences in the building and all of it is accordingly integral to and within the curtilage of the building. Mr Martin also argued that the rights of the residents relating to the common areas were not “accommodation in any dwelling by way of ... a licence to occupy” because those rights were not in themselves accommodation and because a “licence to occupy” means a “right to exclusive personal occupancy” and therefore cannot extend to shared areas and facilities. However, we think that rights and services going with accommodation are properly to be regarded as part of the accommodation provided to residents and that the element of exclusivity and occupation need not extend to those rights and services. Rights appurtenant to a title to land are very often shared with others. When it included within the term “dwelling” the appurtenances “belonging thereto and enjoyed with” the building or premises we do not think that the Legislature would have had in mind only those amenities which were exclusively contained within the walls of a dwelling or garage. \[Emphasis added.\] 126 Norfolk is consistent with Cadogan v McGirk \[1996\] 4 All ER 643, which confirms that appurtenances may include land within the building in which the apartments are situated or within the curtilage of the building in which the apartments are situated. However, Wairakei, which concerned detached buildings that had their own curtilage, cannot be explained on that basis. Wairakei concerned a retirement village that consisted of a rest home complex with 37 beds, six villas (stand-alone units) and 17 studio units that were contained in one building. Occupants of the villas were entitled to use community facilities. Chisholm J considered that (on the basis of the authority of Norfolk) the common areas and facilities were appurtenances to the villas. Chisholm J did not consider whether the common areas and facilities were within the curtilage of the villas. 127 Both Wairakei and Norfolk concerned non-exclusive rights to use land. The Commissioner considers that the basis for the decisions in Norfolk and 29 Wairakei is that the right to use the common areas and facilities was an appurtenance, rather than the land or building comprising the common areas and facilities being an appurtenance. Areas within a Community Centre to which residents do not have access are not within the meaning of “common areas and facilities”. 128 The Commissioner considers that the right to use the common areas and facilities is an easement and is an appurtenance of dwellings in a retirement village, including dwellings occupied by residents under an arrangement described as a licence. The reasons are as follows: • In Norfolk and Wairakei the court considered that a right to use common areas and facilities was appurtenant to dwellings occupied by residents under an arrangement that was described as a licence. • As the definition of “dwelling” is relevant to the interpretation of section 14(1)(c) and section 14(1)(c) does not apply to the sale of a dwelling, the legislation contemplates that for land or a right to use land to be an appurtenance, the recipient of the supply of accommodation need not be the legal owner of a dwelling to which the appurtenance belongs. • For the right to use the common areas and facilities to be an easement and, therefore, an appurtenance of dwellings in a retirement village, residents need not hold legal title to their units. A lessee may acquire an easement: Halsburys Laws of England Easements and Profits à prendre para 17. In Trim v Sturminster, Methuen-Campbell v Walters and William Hill v (Southern) Ltd v Cabras Ltd (1987) 54 P & CR 42 the meaning of “appurtenance” was considered in relation to property that was subject to a lease. The test of whether an arrangement is a lease or a licence is whether the right of exclusive possession is conferred: Fatac Ltd (in liq) v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,903. As residents in a retirement village invariably have the right to exclusive possession of their dwellings, they are lessees even if the transaction is described as a licence. In Cashmere Capital Ltd v Crossdale Properties Ltd (2008) NZCPR 766 (HC); 2010\] 1 NZLR 577 the court held that as residents in a retirement village had the right to exclusive possession of their units, an occupation loan agreement relating to the units was a lease. • The right to use the common areas and facilities has the other essential characteristics of an easement. It would not be possible to use and enjoy the dwellings in a retirement village without means of access to the dwellings over the common areas. A right to use the gardens and the recreation facilities in a Community Centre may be the subject of an easement, being a right that is reasonably necessary for and that is sufficiently connected to the normal enjoyment of the dwellings as a place to live. Re Ellenborough Park \[1955\] 3 All ER 667; Ryan v Penttila VR 547. For a right to be the subject of an easement, the right conferred must be sufficiently defined and must not amount to joint occupation: Re Ellenborough Park. A right to use a garden, park or recreation facilities satisfies that requirement. • The land subject to the easement and the land having the benefit of the easement need not be contiguous but they must be sufficiently close that the easement benefits the land having the benefit of the easement: Todrick v Western National Omnibus Co Ltd \[1934\] Ch 564. The Commissioner considers that a Community Centre in a retirement 30 village that is on the same site and that is part of the same complex is sufficiently close to benefit the dwellings. • The right of residents to use a Community Centre may be limited to certain times or to certain areas but this does not mean that the right to use a Community Centre cannot be a right affecting land. A right granted under an easement may be for limited purposes or limited as to the time when the right may be exercised: Hart v Timmins (High Court, Palmerston North; CIV-2006-454-353; 4 October 2006); Leon Asper Amusements Ltd v Northmain Carwash Enterprises Ltd (1966) 56 DLR (2d) 173; Coleman v Shand (2004) 5 NZ ConvC 194,019. The fact that a retirement village has the right to vary the hours of access to a Community Centre does not mean that the right to use a Community Centre is a licence rather than an easement. The owner of the land subject to the easement may reserve the right under the easement to vary the terms of the easement: Greenwich Healthcare National Health Service Trust v London and Quadrant Housing Trust \[1998\] 3 All ER 437. • An equitable easement will be recognised and enforced if the right has the essential characteristics of an easement, consideration is provided and there is sufficient memorandum in writing or part performance: Read v Read (1999) 4 NZ ConvC 139,077. Residents provide consideration for the right to use the common areas and facilities. In all cases, there would be sufficient memorandum in writing of the grant of the right to use the common areas and facilities as there is normally a written agreement between a retirement village and its residents. 129 In Re Ellenborough Park the court considered that a mere right of recreation “possessing no quality of utility or benefit” would not be an easement; therefore, a right granted to residents to use the zoo or the right to attend Lords cricket ground without charge could not be an easement because these rights were wholly extraneous to and independent of the use of the house as a place to live. Therefore, the right to receive services such as nursing, meals and transport cannot be an appurtenance. The right to use facilities outside the boundary of a retirement village (such as a right to membership of a golf club) is not an appurtenance. 130 In some contexts, the phrase “belonging to” indicates ownership: Myerson v Collard v the Commonwealth (1918) 25 CLR 154. However, the words “belonging to” in the context of the definition of “dwelling” relate to a “building, premises, structure or other place”, which cannot own or possess something. The Commissioner considers that: • Whether a building belongs to a principal building depends on whether the use of the building is associated with and is part of the use of the principal building; and • A degree of physical separation between two buildings does not mean that one does not belong to the other. An ancillary building belongs to the principal building if the two buildings are on the same site, are adjacent to (next or adjoining: Concise Oxford Dictionary) each other or sufficiently close to each other so that the use or occupation of the ancillary building is for all practical purposes part of the use or 31 occupation of the principal building. To belong to the principal building, the ancillary building need not be contiguous with (neighbouring or connected with) the principal building. See English Clays Lovering Pochin & Co Ltd v Plymouth Corporation \[1974\] 2 All ER 239; Re Red Lion Inn Ltd \[1979\] 2 NZLR 668 and Re Angus Hotels Ltd (1986) 6 NZAR 148. 131 “Enjoyed” means “having had the amenity or advantage of using” and is nearly equivalent to “having had the use of”: Cooper v Straker (1888) 40 Ch D 21. 132 An appurtenance belongs to and is enjoyed with a dwelling if the use of an appurtenance is part of the use and occupation of a dwelling and the resident of the dwelling has the right to use the appurtenance together with the dwelling. The Commissioner accepts that there must a reasonable degree of proximity between the dwellings in a retirement village and a Community Centre before the right to use the Community Centre could be said to be associated with and part of the use of the dwellings. However, it is unlikely that a Community Centre would be so geographically distant from the dwellings that the use of the Community Centre could not, in practical terms, be associated with and used with the dwellings. The Commissioner considers that the right to use the common areas and facilities in a retirement village is an appurtenance that belongs to the dwellings in a retirement village, being a right that is connected with and that is part of the use of the dwellings in the retirement village as a place to live. 133 Residential rentals were exempted because of the practical difficulty of collecting GST on residential rentals and to place owner–occupiers and tenants on the same footing: White Paper on Goods and Services Tax: Proposals for the administration of the goods and services tax (New Zealand Government, 1985). The extension of the definition of “dwelling” to include appurtenances belonging to or enjoyed with a dwelling means that the entire amount of the consideration paid for the supply of accommodation in a dwelling, including rights going with the supply of accommodation, is exempt. 134 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the right to use the common areas and facilities for access or for recreation purposes is an appurtenance of dwellings in a retirement village, including dwellings occupied under an arrangement described as a licence. Commercial dwelling or dwelling? 135 A commercial dwelling is not a dwelling. The definition of “commercial dwelling” includes convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes and hospices, and establishments that are similar to convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes and hospices: paragraphs (c) and (d) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” in section 2. However, a dwelling situated within a retirement village is not a commercial dwelling, if the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy the dwelling: paragraph (f) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” in section 2. 136 A rest home is a residential institution where old or frail people are cared for: Concise Oxford Dictionary (11th ed). In Wairakei Court Ltd v CIR 32 (1999) 19 NZTC 15,202, it was considered that the studio units situated in a retirement village fell within paragraph (c) of the definition of “commercial dwelling”. The court considered that in substance the studio units were no different from the rest home in the retirement village as both accommodation and care were provided there. 137 To be similar to a convalescent home, nursing home, rest home or hospice, an establishment need not be exactly the same as a convalescent home, nursing home, rest home or hospice. “Similar” does not mean identical or exactly the same: Mays v Roberts \[1928\] SASR 217; NZ Central Region etc Local Government Officers’ Union v Lower Hutt City Council (1992) 1 ERNZ 558; Adelaide Caravan Park Pty Ltd v Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (1985) ALD 75. In Case L75 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,435, 1, 440, Judge Keane considered that the premises in question, although not exactly the same as a hotel, a motel, an inn, a hostel or a boarding house, shared some significant defining features of such establishments, so were a commercial dwelling. The Commissioner considers that the significant defining features of convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes and hospices are the provision of accommodation and care and that to be similar to a convalescent home, nursing home, rest home or hospice, an establishment must have those features. 138 The units in a retirement village will generally be predominantly used as a place of residence or abode of the residents and may, therefore, be dwellings. In a Canadian GST case it was held that the rooms in a “nursing home and senior care centre” were occupied by the patients as their “place of residence”, North Shore Health Region v R (2006) GSTC 134. 139 Therefore, potentially units in a retirement village could be regarded either as a collection of dwellings (each of the units being a place that is used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of a resident) or as a commercial dwelling (being a rest home or an establishment that is similar to a rest home). However, if paragraph (f) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” applies to a unit situated in a retirement village, the unit is a dwelling (rather than part of a commercial dwelling) for the purpose of section 14(1)(c). In Wairakei Chisholm J made the following comments on paragraph (f) (at pages 15,209–15,210): In 1990 the definition of “commercial dwelling” was amended (by inserting para (f)) to ensure that dwellings situated within a retirement village or a rest home complex would be governed by the same rules as other dwellings ie the supply of accommodation would be exempt. Notwithstanding the close links between such a dwelling and the remainder of the retirement village or rest home complex Parliament had seen fit to notionally sever the dwelling from the remainder of the complex so that the dwelling would qualify as an exempt supply. \[Emphasis added.\] The effect of paragraph (f) is that if a retirement village contains dwellings (being units to which paragraph (f) applies), the retirement village as a whole will not be a commercial dwelling, although parts of the retirement village may be a commercial dwelling. Paragraph (f) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” 140 Paragraph (f) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” applies to a dwelling within a retirement village or rest home, if the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in the dwelling is for the right 33 to occupy the dwelling. The distinction between rest homes and retirement villages may be blurred, both being places where care and accommodation are provided for senior citizens. The inclusion of “rest home” in paragraph (f) means that it is unnecessary to decide where the boundary between rest homes and retirement villages should be drawn. 141 In Wairakei it was considered that paragraph (f) applied to some units situated in a retirement village (the villas) but that paragraph (f) did not apply to other units (the studio units). Residents of the studio units were required under their licence to pay a weekly rest home fee for full or partial care, in addition to the licence fee and occupation loan. Chisholm J noted that if a resident breached his or her obligations under the licence, the licence could be terminated on one month’s notice. The court did not distinguish between the two levels of care provided to residents of the serviced apartments. The essential difference between the serviced apartments and the villas was that in order to be entitled to occupy the studio units, residents were required to also pay for (and were entitled to receive) care services. Residents of the villas were not required to receive and pay for care services in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation. The consideration that villa residents were required to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation related solely to the supply of accommodation. 142 The Commissioner considers that to decide whether paragraph (f) applies it is necessary to: • identify the consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation. The consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation will normally include the entry payment, the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”, the periodic charges, and exit payments. Optional payments that residents make if they require additional services are not part of the consideration that residents are contractually required to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation. This does not mean that the total amount of the consideration that would be payable by residents over the period of their occupation must be determined. It requires consideration of the terms of the agreement under which residents obtain a right to occupy a unit in a retirement village (generally a lease or the licence). • determine whether such consideration is for the supply of accommodation is for the right to occupy the dwelling (that is, for the supply of accommodation). Where residents have a right to occupy a dwelling in a retirement village, there is a corresponding obligation on the part of the retirement village to supply accommodation. 143 Paragraph (f) applies to a unit in a retirement village, if the consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay to be entitled to the supply of accommodation is for the supply of accommodation (including appurtenances to a dwelling and including goods or services that are ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation). Paragraph (f) does not apply where the consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay to be entitled to accommodation relates to the supply of services other than accommodation. Where residents have purchased a care package, the consideration that they are contractually obliged to pay to be entitled to accommodation is for the supply of accommodation and 34 care services. The fact that a contractual obligation to pay for care services is suspended during any period of temporary absence when care services are not provided does not mean that the consideration that residents are obliged to pay to be entitled to occupy a unit does not include consideration for care services. 144 This view is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the legislation. The purpose of paragraph (f) is to determine whether a unit in a retirement village is to be classified as a dwelling for the purpose of section 14(1)(c), which applies only to the supply of accommodation. The legislation contemplates that both taxable and exempt supplies of accommodation (including the right to use the common areas and facilities) will be made in a retirement village. The policy underlying paragraph (f) is that the supply of accommodation in a retirement village is intended to be exempt from GST where the contract under which accommodation is provided is for the supply of no more than accommodation. 145 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that: • Paragraph (f) would not apply to units whose residents have purchased care packages. Therefore, such units are part of a commercial dwelling so that the supply of accommodation in such units is a taxable supply. • On the basis of contractual arrangements that are currently entered into between retirement villages and their residents, paragraph (f) would apply to other units. Therefore, such units are dwellings. The supply of accommodation in such units is an exempt supply. Participatory security 146 A right under a participatory security to receive a taxable supply for no consideration (other than the consideration for the participatory security) or a below-market consideration is an associated supply: see definition of “associated supply”. If an associated supply is supplied under a participatory security, the exemption for financial services does not apply to the associated supply: section 14(1B). An associated supply is treated as a separate taxable supply: section 5(14B). 147 A “participatory security” for GST purposes: • is an interest in or right to participate in any capital, assets, earnings, royalties or other property; • is an interest or right that forms part of a contributory scheme (as defined in the Securities Act 1978); • includes an interest in a unit trust; and • does not include an equity security, a debt security, money or a cheque. 148 In R v Smith \[1991\] 3 NZLR 740, 748, Wylie J accepted that the concept of participation involves some form of sharing with others even if only with the promoter of the scheme. 149 A “contributory scheme” is defined in the Securities Act as meaning: 35 any scheme or arrangement that, in substance and irrespective of the form thereof, involves the investment of money in such circumstances that— (a) The investor acquires or may acquire an interest in or right in respect of property; and (b) Pursuant to the terms of investment that interest or right will or may be used or exercised in conjunction with any other interest in or right in respect of property acquired in like circumstances, whether at the same time or not;— but does not include such a scheme or arrangement if the number of investors therein does not exceed 5, and neither a manager of the scheme nor any associated person is a manager of any other such scheme or arrangement : 150 In Culverden the Privy Council considered (obiter) that the expression “investment of money” includes schemes under which the return is received in the form of capital (the initial investment) or in the form of income in cash or in kind (or both). A similar view was expressed in Munna Beach Apartments Pty Ltd v Kennedy (1983) Qd R 151, 155–156, which concerned a similar concept in the Australian companies legislation (“investment contract”), where the court considered that an investment implied the payment of money in the expectation of some form of return, whether in the form of money or otherwise. 151 Case law on the interpretation of “investment contract” under the Australian companies legislation indicates the following: • For an interest or right in respect of property to be used or employed in common with the interest or right of other investors, there must be a sharing in the return from the investment. The main factor that must be considered is whether the purchaser is able to exercise individual control over the property. • Where the right obtained is the ownership of a specific apartment together with a share of the common area, each owner will merely be exercising their individual rights as co-owner of land to use the common area. See Munna Beach; Brisbane Unit Development Corp Pty Ltd v Deming No 456 Pty Ltd (No 2) (1983) 2 Qd R 92; Jones v Acfold Investments Ltd FCR 512, Amadio Pty Ltd v Henderson 81 FCR 149; Butterworth v Lezem Pty Ltd (1983) 1 ACLC 821. 152 A scheme with five or fewer investors is not a contributory scheme. This exception would apply in respect of a retirement village scheme if the scheme involved five or fewer residents. 153 A contract may include separate and quite different securities: Culverden. In the High Court in Fenton v Pakuranga Park Village Trust (HC Auckland CP 269/96) Baragwanath J considered that a retirement village scheme involved both a debt security and a participatory security conferring on residents a right to occupy a unit in the village and to receive repayment of a deposit on termination of occupation. In the High Court in Norfolk, Robertson J considered that a licence in respect of an apartment in a retirement village was a participatory security. In Covenant Trustee Co v Ohope Lodge Ltd Penlington J, 28 April 1993, HC Rotorua M70/90, a retirement village scheme was referred to as a participatory security for Securities Act 1978 purposes. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that 36 although a debt security cannot be a participatory security (being excluded from the definition of “participatory security”) a retirement village scheme could include more than one security and could include both a participatory security and a debt security. 154 The issue in Fenton was whether a proposal to sell land occupied by a bowling green and to re-site the bowling green would constitute a breach of the retirement village’s obligation under the licence not to alter the basic scope and nature of the facilities provided as part of the village. The Court of Appeal in Fenton \[(1998) 3 NZConvC 192,681\] did not consider whether the scheme involved a “participatory security”. However, the Court of Appeal considered that the obligation under the licence not to alter the basic scope and nature of the facilities was indivisible (that is, a right owed to residents as a group). The Court of Appeal also considered that NZ Guardian Trust (which was both the trustee for the residents in respect of the deposits and the statutory supervisor under the deed of participation) had separate obligations in respect of the debt security and the participatory security. The obligations under the participatory security related to the protection of the residents under their licences, including the right to preservation of the basic nature and scope of the facilities provided as part of the village for the use of residents. This suggests that the rights of residents in respect of the common areas and facilities were not individual rights but rights enjoyed in common with other residents. 155 Residents have separate rights under a debt security and a participatory security that form part of a retirement village scheme. Under the debt security residents have a right to be paid money (the repurchase price, loan or deposit). Under the participatory security residents have a right to the use and enjoyment of the village facilities. 156 Therefore, if a retirement village scheme includes a participatory security under which an associated supply is made (the right to receive the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling for no consideration or for a consideration that is below the open market value), the consideration attributable to the supply of accommodation would be subject to GST. That being the case, if accommodation is supplied in a commercial dwelling, the supply of accommodation would be a taxable supply, whether or not a participatory security is also supplied. If an associated supply is supplied under a participatory security, the right is treated as a taxable supply for all purposes, including when applying the principal purpose test. INPUT TAX 157 An input tax credit is allowable on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Principal purpose test 158 In Wairakei, Chisholm J summarised the principles relating to the application of the principal purpose test as follows (at page 15,206): The key issue is whether the goods and services for which input credits are claimed were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies or of making exempt supplies. Thus the test known as the “principal purpose” test is of considerable importance. Within a GST context the following features of the principal purpose test seem to be relatively well settled: 37 (1) Purpose is a reference to the object that the taxpayer had in mind or in view. This is not synonymous with intention or motive. Moreover, care must be taken to avoid confusing the means by which the taxpayer achieves its purpose with the purpose itself: C of IR v BNZ Investment Advisory Services Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,111; Norfolk Apartments Limited v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,003 (HC) and (1995) 17 NZTC 12,212 (CA). (2) The principal purpose is the main, primary or fundamental purpose. This does not equate with a more than 50% test: BNZ Investment Advisory Services Limited; Norfolk Apartments. (3) Where the taxpayer is a company its purpose is to be determined by examining the collective purpose of those in control: C of IR v National Distributors Limited (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346. (4) The principal purpose is to be ascertained as at the time the goods and services were acquired: National Distributors Limited and Case M53 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,312. (5) The focus should be on individual supplies: Norfolk at p 12,006. 159 Therefore, the application of the principal purpose test requires the relevant supply to be identified and the principal purpose for which the supply was acquired to be determined. Identifying the supply 160 In Wairakei, Chisholm J applied the principal purpose test separately in respect of the studio units, which were part of a single building, and detached villas (including the land on which these buildings stood). The supply of the villas (which were separate capital assets from the building containing the studio units) was a separate supply from the studio units. 161 In Norfolk, the court did not accept that the principal purpose test should be applied separately to the common areas and facilities in the village. The retirement village in Norfolk included an apartment building surrounded by landscaped grounds. The common areas and facilities were leased to a related company, which supplied the right to use and enjoy the common areas to residents. Rental was paid to Norfolk by the related company for the common areas and facilities. It was accepted that the apartments in the village were dwellings. Norfolk argued that two-thirds of the land (the common areas and facilities) was not used for the construction of the apartment building and that the supply of the common areas and facilities was a taxable supply; therefore, on an area basis the principal purpose was for making taxable supplies. The court rejected this argument. 162 In the High Court in Norfolk, Robertson J considered that as the ratios of density and development were dictated by resource management requirements, the percentages of actual use did not provide helpful evidence as to the principal purpose for acquisition of the land and construction of the development. The principal purpose of the development was the accommodation (an exempt supply). The use of the common areas was essential to the enjoyment of the apartments. Access to the apartments could be obtained only through part of the common areas. The right to use the common areas and facilities was an appurtenance of the apartments (and, therefore, part of the dwellings in the village). Therefore, the common areas and facilities were acquired for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies. 38 163 The Court of Appeal in Norfolk noted that the supply of accommodation was central to the concept of a retirement village and, as the common areas and facilities were ancillary to the apartment building, the only conclusion that could be reached was that Norfolk’s principal purpose in acquiring the land and entering into the construction contract was to provide accommodation in dwellings. The court considered that even if the taxpayer had made two supplies (the supply of the dwellings and the supply of the common areas and facilities under the lease to the related company), as the rights of residents relating to the common areas were appurtenances to the dwellings, the right to use the common areas and facilities was part of the supply of accommodation. The Court of Appeal said (at page 12,215): It is unconvincing for Norfolk to assert that its principal purpose can be seen from the fact that about two-thirds of the land was not required to be utilised for the erection of the apartment building itself. (It points out also that some of the space within the building is common area.) A glance at the site plan showing the substantial apartment building centrally positioned on the land and the balance of the property depicted as developed for gardens, driveway, paths and other facilities which are obviously ancillary to the building is sufficient to dispose of the argument. Norfolk may now wish to say that its principal purpose was to provide a package for the residents of the retirement village but common sense suggests that what must have been uppermost in the minds of the Tuke family was the supply of the apartments (the dwellings), for without them the project would simply not exist. They are obviously central to the concept of a retirement village. The only conclusion which can sensibly be reached is that Norfolk’s principal purpose in acquiring the land and entering into the construction contract was to be able to provide accommodation in dwellings situated within a retirement village by way of licences to occupy. That is an exempt supply. It follows that the goods and services acquired by Norfolk were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and that no input tax deduction is available. Even if the conclusion had been that there were two proposed supplies, one of the dwellings and the other, under the lease, of the common areas and the facilities upon them, Norfolk still faced another insuperable difficulty in its argument that the purpose relating to the common areas was the principal purpose. That is because the definition of “dwelling” means not only the building or premises but also “any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it”. In our view the common areas and the facilities upon them, the use and enjoyment of which is promised to the residents of the dwellings in the occupation licences, are appurtenances to the dwellings. 164 If the principal purpose test is satisfied in respect of a supply of goods and services, a full input tax credit is allowed: CIR v Coveney (1994) 16 NZTC 11,329 (HC); (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 (CA). In Coveney the court rejected the Commissioner’s argument that the legislation contemplates apportionment of the input tax credit on a supply of goods and services. In Case S56 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,361 Judge Barber commented that Coveney made it clear that if the principal purpose test is satisfied, a full input tax credit is allowed on goods and services. Case Z12 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,142 confirms that under the principal purpose test an input tax credit is allowed on an all or nothing basis. 165 Generally the development of a retirement village involves the purchase of bare land and the construction of a retirement village complex on the land. Land acquired for the purpose of a retirement village development under a single transaction is a single supply of a single property. The individual goods and services that go into the construction and development of a retirement village acquired under separate transactions are separate supplies. However, if the principal purpose test is satisfied in respect of the asset or assets produced using these individual supplies, the principal purpose test would be satisfied in respect of the individual supplies that go into a retirement village development. Areas of a Community Centre such 39 as a kitchen or dining room that are used exclusively for the purpose of making taxable supplies are not a supply that is separate from the supply of the Community Centre as a whole. The principal purpose test is to be applied to the Community Centre as a whole. 166 The Commissioner considers that: • Where a retirement village includes both dwellings and a commercial dwelling, the dwellings and the commercial dwelling are treated as separate supplies. The villas and the studio apartments are treated as separate supplies because the effect of paragraph (f) is that dwellings within a retirement village are notionally severed from the remainder of a retirement village complex: Wairakei. • The principal purpose test is not applied separately in respect of the common areas and facilities, roading, landscaping, lighting and other similar infrastructure costs or separately to areas within a community centre. As the supply of the right to use the common areas and facilities is part of the supply of units in a retirement village, whether the principal purpose test is satisfied in respect of the common areas and facilities depends on whether the retirement village principally supplies exempt supplies of accommodation or taxable supplies of accommodation and other services. The right to use the common areas and facilities is granted to residents of both dwellings and a commercial dwelling within a retirement village complex. Therefore, it is not possible to argue that the parts of the common areas and facilities that are immediately adjacent to the commercial dwelling part of a retirement village were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies in a commercial dwelling in the village. Areas within a community centre such as the kitchen, dining room and nursing station that are used exclusively for the purpose of making taxable supplies are not a separate supply. The principal purpose test is to be applied to a supply as a whole. Determining the principal purpose 167 The principal purpose is to be determined at the time of acquisition. In determining the principal purpose all relevant circumstances (including objective and subjective matters) are to be considered. Both immediate and long-term or ultimate purposes that would be fulfilled in the future may be relevant in determining the principal purpose. In Wairakei, Chisholm J did not accept that a long-term or ultimate objective or purpose was necessarily irrelevant and that only the immediate object or purpose should be taken into account in determining the principal purpose. The court considered that although the principal purpose for which goods or services were acquired is to be ascertained at the time of acquisition, purposes that would be fulfilled in the future may, in some cases, be relevant in determining the principal purpose. 168 The principal purpose could be satisfied although no taxable supplies have been made in the period in which goods or services were acquired. However, there must be objective factors to support the taxpayer’s stated intention. In the retirement village context it would be necessary to have regard to matters such as the nature of the development permitted by the resource consent, the disclosure statement required to be provided to 40 prospective residents under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 and the form of the occupation right agreement intended to be entered into with residents. 169 Norfolk and Wairakei suggest that as the central purpose of a retirement village is the supply of accommodation, the nature of the supply of accommodation supplied will normally determine whether land acquired and construction contracts entered into for the development of a retirement village were for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The supply of the common areas and facilities is ancillary to the supply of accommodation, which is the fundamental purpose of a retirement village. Therefore, whether the supply of the right to use the common areas and facilities is a taxable supply depends on the nature of the supply of accommodation. 170 At the time that land is acquired, development plans may not be finalised. However, the principal purpose at the time of acquisition is to be ascertained. Whether the principal purpose test is satisfied in respect of land acquired for the purpose of a retirement village development depends on whether the intended use of the land is principally for the purpose of making taxable supplies (the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling, the supply of care or other personal services). Both subjective and objective factors are relevant in determining the principal purpose: Wairakei. Therefore, there must be objective evidence of the intended use of the land (such as planning applications, feasibility studies and preliminary designs). 171 A building could include both dwellings and commercial dwellings. In applying the principal purpose test to such a building, it is necessary to consider whether on an area basis the building is used principally for the purpose of making taxable supplies. The use or intended use to which a building is put is relevant evidence of the principal purpose in acquiring the building and may be determinative of the principal purpose: Case S16 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,123. Overhead costs relate to goods and services that may not be directly used in making particular supplies. It is appropriate to assess the principal purpose for which overhead costs are incurred on the basis of the ratio of taxable supplies to exempt supplies (the turnover method). However, it is not necessary to use the turnover method to determine the principal purpose for acquiring a building as it is possible to identify the use or uses to which the building is put. Determining the principal purpose on the basis of the ratio of residents in the dwelling and commercial dwelling areas of a building may not give a true picture of the principal purpose for which a building was acquired. There may be more residents in the commercial dwelling part of a building but the dwellings could occupy more of the building on an area basis. It may be necessary to ascertain the principal purpose before a building is occupied. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the principal purpose in acquiring a building is to be determined on the basis of the use or intended use of the building. Input tax adjustments 172 If the principal purpose test is not satisfied in respect of a supply of goods or services, an input tax adjustment may be allowable to the extent that the goods or services are applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies if: 41 • the goods or services were acquired on or after 1 October 1986; and • GST was charged on the supply of the goods or services; or • the goods are secondhand goods that have always been situated in New Zealand and were acquired by way of sale: section 21E. The input tax adjustment is based on the lesser of the cost of the goods and services or the open market value of the goods and services: section 21F. 173 If the principal purpose is not satisfied in respect of goods and services, an input tax adjustment must be allowed to the extent that such goods and services are applied in any taxable period for a purpose of making taxable supplies, based on the lesser of the: • cost of the goods and services; or • open market value of the goods and services. 174 The term “applied” has a wider meaning than “used”. In Case N13 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,105, 3,113 Judge Bathgate considered that “applied” meant “put to the use of” and that goods and services may be applied in an active or passive manner pending their supply. In Case N22 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,187, 3,193-3,194 Judge Bathgate said that “use” meant “direct, physical involvement or use” while “apply” meant “put to practical use”. In Case N31 (1991) 13 NZTC 2,377, 3,279 Judge Bathgate considered that “used” may have a physical connotation while the application of property may be a more passive concept. In practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between the use and application of a property. A property could be used in a passive way (including when an owner obtains some advantage from the property without doing anything to it): Sloss v Sloss (1989) 5 FRNZ 148. In CIR v Lundy Family Trust (2006) 22 NZTC 19,738 the Court of Appeal considered that properties acquired for the purpose of sale and rented for residential purposes pending their sale were used and applied for both taxable purposes and exempt purposes. The properties continued to be part of the taxpayer’s trading stock and remained on the market. At the same time the properties were dedicated to use (applied) for both residential rental purposes and taxable purposes: see para 41 and 43. Some act by the taxpayer would be necessary to establish that goods and services had been applied for a particular purpose. 175 The extent to which goods and services are applied for the purpose of exempt supplies is to be determined either according to the actual use of goods and services or by using the formula in section 21A(2), which determines the proportion of the turnover attributable to taxable supplies. Any method that is used must ensure that the allocated amounts are fair and reasonable: section 21A(1)(b) and (3). An input tax adjustment is intended to reflect the extent of the taxable use of a good or service acquired and the adoption of some measure that is a fair and reasonable approximation of the actual use is required. Measures based on distance travelled, time spent, the numbers of transactions of particular types, area used for different activities and the actual use of goods or services usually give an accurate estimate of how a good is intended to be used or is used. Indirect estimation methods may be appropriate where there are overhead expenses that are not directly referable to particular supplies. Indirect methods that may be used are based on turnover or profit. 42 176 Taxpayers have an option of making input tax adjustments on a periodic or an annual basis. Section 21G(1) says that the input tax adjustment is to be allowed in either of the following: • In each taxable period in which the goods and services are applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies. • In each year in which the goods and services are applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies. (However, if an annual deduction is made, the amount of the deduction made in any subsequent period must be reduced by the amount of the deductions made in any earlier period). 177 A one-off adjustment is allowable in the following circumstances: • If the goods are capital assets with a cost of less than $18,000, a one- off deduction may be made in the taxable period during which the goods are applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies: section 21G(1A). • If goods and services costing more than $18,000 are wholly applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies and the Commissioner allows a single deduction to be made, a one off deduction may be made in the taxable period in which such goods and services are wholly applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies: section 21H(1). 178 “Capital asset” is not defined in the legislation. The GST Act does not distinguish between capital and revenue. “Capital asset” is an income tax concept. For income tax purposes capital assets are acquired for retention and use in carrying on a business while revenue assets are assets that are acquired for sale: Sun Newspaper Ltd and Associated Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1939) 61 CLR 337; Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131; CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. In the GST context in Case K55 (1988) 10 NZTC 453 Judge Bathgate accepted that a car that was used in carrying on the taxpayer’s sheepfarming activity was a capital asset. The Commissioner considers that for GST purposes, a capital asset is an asset that is acquired for retention and use in carrying on a taxable activity whereas revenue assets are acquired for sale. 179 In some circumstances, it may be necessary to consider whether an item is a separate asset. The Interpretation Statement on Residential Rental Properties – depreciation of items of depreciable property provides some guidance as to the matters to be considered in determining whether an item is a separate asset, although the Interpretation Statement considers this issue only in relation to residential rental properties. Common areas and facilities 180 A retirement village may include a commercial dwelling or dwellings. Residents of both dwellings and commercial dwellings in the village have the right to use the common areas and facilities. A community centre may also include areas such as kitchens, restaurants and nurses’ workstations that are used solely for the provision of taxable services. 181 The Commissioner considers that to the extent that part of a community centre (such as kitchens, restaurants and nursing stations) is used for the preparation and provision of meals and the provision of nursing care, such 43 an area would be used and applied solely for the making of taxable supplies. Therefore, an input tax adjustment would be allowable under section 21F based on the lesser of the cost or market value attributable to that part of the community centre that is exclusively used for the making of taxable supplies (the supply of meals and nursing services). 182 The Commissioner also considers that, to the extent that the right to use the common areas and community facilities is made available for the use of residents of a commercial dwelling in a retirement village, the common areas and community facilities would be applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies. Such common areas and community facilities will also be applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies if residents of dwellings in the retirement village (parts of the village to which paragraph (f) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” applies) also have the right to use these areas. The Commissioner considers that an apportionment based on the proportion of commercial dwellings to dwellings (that is, the number of units that are commercial dwellings relative to the number of units that are dwellings) in the retirement village would be fair and reasonable and would reflect the use of the common areas and facilities for both taxable and exempt supplies to all residents. 183 If the cost of the capital assets that make up the common areas and facilities (including land, buildings, roading, landscaping and lighting) exceeds $18,000 (as is likely), a one-off input tax adjustment would not be permitted. A building that is a separate physical structure constitutes a capital asset separate from the other assets that make up a retirement village complex. The Commissioner considers that it is unlikely that separate paths and roads within a retirement village complex constitute separate capital assets for the purpose of section 21G(1A). The fact that paths and roads may have been constructed at different times is not determinative. The roads and paths in a retirement village form a network for vehicle and pedestrian travel within a retirement village and in and out of the complex and function together as part of that network. 184 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a one-off input tax adjustment would generally not be allowable in respect of a community centre (or other building) or in respect of parts of the common areas such as paths, roads and infrastructure costs that are applied for both taxable and exempt supplies. 185 The input tax adjustment is based on the lesser of the cost and the market value of the common areas and facilities. The cost of the goods and services means their acquisition cost: Lundy. In Lundy, the court accepted that the cost of land and buildings (which were used for both taxable and exempt supplies over more than one taxable period) in each taxable period was to be determined on the basis of the depreciation rate. The cost of the common areas and the community centre includes the cost of the land within the common areas and the land on which a community centre is constructed, the cost of constructing the community centre, roads and footpaths and landscaping. Therefore, the cost of the common areas and community centres in each taxable period would be depreciation on the land and buildings comprised in the common areas and community centre. Dwellings 186 The Commissioner does not consider that dwellings in a retirement village (being parts of the village to which paragraph (f) of the definition of 44 “commercial dwelling” applies) would be applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies merely because taxable supplies such as nursing, meals and cleaning services are provided there. Dwellings would not be applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies merely because taxable supplies that have no relationship with the dwellings are provided to residents in the dwellings. Dwellings are not applied (used) for the provision of a cleaning service; the cleaning service is something that is done to the dwelling. 187 The Commissioner also does not accept that the dwellings in a retirement village are applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies where the dwellings provide a catchment for the remainder of the village. Although it is likely that residents in a retirement village will require more care as they age and a retirement village may anticipate that residents would transfer from dwellings to a serviced apartment or rest home in the same village, there is no obligation on residents to do so. While dwellings are occupied as dwellings, they are applied solely for the purpose of making exempt supplies. Output tax adjustments 188 An output tax adjustment would be required in respect of goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and that are applied for another purpose. Section 21C requires output tax adjustments to be made at one of the following times: • In the first taxable period in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. If a taxpayer makes an output tax adjustment in that period, the taxpayer is required to make further output tax adjustments to reflect further changes of use of 20 percent or more. • In each taxable period in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. • In each year in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. 189 Goods and services would be “applied” for a particular purpose if they are allocated for a particular purpose. Therefore, land or other goods or services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies could be “applied” for a non-taxable purpose before it is actually used for a non-taxable purpose. The Commissioner considers that land acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies would be applied (dedicated to use) for the purpose of making exempt supplies if the land has been surveyed and an identifiable area of land has been allocated for the construction of dwellings where exempt supplies of accommodation will be made. The area is also used for the purpose of making exempt supplies in the sense that an advantage is obtained from holding the land for use in making exempt supplies. 190 The Commissioner considers that land, buildings and other assets in a retirement village are not used or applied for the purpose of supplying debt securities. Debt securities are issued to finance the development of retirement villages. Hence, the objective of supplying debt securities is the acquisition of buildings where exempt or taxable supplies of accommodation and other services will be made. 45 191 Taxpayers have an option of making an output tax adjustment in the first taxable period, in each taxable period or in each year in which goods and services are applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies: section 21C. The Commissioner considers that land or a building would be applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies of accommodation when a particular area of the land or a building is allocated for that purpose and the land or a building would continue to be applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies while they continue to be used for that purpose. 192 Section 21A specifies the methods for calculating the extent of the application for a non-taxable purpose. The output tax adjustment is based on the lesser of the cost of the goods and services or the open market value of the supply: section 10(8). “Cost” means the acquisition cost: Lundy. EXAMPLES 193 It is not possible to provide examples relating to every factual situation that may arise in respect of supplies made or received by retirement villages. The following examples are intended to provide guidance on common situations. Example 1 194 RV Ltd is building a retirement village. The village will include a block of 50 apartments and 200 stand-alone villas, roads, landscaped gardens and a community centre, including a lounge, kitchen, dining room, nursing station, library, theatre and bowling green. The cost of the common areas and facilities amounted to $2 million. 195 A licence in respect of an apartment or villa is granted to residents. Under the licence, residents have a right to use the common areas and facilities. Residents are required to pay an up-front facilities fee of $50,000 and are required to make an interest-free loan of $250,000-. The facilities fee accrues to RV Ltd at the rate of $10,000 per year over five years. The loan is repaid when residents leave the village. Residents of apartments are required to pay a weekly fee for accommodation and care services (including the provision of meals and linen, the cleaning of their room or apartment, and the provision of activities and outings and nursing services). Residents of the villas are required to pay a lower weekly fee for the right to use the common areas and facilities but are not required to pay for and receive care services. If residents of the villas require any additional services such as meals or nursing services, an additional charge is payable. 196 As the consideration that residents of the apartments are required to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation is for both accommodation and other services, the apartments are a commercial dwelling. The supply of accommodation and care services in the apartments is a taxable supply for which the consideration is the facilities fee and the weekly fees. GST is chargeable on the facilities fee and the weekly fees paid by residents of the apartment. 197 The villas are dwellings as the consideration that residents must pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation relates solely to the supply of accommodation including the right to use the common areas and 46 facilities, which is an appurtenance of the dwellings and is, therefore, part of the dwellings. The supply of accommodation in the villas under the licence is an exempt supply. GST is not chargeable on the payments made by residents of the villas, except additional payments for the supply of meals or care services made at the request of residents. 198 RV Ltd is entitled to an input tax credit for goods and services acquired for the purpose of constructing the apartments (including the land on which they stand). An input tax credit is not allowable in respect of goods and services acquired for the purpose of constructing the villas as they are acquired for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies of accommodation. 199 The principal purpose test is not satisfied in respect of the common areas and facilities as the village largely consists of dwellings (the villas). A one- off adjustment is not allowable as the common areas and facilities are a capital asset that cost more than $18,000. As the cost of the common areas and facilities is less than their market value, periodic input tax adjustments would be calculated on the basis of the depreciation rate relating to the land and building comprised in the common areas and facilities in the following manner: • As the kitchen, dining room and nursing station will be exclusively applied to the making of taxable supplies (the supply of meals and nursing services), an input tax adjustment would be allowable on the basis of the depreciation rate relating to the land and building comprised in these areas. The retirement village has an option of making an input tax adjustment in the first taxable period, in each taxable period or in each year in which the kitchen, dining room and nursing station are applied for making taxable supplies. The first taxable period in which the kitchen, dining room and nursing station are applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies is the period in which it is determined that specific areas of the building will be allocated for the purpose of the kitchen, dining room and nursing station and the kitchen, dining room and nursing station will continue to be applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies while they continue to be used for that purpose. • As the remainder of the common areas and facilities will be available for the use of residents of both the commercial dwelling part of the village and residents of dwellings in the village, they are applied both for taxable supplies and exempt supplies. The commercial dwelling part of the village represents 20 percent of the village. An input tax adjustment based on 20 percent of the depreciation rate attributable to the remainder of the common areas and facilities would be allowable in each taxable period. (In this example, the amount of the input tax adjustments has been calculated on the basis of the ratio of dwellings to commercial dwellings in the retirement village. However, another method of calculating an input tax adjustment would be acceptable provided it results in fair and reasonable amounts.) Example 2 200 ABC Ltd owns and operates a retirement village that comprises an apartment building that includes garages, a library, theatre, kitchen, dining room and nursing station and is surrounded by gardens, paths and driveways. 47 201 A lease for life in respect of a resident’s apartment and a garage in the basement of the building, together with a right to use the common areas and facilities of the village, is granted to residents. Residents are required to pay an entry payment of $300,000. On the termination of the lease, the entry payment less the following charges is repaid to residents: • a facilities fee of $50,000; • a refurbishment charge, the amount of which depends on the period of occupation. Residents are also required to pay a weekly fee for the management of the village. Residents have an option of receiving meals or care services on payment of an additional charge. 202 The apartments are dwellings as the consideration payable in order to be entitled to occupy an apartment in the village (the facilities fee, the periodic charges and the refurbishment charge) relates solely to the supply of accommodation (including the right to use the common areas and facilities, which is an appurtenance of the apartments, and including management services, which are incidental or ancillary to the supply of accommodation). GST is not chargeable on the facilities fee, the periodic charges, the refurbishment charge or the entry payment as these payments are consideration for exempt supplies (the supply of accommodation in a dwelling by way of hire and the supply of a financial service). Any additional payments for the optional supply of care and other services relate to a taxable supply and are subject to GST. 203 An input tax credit is not allowable in respect of land and construction costs relating to the apartment and the common areas and facilities. However, input tax adjustments would be allowable in respect of the kitchen, dining room and nursing station. The basis for calculating and the timing of such input tax adjustments is as outlined above. Example 3 204 XYZ Co Ltd acquires land for the development of a rest home complex. The rest home beds are intended for residents who require a high level of care. The rest home is a commercial dwelling (para (c) of the definition of “commercial dwelling”). The supply of accommodation and care in the rest home is a taxable supply. An input tax credit is allowable on land and construction costs incurred in developing the rest home complex. 205 A decision is later made to expand the retirement village by the construction of 200 villas and a community centre that includes recreational facilities available to residents of the villas, a kitchen, dining room and administration areas. A licence to occupy is granted in respect of villas and serviced apartments. Residents of the villas must pay a refundable deposit of $300,000. The deposit is refundable on termination of occupation. Residents must also pay a facilities fee of $50,000 on termination of occupation and periodic fees. As the consideration payable by residents for the supply of accommodation relate solely to the right to occupy a villa, the villas are dwellings and the supply of accommodation in the villas is an exempt supply. 206 An output tax adjustment must be made as the land will be applied in part for the making of exempt supplies. As the cost of the land allocated for the purpose of the villas, the recreation facilities and other common areas 48 to which residents have access is less than its open market value, the output tax adjustment is based on the cost of the land. The extent to which the land is applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies may be calculated on an area basis. However, the output tax adjustment may be calculated on the basis of the proportion of the turnover from the making of taxable and exempt supplies (or another method of calculation) if the method results in a fair and reasonable output tax adjustment. 207 The retirement village elects to make the output tax adjustment in each year in which the land is applied for the making of taxable supplies. However, the retirement village would also have been permitted to make the output tax adjustment at either of the following times: • in the first taxable period in which the land and common areas and facilities are applied for the making taxable supplies. The land would be applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies when it is determined that a particular area of the land would be allocated for the construction of the villas and community centre and the common areas serving the villas; or • in each taxable period in which the land is applied for the making of exempt supplies.
Interpretation Statement IS 11/01 INCOME TAX - DEPRECIATION: MEANING OF “OBSOLESCENCE” IN THE DEFINITION OF “ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE” All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. This Interpretation Statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the meaning of the term “obsolescence” in s EE 63. This statement also sets out practical examples of the kinds of considerations that the Commissioner will take into account when setting the estimated useful life of an item of depreciable property based on obsolescence. 2. Section EE 63 defines the term “estimated useful life”. The estimated useful life of an item of depreciable property ("an item") is used to set the depreciation rate for that item. The longer the estimated useful life of an item, the lower the depreciation rate for that item will be. The shorter the estimated useful life of an item, the higher the depreciation rate will be. There is, therefore, a timing advantage in having a shorter, rather than longer, estimated useful life. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for items of depreciable property that they own using an appropriate depreciation rate. Section EE 63 provides that certain factors must be taken into account when determining the estimated useful life of an item. One of the factors in s EE 63, which is relevant to setting general, special and provisional depreciation rates, is "obsolescence". 3. The word “obsolescence” may have different meanings in different contexts. In the context of s EE 63, obsolescence involves a reduction in the period for which an asset might be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income for reasons (other than physical deterioration or wear and tear) such as economic, technological or other external causes that affect the estimated useful life of the item. The estimated useful life of an item is relevant when the Commissioner sets a general depreciation rate, or considers applications for special or provisional depreciation rates. Obsolescence will cause an item to no longer be useful in deriving assessable income before the end of its physical life. However, an obsolete item will not necessarily be completely useless. 4. Whether an item is affected by obsolescence is a question of fact to be judged objectively. An item will be obsolete if causes external to that item, and outside the control of the taxpayer, will result in it being no longer useful in deriving assessable income before the end of its physical life. For obsolescence to affect the estimated useful life of an item, there must be a reasonable certainty that it will become obsolete and a sufficiently clear indication of when this would be likely to occur. The nature of obsolescence can be described in the following terms:  Obsolescence is the process whereby an asset loses its economic usefulness or ability to function in a business through causes other than physical deterioration or wear and tear. 1  Obsolescence may arise from factors that are inherent to the item (functional obsolescence) or that constitute a change to the environment or conditions surrounding an item (economic obsolescence).  Obsolescence may arise from such circumstances as changes in the way in which the business is undertaken, shifting of business centres, loss of trade, technological changes, new inventions, inadequacy, and prohibitory laws where those factors result in a decrease in the estimated useful life of the item by making that item become obsolete.  Obsolescence may arise from technological changes or the development of more modern improved alternatives that are significant enough to affect the useful life of an item and mean that the item has been superseded by improvements. However, obsolescence does not equate to an item simply being suboptimal or there being “better” or more modern alternatives. The difference is that the more modern improved alternatives must be significant enough to affect the estimated useful life of the item. 5. Obsolescence is not contributed to by the following:  The mere presence of a business failure or market forces of supply and demand that do not impact on the item. For instance, a desire to cease, enhance, or expand business operations will not contribute to obsolescence.  The mere fact that an item is abandoned, demolished or scrapped or that there is a decision to do so. The presence and impact of obsolescence must be determined having regard to the status of the item before its abandonment, demolition or scrapping.  The availability of newer or better alternatives, which do not affect the estimated useful life of the item. 6. An item can become obsolete in many different ways. Therefore, this statement does not provide an exhaustive list. As stated above, whether an asset is becoming obsolete is a question of fact to be determined objectively. In considering whether an item is affected by obsolescence, in each particular case, the focus is on establishing whether there is a set of considerations that will affect the usefulness of an item or, in other words, the item’s estimated useful life. 7. Where obsolescence is present, the item will eventually become unsuitable for the purposes of the business, such that the item will no longer contribute to the income-earning process. This requires a reasonable certainty that an item will become obsolete, and a sufficiently clear indication of when this would be likely to occur, for obsolescence to affect the estimated useful life of the item. Analysis 8. This analysis explains the meaning of the word “obsolescence” in s EE 63. The Commissioner must take any obsolescence into account when setting the 2 estimated useful life of an item. This Interpretation Statement analyses the wording and statutory context of s EE 63 and relevant case law. 9. The following analysis considers the statutory context of s EE 63 together with the ordinary and commercial meaning of the word “obsolescence” and analyses the case law on the term “obsolescence”. This statement then explains what the Commissioner will take into account when determining whether obsolescence is affecting an item’s estimated useful life. Statutory context for the term “obsolescence” in s EE 63 10. Section DA 1(1) provides that a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss. However this is only to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred by the person in deriving their assessable or excluded income or both, or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income or both. 11. Generally, a person is not allowed a deduction for a capital item: s DA 2(1). However, s DA 4 overrides s DA 2(1) by expressly providing that a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss. 12. Section EE 1 provides that subpart EE quantifies the amount of depreciation loss a person is allowed as a deduction under Part D of the Act. Depreciation loss refers to the amount of depreciation allowable in an income year under s EE 1(2). Section EE 1 also quantifies the amount of depreciation recovery income that is income under Part C. Depreciation recovery income arises when a person disposes of an item of depreciable property. 13. In setting a depreciation rate for an item the Commissioner must determine the “estimated useful life” of an item based on the definition of that term in s EE 63. Section EE 63(1) provides the following definition of the term “estimated useful life”: EE 63 Meaning of estimated useful life Meaning for item of depreciable property, except for copyright in sound recording (1) Estimated useful life, for an item of depreciable property, other than a copyright in a sound recording, means the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, taking into account— (a) the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence; and (b) an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. 14. The purpose of s EE 63 is to determine the estimated useful life of an item, taking into account the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence. The estimated useful life of an item is relevant when the Commissioner sets a general depreciation rate, or considers applications for special or provisional depreciation rates. A person may apply for a special depreciation rate when the general economic rate for that item is not appropriate. Depending on a taxpayer’s particular circumstances, alternatives to applying for a special rate include writing off the item (s EE 39) or disposing 3 of the item and claiming a depreciation loss for the amount by which the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value (s EE 48(2)). 15. In setting the estimated useful life of an item, the Commissioner must make a reasonable estimate of the period for which an item might be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income. This estimate is based on information available to the Commissioner at the time the rate is set. The longer the estimated useful life of an item, the lower the depreciation rate for that item will be. The shorter the estimated useful life of an item, the higher the depreciation rate will be. There is, therefore, a timing advantage in having a shorter, rather than longer, estimated useful life. 16. “Obsolescence” is not defined in the Act. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret the meaning of the term “obsolescence” as it is used in s EE 63. The following analysis considers the ordinary and commercial meaning of the term “obsolescence” and relevant case law. Ordinary meaning of the term “obsolescence” 17. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary (6th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2007) defines “obsolescence” as: 1 The process or state of becoming obsolete or falling into disuse. ...b A diminution in the value or usefulness of consumer goods, machinery, etc., owing to technological advances, changes in demand, etc. 18. In addition, “obsolete” is defined as: A adjective. 1 No longer practised or used; going out of use, out of production, or out of date. B noun. A thing which is out of date or has fallen into disuse; 19. Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed, Thomson West, St Paul, Minnesota, 2004) defines “obsolescence” as: Obsolescence, 1. The process or state of falling into disuse or becoming obsolete. 2. A diminution in the value or usefulness of property, esp. as a result of technological advances. For tax purposes, obsolescence is usu. distinguished from physical deterioration. Cl. DEPRECIATION. \[Cases: Taxation 348(4).\] economic obsolescence. Obsolescence that results from external economic factors, such as decreased demand or changed government regulations. – Also termed external obsolescence. Cf. functional obsolescence. external obsolescence. See economic obsolescence functional obsolescence. Obsolescence that results either from inherent deficiencies in the property, such as inadequate equipment or design, or from improvements in the property since its use began. Cf. economic obsolescence. planned obsolescence. A system or policy of deliberately producing consumer goods that will wear out or become outdated after limited use, thus inducing consumers to buy new items more frequently. – Also termed built-in obsolescence. 20. The dictionary meaning of these words indicates that obsolescence involves a reduction in the usefulness (and so the value) of an item for reasons other than physical deterioration or wear and tear. Examples of obsolescence are losses of value or usefulness of an item as a result of inherent deficiencies in that item, 4 rapid technological advances, changes in the demand for products, or changes in government regulation. Obsolescence is also described as a process that suggests items affected by obsolescence will continue to have some utility until they become obsolete. The result is that the item will become obsolete, or fall into disuse, before the end of its physical life. Commercial meaning of the term “obsolescence” 21. The notion of obsolescence is also frequently referred to in commercial contexts. Again, obsolescence is distinguished from physical deterioration or wear and tear. Often, although not always, the cause of the item becoming obsolete will be external to that item of property – such as economic changes, technological advances, and changes in demand that affect the estimated useful life of an item. 22. The Penguin Dictionary of Economics (7th ed, Penguin Books, London, 2003) defines obsolescence as (at p 281): A reduction in the useful life of a capital good or consumer durable through economic or technological change or any other external (durable goods) changes, as distinct from physical deterioration in use (depreciation). For example, a new process or machine may be developed that renders existing equipment uneconomic because a firm could significantly reduce its costs by scrapping its existing machinery even though it might still have many years of physical life. Then the old equipment has become obsolescent. 23. The CCH Macquarie Dictionary of Accounting (Business ed, CCH Australia, Sydney, 1991) defines obsolescence as: Obsolescence – the state of having gone out of use, become out of date, especially as caused by new alternatives being available. An asset (e.g. machinery) may become obsolete when a more cost-effective alternative appears on the market. Obsolescence is one of the factors which determines the useful life of a non-current asset. It can be hard to predict, as it is closely related to the technological advances and changes in demand. 24. The Dictionary of Accounting and Finance Terms (4th ed, Addison Wesley Longman, Auckland, 1996) defines obsolescence as: The outdating of a product or process caused by improved alternatives becoming available that will be more cost-effective resulting in a decline in the market value of an asset. The decline in market value is unrelated to physical changes in the asset itself. Obsolescence is one of the factors which determines the economic life of a fixed asset, which in turn is one of the elements determining the basis of depreciation charged against the fixed asset. 25. These definitions show that obsolescence is a reduction in usefulness due to causes other than physical deterioration or wear and tear, such as economic, technological, or other external causes that affect the estimated useful life of the item. 26. The commercial commentaries appear to have extended the meaning of “obsolescence” to situations where an item may lessen in usefulness simply because more efficient alternatives are developed. The Commissioner considers that this expanded commercial definition of obsolescence is not directly applicable to the meaning of “obsolescence” in s EE 63. This is because, in the context of s EE 63, in order for obsolescence to be taken into account, the availability of newer and better alternatives must be significant enough to 5 reduce the estimated useful life of the item. The relevant case law shows that the availability of newer or better alternatives will cause an item to become obsolete only if the item has been “superseded by improvements”. In the situation described by the Penguin Dictionary of Economics (where an item is scrapped because it is uneconomic) to establish obsolescence for income tax purposes it would be necessary to show that the scrapping of the item is or will be necessary because, for example, new parts are no longer available. Case law New Zealand case law on obsolescence 27. The term “obsolescence” in s EE 63 has not been judicially discussed in any New Zealand cases. However, in Para Handkerchief & Textiles (1964) Ltd v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,125 the High Court considered the meaning of the phrase “by the fact of the asset becoming obsolete or useless” as it appeared in s 108(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 was the predecessor to the current depreciation rules and where applicable, gave the Commissioner the power to allow such deduction as the Commissioner thought just. The High Court determined that the assets owned by the company suffered a reduction in value, not because they had become “obsolete or useless” but because the company could not operate profitably and the assets had to be sold for the best price that could be achieved. The decreased price received was caused, not by the state of the assets, but because of supply and demand. 28. The High Court judgment in Para Handkerchief is relevant to determining the meaning of the term “obsolescence” as this case considered the process of an item becoming obsolete. Jaine J stated (at p 9,128): The wording of sec 108 is not such that it is necessary to establish that depreciation caused the asset to become “useless” but rather the converse, namely, that an asset has depreciated “by the fact of the asset becoming ... useless”. 29. Obsolescence can contribute to a reduction in the economic usefulness of property through causes other than physical deterioration. Unlike depreciation as a result of “fair wear and tear”, the High Court in Para Handkerchief stated that obsolescence is not always as a result of a gradual process (at p 9,128): This Court could readily accept that depreciation caused by “fair wear and tear” denotes a gradual process. Similarly depreciation could occur “by the fact of the asset becoming obsolete or useless” where that state has been reached gradually - but that is not necessarily so in relation to obsolescence or uselessness. It is possible to conceive of situations where that state has been caused by rapid technological changes or a particular event or series of events which may occur in a short space of time. 30. In Para Handkerchief the relevant items had been disposed of before the taxpayer’s claim for obsolescence. Disposal or termination of use is not a requirement in the New Zealand statutory context for the Commissioner to determine whether obsolescence is relevant. Where an item is disposed of or its use is terminated, however, the Commissioner considers that the presence or absence of obsolescence is to be determined before the item is disposed of or its use terminated. 6 Objective test for obsolescence 31. In Para Handkerchief the taxpayer pointed to the United Kingdom High Court of Justice (King’s Bench Division) decision in South Metropolitan Gas Company v Dadd (1927) 13 TC 205 and submitted that the test for obsolescence should be a subjective test. Jaine J rejected a subjective test for determining if obsolescence was relevant, stating (at p 9,130): But it does not follow from the dictum of Rowlatt J that he was saying that “obsolete” means “obsolete in the hands of or in the opinion of the taxpayer” ie the subjective test urged on this Court by the objector – otherwise South Metropolitan Gas Company v Dadd would have been decided differently. Indeed that was recognised by Rowlatt J when he concluded his judgment in this way: “It is impossible for me to say on the facts here that this ship was, as a matter of fact, obsolete, because, unless I were to say that whenever a man says a thing is obsolete, it is obsolete, I could not decide that, and it is impossible to say that. There is always the possibility ... that the Company here merely wanted something rather better, not because the old thing had been superseded by improvements, but they wanted rather a better ship, because it would suit their purposes better .... and I think under those circumstances, it is open to the Commissioners to say the plant has not become obsolete....” Whether an asset has become “obsolete” or “useless” is a question of fact but it cannot be said that if a taxpayer claims an asset is “obsolete” or “useless” because it either chooses not to use it or cannot use it by reason of business failure then the Commissioner is bound to accept that it is “obsolete” or “useless” within sec 108(1)(b). 32. The objective test for obsolescence means that items a taxpayer considers to be obsolete or less useful to them may not necessarily be affected by obsolescence. Presence of obsolescence is a question of fact 33. In Para Handkerchief Jaine J considered South Metropolitan Gas Company and the Supreme Court of South Australia decision in Robertson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1928\] SASR 313. Jaine J noted that the statutory regimes considered by those cases were different to that contained in s 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. This was because the sections considered by those cases related to a situation in which a taxpayer had replaced the item said to have become obsolete and the deduction was allowed only to the extent of the cost of the replaced item after deduction of earlier allowances for fair wear and tear and any sum realised from the sale of that item. This was intended to encourage the purchase of new items. Further, the Australian provision considered in Robertson also required the useless state to have resulted from wear and tear, which is not a requirement for obsolescence because wear and tear is provided for separately in s EE 63(1)(a). As stated by Jaine J in Para Handkerchief, obsolescence does not require the obsolete state to be reached gradually (like wear and tear). Therefore, the United Kingdom and Australian case law on obsolescence or uselessness must be interpreted with these comments in mind. 34. The decision in South Metropolitan Gas Company concerned a taxpayer who owned and operated steamships carrying coal. The taxpayer replaced an old steamship with a superior vessel. Rowlatt J upheld the Special Commissioner’s decision that obsolescence was not relevant. 7 35. Rowlatt J refused to interfere with the decision of the Special Commissioners that obsolescence was not relevant in this case because obsolescence was a question of degree and so a question of fact (at p 210). Rowlatt J did, however, set out a few general comments on obsolescence, stating that (at p 210): There is always the possibility–and this is what I think the Commissioners may have thought; so far as I can see, they did think–that the Company here merely wanted something rather better, not because the old thing had been superseded by improvements, but they wanted rather a better ship, because it would suit their purposes better. The old ship and the new ship are both contemporary types of ships as far as that goes, but they wanted rather a better one because they thought it would be more useful for the way they were going to carry on their business, and that is all: and I think under those circumstances, it is open to the Commissioners to say the plant has not become obsolete. 36. By stating that both of the ships were contemporary types of ships, Rowlatt J left open the possibility that technological changes may cause obsolescence and may, objectively, contribute to a decrease in the estimated useful life of the item. In this case, however, the fact that there were more superior vessels (such that replacement made business sense) did not prove that the old ship had been “superseded by improvements”. Rowlatt J therefore found that the old ship had not become obsolete. Obsolescence must affect the state or nature of the item by decreasing that item’s estimated useful life, but obsolescence is not wear and tear 37. The Commissioner considers that a relevant consideration in deciding whether an item is affected by obsolescence is whether the item will remain adequate for the purpose or function for which it was acquired. If the cause of the claimed obsolescence will result in the item being no longer suitable for the purpose or function for which that item was acquired then it is more likely that the item will be affected by obsolescence. In South Metropolitan Gas Company the purpose or function of the taxpayer’s steamship remained unchanged from when that steamship was purchased. Therefore, obsolescence was not relevant. Each case must be considered on its own facts to determine whether there has been a decrease in the estimated useful life of an item or whether the decrease is caused by other considerations, such as the taxpayer’s desire to increase business. 38. In Para Handkerchief, Jaine J stated that the loss in value, caused by an asset becoming obsolete or useless, must be related to the state or nature of the assets (at p 9,129): Section 108 was hardly designed to allow an almost complete write-off of near new assets in the first year (when the Commissioner has already allowed standard depreciation for that year) when there can be no suggestion that their income producing capabilities had been affected except by the business failure of the owner brought about by factors unrelated to the state or nature of the assets. 39. Therefore, obsolescence must be related to the state or nature of an item by causing a decrease in the estimated useful life of the item. However, that does not require that the item is obsolete or useless to everyone. In both Para Handkerchief and South Metropolitan Gas Company the items did not suffer from a decrease in their estimated useful life. In Para Handkerchief the 8 decrease in value was caused by business failure, and in South Metropolitan Gas Company the taxpayer merely wished to replace a steamship with a superior vessel and was therefore not obsolete. 40. In Robertson the taxpayer claimed deductions for various items of plant purchased to replace items the taxpayer had sold or scrapped or that had become worn out. Murray CJ stated that wear and tear was not the same as obsolescence (at p 318): Advancing age or obsolescence of the thing it \[sic\] not “wear and tear” ...; and Earl of Derby v. Aylmer, \[1915\] K.B. 374; London County Council v. Edwards, (1909) 100 L.T. 444, at p. 446). 41. This conclusion would be the same under s EE 63. This is because the term “wear and tear” and the term “obsolescence” are listed separately as factors that may be used in determining an item’s estimated useful life under s EE 63(1)(a). In Para Handkerchief Jaine J discussed Robertson, stating (at p 9,131): The judgments in Robertson, and in particular the conclusion that useless means unfit through wear and tear and that the item is either incapable of repair or in a condition that would lead a reasonable businessman to replace, need to be considered in the context of the particular statutory provisions with which they were dealing. The indication by Napier J that “useless” means “useless for the purposes of the trade or business” cannot be said to mean simply “useless for the purposes of the trade or business of the taxpayer” without further qualification. The provision he was interpreting did not require (as s 108 does) the taxpayer to satisfy the Commissioner that the state of uselessness could not be made good by repair. In that context he appears merely to be saying that if it is commercially expedient to cease using an asset which has suffered from wear and tear for the purposes of the taxpayer's business and the taxpayer incurs expense in substituting a new asset, a deduction may be allowed in respect of some part of the cost of the new equipment. The position was expressed by Murray CJ at p 319 in the following way: “... an implement is ‘useless’ from wear and tear, within the meaning of the provision, when it has become unfit for the purpose for which it was used and is either incapable of being repaired or is in such a condition that a reasonable businessman would prefer to substitute a new implement rather than incur the cost of repairing the old one.” In the present case there is of course no question of commercial expediency leading to replacement of equipment which had suffered wear and tear but neither could it possibly be said on the facts in the present case that the assets were useless for the purposes of the trade or business carried on by the company. They remained commercially useful as evidenced by the fact that they were used by the purchaser in the operation of the business until fire brought about its conclusion. 42. Obsolescence under s EE 63 does not require that the item cannot be made good by repair. However, s EE 63(1)(b) does provide that in setting an estimated useful life for an item there is an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. Unlike the United Kingdom and Australian decisions set out above, however, s EE 63 is not necessarily intended to promote the purchase of new items as s EE 63 does not require that the item be replaced. 9 United States case law examples of obsolescence 43. There are some United States decisions that consider the meaning of obsolescence in a depreciation context. However, in the United States cases, the taxpayer is generally claiming a deduction for obsolescence at the end of the item’s life. This is in contrast to the New Zealand legislation, in which the estimated useful life of an item (taking into account obsolescence) is used to determine an appropriate depreciation rate to be used throughout the life of the item. 44. In Anaconda Company v Property Tax Department of the State of New Mexico 94 NM 202; 608 P 2d 514 (1979), the Court of Appeals in New Mexico discussed the meaning of the term “obsolescence”, stating (at p 207; 519): “Obsolescence” is generally understood to be the process “whereby property, because of causes other than physical deterioration, loses its economic usefulness to the taxpayer” 4 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation s 23.104 (1973). A broader definition was given by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which stated that obsolescence “mean(s) a loss in the service value of a fixed or capital asset which has become useless or inefficient on account of advances in the art, new inventions, inadequacy, the shifting of business centres, the loss of trade or some governmental ruling” Attorney DJ General v Trustees of Boston Elevated Railway, 319 Mass. 642, 659, 67 N.E. 2d 676, 688 (1946). Interpreting a federal statute allowing a deduction from income tax for obsolescence, the United States Court of Claims stated that in order to obtain the deduction the taxpayer must show that the property is being affected by economic conditions that will result in its being abandoned prior to the end of its normal useful life. S.S. White Dental Manufacturing Company v. United States 38 F. Supp. 301, 93 Ct. CL.469 cert. denied, 314 U.S. 644, 62 S.Ct. 84, 86 L.Ed. 517 (1941). (Emphasis added.) Yet not every decision to abandon property gives rise to a claim for obsolescence. Real Estate-Land Title & Trust Co. v United States, 309 U.S. 13, 60 S.Ct. 371, 84 L.Ed. 542 (1940). \[Emphasis in original\] 45. As stated in Anaconda Company the item must be affected by economic conditions (for example, advances in the art, new inventions, and inadequacy) that will result in the need to abandon the item before the end of its physical life. Obsolescence may exist where an item becomes outmoded by virtue of more modern improved alternatives that make the item uneconomic or uncompetitive, such that it will eventually be replaced. 46. However, obsolescence does not equate to there simply being “better” or more modern alternatives available. Any technological advances or improvements must be significant enough to affect the item’s estimated useful life. The item must eventually be “superseded by improvements”: South Metropolitan Gas Company. This requires a reasonable certainty that the item will become obsolete and a sufficiently clear indication of when this would be likely to occur. 47. Some cases make specific reference to two main forms of obsolescence, being “functional” and “economic” obsolescence. An example is set out in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division decision in Piazza v Town Assessor of Town of Porte 16 AD 2d 863; 228 NYS 2d 397 (1962) (at p 863; 397): “Functional obsolescence” with respect to valuation of property for taxation is a loss of value brought about by the failure or inability to deliver full service, and includes any loss of value by reason of shortcomings or undesirable features contained within the property itself and is a loss of utility and failure to function due to inadequacies of design and deficiency in the property. 10 “Economic obsolescence” with respect to valuation of property for taxation is a loss of value brought about by conditions that environ \[surround, enclose\] a structure such as a declining location or downgrading of a neighbourhood resulting in reduced business volume. 48. Functional obsolescence primarily considers factors inherent to items that have an effect on the estimated useful life of that item. Such factors include (but are not limited to) technological changes affecting the ability to use an item. An example of a factor inherent to an item that decreases its estimated useful life is new mobile phone technology where there is no longer a provider of the old technology. Any mobile phone using that technology would be rendered obsolete due to the inability to access service. 49. Economic obsolescence primarily considers factors that cause changes to the environment and conditions surrounding an item that have an effect on the estimated useful life of that item. Such factors include (but are not limited to) regulatory or economic changes. For example, government regulation or public taste could change consumer demand for a product produced by an item. As stated above, however, the cause of the obsolescence must objectively contribute to a decrease in the estimated useful life of an item. Economic factors could impact equally on either the supply or demand side of a business. Economic factors (such as supply and demand changes) need careful consideration as a clear link to a decrease in the estimated useful life of an item must be established. This is because, as stated by Jaine J in Para Handkerchief, obsolescence is not relevant where the cause of a decrease in value is unrelated to the state or nature of the actual items. 50. The Commissioner considers that an example of economic obsolescence is the depletion of available raw materials that an item relies on to produce income. This is because a lack of raw materials for a machine contributes to the reduced usefulness of that item. In Anaconda Company the taxpayer, relying on a valuation report, argued that its uranium supply would be depleted in eight years. However, the claim that the uranium supply would be depleted within eight years was disproved because contrary evidence was called that indicated there was another 11.2 million tonnes of uranium in the area (this information came from a merger report between the taxpayer and another company) and the price of uranium ore was rising. The taxpayer also argued that one of its uranium ore mills was less productive than other independent mills. The taxpayer produced evidence showing that its mill had an 89.2% recovery rate whereas other mills had a 90.9% recovery rate. This evidence was not considered sufficient to overturn the trial court’s factual findings that obsolescence was not present in this case. 51. In Piazza the New York Supreme Court referred to an argument, by the taxpayer, that economic obsolescence was present because the taxpayer’s hospital was in a rural area where an industrial plant had closed, resulting in low business volume. The taxpayer argued that the hospital could not be operated at a profit. The court stated that the taxpayer had failed to produce evidence in support of this argument. However, the High Court decision in Para Handkerchief shows that business failure that does not affect the items, is not sufficient for obsolescence to be relevant. This is because the cause of the 11 obsolescence must be objectively shown to affect the estimated useful life of an item. 52. The United States Supreme Court considered the meaning of the term “obsolescence” in Real Estate-Land Title & Trust Co v United States 309 US 13 (1940), stating (at p 16): This Court, without undertaking a comprehensive definition, has held that obsolescence for purposes of the revenue acts ‘may arise from changes in the art, shifting of business centers, loss of trade, inadequacy, supersession, prohibitory laws, and other things which, apart from physical deterioration, operate to cause elements or the plant as a whole to suffer diminution in value’ ... Such specific examples illustrate the type of “economic conditions” whose effect on physical property is recognized as obsolescence by the Treasury Regulations. Others could be mentioned which similarly cause or contribute to the relentless march of physical property to the junk pile. But in general, obsolescence under the Act connotes functional depreciation, as it does in accounting and engineering terminology. More than use or disuse is necessary to establish it. To be sure, reasons of economy may cause a management to discard a title plant \[Facilities — records, equipment, fixtures, and personnel — required to function as a title insurance operation\] either where it has become outmoded by improved devices or where it is acquired as a duplicate and therefore is useless. But not every decision of management to abandon facilities or to discontinue their use gives rise to a claim for obsolescence. For obsolescence under the Act requires that the operative cause of the present or growing uselessness arise from external forces which make it desirable or imperative that the property be replaced. What those operative causes may be will be dependent on a wide variety of factual situations. “New and modern methods” appear to have been one of the real causes of abandonment of the title plant in Crooks v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co. ... Suffice it hereto say that no such external causes are present, for the record shows little more than the desire of a management to eliminate one plant which was a needless duplication of another but which functionally was adequate. The fact that fewer employees were required to operate the one retained than the one discarded is inconclusive here. For this is not the case of acquisition of a new plant to take the place of one outmoded or less efficient. Rather the conclusion is irresistible that the plant was discarded only as a proximate result of petitioner’s voluntary action in acquiring excess capacity. \[Emphasis added\] 53. The term “external forces” was used in Real Estate-Land Title & Trust Co to refer to the fact that the causes of the obsolescence must be outside the control of the taxpayer (external forces could result in functional obsolescence or economic obsolescence). This means obsolescence does not hinge on the decisions of management that a particular item be abandoned or its use terminated. Therefore, the presence of obsolescence is judged objectively before disposing of the item. The decision in Real Estate-Land Title & Trust Co further shows that the external forces cannot merely be the expansion of the business or the desire to expand the business. This is because the expansion of the business or the desire to expand the business, by itself, does not affect the estimated useful life of an item. 54. In the United States Court of Federal Claims decision in SS White Dental Manufacturing Company v United States 38 F Supp 301 (1941) the taxpayer consolidated its operations to one of its three manufacturing plants for cost- saving reasons. One of the plants was effectively abandoned, and the taxpayer claimed an allowance for “extraordinary obsolescence”. The Court of Claims noted (at p 304): 12 The facts clearly indicate that the underlying reason for the abandonment and disposition of the Northwood plant was to save the extra operating costs of maintaining the two plants. The ultimate purpose, as disclosed by the minutes of the directors’ meeting and by testimony, was to abandon the third plant also and to consolidate the entire operation at the headquarters plant at Staten Island. The Northwood plant was adequate. It was located in a desirable industrial centre. It was easily accessible for all purposes. It was in good condition and satisfactory in operation. The primary reason for the decision to consolidate the two plants at Staten Island was that the current expenses of operation could be reduced thereby. And later (at p 306): There is no evidence that any of the buildings were in other than first-class condition. On the contrary, the appraiser’s report shows them in good condition. We find that the evidence fails to show that the physical plant in Northwood on April 1, 1936, was on the way to becoming obsolete. Under the facts as disclosed by the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover on the grounds of obsolescence. 55. An important point in the above extract from White Dental is that making a business more efficient by abandoning an item does not necessarily mean the item is affected by obsolescence. Similarly, an item is not necessarily obsolete simply because the item is of no further use to a particular taxpayer in deriving their assessable income. This is because the decrease in utility must relate to the item itself by objectively causing a decrease in the estimated useful life of that item. In this case the estimated useful life of the plant was unchanged and the taxpayer merely wished to consolidate its operations to save costs. Although White Dental involved consolidating business premises, the Commissioner also considers that the growth of a business, which reduces the utility of an item, does not, in itself, establish that an item is becoming obsolete. What the Commissioner takes into account when considering whether an item is affected by obsolescence 56. In the context of s EE 63, obsolescence involves a reduction in the period for which an asset might be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income for reasons (other than physical deterioration or wear and tear) such as economic, technological or other external causes that affect the estimated useful life of the item. The tests for obsolescence are the same regardless of whether the Commissioner is setting a general, special or provisional depreciation rate. However, there may be differences in the types of information available to the Commissioner to determine whether an item is affected by obsolescence. For example, when the Commissioner is considering an application for a special depreciation rate, the Commissioner would have information about the particular circumstances relating to the taxpayer’s item. Whereas, in setting a general rate, the Commissioner takes into account information generic to the class of item. 57. The cases discussed above show that determining whether an item is affected by obsolescence is a question of fact to be judged objectively. The cause of any obsolescence will be outside the control of the taxpayer and may arise from factors that are inherent to the item (functional obsolescence) or that constitute 13 a change to the environment or conditions surrounding an item (economic obsolescence). 58. There are many different causes of obsolescence and this statement does not provide an exhaustive list. However, the Commissioner considers that the following are examples of external causes that may result in an item becoming obsolete:  prohibitory laws or regulatory changes that affect the useful life of the item in deriving assessable income;  technological changes or the development of more modern improved alternatives that are significant enough to affect the useful life of the item and mean that the item has been superseded by improvements;  changes in consumer tastes and public opinion, in relation to products produced by the item, such that the item will no longer be useful in deriving assessable income;  changes in the art or, in other words, changes in the way in which a business or a type of business is undertaken, such that the item’s estimated useful life is decreased;  depletion of raw materials on which the item is reliant to produce income;  the item causes reduced ability or failure to continue business at previous levels such that the item will no longer be useful in deriving assessable income. 59. An item may become obsolete when it is superseded by improvements. However, obsolescence does not equate to an item simply being suboptimal or there being “better” or more modern alternatives. The difference is that the more modern improved alternatives must be significant enough to affect the estimated useful life of the item. Examples of situations where the items remained suitable for their original use or purpose are the assets in Para Handkerchief, the steamship in South Metropolitan Gas Company and the surplus Northwood industrial plant in White Dental. 60. As discussed above, obsolescence is the process of becoming obsolete. However, it may not always be a gradual process. When the Commissioner sets the estimated useful life for an item of depreciable property any reasonably predictable obsolescence will be taken into account at that time. For obsolescence to be taken into account, the estimated useful life of the item must have decreased. As the obsolescence of an item is a question of fact, other considerations similar to those set out above may also be relevant. 61. The Commissioner considers, however, that the following considerations, by themselves, will not establish whether a decrease in the estimated useful life of an item is as a result of obsolescence:  demolition, scrapping or abandonment of the item, or a decision to do so;  a decision of management to discontinue the use of an item; 14  the availability of newer or better alternatives;  market forces of supply and demand;  a desire to enhance or expand business operations;  the likelihood of business failure. Examples 62. The following examples illustrate the principles outlined in this Interpretation Statement. They are therefore only a guide. Whether obsolescence may be taken into account in determining the estimated useful life of an item of depreciable property will depend on the facts of each case. 63. The first five examples consider situations in which an event has occurred (other than physical wear and tear) that may have changed the estimated useful life of the item. The examples then consider whether that event has reduced the original estimated useful life of the depreciable property. The sixth example shows how the Commissioner will take obsolescence into account when setting a general rate. Example 1 64. The Government contracts A Ltd to provide security at New Zealand’s international airports. To provide this service, A Ltd has purchased equipment to scan passengers and their baggage. 65. As a result of world events, the governments around the world have updated their security regulations to require more rigorous screening of passengers and baggage at international airports. As a result of these new security regulations, the New Zealand Government passes legislation to comply with the new international standards. To comply with the legislation, A Ltd must replace all of its existing equipment with new equipment within the next two years. The equipment is incapable of being used for any other purpose. 66. The result of the new legislation is that the equipment will become obsolete at the end of the two-year period and must be replaced. Therefore the current depreciation rate for A Ltd’s depreciable property may no longer be appropriate and A Ltd may wish to apply to the Commissioner for a depreciation determination setting new depreciation rates for its equipment. Example 2 67. B Ltd owns and operates a business producing aluminium. The manufacture of aluminium requires specialist machinery that depends on aluminium ore. New research suggests the amount of aluminium ore available in the country is decreasing faster than was previously estimated. It is not feasible to import aluminium ore. B Ltd’s specialist machinery is also not capable of running on any input other than aluminium ore. 68. Once the supplies of aluminium ore have run out, B Ltd’s machine will become obsolete. Because the supply of aluminium ore is now decreasing faster than it 15 was initially estimated, the estimated useful life of the plant has decreased and the applicable rates of depreciation (if any) on B Ltd’s plant may no longer be appropriate. Therefore, obsolescence will be relevant when setting any applicable depreciation rate for B Ltd’s plant. Example 3 69. C Ltd owns and operates an eye clinic specialising in refractive surgery for correcting myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. New technological developments result in a new type of refractive surgery, which requires new machinery. The existing machinery remains adequate for the job for which it was acquired, but C Ltd has had a dramatic decrease in the number of customers because the public now demand surgery using the new machinery. This increase in demand is the result of media coverage highlighting the improvements in the new type of refractive surgery. 70. The Commissioner considers that this is an example of consumer preferences causing C Ltd’s machine to become obsolete. This means the applicable rates of depreciation on C Ltd’s machinery may no longer be appropriate. Therefore, C Ltd may wish to apply to the Commissioner for a depreciation determination setting new depreciation rates for its machinery. Example 4 71. D Ltd owns and operates a small winery business. D Ltd’s wine is very popular, so the owners wish to expand the business. D Ltd gains consent to undertake a total redevelopment and expansion of the winery, complete with much larger wine vats, so production can be increased. 72. D Ltd argues that the current winery is now obsolete because the market for wine has changed and it can no longer produce enough wine to keep up with customer orders. D Ltd also argues that if it did not expand, its customers might lose interest in its product. For this reason D Ltd considers that the previous depreciable property used by the winery (for example, the smaller wine vats) has been affected by obsolescence. 73. The decision by D Ltd to expand the winery is a result of D Ltd’s desire to expand its business or, in other words, because of the increased demand for D Ltd’s product. The change in customer preferences and expectations did not have any impact on the estimated useful life of any of D Ltd’s depreciable property used before the redevelopment and expansion of the winery (for example, the smaller wine vats). This is because the wine-making equipment used before the redevelopment remains able to undertake the function for which that equipment was designed. Therefore, none of the winery’s depreciable property has been affected by a change in circumstances leading to a decrease in the estimated useful life of that depreciable property. Therefore, the current depreciation rates for D Ltd’s depreciable property remain appropriate. 16 17 Example 5 74. E Ltd owns and operates a business renting buses to the public. Some of E Ltd’s buses have diesel engines, and those buses are all five years old with an estimated useful life of another seven years. New research shows that these types of diesel engines in buses, when they are over 10 years old, are extremely harmful to the environment. As a result, the Government decides to pass new environmental emissions laws for buses with this type of engine over 10 years old. These new laws mean E Ltd’s buses with diesel engines that are over 10 years old are not allowed to be registered to be driven on the road. 75. The effect of the new law is that the estimated useful life of these diesel engine buses of E Ltd has been decreased from 12 years to 10 years. The Commissioner considers that this is an example of economic obsolescence, such that the applicable rate of depreciation on E Ltd’s buses with this type of engine may no longer be appropriate. Therefore, E Ltd may wish to apply to the Commissioner for a depreciation determination setting new depreciation rates for these buses. Example 6 76. The Commissioner is considering setting a general economic depreciation rate for game consoles with hard drives. Game consoles are basically computers that are specifically designed to be used to play video games. These items are used in a number of different types of businesses such as hotels and short-term hire companies. 77. Game consoles are subject to technological change and are regularly superseded by improvements in later generation models. Often games for later models cannot be played on earlier models. In addition, there is evidence that consumer demand means that earlier generation consoles cannot be hired out. It is accepted that the useful life of the consoles would be significantly shorter than their physical life due to technological change and consumer demand. The Commissioner therefore considers that video game consoles will be affected by obsolescence and their estimate useful life would be reduced accordingly. In setting the final estimated useful life, in addition to obsolescence there may be other factors to take into account such as wear and tear.

This Interpretation Statement considers:  who holds shares issued by a company;  when, during a sale or transfer of shares, there is a change in who holds those shares. The Commissioner is aware that people have had difficulty in determining the latter point in particular. 2. The person who holds shares issued by a company will have a “voting interest” in the company. The amount of the person’s voting interest in the company must be calculated when applying the “continuity provisions” of the Act. The continuity provisions govern the ability of companies to:  carry forward losses;  offset losses with other companies;  carry forward credits in any memoranda accounts (eg, imputation credit accounts);  carry forward excess tax credits. 3. The continuity provisions are set out in ss GB 3, GB 4, IA 3 to IA 5, IC 1, LP 3(4), OB 41, OC 24, OE 10 and OK 15. 1 Generally, these provisions require that over a period a group of persons’ combined voting interests in a company or companies exceed certain minimum levels. 1 Section OE 10 has been repealed, effective from 1 July 2012: see the Appendix. 2 4. Under s YC 2 the amount of a person’s voting interest in a company is a product of two factors. One factor is the number of shares the person holds. The other factor is the “shareholder decision-making rights” carried by those shares. This Interpretation Statement considers the first factor only. 5. This Interpretation Statement also does not apply to:  market value interests under s YC 3 that arise where there is a “market value circumstance” as defined in s YA 1;  rectification (where there is a mistake in a company’s share register);  options over shares. 6. In respect of the last item above, in certain circumstances (involving “shareholder decision-making rights” as defined in s YA 1) the calculation of voting interests under s YC 2 and market value interests under s YC 3 include options where an “option” includes an “agreement for sale at a time when beneficial ownership of the property sold has not completely passed to the purchaser”. In addition, a “market value circumstance” can include an occasion or a situation in which an option exists. Accordingly, in addition to the matters concerning agreements for the sale and purchase of shares discussed in this Interpretation Statement, continuity implications may arise from some uncompleted agreements in terms of options and market value circumstances. In particular, this may be the case if an agreement provides for an alteration of any of the vendor’s shareholder decision-making rights. 7. This Interpretation Statement applies to “shares” issued by a company registered under the Companies Act 1993 where those shares are an “interest in the capital of a company” (as per para (a) of the definition of “share” in s YA 1). The definition of “share” includes other items such as certain debentures, stapled debt securities and units in a unit trust. None of these additional items falling under the definition is dealt with in this Interpretation Statement. Summary 8. As a rule, shares issued by a company will be held by the registered holder of those shares. The registered holder of shares is the person whose name appears on the share register of the company. 9. There are two exceptions to this rule. 10. The first exception is if those shares are held by the registered holder as “nominee” for another person. If so, under s YB 21, the registered holder is “looked through” and the other person will hold the shares for the purposes of the Act, unless the second exception applies. 11. The second exception is if any of ss YC 8 to YC 19 and s FB 10 apply. These provisions apply in specific circumstances (eg, where a person has a voting interest of less than 10% in a company). If any of these provisions apply, someone other than the registered holder of the shares may be considered to hold the shares. This Interpretation Statement does not consider these provisions in depth. 12. Where shares are transferred from one person to another, a change in who holds the shares occurs at the earlier of when:  the purchaser of the shares becomes the registered holder of the shares (ie, when the purchaser’s name is entered onto the company’s share register in accordance with the agreement); or  under s YB 21, the vendor holds the shares as “nominee” for the purchaser. 13. The vendor will hold the shares as “nominee” for the purchaser when one of the following occurs: 3  The vendor and the purchaser enter into an agreement, either as part of the transfer agreement or separately, that explicitly or implicitly creates a “nominee” relationship in relation to the shares.  The vendor is the bare trustee for the purchaser of shares under an agreement that has been settled, but the purchaser is not the registered holder of the shares. In such a case, the purchaser may go on to be registered or may never be registered (eg, where it is agreed the vendor will hold the shares as bare trustee for the purchaser indefinitely). 14. In the nominee situation, exceptions to when the purchaser is then the holder of the shares could arise if:  the purchaser is themselves a “nominee” for someone else (in which case s YB 21 will deem the shares to be “held” by that other person); or  any of the provisions of ss YC 8 to YC 19 or s FB 10 apply so that someone other than the purchaser is the holder of the shares. 15. Where the vendor is the purchaser’s nominee, entering the purchaser’s name onto the share register of the company later does not affect who holds the shares. In that situation, the purchaser is already considered the holder of the shares. 16. A flowchart showing when during a transfer of shares there is a change in who “holds” shares is in paragraph 155. Examples follow the flowchart. In all cases and for the avoidance of doubt, the outcomes in terms of the application of the continuity provisions suggested by the flowchart and in the examples may not apply where s BG 1 applies. Analysis 17. The issues to consider are:  who shares are “held” by; and  when under a share transfer agreement there is a change in who holds those shares. 18. These issues are important for applying the continuity provisions. Therefore, it is useful to first review those provisions. What are the continuity provisions? 19. The continuity provisions relate to whether a company may:  carry forward losses;  offset losses with other companies;  carry forward credits in its memorandum accounts (eg, imputation credit account);  carry forward excess tax credits. 20. As will be seen in the following paragraphs, pivotal to the continuity rules is the measurement of voting interests under s YC 2. Carry forward of losses 21. The continuity provision relating to the carrying forward of company losses is s IA 5. Section IA 5 provides that a company’s tax loss is carried forward only if a group of persons holds for the relevant period a minimum voting interest in the company that adds up to at least 49%. 22. A “minimum voting interest” for a person is defined by s IA 5(6) as the lowest “voting interest” the person has in the company during the relevant period. “Voting interest” is defined in s YA 1 as the percentage voting 4 interest that a person is treated as holding in the company under ss YC 2 to YC 20. Offset of losses with other companies 23. The continuity provision relating to the offset of losses between companies is s IC 1. Section IC 1 provides that if a company has a tax loss for an income year and is a member of a group of companies, the company may make its tax loss available to another company in the group. Section IC 1 requires s IC 2 to be satisfied. 24. Section IC 2 sets out requirements for the continuity of ownership of the loss company itself and for the commonality of ownership of the two companies seeking to offset losses. 25. The continuity of ownership of the loss company referred to in s IC 2 is set by reference to s IA 5. Section IA 5 is mentioned under “Carry forward of losses” in paragraphs 21 to 22. 26. The commonality of ownership of the two companies seeking to offset losses referred to in s IC 2 is set by s IC 3. 27. Section IC 3 refers to two or more companies in relation to which a group of persons hold common voting interests that add up to at least 66%. Section IC 3(3) provides that the common voting interests of the group are found from the percentage of each individual’s voting interests in each of the companies at the time, as decided by reference to s YC 2. 28. Accordingly, the offset of losses between companies can occur only when there is both continuity of ownership of the loss company and commonality of ownership between the companies concerned. Both requirements are decided with reference to voting interests under s YC 2. Carry forward of credits in memorandum accounts 29. Section OA 8 in certain circumstances prevents a company from maintaining credits in its memorandum accounts. Section OA 8 provides that a credit in a memorandum account may be carried forward only if a group of persons continues to hold aggregate minimum voting interests in the company of at least 66%. Where continuity is breached, s OA 8 refers to a debit arising under the specific continuity provision that relates to each type of memorandum account. For instance, the continuity provision relating to imputation credit accounts is s OB 41. 30. Accordingly, the ability of a company to carry forward credits in its memorandum accounts depends on whether a group of persons holds a certain level of minimum “voting interests” that is decided by reference to s YC 2. Carry forward of excess tax credits 31. The continuity provision relating to the carrying forward of excess tax credits is s LP 3(4). Section LP 3(4) provides that if a company has an amount of tax credit remaining for the tax year the amount must be carried forward. Where this occurs, s LP 4 provides the continuity rules that then apply. Section LP 4 requires that a group of persons, for the relevant period, must have minimum voting interests in the company that add up to 49%. Section LP 4(3) defines “minimum voting interests” as the lowest voting interest that a person has in the company for the relevant period. 32. Thus, similar to other continuity provisions, whether a company can carry forward excess tax credits is decided by reference to s YC 2. 5 Who holds shares? Section YC 2 33. Section YC 2 provides: Percentage of shareholder decision-making rights (1) A person’s voting interest in a company equals the percentage of the total shareholder decision-making rights for the company carried by shares or options held by the person. When decision-making rights vary (2) Despite subsection (1), if the percentage of shareholder decision- making rights for a company carried by shares or options held by any person differs as between the types of decision-making listed in the definition of shareholder decision-making right, the person’s voting interest in the company equals the average of those differing percentages. \[Emphasis added\] 34. On an ordinary reading, s YC 2 is referring to two concepts:  shareholder decision-making rights for the company carried by shares;  “shares ... held” by the person. 35. That is, the section is concerned with shareholder decision-making rights held by a person via the means of that person holding shares. This interpretation is supported by the word “held” appearing immediately after the phrase “shares or options”. This suggests the verb “held” relates to the holding of shares or options and not to the holding of shareholder decision- making rights. 36. Accordingly, the person’s voting interest in a company is calculated firstly, by determining the total number of shares the person “holds”, and secondly, by determining the “shareholder decision-making rights” carried by those shares. Consideration of this latter point is not included in this Interpretation Statement. 37. In relation to what determines the meaning of “shares ... held” as used in s YC 2 and, as a result, what determines who holds shares, the following matters are considered important:  the meaning of “shares”;  the ordinary meaning of “shares ... held”;  the courts’ view on the meaning of “shares ... held”;  the context of s YC 2. Ordinary meaning of “shares” 38. The Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993) provides that every company must have one or more shares, and that, after registration, shares must be issued to the people named in the company’s application for registration. Thereafter, the board of a registered company may issue further shares subject to the CA 1993 and the constitution of the company. Under s 51 of the CA 1993 a share is issued by a registered company when the name of the holder is entered on the share register of the company. 39. For tax purposes, the term “share” is broadly defined in s YA 1. It includes, in para (a) of the definition, “any interest in the capital of a company”. 40. The expression “interest in” can be given a wide meaning. Black’s Law Dictionary (9 th ed, West, St Paul, 2009) defines “interest” as: 2. A legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property. 6 41. The English Court of Appeal in IRC v R Woolf (Rubber) Ltd \[1962\] 1 Ch 35 considered the meaning of s 255(2) of the Income Tax Act 1952 (UK). This section defined a “member” in relation to a company as including “any person having a share or interest in the capital or profits or income of the company”. Donovan LJ stated at 45–46: It is in this context, and against this background, that the word “interest” must, in my view, be construed; and, so construed, I think it connotes an interest which gives the possessor a right or expectation to share in a company’s profits even though they might come to him via liquidation. 42. And at 46, Upjohn LJ stated: The share or interest of a member in the capital of a company has no precise legal signification. In the context it may refer to the share or interest of the member in the issued share capital, or it may refer to his ultimate right to receive a dividend in liquidation after all creditors have been discharged ... 43. The meaning of capital and share capital in particular is discussed in NZ Company Law and Practice Commentary (online ed, CCH, accessed 12 June 2012, at \[15-005\]): The term capital loosely describes the funds to which a company has access for the purpose of its business and development. ... Share capital represents the funds of the company contributed by the issue of shares to shareholders. The concept of share capital is of much less significance under the \[Companies Act 1993\] than formerly: see ¶15-125. In fact, the term capital appears only once in the Act, in s 37(2)(b). The provisions of the Companies Act 1955 relating to share capital were based upon the existence of an identifiable capital fund (albeit represented by assets) which was required to be maintained intact for the benefit of creditors and, to a lesser extent, shareholders. ... The terms authorised, issued and nominal share capital are now obsolete. The term share capital is now a misnomer if it implies the existence of a capital fund. The share structure of the company under the Companies Act 1993 is significant for the rights of the shareholders against the company and between themselves; it has no significance for the protection of creditors. A share has been described as a fractional part of the capital: Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Co Ltd \[1923\] AC 744 at p 767. This concept was easily understood in the case of a company having an issued share capital, say, of $100,000 comprising 100,000 shares of a nominal value of $1 each. But, as noted above, the legal concept of capital has all but disappeared under the 1993 Act. A share now represents not so much a fraction of the capital, but an entitlement to benefits, such as dividends and voting rights. \[Emphasis added\] 44. The House of Lords discussed the nature of a share in IRC v Laird Group plc \[2003\] BTC 385. The issue was whether a payment of a dividend was “a transaction relating to” shares. Lord Millett said at \[35\]: The juridical nature of a share is not easy to describe. It is not a share in the company’s undertaking, for the company owns its property beneficially and not in trust for its members: “shareholders are not, in the eye of the law, part owners of the undertaking” (see Short v Treasury Commissioners \[1948\] 1 KB 116 at p122 (CA)). It is classified as a chose in action, but this merely tells us that it is a species of intangible personal property. It is customary to describe it as “a bundle of rights and liabilities”, and this is probably the nearest that one can get to its character, provided that it is appreciated that it is more than a bundle of contractual rights. The most widely quoted definition of a share is that of Farwell J in Borland’s Trustee v Steel \[1901\] 1 Ch 279 at p288 which was approved by your Lordships’ House in IR Commrs v Crossman \[1937\] AC 26. It was usefully and in my respectful opinion accurately summarised by Lord Russell of Killowen in his speech (dissenting on the facts) in that case, at p66: “It is the interest of a person in the company, that interest being composed of rights and obligations which are defined by the Companies Act and by the memorandum and articles of association of the company.” These rights, however, are not purely personal rights. They confer proprietary rights in the company though not in its property. The company is at one and the same time a juridical person with rights and duties of its own, and a res owned by its shareholders: see Gower’s Principles of Modern Company Law (6th ed, 1997 p301). \[Emphasis added\] 7 45. The standard bundle of rights that attaches to a share is set by s 89(2) of the CA 1993. Section 89(2) provides that: (2) A company may treat the registered holder of a share as the only person entitled to— (a) Exercise the right to vote attaching to the share; and (b) Receive notices; and (c) Receive a distribution in respect of the share; and (d) Exercise the other rights and powers attaching to the share. 46. Section 89(2) of the CA 1993 is clear that the registered holder of shares issued by a company in terms of s 51 of the CA 1993 would be entitled to, among other things, vote and receive distributions in relation to those shares. These shares would give the holder an interest in the capital or profits or income of the company. Therefore, they would constitute an “interest in the capital” of the company. Accordingly, a share issued under s 51 of the CA 1993 would be a “share” as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. Ordinary meaning of “shares ... held” 47. The Act does not define “held”, “hold” or “shares held”. However, s YA 1 defines “shareholder” as: (a) includes— (i) a holder of a share; and (ii) a member of a company, whether the company’s capital is divided into shares or not ... \[Emphasis added\] 48. Therefore, the reference in s YC 2 to shares “held” would cover those instances where, in terms of the definition of “shareholder”, someone “holds” those shares. However, this does not clarify what decides who it is that holds the shares. 49. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) describes “held” as the past tense and past participle of hold. “Hold” is defined as: 5 Have or keep as one’s own: possess, be the owner ... 50. In this context, “held” seems to be about ownership. This definition suggests that determining who shares are “held” by requires a decision about who is the legal owner of the shares. 51. Section 89(1) of the CA 1993 states: (1) Subject to section 91 of this Act, the entry of the name of a person in the share register as holder of a share is prima facie evidence that legal title to the share vests in that person. \[Emphasis added\] 52. Similarly, s 84 of the CA 1993 states: (1) Subject to the constitution of the company, shares in a company may be transferred by entry of the name of the transferee on the share register ... 53. Furthermore, s 96(a) of the CA 1993 defines “shareholder” as: (a) a person whose name is entered in the share register as the holder for the time being of 1 or more shares in the company ... Therefore, the legal title or ownership of shares issued by a company in terms of s 51 of the CA 1993 would be determined by who is the registered holder of those shares. The ordinary dictionary definition of “hold” suggests that the legal owner of shares would “hold” those shares. Therefore, the dictionary definition of “hold” provides some support for the view that the 8 reference to “shares ... held” in s YC 2 should be read as referring to the registered holder of those shares. 54. However, this interpretation of “shares ... held” needs to be consistent with the interpretation the courts have adopted. Courts’ view of meaning of “shares ... held” 55. Several cases have looked at the meaning of “held” or “hold” in relation to shares issued by a company. A leading case in this area is the High Court of Australia case Dalgety Downs Pastoral Company Pty Ltd v FCT (1952) 86 CLR 335. 56. The court in Dalgety looked at s 80(5) of the Australian legislation that governed the carrying forward of company losses. The section required that shares carrying at least 25% of the voting power in the company be “beneficially held” by the same persons during the relevant period. The issue was whether continuity of shareholding had been maintained when a shareholder transferred his shares as security for a loan. The court concluded the shares were held by the person whose name appeared in the company’s share register. The court stated at 341–342: we are of opinion that the construction of s 80(5) upon which the deputy commissioner acted is correct. Dixon J so held in Avon Downs Pty Ltd v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 353, basing his conclusion upon the view that in the terminology of company law shares are said to be “held” by the person who is registered as a shareholder in respect thereof, and that s 80(5), being concerned with voting power, should be treated as using that terminology. We share this view. Indeed it is not too much to say that the verb “hold” and its variants, when used in relation to shares in companies, normally refers to the legal ownership of the shares according to the register of members. The Companies Acts of the United Kingdom and of several States of the Commonwealth have uniformly used the word in this sense, and common usage has followed their example. Before a different meaning is accepted, some justification must be found in the context, or the subject-matter. No such justification is provided by the fact that “held” is modified by the adverb “beneficially”. This word serves more naturally the purpose of excluding the case of a holding for the benefit of others than the purpose of so broadening the meaning of the word “held” beyond the particular significance which it normally has in relation to shares as to make it equivalent to “owned” in the most general sense of that word. \[Emphasis added\] 57. Therefore, the court in Dalgety held that the verb “hold” and its variants (eg, “held”), when used in relation to shares in a company, normally refer to the legal ownership of the company’s shares. Shares that have been issued by a company are, as noted above, legally owned by the person who is listed on the company’s share register as being the legal holder of those shares. Therefore, this suggests that shares issued by a company are “held” in terms of s YC 2 by the registered shareholder. 58. Similarly, in Patrick Corporation Ltd v FCT (1974) 74 ATC 4,149 at 4,164 Mason J held: For the appellants it was submitted that the word “shareholder” should be read as signifying not only a person who is entitled as against the company to be entered as a member in the register but also a purchaser of shares who is beneficially entitled to them as against the person registered as the holder of them. Reliance was placed upon the principle that a contract for the sale of shares in a company whose shares are not available for sale on the market is capable of specific performance and that the vendor of such shares holds them as trustee for the purchaser on completion of the contract. To my mind, this argument does not assist in resolving the problem, which is essentially a question of elucidating the meaning of the word in the light of the extended definition contained in sec. 6(1). It is not enough that the word includes a member. A person who is a beneficial holder of shares in a company (save, perhaps, a subscriber to the memorandum) but who is not, and has not, been entered in the register as the holder of those shares cannot accurately be described as a “shareholder” or a “member” of the company within the meaning of the Act (see Norman v. F. C. of T. (1963), 109 C.L.R. 9, at p. 16). \[Emphasis added\] 9 59. Patrick was appealed to the High Court of Australia as Patcorp Investments Ltd v FCT (1976) 76 ATC 4,225, where the majority dismissed the appeal. However, the whole court agreed on the issue of whether Patcorp was a “shareholder”. After considering various decisions on the meaning of “shareholder”, Gibbs J stated at 4,234: that entry on the register is necessary to constitute membership of a company, and clearly establish that beneficial ownership of shares, without registration, does not make a person a shareholder. \[Emphasis added\] 60. A similar approach was taken by the court in Spencer v Kennedy \[1926\] Ch 125. The court in Spencer considered whether someone who was absolutely entitled to be registered as a shareholder of a company, but who had not yet been entered onto the share register, could be said to “hold a share” in the company. The court held at 132: Now under Table A, art 70, the qualification of a director is “the holding of at least one share”. But, a man does not “hold a share” until he is registered. \[Emphasis added\] 61. The court in Spencer considered whether the claimant could be said to “hold a share” in the company. The court held that no one “holds a share” in a company until their name has been entered onto the company’s share register as the registered holder of that share. See also the English Court of Appeal decision in Bainbridge v Smith (1889) LR 41 Ch D 462 at 470 where the same conclusion is reached. 62. This interpretation of the circumstances when shares will be “held” has also been adopted in a New Zealand context. BHL v CIR (2011) 25 NZTC 20-088 concerned whether the taxpayer company (BHL) could offset its profits against the losses of another company. Who “held” the shares in each company and, in particular, whether one individual (Mrs B) “held” certain shares in BHL, was relevant to determining this issue. The High Court concluded that Mrs B did not “hold” the shares in question at the relevant time because her name was not entered in the share register of BHL as the shareholder of those shares. Courtney J stated at \[14\]-\[16\]: However, none of these provisions \[of the Income Tax Act 2004\] assist in deciding what constitute shares “held by the person”. Mr Dempster, for the Commissioner, argued that, although “held” is not defined in any of the ITAs \[Income Tax Acts\], the concept of “holding” a share is well known in company law to mean having one’s name entered in the share register as a shareholder. Section 96 of the Companies Act 1993 defines a shareholder as: ...a person whose name is entered in the register as the holder for the time being of 1 or more shares in the company. There is very strong support for this argument in Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Dalgety Downs Pastoral Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation. Both concerned the deduction of losses for tax purposes under the relevant Australian legislation. In Dalgety Downs the High Court of Australia held that shares “beneficially held” for the purposes of determining who held the voting power in a company at the relevant time (in the context of income in one year against losses from prior years) required that the name of the shareholder be entered in the register of members: ... I accept that, for the purposes of the group company offset provisions of the ITA, Mrs B had to be recorded in the share register of the company as being a shareholder at least to the extent of 50% of the company’s shares. It is common ground that she was not and that alone should be sufficient to determine the issues raised by BHL. \[Emphasis added\] 63. Another New Zealand case is the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decision Case D27 (1980) 4 NZTC 60,621. That case concerned the carrying forward of losses by the company. The bulk of the shares in the company had been transferred by the original shareholders (the M Family) to another party (WF) with a nominal single share held by the company’s secretary (TP). This transfer occurred before the losses at issue were incurred. The purchase money for the shares had been advanced under debenture by the former 10 shareholders. WF eventually defaulted on the debenture. Arising from this default, WF transferred his shares back to the original shareholders. The company argued that the re-transfer of the shares back to the original shareholders plus the stringent conditions attached to the debentures gave practical control of the company and a practical continuation of the shareholding rights of the original shareholders throughout the relevant period. The TRA looked at the meaning of the words “held” and “on behalf of” in relation to shares. At 60,628 the TRA cited Dalgety and Avon Downs Pty Ltd v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 353, before concluding that there had been a change in who “held” the shares concerned: From the evidence it is clear that WF was shown as the holder of 1,999 shares, TP holding the remaining one share in the Objector. There was no evidence that WF held his share in trust for any member of the M family in any way. Had there not been losses incurred which it was desired to write off, there would have been no argument that WF held such shares by and on behalf of himself only. 64. Therefore, the TRA, like the High Court in BHL, concluded that shares will be “held” by the person who is entered onto the share register as being the holder of those shares (ie, the legal holder of the shares). See also Case N26 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,219 at 3,228. 65. These cases are clear that beneficial or equitable ownership of shares without registration does not make a person a “holder” of a share that has been issued by a company. A person does not “hold” shares that have been issued by a company until their name is entered onto the company’s share register as being the holder of those shares. When the name of the person is inserted onto the share register that person obtains the legal title to the shares. This legal title makes that person the “holder” of the shares. This is consistent with the dictionary definition of “hold” and the CA 1993. Therefore, this suggests that shares issued by a company will be “held” in terms of s YC 2 by the registered holder of those shares. This is subject to consideration of whether the context of s YC 2 requires some other conclusion. Context of section YC 2 66. The court in Dalgety considered that if some justification could be found in the relevant context, a reference to “shares ... held” in an enactment might not refer to the legal ownership of shares (see the quotation from that case in paragraph 56). 67. It is necessary then to consider whether the relevant context provides any assistance in clarifying what the reference to “shares ... held” in s YC 2 means. This involves considering the legislative scheme and intent underpinning s YC 2. Legislative intent of section YC 2 68. To consider the legislative intention underpinning s YC 2 it is useful to outline the history of the section. 69. Section YC 2 can be traced back to s 188 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the 1976 Act). Section 188 dealt with the ability of a company to carry forward accumulated losses. This depended on whether there was sufficient continuity of who shares in the company were “held” by. 70. The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1992 introduced ss 8A to 8F to the 1976 Act. This amendment Act introduced new ownership tests of “voting interest” and “market value interest” to provide a measure of a person’s interest in a company. These interest tests were relevant in several regimes such as the continuity provisions, tax recovery provisions and qualifying company regime. 11 71. Section 8C of the 1976 Act provided the “voting interest” measure of a person’s interest in a company. This measure changed the legislative focus from who shares were “held” by to a broader consideration of whether there was sufficient continuity of who had a “voting interest” in the company over a continuity period. 72. Section 8C of the 1976 Act was essentially replicated in s OD 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and s OD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004. It is now set out in s YC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section 8C referred to “shareholder decision-making rights”. “Shareholder decision-making rights” were defined in s 8B of the 1976 Act. Section 8B was replicated in the definitions in s OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and s OB 1of the Income Tax Act 2004 and now appears in the definitions in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 73. The policy intent underpinning (the equivalent of) s YC 2 is summarised in “Measurement of Voting and Market Value Interests” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 7 (April 1992): 18: Under the new provisions, shareholders’ economic interests in a company will generally be measured by reference to their voting interests held in that company, both directly and indirectly through interposed companies. 74. The quotation above shows the intention for the “voting interest” test was to base the measurement of a shareholder’s economic interest in a company on that shareholder’s voting interests in the company. This “voting interest” was determined by the shareholder decision-making rights carried by shares “held” by a person. 75. Therefore, s YC 2 is intended to measure the economic interest a person has in a company based on that person’s voting interests in the company. In turn, these voting interests in the company relate to the right of the person to vote on decisions affecting dividends, the constitution of the company, capital variations and the appointment of directors. 76. As noted at paragraphs 45 and 51, s 89 of the CA 1993 provides that a registered holder of a share has the ability to vote and share in the company’s capital, income and profits. It is the share in the company that carries these rights. This means that a registered holder of a share will have an economic interest (reflected by these rights) in the company. Section YC 2 was intended to capture such economic interests. Therefore, the view that shares issued by a company will be “held” in terms of s YC 2 by the registered holder is arguably consistent with the legislative intention. Next, any other legislative context that clarifies this point is considered. Legislative scheme re the meaning of “shares ... held” 77. Several sections (namely, ss DC 13, DC 15, GB 5, HA 7 and YC 9) state that a trustee, rather than a beneficiary, “holds” shares. Similarly, as detailed in paragraph 86, s YB 21 assumes that trustees (including bare trustees) can “hold” things (including, for instance, shares). No section in the Act states that a beneficiary holds shares for tax purposes. 78. A trustee has the legal interest in trust property (including any shares that are trust property). Therefore, the holder of the shares, in terms of these sections, will be the legal, rather than the equitable or beneficial, owner of the share (ie, the trustee). 79. This suggests that Parliament intended that shares would generally be “held” by the legal owner of those shares. This owner would be the registered holder. This result makes sense; otherwise a trustee and a beneficiary could “hold” the same share at the same time. This would raise the issue of whether the legal holder or equitable holder would be assessable for tax on dividend income arising from the shares. It is reasonable to believe that 12 Parliament would not have intended these compliance costs. There would also be the possibility that both holders would be assessable for dividend income, raising double taxation issues. This provides further support for the view that the reference to “shares ... held” in s YC 2 should generally be read as referring to the registered holder. 80. Section YC 13(7) is also relevant. Section YC 13(7) relates to the over- riding of the look-through rules in the context of corporate spin-outs. The issue of corporate spin-outs is beyond the scope of this Interpretation Statement. However, s YC 13(7) provides useful contextual guidance about the intended scope of s YB 21. Section YC 13(7) states: For the purposes of measuring common interests, neither section YB 21 (Transparency of nominees) nor YC 4 apply to treat a nominee’s or company’s voting interest or market value interest in the original parent or the spun-out company to be held by another person, if the interest the other person would be treated as holding would be less than 10%. 81. Section YC 13(7) is based on the assumption that, but for s YB 21, a “nominee” shareholder would be a shareholder who has a “voting interest” in a company. As is explained in paragraphs 114 to 118, a nominee shareholder has the legal interest in a share. Therefore, s YC 13(7) provides further support for the view that the reference to shares “held” in s YC 2 should (subject to, for instance, s YB 21 applying) generally be read as covering the person who has the legal interest in the share. 82. Therefore, despite the comments of the court in Dalgety noted in paragraph 56, the relevant context of the scheme and intent of the legislation in relation to s YC 2 does not support departing from the view that legal ownership of shares is what determines who holds shares. Conclusion about who holds shares 83. The Commissioner considers that, as a rule, shares issued by a registered company in accordance with s 51 of the CA 1993 will be “held” in terms of s YC 2 by the registered holder of those shares. The registered holder of shares is the person whose name has been entered onto the share register of the company as the holder of those shares. This is consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of “shares ... held”, the approach that the courts have adopted in relation to this issue, and the relevant context of the Act. 84. However, there are exceptions to this rule. One exception applies if a “nominee” holds the shares in terms of s YB 21. Other exceptions are set out in ss YC 8 to YC 19 and FB 10. 85. These exceptions are looked at next. What are the exceptions to the rule of who “holds” shares? Nominees and section YB 21 86. Section YB 21 provides that: (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, if a person holds something or does something as a nominee for another person, the other person holds or does that thing and the nominee is ignored. (2) A person holds or does something as a nominee for another person if the person acts on the other person's behalf. However, a trustee is a nominee only if the trustee is a bare trustee. (3) A person making a nominal settlement at the request of another person is treated for the purposes of this Act as a nominee in relation to the settlement. \[Emphasis added\] 87. Section YB 21 has general application and operates as an exception to various provisions of the Act. Section YB 21(2) provides that a person is a nominee of another person, if the person “acts on the other person’s behalf”. 13 Where s YB 21 applies, the result is that if someone acts as a nominee for another person, that other person is deemed to hold or do something and the nominee is ignored. This helps to determine where the real economic control resides. In this sense, s YB 21 has a similar legislative intent as s YC 2. 88. Accordingly, s YB 21 is relevant to the application of s YC 2 because s YB 21 can deem that a registered holder acts, and so holds their shares as nominee, on behalf of someone else. If so, that other person will be deemed to “hold” the shares in terms of s YC 2. 89. Section YB 21(2) refers to a person (the “nominee”) who “acts on the other person’s behalf”, including where the nominee is a “bare trustee” for the other person. The meaning of these terms is looked at next. Following that, the application of s YB 21 in the context of shares is considered. When the person “acts on the other person’s behalf” 90. The Act does not define the meaning of “act” or “acts” for the purposes of s YB 21. Therefore, the reference to “acts” is to be read as having its ordinary meaning. 91. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines “act” as: act □ v. 1 take action; do something... 2 (act for/on behalf of) representing on a contractual or legal basis. 92. The Commissioner considers that a person will “act” in terms of s YB 21, if they take action or do something on that other person’s behalf, including representing the other person on a legal basis. Although the holding of shares may appear to be passive and not requiring the holder to take action or do something, it does require the person to act as the legal holder of shares such as exercising voting rights as directed by the other person. 93. The Act also does not define “on the other person’s behalf”. Therefore, this phrase is also to be read as having its ordinary meaning. The courts have considered the ordinary meaning of “on behalf of” many times. This is a slightly different phrase from that set out in s YB 21(2). However, given the similarity between the phrase “on the other person’s behalf” and the phrase “on behalf of”, cases considering the latter are relevant. 94. Latham CJ discussed the general view of the phrase “on behalf of” in the Australian case R v Portus, ex p Federated Clerk’s Union of Australia (1949) 79 CLR 428. Latham CJ stated at 435,: The phrase on behalf of is not an expression which has a strict legal meaning, it bears no single and constant significance. Instead it may be used in conjunction with a wide range of relationships, all however in some way \[are\] concerned with the standing of one person as auxiliary to or representative of another person or thing. \[Emphasis added\] 95. As noted in Portus above, “on behalf of” can apply to a wide variety of relationships. For instance, in Lewis v Nicholson (1852) 18 QB 503 the court considered that an agreement entered into by one party “on behalf of” another party meant the relationship between the parties was one of agent and principal. 96. In Case D27, the TRA, in relation to the expression “on behalf of”, stated at 60,628: In Words and Phrases Legally Defined, vol. 4, cases are cited under the words “ON BEHALF OF”. Lord Hatherley in Gillespie v City of Glasgow Bank (1879) 4 App. Cas. 632 at p. 642 said: I cannot perceive a difference between the words “for behoof of” and “in trust for”. I hold the expression “for behoof of” to mean exactly the same as if the words used had been “on behalf of” or “for the benefit 14 of”, or any of those other words, of which many might be suggested, which indicate that although to the bank you are the absolute owner of the shares, yet as regards a third person, with whom you have entered into an arrangement you are not that owner. \[Emphasis added\] 97. This passage indicates that “on behalf of” and similar terms mean “in trust for” another person. The TRA does not analyse the term further. It is apparent, however, from the TRA’s direct application of the law to the facts that to prove that one person was holding shares on behalf of another evidence of a trust or another similar arrangement or agreement is required. 98. Although the concept of a “nominee” is discussed later in this Interpretation Statement (at paragraphs 114 to 118), the term is used sometimes to signify an agent or a trustee in the sense of someone acting for another in representation of another. For instance, in Schuh Trading Co v Comm’r 95 F 2d 404 (7th Cir 1938) a case concerning the transfer of company assets to a nominee, the judge said at 411: The word nominee ordinarily indicates one designated to act for another as his \[or her\] representative in a rather limited sense. It is used sometimes to signify an agent or trustee. It has no connotation, however, other than that of acting for another, in representation of another, or as the grantee of another. \[Emphasis added\] 99. Similarly, in Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2005), the term “nominee” is defined to mean an agent acting on behalf of a principal: nominee An agent acting on behalf of a principal, often employed in the buying and selling of securities. \[Emphasis added\] 100. This extract means, consistent with the court’s approach in Schuh, “on behalf of” covers a nominee or an agent who is acting on behalf of a principal. 101. It can be concluded that the expression “on behalf of”:  is not an expression that has a strict legal meaning; instead, it takes its meaning from the context in which it is used (Portus);  it may be used in conjunction with a wide variety of relationships (Portus);  is concerned with the standing of one person as auxiliary to or representative of another person or thing (Portus);  may be satisfied by a trust, a nominee or an agency arrangement with another person (Case D27, Lewis, Schuh and Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary). 102. Therefore, the reference to “on the other person’s behalf” in s YB 21(2) covers those instances where something is held or done (the acting) “on trust” for someone else. The inclusion of acting “on trust” is supported by what is effectively a proviso in s YB 21(2) that excludes all but “bare trustees” from being nominees under the section. 103. Of all the relationships that may be encompassed by the phrase “acts on the other person’s behalf”, of most relevance in the present context is that of a “bare trustee”. This relationship is considered next. When a person acts as “bare trustee” 104. The Act does not define “bare trustee”. Therefore, this phrase is to be read as having its ordinary meaning. The meaning of “bare trustee” has been stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England (Trusts, vol 48 (2007 Reissue) at \[755\]) as: A bare trustee has been defined as a person who holds property in trust for the absolute benefit and at the absolute disposal of other persons who are of full age and sui juris in respect of it, and who has himself no present beneficial interest in 15 it and no duties to perform in respect of it except to convey or transfer it to persons entitled to hold it, and he is bound to convey or transfer the property accordingly when required to do so. 105. Lewin on Trusts (16th ed, Sweet and Maxwell, London, 1964) provides a useful definition of a “bare trust”, as compared with a “special trust”. It also refers to a “bare trustee” in the context of someone who holds shares in a company. Lewin on Trusts states at 6: The simple or bare trust is where property is vested in one person upon trust for another, and the nature of the trust, not being prescribed by the settlor, is left to the construction of law. In this case the beneficiary has...the right to be put into actual possession of the property, and ... the right to call upon the trustee to execute conveyances of the legal estate as the beneficiary directs. A bare or simple trustee, especially of shares in a limited company, is often called a nominee. 2 He is a mere name or “dummy” for the true owner.... The special trust is where the machinery of a trustee is introduced for the execution of the purpose particularly pointed out, and the trustee is not, as before, a mere passive depositary of the estate, but is called upon to exert himself actively in the execution of the settlor’s intention, as in the ordinary case of a trustee holding property on the express trusts of a settlement or of a will, or where a conveyance is made to trustees upon trust to sell for payment of debts. \[Emphasis added\] 106. In Herdegen v FCT (1988) 20 ATR 24, the frequently cited decision on the meaning of a bare trust, Gummow J said at 32-33: Today the usually accepted meaning of “bare” trust is a trust under which the trustee or trustees hold property without any interest therein, other than that existing by reason of the office and the legal title as trustee, and without any duty or further duty to perform, except to convey it upon demand to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or as directed by them, for example on sale to a third party. The term is usually used in relation to trusts created by express declaration. But it has been said that the assignor under an Agreement for Value for Assignment of so-called “future” property becomes, on acquisition of the title to the property, trustee of that property for the assignee. \[Emphasis added\] 107. A later edition of Lewin on Trusts (18th ed, Sweet and Maxwell, London, 2008) provides at 15: A distinction has traditionally been drawn between “bare” trusts, or “simple” or "naked” trusts, and “special” trusts. According to that distinction, a bare trustee holds property in trust for a single beneficiary absolutely and indefeasibly, and is a mere passive repository for the beneficial owner, having no duties other than a duty to transfer the property to the beneficial owner or as he directs. By contrast a trustee holding property on special trusts has active duties to perform, for example in executing the trusts of a will or settlement, with administrative (and perhaps, also dispositive) powers accompanying his active duties. It is still possible to distinguish between an absolute trust for a single beneficiary, which might still be called a bare or simple trust, and other types of trust. \[Emphasis added\] 108. These descriptions of a “bare trustee” refer to the trustee’s duty to transfer the property held to the beneficial owner on demand. Halsbury’s Laws of England adds further that the beneficial owner or person for whose benefit the trust was created needs to be “of full age and sui juris” in respect of the property. Sui juris is a legal phrase used to describe people who are under no disability affecting their legal capacity to deal with their property, to bind themselves by contracts, and to sue and be sued. People who do not have full legal capacity, so are not sui juris, can include minors and people who are mentally incapable. 109. A “bare trustee” is often referred to as being a “nominee” in the context of shares. This seems to be consistent with the definition of “nominee” in s YB 21 specifically including bare trustees. 2 Subsequent editions of this publication omit the reference to nominee. 16 110. Furthermore, before a bare trust can be found to exist, there must be a valid trust. This is because a bare trust is a type of trust. The trust must possess the “three certainties”:  certainty of intention (ie, evidence of an intention to create a trust);  certainty of subject matter (ie, the property that is subject to the trust relationship must be clearly identifiable); and  certainty of objects (ie, ascertainable beneficiaries who have the power to enforce the trust: see Knight v Knight (1840) 3 Beav 148). 111. These elements have been firmly accepted in New Zealand law. See, for example, the Court of Appeal’s judgments in Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of NZ Inc v Nelson City Council \[1984\] 2 NZLR 480 at 486 and Foreman v Hazard \[1984\] 1 NZLR 586 at 594. 112. Three principles can be distilled from these authorities:  A “bare trustee” is a person who holds property on trust for the absolute benefit and at the absolute disposal of other persons, and has no beneficial interest in the property.  A “bare trustee” does not have any duties to perform in regard to the property, except to convey or transfer it to a person entitled to hold it when required to do so.  For a bare trust relationship to exist, the three certainties of a trust must be satisfied. 113. Furthermore, the courts have also deemed a bare trust relationship (in relation to property) to exist in certain other circumstances: see Musselwhite v CH Musselwhite & Son Ltd \[1962\] Ch 964. The court in Musselwhite noted that a vendor of a share under an agreement is deemed to hold that share on bare trust for the purchaser at the point of settlement and before the purchaser’s name has been entered onto the company’s share register. This case is discussed from paragraph 133 in relation to when a change in “shares ... held” occurs. When a person acts as “nominee” 114. Finally, s YB 21 uses the term “nominee”. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines “nominee” as: 2 a person or company, not the owner, in whose name a company, stock, etc. is registered. 115. As noted at paragraph 99, in Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2005), the term “nominee” is defined to mean an agent acting on behalf of a principal: nominee An agent acting on behalf of a principal, often employed in the buying and selling of securities. 116. Furthermore, as noted at paragraph 105, in Lewin on Trusts (16th ed, Sweet and Maxwell, London, 1964) a bare or simple trustee, especially of shares in a limited company, is often called a nominee. 117. Therefore, a nominee would include a person who, for instance, is employed in the buying and selling of shares as agent for a principal. This means the meanings of “nominee” and “agent” overlap. 118. A nominee would also include a person who is, for instance, the registered holder of shares, albeit that someone else beneficially “owns” the shares. As noted above, the same test applies to determine whether shares are held on “bare trust”. This means there is also an overlap between the meanings of “nominee” and “bare trustee”, particularly in the context of shares. 17 Application of section YB 21 119. Having considered the terms used in s YB 21, it is necessary to consider how the section might apply in the context of shares. The circumstances when a registered holder will hold shares as bare trustee or nominee for someone else depends on whether the:  shares are held by the registered holder for that other person on a bare trust that satisfies the three certainties of a trust or on a bare trust that is deemed to exist by operation of the law (see the discussion from paragraph 131); or  registered holder merely holds the shares as nominee for someone else (who holds all of the beneficial interest in the shares). 120. Section YB 21(1) deems that, in such instances, the thing will be “held” by that other person and not by the bare trustee or nominee. This is directly relevant to the main interpretive issue of who shares are “held” by in a company in terms of s YC 2. This is because if the registered holder of a share holds a share as bare trustee or nominee for someone else, this means that they “act” for that other person in terms of s YB 21(2). Therefore, unless varied by any other provision in the Act, that share will be deemed by s YB 21(1) to be held by that other person and not to be held by the registered holder in terms of s YC 2. 121. This view is also consistent with the conclusion reached in the Question We’ve Been Asked “QB 10/06: Elections for Qualifying Company Status” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). QB 10/06 states at 114: A nominee shareholder Where a person uses a nominee to hold shares in a company, the nominee is the shareholder on the company’s share register. However, the nominee holds the shares for the other person (the beneficial owner of the shares). 122. Accordingly, s YB 21 operates as an exception to the rule that shares issued by a company are “held” by the registered holder in terms of s YC 2. 123. As mentioned in paragraph 84, in addition to s YB 21 there are other exceptions to the rule that shares are “held” in terms of s YC 2 by the registered holder of those shares. These other exceptions are in ss YC 8 to YC 19 and FB 10. Sections YC 8 to YC 19 and FB 10 124. Sections YC 8 to YC 19 and FB 10 deal with:  the death of the share or option holder (s YC 8);  shares or options held by trustees (s YC 9);  shareholders holding less than 10% direct interests (s YC 10);  the no look-through rule for companies in certain cases (s YC 11);  public unit trusts (s YC 12);  corporate spin-outs (s YC 13);  disregarding concessionary rules (s YC 14);  directors’ knowledge of failure to meet requirements of continuity provision (s YC 15);  disregarding market value changes (s YC 16);  the demutualisation of insurers (s YC 17);  reverse takeovers (s YC 18);  corporate reorganisations not affecting economic ownership (s YC 18B); 18  the legislative conversion of foreign company of proprietors (s YC 19); and  continuity provisions: shares and options (s FB 10; settlements of relationship property). 125. It is beyond the scope of this Interpretation Statement to discuss these provisions in any depth but they generally apply when certain events occur (eg, the death of a shareholder). 126. These sections (in particular, ss YC 9 to YC 11) will sometimes be relevant to agreements for the sale and purchase of shares. For instance, if the purchaser is a trustee (s YC 9), holds direct interests of less than 10% in the target company (s YC 10) or is a company (s YC 11), these provisions could deem the shares to be “held” by someone other than the registered holder. 127. Accordingly, these provisions can operate as exceptions to the rule that shares will be “held” by the registered holder. Therefore, they must always be considered when the continuity provisions are applied. When will there be a change in who holds shares? 128. Considered next is at what point in terms of s YC 2 there is a change in who shares are “held” by (ie, during a sale or transfer of shares). 129. It is helpful to first outline the stages of the share transfer process under which a purchaser becomes a registered holder of a company in terms of the CA 1993. The main stages in this process are listed below. These stages are not necessarily in sequential order. The precise order will always be a question of fact:  An agreement for the sale and purchase of the shares is entered into. This agreement could be an oral agreement or in writing.  A share transfer form, share certificate (if applicable) and other relevant documentation (if applicable) is completed and delivered to the company pursuant to the share transfer process set out in the Securities Transfer Act 1991.  The purchaser pays for the shares (settlement).  The company decides, in accordance with its constitution and any relevant provision of the CA 1993, whether to accept the transfer of the shares.  If the company decides to accept the transfer, the purchaser is entitled to have their name entered into the company’s share register as being the holder of the shares.  The company enters the purchaser’s name onto the company’s share register in accordance with s 89 of the CA 1993. 130. However, the circumstances of a transfer of shares under the CA 1993 are not always the same as when there is a change in who “holds” shares in terms of s YC 2. This is because, as mentioned in paragraph 84, the Act includes exceptions so that it does not always treat the registered holder of the shares as the holder of the shares. At least one of those occasions (the look-though of nominees under s YB 21) can occur during a transfer of shares. When th e vendor holds the shares as “nominee” for the purchaser 131. The vendor of shares “holds” shares as “nominee” for the purchaser in the following circumstances:  An agreement creates a “nominee” relationship – the vendor and the purchaser enter into an agreement, either as part of the transfer 19 agreement or separately, that explicitly or implicitly creates a “nominee” relationship in relation to the shares.  The share transfer agreement has been settled – the vendor is the bare trustee for the purchaser of shares under an agreement that has been settled but the purchaser is not the registered holder of the shares. In such a case the purchaser may go on to be registered, or may never be registered (eg, where it is agreed the vendor will hold the shares as bare trustee for the purchaser indefinitely). When the share transfer agreement has been settled 132. Unless the parties otherwise agree, when an agreement for the sale and purchase of shares has been entered into, the vendor will continue to hold those shares in terms of s YC 2 until the agreement has been settled. In such a case, provided the purchaser is sui juris and of full age, once the agreement has been settled the shares will be deemed to be held by the vendor as “bare trustee” for the purchaser. Therefore, the vendor will hold the shares as “nominee” in terms of s YB 21. This means that, unless varied by any of the statutory exceptions, the shares will be deemed (by s YB 21) to be “held” by the purchaser and not to be “held” by the vendor in terms of s YC 2. This is also assuming the purchaser’s name has not already been entered in the register of the company as the new holder of the shares before settlement in circumstances where the parties’ intention is that the change in ownership occurs before settlement. If this occurs, the purchaser will hold the shares from the date of their registration, consistent with the parties’ intention and s YB 21 will not apply. 133. The leading case in this area is Musselwhite. The court in that case considered whether an unpaid vendor of shares had voting rights in relation to those shares. The court decided that the purchaser merely had an equitable interest in those shares. Therefore, in the absence of a contrary provision in the contract, the vendor retained the prima facie right to vote in relation to those shares. The court referred, at 986, with approval to the comments of Jessel MR in Lysaght v Edwards (1876) 2 Ch D 505 at 505– 506: The matter was put thus by Jessel M.R. in Lysaght v. Edwards: ... In other words, the position of the vendor is something between what has been called a naked or bare trustee, or a mere trustee (that is, a person without beneficial interest), and a mortgagee who is not, in equity (any more than a vendor), the owner of the estate, but is, in certain events, entitled to what the unpaid vendor is, viz., possession of the estate and a charge upon the estate for his purchase-money ... In my judgment an unpaid vendor of shares remaining on the register after the contract for sale retains vis-a-vis the purchaser the prima facie right to vote in respect of those shares. \[Emphasis added\] 134. Therefore, the decision in Musselwhite shows that when an agreement for the sale and purchase of shares is entered into the shares will (before settlement) be held by the vendor with the purchaser having an equitable interest in those shares (see also Hardoon v Belilios \[1901\] AC 118 and Loring v Davis (1886) 32 Ch D 625). The vendor remaining on the share register would not, unless the parties had entered into an agreement creating a bare trustee relationship, hold the shares on bare trust for the purchaser at that point. Therefore, before settlement the shares would still be “held” by the vendor in terms of s YC 2. 135. The decision in Musselwhite was also cited with approval by the High Court in Gillespie v Kinloch Golf Resort Ltd (2008) 10 NZCLC 264,393 at 264,402. The court in Gillespie held: An unpaid vendor of shares remaining on the register after the contract for sale retains vis-à-vis the purchaser the prima facie right to vote in respect of those shares: Musselwhite v C. H. Musselwhite & Son Ltd \[1962\] 1 All ER 201 at 208 ... 20 in the absence of any contractual restriction in the agreement to the contrary, the Gillespies were entitled to exercise their voting rights as they saw fit. 136. Furthermore, the TRA in Case N26 held at 3,228 that: Musselwhite’s case ... sets forth the position with regard to such matters as voting rights. In that case an unpaid vendor of shares remained on the company's register of registered members or shareholders after the contract for the sale of those shares was made. It was decided in that case that the unpaid vendor, retained the rights to vote in respect of those shares, vis-a-vis the purchaser, unless the sale agreement restricted such a right. 137. The relationship between a vendor and purchaser of shares was also considered by the UK Court of Appeal in Michaels v Harley House (Marylebone) Ltd \[1999\] 1 All ER 356. The court held at 367, consistent with the court’s approach in Musselwhite, that: the vendor under an uncompleted contract for the sale and purchase of shares is prima facie entitled to exercise the voting rights ... A registered shareholder who is absolute beneficial owner can vote as he pleases ... A registered shareholder who is a nominee must vote in accordance with the directions of the absolute beneficial owner, to whom his voting rights are attributed. A registered shareholder who is a vendor under an uncompleted contract is in an intermediate position, a fiduciary but not a nominee. \[Emphasis added\] 138. These cases followed the approach adopted by the court in Musselwhite. They are clear that, when an agreement has been entered into for the sale and purchase of shares, the vendor retains a beneficial interest in those shares until settlement occurs. As noted at paragraph 112, a bare trustee in relation to an asset does not have any beneficial interest in that asset. Therefore, a vendor will not be a bare trustee before settlement. Therefore, s YB 21 would not apply. 139. However, the nature of this relationship between the vendor and purchaser (in relation to the shares) changes when the agreement for the sale and purchase of shares is settled. This point is summarised in Avon Downs at 365: It seems to me that a transferor of a share who has been paid the consideration for the transfer, holds simply as a passive trustee until the registration of the transfer and entry of the transferee’s name on the register. \[Emphasis added\] 140. In other words, the court considered that a transferor of shares holds those shares as passive or bare trustee for the purchaser when an agreement is settled. 3 The characteristics of a bare trust were discussed at paragraphs 104 to 113. In the case of a settled agreement for the sale and purchase of shares, the court will recognise the existence of a bare trust relationship between a vendor and purchaser, although the parties may have had no intention of creating a trust. The transferor would have no beneficial interest in those shares at that stage. Therefore, they would be obliged to vote in accordance with the purchaser’s instructions. This is consistent with the distinction drawn by the court in Michaels between a transferor under an uncompleted contract for the sale of shares and a transferor under a completed contract for the sale of shares (who would hold those shares as bare trustee or nominee for the purchaser). 141. The court adopted a similar approach in Stern v McArthur (1988) 165 CLR 489, although the case related to an agreement for the sale of land. The purchaser had not yet paid the full purchase price for that land. The court considered the nature of the purchaser’s interest in that land. In their judgment, Deane and Dawson JJ stated at 522: It has been said in a variety of ways that a vendor under a valid contract for the sale of land holds the land as trustee for the purchaser. He is, however, a trustee only in a qualified sense and the qualifications are such as to rob the proposition of much of its significance or, for some purposes, its 3 A “passive” trust is another way of referring to a “bare trust”: see Underhill and Hayton: Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees (18th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, London, 2010, at 87). 21 validity ... the vendor retains a substantial interest in the property until the whole of the purchase money is paid. He is entitled, subject to the contract, to possession and to the rents and profits in addition to a lien on the land as security for any amount outstanding. Any right to equitable ownership on the part of the purchaser is contingent only ... it is not really possible with accuracy to go further than to say that the purchaser acquires an equitable interest in the land sold and to that extent the beneficial interest of the vendor in the land is diminished. \[Emphasis added\] 142. The court considered that, when an agreement for the sale and purchase of land has been entered into, the vendor would retain a beneficial interest in that land until settlement. Therefore, the court considered that such a vendor would not hold the land on bare trust or as a nominee (for the purchaser) until the agreement had been settled. This is the point (settlement of the agreement) when the entire vendor’s beneficial ownership would have transferred to the purchaser. This is consistent with the approach adopted by the courts for the transfer of shares in Musselwhite, Michaels and Avon Downs. Despite this, it may be possible for the parties to specifically agree that at settlement beneficial ownership does not pass until some later time. In such a case a bare trustee relationship may not be created. They might, for instance, agree beneficial ownership passes at the point of registration of the purchaser to avoid the possibility of the purchaser being unable to obtain registration – the next issue discussed. 143. There may be occasions where the purchaser does not ultimately have their name entered onto the share register of the company as the registered holder of the shares. Such a situation is explained by A Beck, in Guidebook to NZ Companies and Securities Law (8th ed, CCH, Auckland, 2010, at \[546\]): On a sale of shares the transferor does not guarantee that the transferee will obtain registration. The transferor is bound only to do all that is necessary to put the transferee in a position to obtain registration, which is the responsibility of the latter (Skinner v The City of London Marine Insurance Corp (1885) 14 QBD 882 (CA)). The transferor is bound only to do no more than deliver to the transferee a completed transfer form and the relevant share certificate if one has been issued. If the company refuses to register the transfer, neither party may cancel the contract of sale and the purchaser is not entitled to recover the purchase price (London Founders Assn Ltd & Palmer v Clarke (1888) 20 QBD 576 (CA)) In such cases a bare trustee relationship would persist. The registered shareholder (vendor) would continue to be looked through under s YB 21 with the purchaser considered to “hold” the shares for tax purposes. It may be that the purchaser has no desire to become registered, but if the vendor and purchaser wished to protect themselves from such an outcome they could make the sale conditional on registration of the transfer or, as mentioned at paragraph 142, provide for beneficial ownership to pass only with registration. 144. On the basis of the above cases, it is concluded that when an agreement has been entered into for the sale and purchase of shares the shares can be held by the vendor as “bare trustee” for the purchaser. This will be the case where, subject to any agreement to the contrary, all of the following circumstances arise:  The agreement has been settled so that the vendor has the legal obligation to vote in accordance with the purchaser’s instructions but has no ongoing active duties as trustee. Absent any specific rules or agreements otherwise, all dividends received by the vendor would also be owned beneficially by the purchaser. The vendor would have no beneficial interest in the shares at that stage.  The purchaser’s name has not been entered onto the company’s share register as being the registered holder of those shares.  The purchaser is of full age and sui juris (see the quotation from Halsbury’s Laws of England at paragraph 104). 22 145. If the three circumstances listed above arise, the vendor would hold the shares as “nominee” for the purchaser at that stage in terms of s YB 21; that is, unless any of the specific statutory exceptions applied or the purchaser was acting as nominee for someone else. Otherwise, the shares will, because of s YB 21, be deemed to be “held” by the purchaser in terms of s YC 2 and deemed not “held” by the vendor at that stage. 146. This interpretation of s YB 21 is consistent with the legislative intent underpinning s YC 2. As noted at paragraph 75, s YC 2 was intended to provide a means of determining a shareholders’ economic interest in the company in terms of their ability to control the company’s affairs. When shares are held by a “nominee” the principal or beneficiary has voting power (as they may instruct the nominee how to vote) and, generally, the beneficial right to any dividends in relation to the shares. They would clearly have an economic interest in the company and, depending on the size of their holding, be able to control the company’s affairs. When an agreement creates a “nominee” relationship 147. Consistent with the comments made by the court in Musselwhite (see paragraph 133), a vendor of shares could enter into an agreement to become a “nominee” holder of shares for a purchaser (who is sui juris and of full age) under s YB 21. This could occur if the parties entered into an agreement having the effect of creating the situation where the vendor holds those shares either as nominee or bare trustee for the purchaser, although the purchaser’s name has not been entered onto the company’s share register as the holder of the shares. This could be achieved by, for instance, inserting the requisite clauses into the share transfer agreement creating such a relationship. Alternatively, the parties could enter into another contract setting out this relationship in relation to the shares in question. This will always be a question of fact and law and will be determined by the principles outlined in paragraphs 86 to 123. However, in terms of creating a nominee relationship the Commissioner considers that some situations where such a relationship would not necessarily arise before full settlement of an agreement include where:  an agreement simply imposes a duty on the vendor not to act in a way detrimental to the purchaser's interest in the shares;  the vendor must consult with the purchaser (but not necessarily follow the purchaser’s instructions) in relation to certain matters. 148. If there is such an agreement creating a nominee or bare trust relationship, the vendor will, at the time the agreement is entered into, become a “nominee” holder of the shares in terms of s YB 21. Therefore, the shares will (unless varied by any of the statutory exceptions referred to above) be deemed to be “held” by the purchaser and deemed not to be “held” by the vendor in terms of s YC 2. Conclusion 149. As a rule, shares issued by a company under s 51 of the CA 1993 will be “held” in terms of s YC 2 by the registered holder of those shares. The registered holder of shares is the person whose name appears on the share register of the company (see Dalgety, Patrick, Patcorp, Spencer, Bainbridge, BHL; Case D27 and Case N26). 150. An exception to this rule is if those shares are “held” by the registered holder as “nominee” for someone else in terms of s YB 21. If so, that other person will, unless varied by any other provision in the Act, be deemed to hold those shares and the registered holder will be deemed not to hold those shares in terms of s YC 2. 23 151. Other provisions of the Act that can vary the above conclusions are set out in ss YC 8 to YC 19 and FB 10. If any of these exceptions apply, someone other than the registered holder may be deemed to hold those shares in terms of s YC 2 for the purposes of applying the continuity provisions. 152. An agreement for the sale and purchase of shares (as issued under s 51 of the CA 1993) will result in a change in who “holds” shares in terms of s YC 2 at the earlier of when the:  purchaser’s name is entered onto the share register as the holder of the shares in accordance with the agreement;  vendor holds the shares as “nominee” for the purchaser (who is sui juris and of full age) in terms of s YB 21, which will occur if either the: o vendor and the purchaser enter into an agreement, either as part of the transfer agreement or separately, that explicitly or implicitly creates a nominee relationship in relation to the shares; o vendor is the bare trustee for the purchaser under an agreement that has been settled but the purchaser is not the registered holder of the shares; in such a case, the purchaser may go on to be registered or may never be registered (eg, where it is agreed the vendor will hold the shares as bare trustee for the purchaser indefinitely). 153. However, in the nominee situation, exceptions to when the purchaser is then the holder of the shares will arise if:  the purchaser is themselves a “nominee” for someone else (in which case s YB 21 will deem the shares to be “held” by that other person);  any of ss YC 8 to YC 19 or s FB 10 apply. 154. Where the vendor is the purchaser’s nominee, the subsequent entering of the purchaser’s name onto the share register of the company does not affect who holds the shares. In the nominee situation, the purchaser is already treated as holding those shares before that time. 155. These conclusions are illustrated in the following flowchart. It is assumed that any purchaser of shares is acting in their own right and not as a nominee or bare trustee for a third party. 24 25 Examples 156. The following five examples help to explain the application of the law. They illustrate situations where who holds shares and when there is a change in who holds shares affect the calculation of voting interests and the application of the continuity provisions. To illustrate these points, the tax consequences mentioned have been limited to a single continuity provision. However, in practice the change in who holds shares shown in each example could affect several continuity provisions. 157. The examples are:  Example 1: Change in who holds shares after end of continuity period for carrying forward income tax losses.  Example 2: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of income tax losses.  Example 3: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of imputation credits — purchaser registered as shareholder before full settlement.  Example 4: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of imputation credits — purchaser registered as shareholder after full settlement by way of vendor finance.  Example 5: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of imputation credits — purchaser registered as shareholder after full settlement by way of cash. 158. In these examples the following is assumed:  The company in each case has 100 shares and a standard 31 March balance date.  All the shares carry the same shareholder decision-making rights.  No transaction or arrangement has been entered into by the company that varies those shareholder decision-making rights.  No “options” carrying any shareholder decision-making rights have been issued or granted, either by the company or any shareholder, in relation to these shares in terms of s YC 2. In addition, it is assumed the agreement to transfer the shares does not give rise to an “option” (as defined).  There have not been any “market value circumstances”. In particular, it is assumed the agreement to transfer the shares does not give rise to a “market value circumstance” (as defined).  Neither the existing shareholders nor any of the new holders of shares are nominees for other persons (except, where noted, a nominee relationship arises during the transfer of the shares). 159. In all cases and for the avoidance of doubt, the outcomes in terms of the application of the continuity provisions shown in these examples may not apply where s BG 1 applies. Example 1: Change in who holds shares after end of continuity period for carrying forward income tax losses 160. Company A incurred a net loss of $100,000 for the year ended 31 March 2010. It has net income of $200,000 for the year ended 31 March 2011. 161. Company A’s shareholding for the 2010 income year (ie, from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) was:  Bill – 60% (60 shares)  Mary – 28% (28 shares)  Mike – 12% (12 shares) 26 162. The following events subsequently occur:  On 20 March 2011 Bill enters into an agreement to transfer all of his shares to Tom.  On 4 April 2011 the agreement is settled in full.  On 5 April 2011 Company A agrees to the transfer of the shares.  On 10 April 2011 Company A enters Tom’s name onto the company’s share register as being the registered holder of the 60 shares. Is Company A able to carry forward its 2010 net loss of $100,000 and offset that loss against its 2011 net income of $200,000? 163. A change in who holds Bill’s 60 shares occurs for tax purposes on 4 April 2011. This is because when settlement in full occurs on 4 April 2011, s YB 21 will deem the shares to be held by Bill as nominee (bare trustee) for Tom for the purposes of s YC 2. Tom is deemed to hold the shares and Bill is deemed not to hold the shares. 164. There is no further change in who holds the shares when Tom becomes the registered holder of the shares on 10 April 2011. This is because for tax purposes Tom is treated as holding those shares already. 165. Assuming that none of the other statutory exceptions applies, the minimum voting interest of the shareholders over the continuity period (1 April 2009 – 31 March 2011) is:  Bill – 60%  Mary – 28%  Mike – 12% 166. The combined minimum voting interest of the shareholders over the continuity period is 100%. This is because the change in who holds Bill’s shares occurred after the end of the continuity period. 167. Section IA 5 provides that a tax loss is carried forward if a group of persons holds for the continuity period minimum voting interests in the company that add up to at least 49%. Therefore, the minimum voting interest of the shareholders in Company A over the continuity period of 100% is more than that required by s IA 5. 168. Company A may carry forward and offset its net loss for the 2010 income year against its net income for the 2011 income year. Example 2: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of income tax losses 169. Company B incurs a net loss of $100,000 for the year ended 31 March 2010. Of that loss $80,000 relates to the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 October 2009. The $20,000 balance relates to the period from 1 November 2009 to 31 March 2010. Company B has net income of $200,000 for the year ended 31 March 2011. 170. Company B’s shareholding as at 1 April 2009 was:  Bill – 60% (60 shares)  Mary – 28% (28 shares)  Mike – 12% (12 shares) 171. The following events subsequently occur:  On 20 October 2009 Bill enters into an agreement to transfer all of his shares to Tom.  On 31 October 2009 the agreement is settled in full. 27  On 5 November 2009 Company B agrees to the transfer of the shares.  On 10 November 2009 Company B enters Tom’s name onto the company’s share register as being the registered holder of the 60 shares. Is Company B able to carry forward its 2010 net loss of $100,000 and offset that loss against its 2011 net income of $200,000? 172. A change in who holds Bill’s 60 shares occurs for tax purposes on 31 October 2009. This is because when settlement in full occurs on 31 October 2009 s YB 21 will deem the shares to be held by Bill as nominee (bare trustee) for Tom in terms of s YC 2. Tom is deemed to hold the shares and Bill is deemed not to hold the shares. 173. There is no further change in who holds the shares when Tom becomes the registered holder of the shares on 10 November 2009. This is because for tax purposes Tom is treated as holding those shares already. 174. Assuming that none of the other statutory exceptions applies, the minimum voting interest of the shareholders over the continuity period (1 April 2009 – 31 March 2011) is:  Bill – 0%  Mary – 28%  Mike – 12%  Tom – 0% 175. The combined minimum voting interest of the shareholders over the continuity period is 40%. This is because the change in who holds Bill’s shares occurred before the end of the continuity period. Therefore, Bill’s shares are excluded from the calculation. 176. Section IA 5 provides that a tax loss is carried forward only if a group of persons holds for the continuity period minimum voting interests in the company that add up to at least 49%. Therefore, the minimum voting interest of the shareholders in Company B over the period is less than that required by s IA 5(2). 177. However, Company B may still be able to carry forward and offset part of its tax losses for the 2010 income year against its net income for the 2011 income year. This will depend on whether the requirements set out in s IP 3 are satisfied. In particular, s IP 3(4) provides that, despite a breach of the requirements of s IA 5, a loss from part of an earlier year may be carried forward to the extent that the requirements for continuity would be met if the continuity period included only part of that earlier year. The amount of loss carried forward must be calculated by preparing financial statements in accordance with s IP 6. No amount of loss can be carried forward from a year, if, over that entire year, the company had net income; nor can the amount of the loss carried forward be more than the total loss for that entire year. 178. If the requirements set out in s IP 3 are satisfied, the continuity period can be treated as covering the period since Tom became a shareholder: 1 November 2009 – 31 March 2011. In that period, there would be 100% continuity of who holds the shares in the company. Of Company B’s loss for the 2010 year, $20,000 was incurred in this continuity period. 179. Company B could, provided these requirements are satisfied, carry forward and offset that $20,000 against its net income for the 2011 income year. 28 Example 3: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of imputation credits— purchaser registered as shareholder before full settlement 180. Company C has the following imputation credits in its imputation credit account (arising as a result of tax payments):  28 August 2009 – $20,000  15 January 2010 – $30,000  7 May 2010 – $50,000 181. There are no other entries in the company’s imputation credit account. 182. On 1 April 2009 Company C’s shareholding was:  Bill – 60% (60 shares)  Mary – 28% (28 shares)  Mike – 12% (12 shares) 183. The following events subsequently occur:  On 30 April 2010 Bill enters into an agreement to transfer all of his shares to Tom. The agreement provides for settlement to occur once there has been full payment for the shares. Full payment is to be made in two equal instalments. The first instalment is due on the date of the agreement and the second is due in six months’ time. The agreement provides that ownership of the shares is to pass on the registration of Tom as the new shareholder following payment of the first instalment.  On 30 April 2010 Tom pays the first instalment and Bill delivers signed share transfer documents to Tom.  On 10 May 2010 Company C agrees to the transfer of the shares and enters Tom’s name onto the company’s share register as being the registered holder of the 60 shares.  On 12 May 2010 the board authorises and pays a dividend.  On 31 October 2010 Tom pays the second and final instalment for the shares. Is Company C able to attach imputation credits when it pays the dividend? 184. A change in who holds Bill’s 60 shares occurs for tax purposes on 10 May 2010. This is because Tom’s name is entered onto Company C’s share register as the holder of the shares on 10 May 2010 which is the date on which the agreement provides ownership is to pass. 185. There is no further change in who holds the shares when Tom pays in full for the shares on 31 October 2010. By that date Tom is already the registered holder of the shares. No bare trustee relationship arises between Bill and Tom and s YB 21 does not apply. 186. Assuming that none of the other statutory exceptions applies, the voting interest of the shareholders for the relevant period until the date the dividend is paid is:  Bill – 0%  Mary – 28%  Mike – 12%  Tom – 0 % 187. The combined minimum voting interest of the shareholders over the relevant period is 40%. This is because the change in who holds Bill’s shares occurred before the date the imputation credits could be used by being 29 attached to the dividend paid. Therefore, Bill’s shares are excluded from the calculation. 188. For each imputation credit, shareholder continuity is measured from the time the credit arises until the time it is used or continuity is breached. A combined minimum voting interest of 40% does not satisfy the continuity requirement of 66% or more set out in s OA 8. Section OB 41(1) states that an imputation credit account company has an imputation debit for the amount equal to the imputation credit retained in the imputation credit account and unused before the date on which shareholder continuity is breached. Therefore, as of 10 May 2010 there is a debit of the entire amount in Company C’s imputation credit account (being the $100,000 of tax that Company C paid up to that point). 189. This means Company C has no imputation credits in its imputation credit account that it can attach to the dividends that it authorised and paid on 12 May 2010. Example 4: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of imputation credits— purchaser registered as shareholder after full settlement by way of vendor finance 190. The facts in this example are the same as the preceding example involving Company C with the following two differences in the terms of the agreement between Bill and Tom:  There is no provision in the agreement specifying when ownership of the shares is to pass.  The agreement provides for Bill to provide vendor finance. Settlement of the agreement occurs in full on the provision of acceptable debt arrangements and the payment by Tom of the first instalment. Is Company C able to attach imputation credits when it pays the dividend? 191. A change in who holds the shares occurs on 30 April 2010. This is because with settlement in full occurring at that date, Bill would hold the shares as bare trustee for Tom until Tom’s name was entered onto the company’s share register on 10 May 2010. Under s YB 21 Tom would be deemed to hold the shares from 30 April 2010. 192. There is a debit to Company C’s imputation credit account for $50,000 (being the amount of credits which arose before 30 April 2010). While the change in who holds the shares still occurs before the dividend is paid on 12 May 2010, the $50,000 credit to the company’s imputation credit account for the tax paid on 7 May 2010 would be available to attach to the dividend. This is because there has been continuity of the new shareholding of Company C from the date the tax is paid on 7 May 2010 until the date the dividend is paid a few days later. Example 5: Change in who holds shares before end of continuity period for carrying forward of imputation credits — purchaser registered as shareholder after full settlement by way of cash 193. Company D has the following imputation credits in its imputation credit account (arising as a result of tax payments):  28 August 2009 – $20,000  15 January 2010 – $30,000  7 May 2010 – $50,000 194. There are no other entries in the company’s imputation credit account. 195. On 1 April 2009 Company D’s shareholding was: 30  Bill – 60% (60 shares)  Mary – 28% (28 shares)  Mike – 12% (12 shares) 196. The following events subsequently occur:  On 30 April 2010 Bill enters into an agreement to transfer all of his shares to Tom.  On 8 May 2010 the agreement is settled in full in cash.  On 10 May 2010 Company D agrees to the transfer of the shares.  On 12 May 2010 Company D enters Tom’s name onto the company’s share register as being the registered holder of the 60 shares.  Also on 12 May 2010 the board authorises and pays a dividend. Is Company D able to attach imputation credits when it pays the dividend? 197. A change in who holds Bill’s 60 shares occurs for tax purposes on 8 May 2010. This is because when settlement in full occurs on 8 May 2010, s YB 21 will deem the shares to be held by Bill as nominee (bare trustee) for Tom in terms of s YC 2. Tom is deemed to hold the shares and Bill is deemed not to hold the shares. 198. There is no further change in who holds the shares when Tom becomes the registered holder of the shares on 12 May 2010. This is because for tax purposes Tom is treated as holding those shares already. 199. Assuming that none of the other statutory exceptions applies, the voting interest of the shareholders for the relevant period until the dividend is paid is:  Bill – 0%  Mary – 28%  Mike – 12%  Tom – 0% 200. The combined minimum voting interest of the shareholders over the continuity period is 40%. This is because the change in who holds Bill’s shares occurred before the date the dividend is paid. Therefore, Bill’s shares are excluded from the calculation. 201. For each imputation credit, shareholder continuity is measured from the time the credit arises until the time it is used or continuity is breached. A combined minimum voting interest of 40% does not satisfy the continuity requirement of 66% or more set out in s OA 8. Section OB 41(1) states that an imputation credit account company has an imputation debit for the amount equal to the imputation credit retained in the imputation credit account and unused before the date on which shareholder continuity is breached. Therefore, as of 8 May 2010 there is a debit of the entire amount in Company D’s imputation credit account (being the $100,000 of tax that Company D paid up to that point). 202. This means Company D has no imputation credits in its imputation credit account that it can attach to the dividends tha t it authorised and paid on 12 May 2010. 31 References Related rulings/statements “Measurement of Voting and Market Value Interests” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 7 (April 1992):18 “QB 10/06 Elections for Qualifying Company Status” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011):114 Subject references Bare trustee Continuity provisions Nominees Shares “held” Share transfers Legislative references Companies Act 1993: ss 10, 36, 37, 41, 42, 44, 51, 84, 89, 96 Income Tax Act 1976: ss 8A-8F, 188 Income Tax Act 1994: s OB 1 “shareholder decision-making rights”, OD 3 Income Tax Act 2004: s OB 1 “shareholder decision-making rights”, OD 3 Income Tax Act 2007: ss DC 13, DC 15, FB 10, GB 3-5, HA 7, IA 3-5, IC 1-3, LP 3(4), OA 8, OB 41, OC 24, OE 10, OK 15, YA 1 “continuity provisions”, “excluded option”, “market value circumstance”, “option”, “share”, “shareholder”, “shareholder decision-making right”, “voting interest”, YB 21, YC 2, YC 3, YC 8-19 Case references Avon Downs Pty Ltd v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 353 BHL v CIR (2011) 25 NZTC 20-088 Bainbridge v Smith (1889) LR 41 Ch D 462 Case D27 (1980) 4 NZTC 60,621 Case N26 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,219 Dalgety Downs Pastoral Company Pty Ltd v FCT (1952) 86 CLR 335 Foreman v Hazard \[1984\] 1 NZLR 586 Gillespie v Kinloch Golf Resort Ltd (2008) 10 NZCLC 264,393 Hardoon v Belilios \[1901\] AC 118 Herdegen v FCT (1988) 20 ATR 24 IRC v Laird Group plc \[2003\] BTC 385 IRC v R Woolf (Rubber) Ltd \[1962\] 1 Ch 35 Knight v Knight (1840) 3 Beav 148 Lewis v Nicholson (1852) 18 QB 503 Loring v Davis (1886) 32 Ch D 625 Lysaght v Edwards (1876) 2 Ch D 505 Michaels v Harley House (Marylebone) Ltd \[1999\] 1 All ER 356 Musselwhite v CH Musselwhite & Son Ltd \[1962\] Ch 964 Patcorp Investments Ltd v FCT (1976) 76 ATC 4,225 Patrick Corporation Ltd v FCT (1974) 74 ATC 4,149 R v Portus, ex p Federated Clerk’s Union of Australia (1949) 79 CLR 428 Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of NZ Inc v Nelson City Council \[1984\] 2 NZLR 480 Schuh Trading Co v Comm’r 95 F 2d 404 (7 th Cir. 1938) Spencer v Kennedy \[1926\] Ch 125 Stern v McArthur (1988) 165 CLR 489 Other references Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed, West, St Paul, 2009) Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2005) Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) Guidebook to NZ Companies and Securities Law (8 th ed, CCH, Auckland, 2010) Halsbury’s Laws of England (Trusts, vol 48 (2007 Reissue)) Lewin on Trusts (16th ed, Sweet and Maxwell, London, 1964) Lewin on Trusts (18th ed, Sweet and Maxwell, London, 2008) NZ Company Law and Practice Commentary (online ed, CCH, accessed 12 June 2012) Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) Underhill and Hayton: Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees (18th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, London, 2010, p 87) 32 Appendix: Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 A1.

This Interpretation Statement considers whether income deemed to arise under tax law, but not trust law, can give rise to beneficiary income for tax purposes. If deemed income does give rise to beneficiary income for tax purposes, then the deemed income will be taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. 2. In this Interpretation Statement, “deemed income” is income deemed to arise under a provision of the Income Tax Act 2007. Where deemed income arises, it generally does not result in an actual cash flow to the trust at all, or at least in that income year. This may cause mismatches between the tax law and trust law treatments. Examples of such deemed income include attributed controlled foreign company income, foreign investment fund income, and look-through company income based on an owner’s effective look-through interest. 3. The term “beneficiary income” has a defined meaning in the Act. Under s HC 6, “beneficiary income” is income derived by a trustee that either vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary, or has been paid to the beneficiary, within the time limits imposed by s HC 6(1B). 2 4. An amount vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary when the amount derived is indefeasibly vested in the beneficiary so they obtain an immediate right of present or future possession of the income. The income must not be future property or an expectancy. This means the beneficiary need not receive the amount vested at the time of vesting, but they must have an indefeasible right to that part of the trust property. 5. An amount will be “paid” if it is actually paid, distributed, credited or dealt with in the beneficiary’s interest. Case law establishes that a declaration or resolution by a trustee allocating income to a beneficiary will be sufficient for an amount to be “paid”. 6. Under the Act, there is no apparent impediment to deemed income giving rise to beneficiary income. However, s HC 6 requires an examination of what has happened within the trust. This is because s HC 6 requires income to actually vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, a beneficiary before it can be beneficiary income. The terms of the trust deed and general trust law bind how a trustee may deal with the trust fund. For an amount to vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, a beneficiary, the trust deed must provide for such vesting or payment, either by express provision in the trust deed or through appropriate powers of the trustee. 7. As well as having the power to do so, for an amount of income derived by a trustee to be beneficiary income, the amount must actually vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, the beneficiary. For an amount of trustee income to vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, a beneficiary as beneficiary income for tax purposes, it must be effective for trust law. This is true for all types of income derived by a trustee, not just deemed income. 8. The Commissioner considers that an amount of deemed income cannot itself be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. This is because there is no actual income to vest or pay to a beneficiary. The income is only deemed to arise for tax purposes and does not exist for trust purposes. The trust must have an actual (non-deemed) amount in the trust fund available to be distributed that can be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. Such an amount must actually vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, a beneficiary in a way that is effective for trust law. An actual cash payment does not necessarily have to be made to a beneficiary at the time of the vesting or payment. However, at the time of the vesting or payment, the trust must have sufficient amounts in the trust fund available to be distributed to that beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with the trust deed. This is because a trustee can only vest or pay amounts of the trust fund to beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. 9. When the trust law income of a trust is the same as or exceeds its tax law income in any income year, this will not pose any problems. Provided an equivalent amount of trust law income is actually vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary, and that vesting or payment is effective for trust law, the deemed income will be beneficiary income for tax purposes and taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. 10. However, when the tax law income of a trust exceeds its trust law income in any income year, it is not possible under trust law for the excess tax law income simply to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, beneficiaries unless the trust deed expressly provides a way for this to happen. The Commissioner considers that deemed income will be beneficiary income only to the extent to which is it reflected by an actual amount vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary by the trustee or under the terms of the trust deed. Whether this is possible will depend on the terms of the relevant 3 trust deed. In this situation, it will be necessary for a trustee to resolve that the actual amount from the trust fund is being treated as the vesting or payment of deemed income for tax purposes. If an actual amount from the trust fund is used to vest or pay the deemed income for tax purposes, the Commissioner considers that the amount of deemed income will meet the definition of “beneficiary income”, and will be taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. 11. The examples at the end of this Interpretation Statement apply these principles to three types of trusts in a situation where the tax law income of a trust exceeds its trust law income in a particular income year:  The trust deed does not define income. The tax law income and trust law income of a trust are different. Under the trust deed, the trustee can only vest absolutely in interest or pay income of the trust according to trust law concepts of capital and income. Therefore, trustees will not be able to vest absolutely in interest or pay an amount that equates to deemed income. The deemed income will be treated and taxed as trustee income. This would be the case in any income year.  The trust deed defines trust law income as income calculated for income tax purposes. The tax law income and trust law income of a trust are the same. Under the trust deed, the trustees can vest absolutely in interest or pay income of the trust to beneficiaries according to tax law. To the extent that there are sufficient amounts available in the trust fund, trustees may vest or pay amounts that equate to deemed income. The deemed income will then give rise to beneficiary income.  The trust deed defines income using trust law concepts of capital and income, but the trustees have the power to distribute trust capital to income beneficiaries. The tax law income and trust law income of a trust are different, but the trustees have the power to vest or pay amounts that are more than trust law income to income beneficiaries. To the extent the trustees actually vest absolutely in interest or pay amounts equating to deemed income, the deemed income will give rise to beneficiary income. 12. Therefore, deemed income is never of itself “beneficiary income”, but by a combination of the relevant trust deed and the trustees’ actions, deemed income can in some situations give rise to beneficiary income. However, any vesting or payment of deemed income must be effective for trust law to be beneficiary income for tax purposes. Where it is not vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary, deemed income that is in excess of trust law income is taxed as trustee income. Trustees should, if uncertain, seek legal advice on whether, in a particular income year, their particular trust deed allows them to vest absolutely in interest or pay amounts from the trust fund equating to deemed income. Introduction 13. This Interpretation Statement considers whether income deemed to arise under the Act can be beneficiary income under s HC 6. This issue arises most commonly when the income of a trust under tax law is different from the income of a trust under trust law. A divergence between tax law income and trust law income may occur because of the different rules that apply to each area of law. Trust law requires trustees to treat incomings and outgoings in a particular way, and that treatment is not necessarily aligned with the treatment of such incomings and outgoings under the tax rules. 4 14. In this Interpretation Statement, “deemed income” is income that arises only because of the provisions of the Act. The income has no necessary counterpart in terms of cash flow to a trust, or income for trust law purposes (although there may be a cash flow to another entity). Deemed income arises in several places under the Act, including under s CP 1 (which attributes income to an investor in a multi-rate portfolio investment entity), s CQ 1 (which provides that attributed controlled foreign company income of a person is income), s CQ 4 (which provides that foreign investment fund income of a person is income) and s CB 32B (which provides that look- through company income is income of an owner based on their effective look-through interest). 15. In addition, there are other types of income that arise under the Act that correspond to a cash flow, but nevertheless create a mismatch between tax law income and trust law income. Sometimes the cash flow may arise in a different income year than the year the trust is treated as deriving it. The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW may give rise to such timing mismatches. Some types of income correspond to cash flows to the trust, but those receipts might be characterised differently under trust law and tax law. For example, the rules in ss CB 6 to CB 15 may treat amounts derived on the disposal of land as income, while a trust may characterise those amounts as being on capital account. While the focus of this Interpretation Statement is on deemed income that does not necessarily correspond to a cash flow, the same reasoning could also apply to these other kinds of income that create a mismatch between tax law income and trust law income. Analysis 16. The main issue in this Interpretation Statement is whether income that arises under tax law, but not under trust law, can be beneficiary income for tax purposes. The analysis in this Interpretation Statement considers this issue under the following main headings:  Tax law (including consideration of the definition of “beneficiary income” in s HC 6 and the meaning of the terms “vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary” and “paid”);  Trust law; and  Application of the law. 17. Some practical examples are then set out at the end of the Interpretation Statement to illustrate the tax treatment of deemed income when the tax law income of a trust exceeds the trust law income of the trust under general trust law principles. Tax law 18. To understand beneficiary income under tax law, it is useful to understand broadly how the trust rules in the Act apply. Under the Act, there are three types of trusts: complying trusts, foreign trusts, and non-complying trusts. This Interpretation Statement applies to the vesting or payment of income to beneficiaries by these three types of trusts. Trust income is dealt with in ss HC 5 to HC 7. Section HC 5 provides that an amount of income derived by a trustee of a trust is either trustee income or beneficiary income. Section HC 6 provides a definition of what is beneficiary income. (Section HC 6 is the key provision in determining whether deemed income can be beneficiary income and is discussed in detail below.) Section CV 13(a) provides that an amount derived by a person is income of the person if it is 5 beneficiary income to which s HC 6 applies. Section HC 7 provides that an amount of income derived by a trustee of a trust is trustee income to the extent to which it is not beneficiary income. Therefore, in a sense the default position is that income derived by trustees of a trust will be taxed to the trustees. 19. Section HC 5(2) provides that if a trustee is treated as having an amount of income in an income year under a provision in the Act and that amount is not derived under ordinary concepts, then the amount is treated as derived in the income year. 20. Complying trusts, foreign trusts and non-complying trusts can all vest or pay amounts to beneficiaries and, provided s HC 6 is satisfied, this will be beneficiary income for tax purposes. If a trust does vest or pay beneficiary income, then that income will be taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. For a complying trust, an amount vested in, or paid to, a beneficiary that is not beneficiary income will be exempt income to the beneficiary: s HC 20. This reflects the fact that the amount will already have been taxed as trustee income. If a non-complying or foreign trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary that is not beneficiary income under s HC 6, then that distribution may potentially be a taxable distribution (if it is not one of the other types of distributions listed in s HC 15(2) and s HC 15(4)). 21. The trustees are responsible for paying the tax on beneficiary income. Section HC 32(3) provides that, in the trustee’s capacity as agent, the trustee must satisfy the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and any taxable distributions derived by the beneficiary. What is “beneficiary income”? 22. The focus of this Interpretation Statement is on whether tax law income that does not have a trust law counterpart can be beneficiary income for tax purposes. Certain requirements must be satisfied for an amount to be beneficiary income. Section HC 6(1) defines “beneficiary income”: HC 6 Beneficiary income Meaning (1) An amount of income derived in an income year by a trustee of a trust is beneficiary income to the extent to which— (a) it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year; or (b) it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust in the income year or by the date after the end of the income year referred to in subsection (1B). 23. Section HC 6(1B) provides the date by which income must be allocated for the purposes of s HC 6(1)(b): Date by which income must be allocated (1B) The date referred to in subsection (1)(b) is the later of the following: (a) a date that falls within 6 months of the end of the income year; or (b) the earlier of— (i) the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year; or (ii) the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year under section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 24. Section HC 6(1) refers to an amount of “income” derived by a trustee. “Income” is defined in s YA 1 to mean income of the person under s BD 1(1). Section BD 1(1) provides that an amount is income of a person if it is their 6 income under a provision in Part C of the Act. The significance of this is that the concept of income derived by a trustee in s HC 6 is a reference to the tax law income of the trustee and not the trust law measure of income of a trustee. Importantly, such tax law income of the trustee is beneficiary income only “to the extent to which” it is vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary under s HC 6. As will be discussed below, the provisions of the trust deed bind a trustee as to what can be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. Therefore, beneficiary income is fundamentally determined according to trust law. 25. The definition of beneficiary income provides for two specific exclusions: (a) an amount of income derived by a trustee of a trust in an income year in which the trust is a superannuation fund; and (b) an amount of income derived by a trustee that is income to which ss CC 3(2) and EW 50 (which relate to income that arises on the forgiveness of a debt) apply. This suggests that all other income derived by a trustee can potentially be beneficiary income for tax purposes. In addition, income that arises on the forgiveness of a debt, which could be considered a type of deemed income, is specifically excluded. The implication from this is that it might otherwise be trustee income or beneficiary income. 26. Therefore, s HC 6 does not, on its face, preclude other types of income from giving rise to beneficiary income, including amounts of deemed income. Section HC 5(2) would seem to also support this. As noted above, s HC 5(2) provides that if a trustee is treated as having an amount of income in an income year under a provision in the Act and that amount is not derived under ordinary concepts, then the amount is treated as derived in the income year. This subsection is essentially a timing provision for the derivation of income arising under the Act, but it also suggests that amounts of income that are not derived under ordinary concepts can potentially be trustee income. This, coupled with the fact that there are only two specific exclusions in the definition of beneficiary income (one being a kind of deemed income), suggests that other types of deemed income can potentially be beneficiary income. 27. However, it is also necessary to determine whether an amount of income derived by a trustee has been vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. This is a central requirement of beneficiary income under s HC 6. The Commissioner considers that s HC 6 requires an examination of what has occurred within a trust to determine whether an amount of income derived by a trustee has actually been vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. This is because s HC 6 is based on concepts of trust law, including “trustee”, “beneficiary” and “vests absolutely in interest”. Whether deemed income may be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary under general principles of trust law is discussed further below. However, the meaning of “vests absolutely in interest” and “paid” in s HC 6(1) must be determined first. Section HC 6(1)(a): “vests absolutely in interest” 28. Section HC 6(1)(a) provides that an amount a trustee derives in an income year will be beneficiary income to the extent it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary. The gross income must not only “vest absolutely in interest in a beneficiary”, but the vesting must occur “in the income year”. 29. The phrase “vests absolutely in interest” is not defined in the Act. Vesting is a trust law concept. Therefore, trust law must be considered to determine the meaning of “vests absolutely in interest”. 7 30. The words “vest” and “vested in interest” are defined in Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2005): vest 1. To deliver to a person the full possession of land, and so to clothe him or her with the legal estate therein. 2. To become a vested interest. vested in interest A phrase used to indicate a present fixed right of future enjoyment, as reversions, vested remainders, and other future interests which do not depend on a period or event uncertain. For an interest to be vested in interest the persons who are to take it must be ascertained and there must be no condition precedent other than the determination of the prior interest. 31. The glossary in N Kelly, C Kelly and G Kelly, Garrow and Kelly Law of Trusts and Trustees (6th edition, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2005) also defines “vesting” and “vested in interest”: Vesting When a person becomes absolutely entitled to the eventual ownership of certain property or a defined part of a fund, that ownership right is said to be vested. ... Vested in interest A vested right to receive property at a future time. 32. Some guidance on the meaning of the term “vests absolutely in interest” can also be gained from considering cases on earlier trust provisions in the New Zealand tax legislation. The cases include Doody v Commissioner of Taxes \[1941\] NZLR 452 (SC), Commissioner of Taxes v Johnson and Maeder \[1946\] NZLR 446 (CA), Blathwayt v CIR (1973) 1 NZTC 61,112 (SC) and CIR v Simpson (1989) 11 NZTC 6,140 (CA). 33. These cases considered legislation where the relevant statutory test for an amount to be income of a beneficiary was that the beneficiary was “entitled in possession” to the income. The case law continues to be relevant because the test of “entitled in possession” was found to require that the income be vested absolutely in interest in the beneficiary and that the beneficiary be entitled to the receipt of the income. Accordingly, the discussion in those cases of what was required for something to be vested absolutely in interest (as a part of being “entitled in possession”) is still relevant to the interpretation of the words “vests absolutely in interest”. 34. It has been held in the context of New Zealand trust taxation legislation (in particular s 102(b) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923) that “vested” means indefeasibly vested in the sense of finally and absolutely vested and not merely defeasibly vested: Johnson and Maeder. The use of the word “absolutely” makes it even clearer that income must vest indefeasibly in a beneficiary to satisfy the vests absolutely in interest requirement. In addition, where income is future property or an expectancy the vesting will not be effective until the income is received or receivable: Garrow and Kelly Law of Trusts and Trustees, from 45-47; see also Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,155 (HC)). 35. In Doody, two infant beneficiaries were entitled to one third each of their father’s estate under the Administration Act 1908. During the income years in question, the administrators applied some of the infant beneficiaries’ entitlement for their maintenance and education. In relation to the beneficiaries’ entitlements that had not been applied for their benefit, the court accepted that the shares of the infant beneficiaries in the estate were indefeasibly vested. However, being infants, the beneficiaries could not demand receipt of their entitlements. Smith J said, at 457, that for a beneficiary to be “entitled in possession” they must be a person who has not only a right to the income that is absolutely vested but also be entitled to the actual receipt of that income under the terms of the trust during the income year in question. 8 36. The Court of Appeal in Simpson came to the same conclusion. In that case the Commissioner attempted to tax the taxpayer and his wife as discretionary beneficiaries under a trust. The trustees had resolved to appropriate income for a particular income year to the taxpayer’s two infant children. The money was paid into the joint account of the taxpayer and his wife. Richardson J found that the money was paid to the taxpayer and his wife in a fiduciary capacity for the children and not in their own right as beneficiaries under the trust. The court accepted that the resolution of the trustees was validly passed and legally effective to confer on the infants an absolute and indefeasibly vested interest in the income for the year. That decided the issue in the case, but Richardson J went on to approve the earlier New Zealand authorities and expressed doubt that infant beneficiaries could be entitled in possession (which was the legislative requirement for income to be beneficiary income). Somers J also endorsed the earlier decisions of Doody and Blathwayt, while Wylie J expressed no view on this. The implication is that the income should instead have been taxed as trustee income because, although the income was vested absolutely, the infant beneficiaries were not entitled in possession. 37. In Davidson and Duke v CIR (1976) 2 NZTC 61,121 the court considered different ways in which a trustee could vest amounts in (or pay or apply amounts to) a beneficiary. In that case, the trustees signed a memorandum recording their decision that “income from the trust be allocated” to certain beneficiaries on the basis of a two-thirds share going to one of the children and a one-third share to the other. The court found that such an “allocation” was sufficient to vest the amounts in the beneficiaries. 38. The relevant legislation at the time referred to both “vest” and “pay or apply”. Somers J did not differentiate between “vest” and “pay or apply” but concluded that trustee resolutions would be sufficient to “vest” or “pay or apply” income to beneficiaries if they used wording that:  “allocated” amounts to beneficiaries;  provided an amount “shall belong to” beneficiaries; or  stated income “shall be disposed of ... to be held for the credit of” beneficiaries. 39. In 1988, the legislation was changed. The test had been whether the beneficiary was “entitled in possession” to the income. This test was changed to the current test of “vests absolutely in interest”. This was understood to be a widening of the test for “beneficiary income”. 40. Therefore, “vests absolutely in interest” means a present fixed right of future enjoyment. This means that the beneficiary need not receive the amount vested at the time of vesting absolutely in interest, but they must have an indefeasible right to that part of the trust fund. For an amount of deemed income to be vested absolutely in interest in a beneficiary, the amount must be dealt with by a provision of the trust deed, the actions of the trustee, or both. Vesting absolutely in interest may occur because the trust deed specifies that income will be dealt with in a certain way. Alternatively, the trust deed may facilitate the vesting but not provide for it, so it will be vested only if the trustees take some action to vest it. This illustrates an important point: “deemed income” will not always give rise to beneficiary income. A provision of the trust deed, the actions of the trustees, or both, must grant a fixed right of future enjoyment to an amount of deemed income for the deemed income to give rise to beneficiary income under s HC 6(1)(a). Where the deemed income is not beneficiary income for tax purposes, it is trustee income. 9 41. Based on the cases discussed above, the mechanisms by which an amount can vest absolutely in interest in a beneficiary include:  a provision of the trust deed that vests the income in the beneficiaries;  a resolution of the trustees vesting the income in the beneficiaries;  a payment to, or crediting to an account of, the beneficiaries in the income year (or, as in Simpson, even a payment into the beneficiaries’ parents’ bank account). Section HC 6(1)(b): “paid to a beneficiary” 42. This part of the analysis considers the meaning of “paid” in s HC 6(1)(b). Section HC 6(1)(b) provides that an amount a trustee derives in an income year will be beneficiary income to the extent it is “paid” to a beneficiary. The word “paid” is not defined in the Act. However, the word “pay” is defined in s YA 1 and provides (as relevant): pay,— (a) for an amount and a person, includes— (i) to distribute the amount to them: (ii) to credit them for the amount: (iii) to deal with the amount in their interest or on their behalf, in some other way: 43. Section 32 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes it clear that all parts of speech and grammatical forms of a word are to have the same meaning throughout the Income Tax Act, unless the context takes a different meaning (see also Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 2 (March 2008), which provides commentary on the rewrite of parts M to Z of the Income Tax Act 2007). Therefore, the definition of “pay” in s YA 1 is relevant in determining the meaning of “paid” in s HC 6(1)(b). 44. Before the Income Tax Act 2007, the definition of “beneficiary income” was different to the current definition in s HC 6. In particular, the definition of “beneficiary income” in s OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 included an amount derived by a trustee to the extent to which the trustee “pays or applies it to or for the benefit of the beneficiary”. 45. The new definition of “beneficiary income” removed two parts of the old definition relating to the word “applies”:  the reference to the trustee applying income “to” a beneficiary;  the reference to the trustee applying income “for the benefit of” the beneficiary. Section HC 6(1)(b) now applies to an amount to the extent to which “it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust in the income year or by the date after the end of the income year referred to in subsection (1B)”. 46. The definition of “pay” in s YA 1 is noted in schedule 51 of the Act (“Identified changes in legislation”), but the annotation is as follows: The provision is simplified and structured so it is to apply generally for the Act. This is consistent with the objectives of plain accessible legislation and is thought highly unlikely to result in any material change in law. However, as this change in drafting could conceivably result in a change in outcome in some circumstances, the change should be identified for readers. Schedule 51 makes no reference to s HC 6. It would seem this change was intended to simplify the definition of “beneficiary income” by relying on the 10 definition of “pay” in s YA 1, rather than being a change to the definition of “beneficiary income”. 47. The definition of “beneficiary income” in s HC 6 no longer refers to a trustee applying income to or for a beneficiary. In addition, the new definition of “pay” does not use the word “apply”. The new definition now includes, in subparas (ii) and (iii), crediting a person for an amount, or dealing with an amount in a person’s interest or on their behalf. The question that arises is whether the definition of “pay” is wide enough to encompass concepts previously covered by the word “apply”. It is therefore helpful to look at case law on “apply” to determine whether that concept is covered by the new definition of “pay” in s YA 1. 48. The leading New Zealand decision on “paid or applied” is CIR v Ward \[1970\] NZLR 1 (CA). This was a majority decision of the Court of Appeal with North P and McCarthy J in the majority, and Turner J dissenting. The facts of the case involved a trust deed under which property was held on trust for four children. The children were entitled to the trust property (including capital and income) when they reached the age of 21. For the year ended 31 March 1963, the trustee made a declaration that she held the trust income in stated amounts for each of the four infant beneficiaries. The declaration was made before the end of the income year, but no entries were made in the trust accounts until after the end of the income year. The Commissioner assessed the trustee with income tax on the whole of the income of the trust, on the basis that the declaration was inadequate to transfer the income to the beneficiaries. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the income had been applied to the beneficiaries. 49. The majority concluded that once the trustee had made the declaration for the children, who until then merely had a contingent interest, the children became absolutely entitled to the sums allotted to them. The trustee’s declaration was an application of income. The majority also considered that when the trustee made her declaration it was a matter for her to determine what income was presently available. There was nothing before the court to justify the conclusion that the income was not presently available. The declaration by the trustee amounted to an application. 50. The decision in Ward establishes that a trustee will be able to apply a presently available amount to a beneficiary simply by way of a declaration. The effect of Ward is that it is not necessary for that declaration to be reflected in the books of the trust in the relevant period, nor is an actual payment of the amount to the beneficiary or beneficiaries required at the time of the application. 51. Subparagraph (i) of the definition of “pay” refers to the ordinary meaning of “pay”: namely, to distribute (cash or other consideration) or to otherwise transfer funds to a person. However, subparas (ii) and (iii) of the definition appear to cover other situations that were previously covered by the word “applies”. Subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) apply to crediting the beneficiary for the amount, and dealing with the amount in their interest or on their behalf in some other way. The situation in Ward, where a declaration by a trustee amounted to an application, would fall within subparas (ii) or (iii). 52. In addition, a recent case supports the view that the expanded definition of “pay” is broad enough to cover the concepts previously covered by the word “applies”. The case is the High Court decision of Clifford J in CIR v Albany Food Warehouse (2009) 24 NZTC 23,532. The case concerned the timing of a dividend payment. Section ME 5(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provided there would be a debit to the company’s imputation credit account 11 for imputation credits attached to a dividend “paid” by the company. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 defined “paid” for the imputation rules to include any amount distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interest of, or on behalf of, a person. On 6 June 2001, the directors of the company declared a fully imputed dividend. The dividend was resolved by the directors to be credited to the relevant shareholders’ current accounts, with payment from those accounts conditional on the shareholders agreeing to subordinate their claims to the company’s creditors generally and only to be made “as and when finance permits”. The shareholders agreed to those terms that day. Later that day, there was a change in shareholding in the company. This change breached shareholder continuity. 53. If the dividend was paid before the breach of continuity, the company would be able to attach those credits to the dividend payment. However, if the dividend was not paid before the breach, the credits would be forfeited and any eventual dividend would potentially have no credits available to be attached. Clifford J concluded (at \[27\] and \[28\]): \[27\] I have little difficulty in concluding that the directors’ resolution provided for the “crediting” of the dividend to the shareholders’ current accounts within the meaning of the word “credited” as it appears in s OB 1 in para (g) of the extended definition of “paid”. \[28\] In my judgment, and as a matter of general company law, the effect of the directors’ resolution, albeit together with the shareholders’ resolution agreeing to the subordination terms, was that funds that were previously available to the directors, in their discretion to apply for the purposes of the respondent’s business generally, were placed outside the directors’ control and became debts due and owing to the shareholders and able to be sued for as such if not paid on their terms, and proved for in liquidation. This substantive change is reflected in the accounting treatment, whereby amounts that had previously stood to the credit of the shareholders’ funds of the respondent, were re- categorised by the dividend resolution and became credits in the shareholders’ current accounts. As the respondent in my view correctly submitted, the declaration and subsequent crediting of the dividend amount to the shareholders’ current accounts therefore constitute a “crediting”. 54. The similarities between the resolution in Albany Food Warehouse and the declaration in Ward suggest that the use of the term “applies” and the extended definition of “paid” (or “pay” in the current legislation) lead to a similar result. As such, the removal of the word “applies” from the definition of “beneficiary income” and its absence from the definition of “pay” do not alter the scope of what is “beneficiary income” under the 2007 Act. 55. Given the decision in Albany Food Warehouse, and that schedule 51 suggests there has been no material change in the law, the Commissioner considers that the revisions to s HC 6 and the definition of “beneficiary income”, and the reliance on the meaning of “pay” in s YA 1, are not intended to change what is “beneficiary income”. Therefore, the previous law and commentary on the meaning of “beneficiary income” (including the case law on the meaning of “applies”) are still relevant. Effect of the deeming provisions 56. Whether there are any limits on the effect of a provision that deems an amount of income to arise must also be considered. In particular, whether the deeming of income is limited so that it can be taxed only as trustee income, or whether the effect is broader so that deemed income could potentially be beneficiary income. 57. In F A R Bennion, Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (5th ed, LexisNexis, London, 2008) at 950 the author states that “\[t\]he intention of a deeming 12 provision, in laying down a hypothesis, is that the hypothesis shall be carried as far as necessary to achieve the legislative purpose, but no further”. At 1,004 the author notes that “\[w\]henever an Act sets up some fiction the courts are astute to limit the scope of its artificial effect. They are particularly concerned to ensure that it does not create harm in ways outside the intended purview of the Act”. Both of these comments make it clear that deeming provisions in an Act need to be given effect to, but should not be construed any more widely than absolutely necessary. In a tax context this will often mean that a deeming provision will only have effect within the tax legislation and will not have wider consequences for other areas of law (such as company law or trust law). 58. This Interpretation Statement is concerned with whether deemed income can be beneficiary income. As deemed income can be income of a trustee as a taxpayer, the Commissioner considers that this deeming must take effect at least for a trustee in all relevant contexts in the Act. A trustee cannot argue that the deeming does not apply for all of the trustee’s various responsibilities under the Act. The question then is whether, in a deemed income context, there is any indication in the Act that the portion of a trustee’s income that relates to deemed income should not be able to be beneficiary income. There does not appear to be any obvious indications of this. There are no clear policy indications or principles that would lead to such a rule. Indeed, as already noted, arguably s HC 5(2) suggests otherwise. 59. Therefore, under the Act, the position is that deemed income can potentially be beneficiary income provided it is vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. However, the income deemed to arise under the Act does not exist in trust law. This is because the deeming provisions only operate within the context of tax law. Summary of New Zealand tax law 60. The discussion of New Zealand tax law above establishes that for income derived by a trustee to be beneficiary income either it must be vested absolutely in interest in the beneficiary within the income year it was derived, or it must be “paid” (in the broad sense of that term) to the beneficiary in the income year or within the time limits in s HC 6(1B). 61. The notion of vesting absolutely in interest in s HC 6(1)(a) is that the amount derived is indefeasibly vested in the beneficiary. The beneficiary obtains an immediate right of future possession of the income. The income must not be future property or an expectancy. An amount of income is “paid” under s HC 6(1)(b) if it is actually paid, distributed, credited or dealt with in the beneficiary’s interest. The Ward case establishes that a declaration of trust allocating income to a beneficiary is sufficient. Based on the decision in Davidson and Duke, an application of income can occur even if a specific sum is not allocated to a beneficiary, as long as there is some mechanism to apply the income. 62. In practice, there may be some overlap between the concept of “vest absolutely in interest” at common law and the definition of “pay” in s YA 1, particularly since neither concept necessarily requires an immediate payment of an amount in order to be effective. 63. Section HC 6(1) does not make a distinction between different types of income derived by a trustee (except for the two exclusions in s HC 6(2)). Therefore, nothing under the Act appears to prevent deemed income from giving rise to beneficiary income for tax purposes. However, s HC 6 requires 13 an examination of what has happened in the trust. This is because s HC 6 requires income to vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, a beneficiary before it can be beneficiary income. A trustee is bound by the terms of the trust deed and general trust law as to how they may deal with the trust fund. For an amount from the trust fund to vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, a beneficiary, the trust deed must provide for such vesting or payment, or the trustee must have a power to do so under the trust deed. This is discussed further below. 64. Finally, income deemed to arise under the Act does not exist in trust law. This is because the deeming provisions operate only within the context of tax law. Whether deemed income can vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, a beneficiary, as a matter of trust law, will now be discussed. Trust law 65. Trust law must be considered to understand when amounts derived by a trustee may be beneficiary income. This is because trustees are bound to adhere to the terms of the trust deed when they make distributions from the trust fund to beneficiaries. This applies to amounts vested absolutely in interest in or paid to beneficiaries under s HC 6, whether deemed income or not. 66. One of the leading New Zealand texts on trust law is Garrow and Kelly Law of Trusts and Trustees. This text explains the nature of a trust as follows (at 3): 1.1.1 A trust is an equitable obligation under which a person (the “trustee”) having control of property is bound to deal with that property either: (a) For the benefit of definite persons (of whom that trustee may be one) and any one of whom may enforce the obligation; or (b) For some object or purpose permitted by law. 67. Amounts that are deemed income exist only for tax law purposes and do not result in an actual cash flow or an accretion to the trust in the relevant income year, if at all. This is because the deeming provisions in the Act only operate within tax law. The deeming provisions in the Act do not cause the deemed income to exist for trust law purposes. Therefore, such an amount could not itself be distributed to a beneficiary as a matter of trust law. 68. The trust law distinction between capital and income is particularly relevant in determining whether deemed income can be beneficiary income. Traditionally, the need to classify capital and income under trust law is one of the fundamental fiduciary duties of a trustee and this continues to be the case for many modern trusts. There are legal impediments to the trustees treating the amounts differently to accord with a tax treatment. 69. Chapter 22 of Law of Trusts and Trustees is entitled “Capital and Income” and refers to the distinction between these two concepts. This distinction is important where a trust has both capital and income beneficiaries. An example is a conventional life estate with a remainder interest – when assets are held on trust to pay the income to “A while A is alive and after A has died to transfer the assets to B”. 70. The authors state that the basic duty of a trustee (which is a fiduciary duty) is to ensure that each beneficiary receives everything he or she is entitled to (at 22.1.3). As a result, trustees need to identify carefully what is to be treated as capital and income and ensure the appropriate beneficiaries receive such amounts. The authors observe that the distinction between capital and income is relevant only to the extent the trust deed requires this. 14 Ultimately it is the trust deed that indicates what each beneficiary is entitled to receive. The trust deed may define what is to be treated as capital and what is income. In the absence of any such indication in the trust deed the courts must apply the long-established trust law principles distinguishing capital and income. 71. At 22.1.4 and 22.1.5, the authors comment that capital and income mean different things for income tax, accounting and trust law. At 22.1.6 they state that for trust law purposes trustees cannot simply rely on tax law, generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards. 72. The authors say a trust may provide that a life interest beneficiary is entitled to the income of the trust, and the capital reverts to the remainder interest in the estate or the trust. Therefore, only income as determined by trust law can be distributed to an income beneficiary. Any amount greater than this received by the trust must be treated as a capital sum attributable to the capital beneficiary. 73. At 22.2 the authors discuss two cases that demonstrate the importance of distinguishing correctly between capital and income: Wong v Burt \[2005\] 1 NZLR 91 (CA) and Wendt v Orr \[2004\] 6 ITELR 989; \[2004\] WASC 28. In Wong, over $300,000 was wrongly paid to the income beneficiary in 1989 and the capital beneficiary plaintiffs were able to recover that sum 14 years later. 74. Not all trusts provide separately for capital and income beneficiaries. At 22.1.6 the authors state that life interest provisions in wills are less common than they were in the past. Where funds do need to be held on trust for a beneficiary, trustees often have the power to apply capital and income as required. The authors state: Similarly most modern family trusts are more flexible discretionary trusts with income and capital payable at the trustees’ discretion. Such provisions avoid the sometimes artificial (and difficult) distinction between income and capital. 75. The important point to understand is that under trust law, trustees must act within the powers given to them by the trust deed. Trustees acting under their fiduciary duties must carefully consider any distinctions required under the trust deed to avoid legal consequences. If, as in Wong, the trustees must distinguish between capital and income, trustees must be careful when making distributions. Some other relevant trustee duties include the duties to:  adhere to the terms of the trust;  act fairly by all the beneficiaries (also called the duty of impartiality or even-handedness); and  keep proper accounts of the trust. 76. It is not possible to cover all the different types of trust deeds in this Interpretation Statement. Instead, it is essential that trustees are familiar with their trust deeds. Trustees should also, if uncertain, seek legal advice on whether, in a particular income year, their particular trust deed allows them to vest absolutely in interest or pay amounts from the trust fund equating to deemed income. Application of the law 77. It is helpful to summarise the above discussion of tax and trust law. As discussed above, the definition of “beneficiary income” in s HC 6 refers to an 15 amount of income derived in an income year by a trustee. The word “income” is a defined term in the Act. Therefore, the income of the trustee referred to in s HC 6(1) is a tax law measure of income, and not the trust law measure of income. However, while the income of a trustee may be measured on a tax law basis, such income is only beneficiary income to the extent to which it:  vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary; or  is paid to a beneficiary in the income year or within the time limits specified in s HC 6(1B). 78. Section HC 6 works on the premise that the trustee has derived the income, so it must be the trustee who is paying that income to the beneficiary. Accordingly, although the tax measure of income may exceed the trust measure, no statutory mechanism exists in s HC 6 to make the tax law measure the relevant measure when it comes to beneficiary income. That is, when the tax law income of a trust is greater than its income according to trust law, the excess tax law income does not automatically become beneficiary income. 79. Under s HC 6(1)(a), an amount will vest absolutely in interest in a beneficiary where the beneficiary obtains an immediate right of present or future possession of the income. This means the beneficiary need not receive the amount vested absolutely in interest at the time of vesting, but they must have an indefeasible right to that part of the trust property. In a trust relationship, this can happen only where a provision of the trust deed, the actions of the trustee, or a combination of both, provides for such income to be vested absolutely in interest in a beneficiary. This requires a focus on what is possible under the trust deed. If the trustees attempt to act outside the trust deed they risk breaching their fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. 80. Beneficiary income includes not only amounts that are vested absolutely in interest but also amounts that are paid (s HC 6(1)(b)). As seen, the word “paid” includes distributing an amount to a beneficiary, to credit a beneficiary for an amount, and to deal with the amount in a beneficiary’s interest or on their behalf in some other way. Implicit in the definition is that it is the action of the trustee that gives rise to something being paid, because the trustee is the person who has the authority to undertake such actions. As with vesting absolutely in interest, this requires a focus on what is possible under the trust deed. If the trustees attempt to act outside the trust deed they risk breaching their fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. 81. For an amount of income derived by a trustee to be beneficiary income, the amount must actually vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, the beneficiary. A trustee is bound by the terms of the trust deed in relation to the vesting or payment of amounts from the trust fund. Therefore, any vesting absolutely in interest or payment of an amount of trustee income must be effective for trust law for it to be beneficiary income. This is true for all types of income derived by a trustee, not just deemed income. 82. However, as noted above in the discussion of trust law, amounts that are deemed income amounts exist only for tax law purposes and do not result in an actual cash flow or an accretion to the trust because the deeming provisions in the Act only operate within tax law. The deeming provisions in the Act do not make the deemed income exist for trust law purposes. Therefore, deemed income could not itself be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary as a matter of trust law. 16 83. In addition, the two limbs of s HC 6 require something to have happened within the trust. That is, the trustee must actually vest absolutely in interest in, or pay something to, a beneficiary. The Commissioner considers a trustee cannot vest absolutely in interest, or pay, notional amounts. However, the Commissioner will recognise deemed income as beneficiary income for tax purposes if an equivalent actual amount of the trust fund is vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. When trust law income is the same or exceeds tax law income 84. When the trust law income of a trust is the same as, or exceeds, the tax law income of a trust in an income year, the Commissioner considers that amounts of deemed income will be able to vest absolutely in interest in, or be paid to, beneficiaries as a matter of trust law. In this situation, sufficient trust income will exist to support the vesting or payment of the tax law income, including the deemed income. Provided sufficient amounts of trust income are actually vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, beneficiaries in a way that is effective for trust law, the deemed income will satisfy s HC 6 and will be taxed as beneficiary income. 85. The Commissioner considers that the trustees will generally not need to resolve that the actual amount of trust income is a vesting or payment of deemed income for tax purposes (compare the situation discussed below where tax law income exceeds trust law income). However, depending on the terms of the trust deed, to make the vesting or payment effective for trust law, trustees might still need to make a resolution exercising their discretion to actually vest absolutely in interest or pay the trust income. When tax law income exceeds trust law income 86. When the tax law income of a trust is greater than its trust law income under trust law the excess tax law income cannot simply be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, beneficiaries unless the trust deed expressly provides a way for this to happen. This is because the trustee is limited to the amounts in the trust fund available to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, beneficiaries. For deemed income to be beneficiary income under s HC 6, the vesting absolutely in interest in, or payment to, the beneficiary must be effective for trust law. 87. If the trust deed makes a clear distinction between capital and income beneficiaries, or defines the meaning of income by applying traditional trust law concepts, legal impediments will exist to prevent the trustee making payments to a beneficiary to match the amount of deemed income arising under tax law. First, the trustee will be bound by the terms of the trust deed as to what it can vest absolutely in interest in, or pay, to beneficiaries. Trustees may have no discretion as to what each beneficiary is entitled to. Secondly, if the tax law income of the trust exceeds the trust law income, the trustees will be unable to vest or pay an amount from the trust fund equating to the excess tax law income amount. A beneficiary entitled to a fixed amount will not be able to receive any more than their entitlement. Similarly, beneficiaries entitled to a proportion of trust income will only be entitled to receive a share of the trust income as determined under trust law. In such situations, the excess tax law income must be taxed as trustee income. More flexible trust deeds 88. Some of these legal impediments may be overcome by different formulations of the trust deed. If, under the trust deed, trustees are able to distribute amounts that are more than the trust law definition of income, the trustees 17 may be able to vest absolutely in interest or to pay amounts available in the trust fund equating to deemed income. For instance, some discretionary trusts allow the trustees to distribute capital and income to beneficiaries as they see fit. Also, some trust deeds give trustees the discretion to distribute capital to income beneficiaries. In these situations, the distinction between capital and income becomes less important and amounts of capital could be used to vest absolutely in interest or to pay deemed income to income beneficiaries. It is, therefore, the terms of the trust deed, or the actions of the trustees (or both), that allows the deemed income to become beneficiary income for tax purposes. 89. If “income” is defined in the trust deed to mean income calculated for income tax purposes, the trustees may vest absolutely in interest or pay amounts that equate to the deemed income to the beneficiaries. In this situation, the tax law income and trust law income of the trust are the same. Similarly, if trustees have discretion as to how they characterise receipts (that is, whether as capital or income), they will be able to vest absolutely in interest in, or pay a greater sum to, income beneficiaries than the conventional trust law definition of income. Where the trust is a flexible trust with all beneficiaries able to receive capital and income, there will similarly be a greater flexibility to vest absolutely in interest or to pay sums greater than the conventional trust law definition of income. To do this, however, the trust must have an actual (non-deemed) amount that can be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. This is because the deemed income does not exist outside tax law. The deemed income does not represent anything that can be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary. 90. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers deemed income will be beneficiary income only to the extent to which it is reflected by an actual amount vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary by the trustee or under the terms of the trust. This means that, at the time the deemed income is purported to be vested or paid, the trust must have sufficient amounts in the trust fund available to be distributed to the beneficiary. This is because the trustees only have the power to deal with the trust fund. This reiterates the point made earlier that the trustee simply deriving deemed income is not sufficient for it to be treated as beneficiary income for tax purposes. If trust law is to be complied with, there must be a provision of the trust deed, or the actions of the trustees, or both, to allow the deemed income to be vested absolutely in, or paid to, the beneficiary. If the trust deed does not allow for deemed income to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, the beneficiaries, or the trustees do not act in such a way as to vest or pay it, then the deemed income will remain as trustee income and be taxed accordingly. There is no automatic process outside of the trust deed, or the trustees’ actions, for deemed income to become beneficiary income. 91. Tax law deems an amount of income to exist, and the Act should be read in a way that is consistent with the deemed existence of the income. Therefore, when an actual amount is vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary by the trustee equal to the amount of “deemed income” (in accordance with an explicit power in the trust deed or the actions of the trustees, or both) the requirements of s HC 6 are met and the amount will be beneficiary income. The “deemed income” is not, of itself, “beneficiary income”; rather, the terms of the trust deed may enable an actual amount that reflects the “deemed income” to be vested in, or paid to, a beneficiary. In this way, the deemed income amount can then be treated as beneficiary income. 18 Explicit link between actual amount and deemed income required 92. The Commissioner considers that where the trustees exercise their power under the trust deed to vest or pay an actual amount to a beneficiary reflecting the amount of deemed income, then the deemed income will be taxable as beneficiary income. For an amount to “reflect” the amount of deemed income, there must be an explicit link between the amount of deemed income for tax purposes and the amount vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, the beneficiary. Importantly, the trustees’ resolution (or the trust deed) must clearly specify that the actual amount being vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary is a payment of an income amount for tax purposes. For example, the trustees may resolve that the trustees are paying the sums to the beneficiaries because the amount of tax income exceeds the amount of trust income. 93. If there is no such link, then the payment may be a payment of capital or corpus (ie, the character of the actual amount) instead of a payment of the deemed income for tax purposes. Such a payment may not always be beneficiary income because the Act does anticipate payments of capital and corpus to beneficiaries. For example, if the amount that is vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary is trust capital, then this will not have the effect of giving rise to beneficiary income. The vesting absolutely in interest or payment will not automatically be treated as the vesting absolutely in interest or payment of income. 94. The Commissioner considers the definition of “beneficiary income” is broad enough to include this use of an actual amount to vest or pay the deemed income amount. This is for two reasons:  There is “an amount of income derived in an income year by a trustee of a trust” for tax purposes, as “income” is a defined term measured using tax law concepts (and it includes the “deemed income”).  Such an amount will be beneficiary income “to the extent to which” it is vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, the beneficiary of the trust in the required timeframe. This requirement is met because the amount of tax law income is, factually, vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary of the trust within the required timeframe by the trustees. Source of the actual amount vested in, or paid to, a beneficiary 95. Therefore, in some situations, trustees may vest absolutely in interest in, or pay to, beneficiaries an amount that represents deemed income. The absence of an actual cash flow for the deemed income could mean that the trustees would have to take funds out of previously taxed income reserves or even trust capital to make the payment. It might be thought that payments from previously taxed income reserves or trust capital should not be taxable as beneficiary income, but should be treated as a payment of corpus or some other type of distribution (depending on the type of trust). However, the Commissioner considers this is not a concern for two reasons. 96. Firstly, the concept of “paid” is not solely about distributions of cash, but includes crediting in account, applying or otherwise dealing with, and can be as simple as a trustees’ resolution that the amounts be held in the name of the beneficiaries. The concept of “vesting absolutely in interest” is similarly unconstrained. In saying that of course, as already discussed, a trustee can “vest absolutely” or “pay” only existing property. Also, there must still be a reality to any payment or vesting. Trustees can deal only with the trust 19 fund, and any vesting or payment from the trust fund must be effective for trust law. 97. Secondly, any concern about the actual source of funds being previously taxed income confuses the source of the funds used to make any payment with the actual classification of the deemed income for tax purposes for that particular income year. That is, the key focus ought to be on the amount of income derived in the income year (ie, the deemed income). The trust property that is used to vest or pay the equivalent amount (should vesting or payment occur) is not critical. 98. Further, as a practical matter, some trustees may not necessarily keep track of the actual identity of funds used to allocate amounts to beneficiaries. Sometimes this is because trustees are not actually making a payment of cash (they are just crediting or applying it). Sometimes this is because of the way the trustees treat funds, taking into account the fungibility of money. That is, once the amounts are in a trust bank account they do not require any particular classification under the trust rules. (However, this latter point does not mean that the trust does not keep records of the amounts it earns and how they are distributed, it is just that the actual cash that the trust holds might not be tracked in this way.) Summary 99. In summary, for an amount of income derived by a trustee to be beneficiary income under s HC 6, the vesting or payment of that amount must be effective for trust law. This also applies to amounts of deemed income. Deemed income does not exist outside tax law and does not, in itself, represent anything that a trustee could vest absolutely in interest in, or pay to, a beneficiary. 100. However, the Commissioner considers the definition of “beneficiary income” in s HC 6 of the Act is broad enough to encompass the situation where an actual amount is used to vest absolutely in interest or pay the deemed income. This will not pose any problems where the trust income under trust law concepts of capital and income is greater than or equal to the tax law income of the trust, provided that actual amounts equating to the deemed income are vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, beneficiaries in that income year. 101. However, where the tax law income of the trust is greater than the trust income under trust law concepts of income and capital, there may be limits on the trustee’s ability to vest or pay actual amounts equating to the deemed income. If it is not possible under the trust deed for an actual amount equating to the deemed income to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary, or the trustees do not vest or pay it (in accordance with their powers under the trust deed), then the deemed income will remain as trustee income and be taxed accordingly. There is no automatic process outside of the trust deed or the trustee’s actions for deemed income to become beneficiary income. Even though “paid” and “vests absolutely in interest” are wide concepts, there must still be a reality to any vesting or payment. Trustees can deal only with the trust fund and any vesting or payment of amounts of the trust fund must be effective for trust law. Alternative views 102. The Commissioner acknowledges there are alternative views on some aspects of this Interpretation Statement. One view is that deemed income can be beneficiary income by simply making an adjustment in the tax return 20 of the trust. The basis for this view is that deemed income only exists for tax law purposes. Accordingly, the deemed income can be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, beneficiaries as beneficiary income purely for tax law purposes. The Commissioner considers this is incorrect because s HC 6 requires that something must have actually happened in the trust. This is evident from the requirement in s HC 6 that an amount of income derived by a trustee must be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary within certain time limits in order to be beneficiary income for tax purposes. 103. Another view is that deemed income can, of itself, be vested absolutely in or paid to a beneficiary. There is no need under trust law for an actual amount to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary in order to vest or pay deemed income. In addition, it has been suggested that this is even more true for automatic vesting provisions in trust deeds. The Commissioner disagrees with this view. This is because a trustee is bound by trust law (including the terms of the trust deed) and can only vest or pay amounts from the trust fund to beneficiaries in accordance with the trust deed. The provisions in the Act that deem income to arise only operate for the purposes of tax law. The deemed income does not exist for trust law purposes and notional amounts cannot be vested or paid. An actual amount must be vested or paid that reflects the deemed income amount. This is also the case for automatic vesting situations. If this is done effectively under the trust deed, the Commissioner will recognise this as effective for tax purposes and tax the deemed income amount as beneficiary income. Examples 104. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. The examples deal with situations where, in an income year, the tax law income of a trust exceeds its income according to trust law concepts of capital and income. The examples address the tax implications of deemed income derived by trustees of the following three types of trust, where:  the trust deed determines the income of the trust according to trust law concepts of capital and income;  the trust deed defines trust law income as meaning income calculated for income tax;  the trust deed determines income using trust law concepts of capital and income, but the trustees have the power to distribute trust capital to income beneficiaries. 105. In each example, the trust provides for a mix of entitlements – Fred is entitled to the first $50 of income, Mary is entitled to the next $60 of income and George and Alice are entitled to 50% each of the balance of the income of the trust. In each example, the trust earns $100 of traditional trust law income and $150 of tax law income. For these examples, it is assumed that the amounts are paid within the time limits imposed by s HC 6(1B). 106. The examples show that where the trust deed does not allow the trustees to vest or pay an amount equating to deemed income, or the trustees decide not to vest or pay an amount equating to the deemed income, the deemed income is taxed as trustee income. The beneficiaries may not receive any more than their entitlements under trust law and as represented by amounts available in the trust fund. Example 1 – Trust deed does not define income 107. Fred is entitled to the first $50 of income, Mary is entitled to the next $60 of income and George and Alice are entitled to 50% each of the balance of the 21 income of the trust. In this situation, the trust deed does not define “income”. Therefore it is necessary to determine the income of the trust according to trust law concepts of capital and income. 108. In the 2011/2012 income year, the trust derived $100 of trust law income. However, the trustees derived $150 of income as calculated under the Act ($50 of which is deemed income), and must return this amount in the income tax return of the trust. In this situation the trust law income of the trust is $100 and the tax law income of the trust is $150. 109. The excess tax law income ($50) does not represent trust income according to ordinary concepts. For trust law purposes, it cannot be included in the income of the trust that may be distributed to the beneficiaries. Therefore, in this situation, Fred would receive $50, Mary would receive $50, and George and Alice would not receive any income. This is because the income of the trust for trust law purposes is only $100. 110. In the case of s HC 6(1)(a) (“vested absolutely in interest in a beneficiary”) the same treatment would apply for tax purposes as applies for trust purposes. There is nothing in the Act to provide that the beneficiaries are entitled to anything more than what they are entitled to under trust law. They do not have an immediate fixed right to the income deemed to arise under the Act. As beneficiaries, their rights arise in trust law and not in tax law. For a beneficiary, any immediate fixed right sufficient to amount to vesting absolutely in interest can be established only under the trust deed and/or the relevant trustees’ resolutions. 111. Similarly, in terms of s HC 6(1)(b) (“paid to a beneficiary”) there is nothing to increase the amounts that the beneficiaries receive by payment from the trustee. Again, the tax law follows from trust law. If a beneficiary is entitled to income only on a trust law basis, there is nothing in s HC 6 to increase that amount. 112. The trustees are bound by the trust deed as to what they can vest absolutely in interest in, or pay to, the beneficiaries. The extra $50 of tax law income cannot be vested or paid to the beneficiaries under the trust deed because the trustee is limited to the trust law concepts of capital and income. 113. In this situation, $100 of the tax law income is taxed as beneficiary income, reflecting the $50 each paid to Fred and Mary. The extra $50 of tax law income must be taxed as trustee income. Example 2 – Trust deed defines trust law income as income calculated for income tax purposes 114. In this situation, the trust deed defines income as income calculated under the Income Tax Act 2007. Therefore, the amount of income under the trust deed will be the same as that calculated under the Act. 115. In the 2011/2012 income year, the tax law income of the trust is $150. Therefore, in accordance with the trust deed, the trust law income of the trust is also $150. However, the trustee only received $100 in cash because $50 of the tax law income was deemed income. As a result, there is a difference between the actual amounts received by the trustee and the income derived under the Act. 116. As stated above, Fred is entitled to the first $50 of income, Mary is entitled to the next $60 of income and George and Alice are entitled to 50% each of the balance of the income of the trust. However, the trustee cannot vest or pay a notional amount. The trust has only received an actual amount of $100. If the trustees took no further steps, Fred and Mary would each 22 derive beneficiary income of $50. George and Alice would not derive any beneficiary income. This is because the trust has only $100 of income available to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, the beneficiaries. 117. However, the trust deed adopts the tax law measure of income which increases the amount that may be distributed to beneficiaries as income. This means the trustees could resolve that, for tax purposes, other amounts from the trust fund (that are available to be distributed to Mary, George and Alice) are to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to the appropriate beneficiaries to reflect the $50 of deemed income. In this way, the deemed income could be treated as vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, the beneficiaries. Mary would then receive a further $10, and George and Alice would receive $20 each in accordance with their entitlements under the trust deed. However, this depends on the trust having an actual (non-deemed) amount corresponding to the amount of deemed income that is available to be vested or paid to the beneficiaries. This is because amounts of income derived by a trustee (including amounts of deemed income) must be able to be actually vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, a beneficiary to be beneficiary income. 118. In exercising their powers under the trust deed, the trustees determine that there is nothing in the trust fund available to be vested or paid to Mary, George and Alice in that year. Only $100 of trust income has actually been vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, the beneficiaries. Therefore, the extra $50 of trust income must be taxed as trustee income. 119. If the trustees had determined that there were sufficient amounts in the trust fund available to be vested absolutely in interest in, or paid to, Mary, George and Alice, the trustees could vest or pay some additional amounts to be treated as the deemed income for tax purposes, after making appropriate resolutions. To the extent they do this, the extra $50 of tax law income will be taxed as beneficiary income. Example 3 – Trust deed defines income using trust law concepts of capital and income, but the trustees have the power to distribute capital to income beneficiaries 120. In this situation the trust deed provides that the income of the trust is defined using trust law concepts of capital and income. However, the trust deed also gives the trustees the discretion to distribute capital amounts to income beneficiaries. As before, Fred is entitled to the first $50 of income, Mary is entitled to the next $60 of income and George and Alice are entitled to 50% each of the balance of the income of the trust. 121. In the 2011/2012 income year, the trust derived $100 of trust income. However, the trustees derived $150 of tax law income, as calculated under the Act, and must return this in the income tax return of the trust. In this situation the trust law income of the trust is $100 and the tax law income of the trust is $150. 122. For tax law purposes, the treatment of the vesting absolutely in interest of income in a beneficiary under s HC 6(1)(a), or a payment to a beneficiary under s HC 6(1)(b), would be the same as in the first example. That is, Fred would receive $50, Mary would receive $50 and George and Alice would not receive anything. The extra $50 of tax law income would be treated as trustee income if the trustees took no further action. 123. However, the trustees exercise their discretion and pay $50 from available trust capital to Mary (who receives an extra $10), and George and Alice (who receive $20 each) to match the excess tax law income. In exercising their 23 discretion, the trustees resolve that the payment of the capital amounts to Mary, George and Alice are to be treated as the payment of the deemed income for tax purposes. 124. In this situation, the $150 of tax law income will be taxed as beneficiary income.

Transfers to other trusts included (2) Despite subsection (1), a settlement for the benefit of a beneficiary is treated as a transfer of value only— (a) if the amount or the property being settled would have been beneficiary income of, or a taxable distribution to, a beneficiary, had it been distributed at the time to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand; or (b) when sections EW 50 or EZ 39 (which relate to forgiveness of debt) applies, if the property being settled is an amount forgiven and treated as paid as described in section EW 44(1) or (2) (Consideration when debt forgiven for natural love and affection) or EZ 39(1). When distribution made (3) A distribution is made when what is transferred— (a) vests absolutely in interest in the person; or (b) is paid to the person. Manner of distribution (4) A distribution may be made directly or indirectly, or by 1 transaction or a number of transactions, whether related, connected, or otherwise. Nil value of beneficiary relationship (5) The fact that a person is, or will become, a beneficiary of a trust does not constitute the giving or receiving of value. 6. Section HC 15 provides: HC 15 Taxable distributions from non-complying and foreign trusts When subsection (2) applies (1) Subsection (2) applies for a trust that is a non-complying trust at the time a distribution to a beneficiary is made. 26 Taxable distributions: non-complying trusts (2) The distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent to which it is not a distribution of— (a) beneficiary income; or (b) a part of the corpus of the trust; or (c) a payment or a transaction that represents a distribution of the corpus of the trust. When subsection (4) applies (3) Subsection (4) applies for a trust that is a foreign trust at the time a distribution to a beneficiary is made. Taxable distributions: foreign trusts (4) The distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent to which it is not a distribution of— (a) beneficiary income; or (b) a part of the corpus of the trust; or (c) a profit from the realisation of a capital asset or another capital gain; or (d) a payment or a transaction that represents a distribution of either the corpus of the trust referred to in paragraph (b) or a capital gain referred to in paragraph (c). Determining amount of gain (5) For the purposes of subsection (4)(c),— (a) the profit does not include— (i) a gain that must be taken into account for the purposes of determining an income tax liability; or (ii) a capital gain derived by the trustee through a transaction or series of transactions between the trustee and a person associated with them: (b) the amount of the profit is determined after subtracting any capital loss that the trustee incurs in the income year in which the amount was derived. Amounts not subject to ordering rule (6) To the extent to which a distribution is made from a trust that is not a complying trust by disposing of property at less than market value or providing services to a beneficiary at less than market value, the distribution is a taxable distribution and is not subject to the ordering rule in section HC 16. Inadequate records (7) If the records of a trust that is not a complying trust do not allow an accurate determination of the elements of a distribution under section HC 16, the distribution is a taxable distribution. 7. Section HC 16 provides: HC 16 Ordering rule for distributions from non-complying and foreign trusts When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of the trust rules when a trustee of a non- complying trust or a foreign trust makes a distribution in an income year to a beneficiary. Subsections (6) and (7) override this subsection. Order of elements of distribution (2) The distribution is treated as consisting of the following elements in the following order: (a) first, an amount of income that the trustee derives in the income year: (b) second, an amount of income, other than beneficiary income, that the trustee has derived in an earlier income year: (c) third, an amount that the trustee derives in the income year from the realisation of a capital asset of the trust or another capital gain: 27 (d) fourth, an amount that the trustee has derived in an earlier income year from the realisation of a capital asset of the trust or another capital gain: (e) last, the corpus of the trust. Order and elements (3) In subsection (2),— (a) an amount must not be treated as included in the distribution if the amount has been treated under this section as being included in an earlier or contemporaneous distribution from the trust: (b) the paragraphs are applied in order, and the next paragraph applies only to the extent to which the amount of the distribution is more than the cumulative amounts described in that paragraph and the preceding paragraphs. Deductions and capital losses subtracted (4) For the purposes of subsection (2),— (a) in paragraphs (a) and (b), the amount of income is determined after subtracting the amount of a deduction that is taken into account in the income year in the calculation of net or taxable income for the corresponding tax year: (b) in paragraphs (c) and (d), the amount is determined after subtracting the amount of a capital loss that the trustee incurs in the income year. Transactions that are not genuine (5) In the determination of the elements of a distribution to a beneficiary (beneficiary A), no amount of income or capital gain derived by the trustee of the trust is treated as distributed to another beneficiary of the trust (beneficiary B) if the effect is that some or all of the distribution to beneficiary A would be treated as not being a taxable distribution, unless the distribution to beneficiary B meets all the following requirements: (a) it is a genuine transaction entered into and carried out in good faith; and (b) it places the amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee in their capacity as trustee; and (c) it does not itself constitute a settlement. Exclusions: terms of trust (6) This section does not apply to the following distributions which are instead treated as consisting of the amount that reflects the terms of the trust or the terms of the exercise of the trustee’s discretion: (a) a distribution by the trustee of a complying trust which is treated as exempt income under section CW 53 (Distributions from complying trusts), unless an election to pay income tax on trustee income has been made for the purposes of section HZ 2 (Trusts that may become complying trusts); or (b) a distribution from a non-discretionary trust— (i) created by will or codicil, or by an order of court varying or modifying the provisions of a will or codicil; or (ii) created on an intestacy or partial intestacy; or (iii) on which no settlement has been made after 17 December 1987; or (c) a distribution from a trust other than a non-complying trust that is settled by a natural person who makes an election under section HC 30(2). Exclusions: taxable distributions (7) This section does not apply to a distribution described in section HC 15(6). Meaning of non-discretionary trust (8) In this section, a non-discretionary trust is a trust in relation to which the trustee has no discretion as to the source, nature, and amount of distributions to beneficiaries, including but not limited to the classification of trust property as capital or income. 28 8. Section HC 20 provides: HC 20 Distributions from complying trusts An amount that a person derives in an income year is exempt income of the person under section CW 53 (Distributions from complying trusts) if— (a) the amount is a distribution from a complying trust other than a community trust; and (b) the amount is not beneficiary income. 9. Section HC 32 provides: HC 32 Liability of trustee as agent When this section applies (1) This section applies in an income year when a beneficiary of a trust derives an amount of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. Exclusion (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who derives an amount from a community trust. Agency (3) In their capacity as agent, the trustee must satisfy the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived. Relationship to other provisions (4) Section HD 4(b) (Treatment of principals) overrides this section. 10. In s YA 1, the word “pay” is defined as follows: pay,— (a) for an amount and a person, includes— (i) to distribute the amount to them: (ii) to credit them for the amount: (iii) to deal with the amount in their interest or on their behalf, in some other way: (b) for a dividend that is a bonus issue, means to issue shares or to give credit for the shares comprising the bonus issue: (bb) is defined in section LD 4(7) (Tax credits for payroll donations) for the purposes of that section and section LD 8(1) (Meaning and ranking of payroll donation) and for section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (c) is defined in section RD 51(6) (Calculation of all-inclusive pay) for the purposes of that section Interpretation Act 1999 11. Section 32 of the Interpretation Act 1999 provides: 32 Parts of speech and grammatical forms Parts of speech and grammatical forms of a word that is defined in an enactment have corresponding meanings in the same enactment.

This statement outlines the Commissioner’s view of the law on tax avoidance in New Zealand. It sets out the approach the Commissioner will take to ss BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BG 1 is the general anti-avoidance provision in the Act. Section GA 1 enables the Commissioner to make an adjustment as a result of the application of s BG 1. 2. In Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 the Supreme Court indicated it intended to settle the approach regarding the relationship between s BG 1 and the rest of the Income Tax Act. This has been acknowledged in all relevant judicial decisions released since Ben Nevis. In particular, the Ben Nevis approach was subsequently confirmed as the proper approach to applying s BG 1 by the Supreme Court in Penny v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 95, \[2012\] 1 NZLR 433 (litigation known as Penny & Hooper). Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that this statement is based upon and reflects the view of the court in Ben Nevis. Previous statements 3. In February 1990 the Commissioner issued a statement on s 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976, the general anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act. It was published as an appendix to the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 1, No 8 (February 1990). That statement set out the Commissioner’s view on the function of the section, the relevance of case law and the WITHDRAWN 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] process the Commissioner would follow when considering invoking the section. 4. A new draft statement was prepared and circulated for external comment during 2004, but that statement was not finalised. 5. These earlier published and draft statements no longer represent the Commissioner’s view. SUMMARY 6. Section BG 1 is only considered after determining whether other provisions of the Act apply or do not apply. That inquiry considers how specific provisions apply to particular parts of the arrangement. The words of a specific provision are interpreted in light of its purpose in accordance with s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999. 7. The inquiry under s BG 1 considers whether the use of the Act is within Parliament’s contemplation when viewed in light of the whole arrangement. Section BG 1 applies to arrangements that use or circumvent specific provisions. 8. The Commissioner’s approach to analysing and applying s BG 1 is set out in a flow chart that outlines the sequence of analysis undertaken to establish whether an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement. This is included at the end of this summary. There are also examples illustrating how the approach is worked through from page 95. Arrangement 9. Section BG 1 voids a tax avoidance arrangement. An “arrangement” is defined widely and includes formal, legally-enforceable contracts through to informal, unenforceable understandings. 10. An “arrangement”: • includes “all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect”; • can include unilateral arrangements; • can comprise two or more documents or transactions together if they constitute a single “agreement, contract, plan or understanding”; • can include steps or transactions carried out or brought into effect outside of New Zealand. 11. Also, a taxpayer may be considered party to an “arrangement” even if they did not know the details of how the arrangement would be carried out. 12. It is important to fully understand the arrangement, taking into account all pertinent facts and information relating to it. This includes understanding the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives of the arrangement. 13. The tax effects and tax provisions at issue are then identified. The tax provisions at issue include specific provisions used by the arrangement and any potentially relevant provisions that do not apply to the arrangement. WITHDRAWN 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Tax avoidance 14. The statutory definition of “tax avoidance” is not an exhaustive one. Parliament has left it to the courts to identify tax avoidance, and t he function of the statutory definition is to confirm that certain defined circumstances, such as future tax liabilities, are not excluded from the scope of tax avoidance. 15. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis set out the approach to be adopted to determine whether tax avoidance exists. The Commissioner refers to this approach as the Parliamentary contemplation test. 16. The Parliamentary contemplation test asks whether the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the Act in a manner that is consistent with what Parliament would have intended for the provisions that apply (or do not apply) to the arrangement. Applying this test involves identifying: • Parliament’s purpose regarding the relevant provisions, and • the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement. 17. The Commissioner considers that the better approach is to identify Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions first, even though it is recognised that these two aspects of the Parliamentary contemplation test are interrelated and inform each other. Ascertaining Parliament’s purpose regarding the relevant provisions 18. Parliament’s purpose for provisions is the result Parliament intended to achieve, or the end Parliament had in mind. There may be multiple purposes. Parliament’s purpose for combinations of provisions may need to be identified. It is Parliament’s purpose at the time it enacted the provisions that is relevant. The test is not to discern whether Parliament contemplated the actual arrangement with all its steps and transactions. Instead, the question is a hypothetical one. 19. How Parliament’s purpose is identified will depend on how the Act applies or does not apply to the arrangement. In some cases, the focus will be on the text of a particular provision. In others, a broader examination of the Act may be required to identify Parliament’s purpose. Sometimes extrinsic materials and case law may help when reaching a view on Parliament’s purpose for particular provisions. 20. Once Parliament’s purpose for particular provisions has been ascertained, the facts, features and attributes required to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose for those provisions must be identified. The commercial and economic reality 21. The commercial and economic reality of an arrangement is examined to see whether the use of the provisions is within Parliament’s purpose. In particular, the arrangement is examined to see whether the facts, features and attributes required to give effect to Parliament’s purpose for the provisions in question are in fact present (or absent). 22. Understanding what is actually achieved requires a complete understanding of the facts and a thorough grasp of the detail and workings WITHDRAWN 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] of the arrangement as a whole. Identification of the commercial reality and economic effects is not limited by the form of the arrangement, nor does it involve identifying an arrangement that is economically equivalent. 23. Considering the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement may identify further relevant provisions or raise further questions as to Parliament’s purpose for provisions already identified. If necessary, repeat these steps until Parliament’s purpose has been sufficiently ascertained. 24. Determining whether a tax avoidance arrangement exists involves considering various factors, including the: • manner in which the arrangement is carried out; • role of all relevant parties and their relationships; • economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions; • duration of the arrangement; • nature and extent of the financial consequences; • presence of artificiality or contrivance; • presence of pretence; • presence of circularity; • presence of inflated expenditure or reduced levels of income; • undertaking of real risks by the parties; • relevance of an arrangement being pre-tax negative. The relevance of these factors will depend on the provisions used or circumvented and what facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present (or absent). Applying the Parliamentary contemplation test 25. The question is then, taking into account all of the above, does the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, use (or circumvent) the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose? It may be necessary to exercise judgement over whether any of the requisite facts, features and attributes are present or absent to a sufficient degree. Not all complex fact situations or undesirable policy outcomes amount to tax avoidance 26. Even when an arrangement is complex or unusual, or produces tax results that may be undesirable from a policy perspective, it may not be a tax avoidance arrangement. Taxpayers may structure arrangements to their best tax advantage, provided the use of the provisions is within what Parliament would have contemplated. However, literal compliance with provisions is not sufficient to establish that the use is within Parliament’s contemplation. Merely incidental 27. The merely incidental test applies to an arrangement that has a tax avoidance purpose or effect as one of its purposes or effects. It provides WITHDRAWN 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] that even though the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect, it will not be a tax avoidance arrangement if the tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose. 28. A “merely incidental” tax avoidance purpose or effect is something which follows from or is necessarily and concomitantly linked to, without contrivance, some other purpose or effect. Such a purpose is determined objectively by reference to the arrangement itself and not subjectively in terms of motive. 29. Purposes that are general in nature and do not explain the adoption of the specific structure of the arrangement will not establish that the tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental. 30. The merely incidental test is unlikely to apply where an arrangement that uses specific provisions in a way not contemplated by Parliament has been structured to gain a tax advantage in an artificial and contrived way. Section GA 1 adjustment 31. When the voiding of an arrangement under s BG 1 appropriately counteracts the tax advantages, and does no more than that, then the Commissioner will not be required to apply s GA 1. However, if the voiding has not appropriately counteracted the tax avoidance, or the voiding has removed legitimate outcomes, or there are consequential adjustments that need to be made, the Commissioner is required to apply s GA 1. 32. The Commissioner has a broad discretion as to the adjustments that can be made to counteract the tax advantage. There is no duty to describe precisely the actual basis for an adjustment. Further, the Commissioner may adjust the taxable income of any person affected by the arrangement. A person can be affected by an arrangement whether they are a party to the arrangement and whether they are aware that they benefited from a tax avoidance arrangement. Flow C harts 33. The following flow chart illustrates the steps the Commissioner considers should be taken when analysing whether s BG 1 applies to an arrangement. It is followed by a further flow chart setting out the steps the Commissioner considers should be taken in applying s GA 1. WITHDRAWN 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section BG 1: a suggested approach Your consideration of the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement may raise further questions as to Parliament’s purpose in the context of this particular arrangement. If necessary, repeat these steps until you are satisfied that you have sufficiently ascertained Parliament’s purpose. 1 You may need to return to this step if your subsequent analysis of the arrangement identifies additional potentially relevant provisions. s BG 1 does not apply arrangement tax avoidance The arrangement and its tax effects •Identify all of the steps and transactions that make up the arrangement. •Gain an understanding of the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives of the arrangement, including the role of each of its individual steps. •Identify the tax effects of the arrangement, the provisions of the Act that apply to it, and any potentially relevant provisions that do not apply. 1 Parliament’s purpose •Ascertain Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions from their text, the statutory context (including the statutory scheme relevant to the provisions), case law and any relevant extrinsic material. 2 Commercial reality and economic effects •Examine the whole arrangement from the point of view of its commercial reality and economic effects, having particular regard to the facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. Does the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, use (or circumvent) the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose? merely incidental Other purposes or effects •Identify any other (ie, non-tax avoidance) purposes or effects of the arrangement that are not integral to the tax avoidance purpose or effect. 3 Does the tax avoidance purpose or effect merely follow naturally from the other purposes or effects (rather than being an end in itself)? 4 Section BG 1 applies no yes no yes 2 You may also need to consider Parliament’s purpose for combinations of provisions at this step. 3 These do not include purposes or effects that are not achieved by the arrangement (otherwise than as a result of unforeseen factors). 4 Tax avoidance purposes or effects will not be merely incidental to other purposes or effects where the other purposes or effects: •fail to explain the particular structure of the arrangement, but instead are more general in nature; or •are underpinned by tax avoidance purposes or effects. the arrangement has tax avoidance as a purpose or effect •Identify any facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to that purpose. WITHDRAWN 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] yes yes ∗“Legitimate tax outcomes” do not include tax outcomes that are integral to the tax avoidance. Section BG 1 applies Has the voiding effect of s BG 1 removed any legitimate tax outcomes?\* Are any consequential adjustments required to ensure appropriate outcomes? Application of s GA 1 is not required The Commissioner will apply s GA 1 (as required) to ensure that: •The tax advantages from the tax avoidance are appropriately counteracted. •Legitimate tax outcomes are reinstated.\* •Appropriate consequential adjustments are made. yes no no no Has the voiding effect of s BG 1 completely counteracted the tax advantages from the tax avoidance? Approach to s GA 1 WITHDRAWN 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] LEGISLATION 34. The general anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 are in ss BG 1 and GA 1, with relevant terms defined in s YA 1. 35. Many cases on tax avoidance refer to the predecessors to ss BG 1 and GA 1—ss BG 1 and GB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, ss BG 1 and GB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, s 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and s 108 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. 36. The relevance of those cases to the interpretation of the current provisions will sometimes depend upon the words used in the corresponding repealed provisions. In some instances the relevant wording is the same or similar and the cases remain authoritative. However, more recent court decisions have taken different views as to the meaning to be given to the wording. The most recent authoritative decision is the decision of the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis. The court indicated it intended to settle the approach that should be applied to the inter-relationship of the general anti-avoidance provision with specific provisions (at \[100\]). Therefore, to the extent that earlier decisions are inconsistent with Ben Nevis on that issue, they are no longer relevant. 37. The general anti-avoidance provisions of the 2007 Act and related provisions are as follows: BB 3 Overriding effect of certain matters Tax avoidance arrangements: subpart BG (1) Under Part G (Avoidance and non-market transactions), the Commissioner may counteract a tax advantage from a tax avoidance arrangement. BG 1 Tax avoidance Avoidance arrangement void (1) A tax avoidance arrangement is void as against the Commissioner for income tax purposes. Reconstruction (2) Under Part G (Avoidance and non-market transactions), the Commissioner may counteract a tax advantage that a person has obtained from or under a tax avoidance arrangement. GA 1 Commissioner’s power to adjust When this section applies (1) This section applies if an arrangement is void under section BG 1 (Tax avoidance). Commissioner’s general power (2) The Commissioner may adjust the taxable income of a person affected by the arrangement in a way the Commissioner thinks appropriate, in order to counteract a tax advantage obtained by the person from or under the arrangement. Commissioner’s specific power over tax credits (3) The Commissioner may— WITHDRAWN 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) disallow some or all of a tax credit of a person affected by the arrangement; or (b) allow another person to benefit from some or all of the tax credit. Commissioner’s identification of hypothetical situation (4) When applying subsections (2) and (3), the Commissioner may have regard to 1 or more of the amounts listed in subsection (5) which, in the Commissioner’s opinion, had the arrangement not occurred, the person— (a) would have had; or (b) would in all likelihood have had; or (c) might be expected to have had. Reconstructed amounts (5) The amounts referred to in subsection (4) are— (a) an amount of income of the person: (b) an amount of deduction of the person: (c) an amount of tax loss of the person: (d) an amount of tax credit of the person. No double counting (6) When applying subsection (2), if the Commissioner includes an amount of income or deduction in calculating the taxable income of the person, it must not be included in calculating the taxable income of another person. Meaning of tax credit (7) In this section, tax credit means a reduction in the tax a person must pay because of— (a) a credit allowed for a payment by the person of an amount of tax or of another item; or (b) another type of benefit. YA 1 Definitions arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect tax avoidance includes— (a) directly or indirectly altering the incidence of any income tax: (b) directly or indirectly relieving a person from liability to pay income tax or from a potential or prospective liability to future income tax: (c) directly or indirectly avoiding, postponing, or reducing any liability to income tax or any potential or prospective liability to future income tax tax avoidance arrangement means an arrangement, whether entered into by the person affected by the arrangement or by another person, that directly or indirectly— (a) has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or (b) has tax avoidance as 1 of its purposes or effects, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings, if the tax avoidance purpose or effect is not merely incidental. WITHDRAWN 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] THE ROLE OF SECTION BG 1 IN THE INCOME TAX ACT 38. Section BG 1 is a core provision of the Income Tax Act. It applies to an arrangement that has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. It also applies to an arrangement that has tax avoidance as one of its purposes or effects that is more than merely incidental, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings. The section is self-activating in that it does not require the Commissioner’s intervention for it to apply. Under s BG 1 a tax avoidance arrangement is void against the Commissioner for income tax purposes. Where an arrangement is void under s BG 1, s GA 1 may operate to allow the Commissioner to counteract the tax advantage that would otherwise have been obtained through the voided arrangement. It follows that, where there is a tax avoidance arrangement, s BG 1 applies to deny the result under the Act that would otherwise apply. 39. Woodhouse P in Challenge Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 at 529 (CA) described the role of the section at 532: But be that as it may s 99 is obviously a central pillar of the income tax legislation (to use the language of counsel for Challenge in accepting the fact) and a reflection of the firm and understandable conclusion of Parliament that there must be a weapon able to thwart technically correct but contrived transactions set up as a means of exploiting the Act for tax advantages. 40. The Supreme Court put it this way in Ben Nevis at \[106\]: The general provision is designed to avoid the fiscal effect of tax avoidance arrangements having a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Its function is to prevent uses of the specific provisions which fall outside their intended scope in the overall scheme of the Act. Such uses give rise to an impermissible tax advantage which the Commissioner may counteract. The general anti-avoidance provision and its associated reconstruction power provide explicit authority for the Commissioner and New Zealand courts to avoid what has been done and to reconstruct tax avoidance arrangements. 41. And in Penny (SC) the Supreme Court said at \[47\]: \[The New Zealand general anti-avoidance provision\] continues to have work to do whenever a taxpayer uses specific provisions of the Act and otherwise legitimate structures in a manner which cannot have been within the contemplation of Parliament. The policy underlying the general anti-avoidance provision is to negate any structuring of a taxpayer's affairs whether or not done as a matter of “ordinary business or family dealings” unless any tax advantage is just an incidental feature. \[Footnote omitted\] The relationship between section BG 1 and the rest of the Act 42. Section BG 1 voids tax avoidance arrangements and s GA 1 counteracts the tax outcomes that would otherwise apply. Consequently, an issue arises about the relationship between s BG 1 and the rest of the Act. The issue is that, r ead literally, the anti-avoidance provision would strike down any transaction that has the effect of reducing tax. 43. Determining the correct approach to take to reach a view on whether s BG 1 applies or the other provisions of the Act operate, has been difficult for taxpayers and their agents, the Commissioner and the courts. This is reflected in the fact that the courts in several leading cases have used different approaches to reach a view on whether an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement. I n a dissenting judgment delivered in 1970 in WITHDRAWN 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Mangin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1971\] NZLR 591 (PC), Lord Wilberforce outlined problems he saw with the general anti-avoidance provision, including at 602: (c) It fails to specify the relation between the section and other provisions in the Income Tax legislation under which tax reliefs, or exemptions, may be obtained. Is it legitimate to take advantage of these so as to avoid or reduce tax? What if the only purpose is to use them? Is there a distinction between “proper” tax avoidance and “improper” tax avoidance? By what sense is this distinction to be perceived? 44. In Challenge (CA) Woodhouse P made the same point at 532: A criticism levelled at s 99, as it has been levelled at the earlier s 108, is that on its face the language is so encompassing when read literally that major qualifications must be read into it if various deduction and other provisions of the Act are to be left effective. It cannot have been the purpose of the legislature, so it is said, to import into the Income Tax Act a general provision so spacious in operation that other sections would be virtually impotent. See also Elmiger v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1966\] NZLR 683 (SC) at 687–688, Challenge (CA) Cooke J at 541, and Richardson J at 548, Commissioner of Inland Revenue v BNZ Investments Ltd \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450 (CA) \[BNZ Investments No 1 (CA)\] at \[40\]. 45. Most recently, the relationship between the specific provisions and the general anti-avoidance provision was the central issue for the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis ( see \[12\], \[83\] and \[100\]). The court described the problem in this way: \[12\] The expanded provision, and its successors, did not, however, explicitly resolve a central issue that had arisen with s 108 of the 1954 Act. That was the relationship between the general anti-avoidance provision and the many "specific provisions" that allow tax concessions, principally through authorising deductions and depreciation allowances. Taxpayers enter into many transactions which have been structured with the purpose of taking advantage of specific provisions in order to reduce tax. While the general anti-avoidance provision is expressed broadly, its purpose cannot be to strike down arrangements which involve no more than appropriate use of specific provisions. On the other hand, strict compliance with the requirements of specific provisions cannot have been intended to immunise all arrangements involving their use against being categorised as tax avoidance arrangements, which it was the purpose of the general provision to avoid. \[13\] The present appeals are the first occasion this Court has had to consider when use of specific provisions will amount to proscribed tax avoidance. There is little explicit guidance in the legislation and the current case law has become complex, through being encumbered by considerations and tests that the legislation does not specify. Through a process of interpretation of all the relevant statutory provisions, we must identify a means for determining where permissible use of specific provisions ends and tax avoidance begins. 46. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis acknowledged that the tax legislation does not explicitly address how to discern the relationship between all owing tax concessions for certain arrangements and applying the general anti-avoidance provision. After considering the various approaches adopted by the courts during the last twenty years, the majority concluded that in the face of continuing uncertainty it was desirable for the Supreme Court to settle the approach that should be applied (see Ben Nevis at \[100\]). The Supreme Court’s approach is discussed from paragraph 193 of this statement. In short, it is to determine whether the use of the Act is consistent with Parliament’s purpose when the arrangement is viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way. WITHDRAWN 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Using and circumventing provisions, and specific and general provisions 47. Section BG 1 can only apply if an arrangement is first subject to the other provisions of the Income Tax Act. In coming to a view on whether the tax provisions apply as claimed or s BG 1 applies, it is important to appreciate that a view may be required to be reached not only as to how particular sections apply (eg, the application of the financial arrangements rules to a particular loan structure), but also as to which sections an arrangement ensures do not apply (eg, sections applying to certain types of leases that the arrangement does not fall within). This is because, when the further inquiry is made under s BG 1 , a decision must be reached not only on whether certain provisions apply, but also on whether certain provisions do not apply, in a way Parliament would have contemplated. Thus, some tax avoidance arrangements involve the positive utilisation of specific provisions in a way Parliament did not contemplate. Other tax avoidance arrangements have the effect that provisions of the Act do not apply at all, contrary to what Parliament contemplated for those provisions. The first type of arrangement might be said to involve a use of provisions and the second a circumvention. 48. In Ben Nevis, the facts involved the use of provisions rather than their circumvention. The taxpayers in that case argued that certain provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 applied—s EG 1, which allowed a deduction for depreciation, and s DL 1(3), which provided for a deduction for insurance premiums. At \[107\], the court made it clear that the case before it concerned the use of particular specific provisions: \[107\] When, as here, a case involves reliance by the taxpayer on specific provisions, the first inquiry concerns the application of those provisions. The court did not have to consider an arrangement that involved the circumvention of provisions. 49. However, the same approach adopted by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis applies equally to arrangements that circumvent the Act. In the Commissioner’s view, the re is no logical reason or policy consideration why s BG 1 will not apply to an arrangement that was not within Parliament’s contemplation because it circumvents the Act, as opposed to an arrangement that positively utilises particular provisions. 50. Other arrangements employ lawful structures recognised in the Act but use them in ways not contemplated by Parliament. One step in an otherwise unobjectionable arrangement might give rise to a tax advantage that was not intended by Parliament. In Penny (SC), the court said: \[33\] This case differs from Ben Nevis, in which this Court explained the proper approach to questions of tax avoidance. Here there can be no question of the taxpayers failing to comply with specific taxation provisions. The structure both taxpayers adopted when they transferred their businesses (orthopaedic practices) to companies owned by their family trusts was, as a structure, entirely lawful and unremarkable. The adoption of such a familiar trading structure cannot per se be said to involve tax avoidance. It was a choice the taxpayers were entitled to make. Nor is there anything unusual or artificial in a taxpayer then causing the company under his control to employ him on a salaried basis. What is said by the Commissioner to constitute tax avoidance is the fixing of the salaries at artificially low levels whereby the incidence of tax at the highest personal rate was avoided. 51. The court went on to conclude that fixing the taxpayer’s salary in an artificial manner in combination with the operation of other features of the WITHDRAWN 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] structure had the effect that the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement (at \[34\] and \[47\]). 52. Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) (2010) 24 NZTC 24,463 (HC) was another example of an arrangement that used lawful structures in a way Parliament did not contemplate. In Russell, Wylie J observed that the taxpayer did not place reliance on any specific provision (at \[106\]). The arrangement in that case involved complicated arrangements incorporating payments between companies, partnerships and other companies that had losses. Although they were legitimate corporate and trust structures, the way those structures were used meant that, without the operation of s BG 1, the taxpayer was not taxed on income he earned through his personal exertion (at \[115\] and \[116\]). 53. It might also be that a single arrangement has the effect of both using and circumventing provisions in a way Parliament did not contemplate. Further, tax avoidance arrangements might involve either the use of general provisions, such as the general deductibility provision, or a particular detailed provision in the Act. In the same way, arrangements that circumvent provisions might circumvent general provisions, such as those establishing all income is taxed or general timing provisions, or they might circumvent a detailed set of specific provisions in the Act. 54. As will be explained later, the approach in Ben Nevis sets out how to decide whether s BG 1 or the other provisions of the Act apply. The Commissioner’s opinion is that this approach applies to all of the categories of tax avoidance arrangement identified in paragraphs 47 to 53 above. In other words, the approach is not limited solely to arrangements that use specific provisions to achieve tax advantages, but will also apply when arrangements circumvent provisions to achieve similar advantages. Equally, the approach is not limited to specific, as opposed to general, provisions. PROVISIONS OF THE ACT OTHER THAN SECTION BG 1 55. Section BG 1 is only considered after reaching a view on whether the other, more specific, provisions of the Act apply or do not apply. This inquiry as to the application of the other provisions is a separate inquiry that must be made before considering the application of s BG 1. This section of this statement discusses the approach to interpreting the other provisions and how that differs from the approach to applying s BG 1. It then discusses whether it must be established that those other provisions apply in a dispute. Approach to interpretation 56. Legislation is interpreted in accordance with s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999, which provides that the meaning of an enactment “must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose”: see Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767. The Supreme Court in that case stated at \[22\] and \[24\] (footnotes included): \[22\] It is necessary to bear in mind that s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes text and purpose the key drivers of statutory interpretation. The meaning of an enactment \[10\] must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. Even if the meaning of the text may appear plain in isolation of purpose, that meaning should always be cross checked against purpose in order to observe the dual WITHDRAWN 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] requirements of s 5. In determining purpose the Court must obviously have regard to both the immediate and the general legislative context. Of relevance too may be the social, commercial or other objective of the enactment. \[11\] \[24\] Where, as here, the meaning is not clear on the face of the legislation, the Court will regard context and purpose as essential guides to meaning. \[F ootnotes: 10 “Enactment” means “the whole or a portion of an Act or regulations” (see s 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999); 11 See generally Auckland City Council v Glucina \[1997\] 2 NZLR 1 (CA) at p 4 per Blanchard J for the Court, and Burrows, Statute Law in New Zealand (3rd ed, 2003), p 146 and following.\] 57. While Fonterra was not a tax case, its approach is consistent with the most recent appellate decision on how tax legislation is to be interpreted in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Alcan New Zealand Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439 (CA). In Alcan at 444, the Court of Appeal held that tax legislation is to be interpreted in the same way as other types of legislation and, as such, it must be given a meaning that is “consonant with the words used, having regard to their context in the Act as a whole, and to the purpose of the legislation to the extent that this is discernible”. 58. The approach to statutory interpretation of legislative provisions used by an arrangement should give effect to those provisions. 59. In the context of discussing the approach to establishing the relationship between s BG 1 and the other sections of the Act, the court in Ben Nevis said the following about interpreting the other sections of the Act: \[102\] It is accordingly the task of the Courts to apply a principled approach which gives proper overall effect to statutory language that expresses different legislative policies. It has long been recognised those policies require reconciliation. The approach must ensure that the particular case before the court is examined by reference to the respective legislative policies. It must enable decisions to be made on individual cases through the application of a process of statutory construction focusing objectively on features of the arrangements involved, without being distracted by intuitive subjective impressions of the morality of what taxation advisers have set up. \[103\] We consider Parliament’s overall purpose is best served by construing specific tax provisions and the general anti-avoidance provision so as to give appropriate effect to each. They are meant to work in tandem. Each provides a context which assists in determining the meaning and, in particular, the scope of the other. Neither should be regarded as overriding. Rather they work together. The presence in the New Zealand legislation of a general anti-avoidance provision suggests that our Parliament meant it to be the principal vehicle by means of which tax avoidance is addressed. The general anti-avoidance regime is designed for that purpose, whereas individual specific provisions have a focus which is determined primarily by their ordinary meaning, as established through their text in the light of their specific purpose. In short, the purpose of specific provisions must be distinguished from that of the general anti-avoidance provision. \[Emphasis added\] 60. And, the court said: \[107\] When, as here, a case involves reliance by the taxpayer on specific provisions, the first inquiry concerns the application of those provisions. The taxpayer must satisfy the Court that the use made of the specific provision is within its intended scope. If that is shown, a further question arises based on the taxpayer’s use of the specific provision viewed in the light of the arrangement as a whole. \[Emphasis added\] 61. Thus, the inquiry into whether a specific provision applies is undertaken so as to be satisfied that the use made of a specific provision is within its intended scope. T his inquiry takes place before any consideration of WITHDRAWN 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] s BG 1 is undertaken. The approach to the specific provisions should therefore give effect to Parliament’s intention for the provision. JF Burrows and RI Carter Statute Law in New Zealand (4th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2009) state at 201–202 that words should be given a liberal interpretation to ensure the purpose of the legislation is achieved, and hand in hand with that is the: ... desire to examine the text of the Act in context. A section should be read in the context of the Act as a whole (the “scheme of the Act” as it is often called), and it is permissible to consult a much wider range of extrinsic materials than was once the case to understand the background to the Act and what its framers were trying to achieve by it. 62. Burrows also states that, however far the purposive approach extends, the actual words of the Act remain the most important single factor in statutory interpretation. However, the meaning is not the narrow purely literal meaning, but the most natural meaning of the words in the context and taking into account their purpose. The relevance of the approach of English cases to interpreting tax legislation 63. To understand the approach to interpreting provisions other than s BG 1, it is relevant to consider what the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis said about certain English cases. The United Kingdom does not have a general anti-avoidance provision, and the courts there have developed ways of analysing transactions to give effect to Parliament’s intention where avoidance is an issue: W T Ramsay Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners \[1982\] AC 300 (HL), Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v Dawson \[1984\] AC 474 (HL), MacNiven (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Westmoreland Investments Ltd \[2001\] UKHL 6, \[2003\] 1 AC 311 and subsequent cases. This approach has allowed courts in recent years to take a more purposive approach to interpreting the statutory provisions, including taking into account the economics of an arrangement. 64. The minority in Ben Nevis considered that this approach applies in New Zealand. They wrote separately to express their reservations on the approach of the majority to the interpretation of the specific provisions. The minority’s view was at \[5\]: We do not therefore accept that when considering the application of a specific tax provision, and before considering the question of avoidance, the Court is concerned primarily with the legal structures and obligations created by the parties, and not with the economic substance of what they do. 65. The majority, on the other hand, distinguished the English cases (at \[110\]). The majority considered that the English decisions were of limited assistance because, due to the lack of a general anti-avoidance provision, they were not concerned with reconciling potentially conflicting provisions. 66. The majority’s view was, therefore, that although the English cases would suggest a more purposive approach should be taken to interpreting tax legislation than in the past, in New Zealand this means giving words their ordinary meaning in the context and taking into account their purpose. Generally the Income Tax Act taxes on the basis of the legal rights and obligations of parties based on the legal form. However, there may be instances where the statutory provisions require that in certain circumstances the substance of a transaction is taken into account: see Sovereign Assurance Company Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue WITHDRAWN 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[2012\] NZHC 1760, (2012) 25 NZTC ¶20-138. In the absence of such a statutory requirement, that is the role of s BG 1, as stated in Ben Nevis at \[110\]: A purposive approach is, in any event, limited in the extent to which it can avoid arrangements on its own. Such an approach is, however, reinforced in New Zealand by the presence in our legislation of the general anti-avoidance provision. Whether the general anti-avoidance provision can apply when there are potentially applicable specific anti-avoidance provisions 67. It is sometimes argued that if a specific anti-avoidance provision has been enacted for a set of tax provisions, there is no scope for s BG 1 t o apply because Parliament has made clear the type of arrangements it is not comfortable with. However, s BG 1 may apply even if there is a specific anti-avoidance provision that accompanies the provisions used or circumvented. The purpose of a specific anti-avoidance provision is to ensure that tax outcomes will not be as claimed in certain defined circumstances. It does not implicitly rule out the application of s BG 1. 68. The taxpayer in Challenge (CA) argued that the presence of a specific anti-avoidance provision meant Parliament must, by implication, accept tax avoidance of a kind different than that covered by the specific provision. The Privy Council in Challenge Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 at 555 (PC) disagreed and said at 559: A likely explanation is that Parliament was indifferent to or unmindful of any overlap between the general provisions of s 99 and the particular provisions of s 191(1)(c)(i) or that, in view of the well-known difficulties encountered in the formulation and enforcement of effective anti-tax avoidance provisions, Parliament thought that an overlap might be useful and could not be harmful. Parliament may have had in mind two different tax avoidance positions. 69. Section BG 1 may apply to the same or a similar situation as that covered by a specific provision. Section BG 1 might apply in a situation close to that covered by a specific anti-avoidance provision where, for example, the arrangement has the effect of carefully circumventing the scope of a specific anti-avoidance provision. Section BG 1 might also apply to arrangements that avoid tax in a different way than that covered by the specific anti-avoidance provision. In Challenge (PC), the Privy Council suggested some different scenarios that would avoid tax in a different way than was covered by the specific anti-avoidance provision. The Privy Council concluded that a construction of a specific anti-avoidance provision that ‘silently repeals’ the general anti-avoidance provision would be unlikely. 70. A similar view was taken by the Supreme Court in Penny (SC). The taxpayer argued that the existence of some special anti-avoidance rules for related party transactions, including the personal services attribution rules, left no room for the operation of s BG 1 in their case (at \[45\]). The Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying: \[48\] Nor, as the Challenge case shows, does the existence in the PSA rules and the cross-border services rules of some specific anti-avoidance provisions have the consequence that s BG 1 cannot operate where the tax avoidance arrangement employed by a taxpayer does not fall within those specific rules. The Select Committee Report on the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill commented that the PSA rules (which it called the attribution rule) “supports the general anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994”. The legislators thus WITHDRAWN 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] recognised that the latter would continue to do their residual work, but no doubt with the hope that the delay and cost involved in using them could be obviated in specifically targeted situations. Unless the specific rules plainly are intended to cover the field in relation to the use of particular provisions by taxpayers or plainly exclude the use of the general anti-avoidance provision in a certain situation — which is not so here — then the Commissioner can rely upon s BG 1 to counter avoidance where that has occurred. 71. The court said there may be instances where the specific rules plainly are intended to cover the field or plainly exclude the use of the general anti-avoidance provision. Whether this is the case will be a matter of statutory interpretation, and it will need to be clear that Parliament intended to limit the use of s BG 1 in the situation. Given the approach taken by the courts in Challenge (PC) and Penny (SC) to arguments about specific anti-avoidance provisions, it will be unlikely that a taxpayer could argue successfully that Parliament has expressed the intention to exclude the operation of s BG 1 without statutory words supporting that conclusion. Whether parts or the whole of the arrangement is considered when applying the sections of the Act other than section BG 1 72. When considering the application of sections of the Act other than s BG 1, the focus is on a particular section. The inquiry is limited to the particular part of the arrangement to which the provisions other than s BG 1 apply. 73. In contrast, as the court said in Ben Nevis, the role of s BG 1 is to examine the use made of the Act “viewed in the light of the arrangement as a whole” ( at \[107\]). The focus is on understanding the arrangement in a commercially and economically realistic way. As the exercise involves looking at the whole arrangement, it may often involve examining the combination of steps by which it is carried out (see Ben Nevis at \[105\]). This may mean that sections and parts of the Act used are considered together that may not be considered together when reaching a view on the application of the specific provisions standing alone. Whether the exercise under s BG 1 will involve considering Parliament’s purpose for a single provision, a combination of provisions, or the Act as a whole, will depend on the use the arrangement makes of the provisions. This last point is considered later in this statement under the heading “Parliament’s purpose regarding the relevant provisions”. 74. Wild J in BNZ Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2009) 24 NZTC 23,582 (HC) \[BNZ Investments No 2 (HC)\] discussed the difference in approach: \[122\] I read Ben Nevis as requiring the court, at step 1, to undertake a discrete inquiry, determining whether the taxpayer has complied with the specific provisions, interpreted as directed by the court in the latter part of \[103\]. The court is engaged in interpreting the specific provisions standing alone, rather than in interpreting them in the context of the whole legislative scheme. If compliance is not conceded, the court must analyse the transaction and decide whether it complies with the applicable specific provisions. ... \[125\] At step 2 the focus shifts to a purposive interpretation of the specific provisions in the context of \[the\] legislative scheme as a whole. 75. In the Commissioner’s view, Wild J was primarily emphasising the broader enquiry that is made under s BG 1 in comparison to the inquiry into sections of the Act that are not connected other than by the arrangement. WITHDRAWN 19 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Wild J was making the point that under s BG 1 it might be necessary to identify Parliament’s purpose for combination of sections and parts of the Act that would not otherwise be considered together. 76. Determining whether s BG 1 applies involves looking at the whole arrangement, even though the objectionable use of the Act may be found in only one step of the arrangement. In Penny (SC), the court said that the use of the company and trust structure was unremarkable. However, a single step in the arrangement—an artificially low level of salary paid to the taxpayers—meant the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement. The court also looked at the whole arrangement to establish that the reality was that, although the taxpayers on the face of it received less salary, when the whole arrangement was looked at it could be seen that the taxpayers suffered no actual loss of income as they received the amounts through their family trusts. Whether in a dispute it must be established the other provisions of the Act apply 77. As previously noted, s BG 1 applies when other provisions of the Act apply, or the application of potentially relevant provisions have been ruled out. Therefore, it must first be determined whether other provisions of the Act apply (or do not apply). However, in a dispute it is open to the Commissioner to argue that provisions of the Act apply in a certain way and also, in the alternative, that s BG 1 will apply. For example, the Commissioner might argue an amount is not deductible but also that, if the Commissioner is found to be wrong on that view, in the alternative s BG 1 would apply. 78. It might be thought this would mean the Commissioner was simultaneously holding contradictory views of the facts and the application of the law. The Commissioner’s view is that it is open to the Commissioner to argue s BG 1 in the alternative. Harrison J approached his judgment in this way in Westpac where he said: \[314\] Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Commissioner has correctly disallowed Westpac’s deductions for the GPFs. They were not paid according to a “financial arrangement” or in deriving gross income. In my judgment Westpac’s use of the deductibility provisions was not within their ordinary meaning and scope in the light of their specific purposes. \[315\] That finding is not, however, determinative of the proceeding. I must still consider Westpac’s claim that, regardless of the lawfulness of its GPF deductions, the transactions are not tax avoidance arrangements and, even if they are, that the Commissioner has wrongfully reconstructed them. In fiscal terms, the consequences are potentially much greater than disallowing the bank’s total deductions for GPF expenditure. On the Commissioner’s case, they extend to the lawfulness of all the bank’s deductions claimed for the cost of funds. 79. This is consistent with the approach of the Court of Appeal in Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1999\] 1 NZLR 275 (CA) when the court was considering whether the Commissioner can make an assessment that is inconsistent with an earlier assessment of a different taxpayer. The court said that although ultimately the assessments must be consistent, the Commissioner is allowed some flexibility in the timing of the adjustments to meet administrative demands and to enable the Commissioner to await the outcome of objection proceedings (at 292). WITHDRAWN 20 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 80. If a taxpayer’s argument based on the application of some particular provisions of the Act fails, there may be no need or scope for the application of s BG 1 in relation to those particular provisions. However, even if some part of an arrangement does not, on closer examination, comply with some particular provisions of the Act (without considering s BG 1), s BG 1 may still apply to the arrangement as a whole in relation to some other use or circumvention of the Act. If this was not the case, it might be argued that, as some part of the arrangement does not comply with one or more of the other provisions of the Act, this precludes the application of s BG 1 to the arrangement as a whole. 81. Authority for the position that s BG 1 can still apply in such cases can be found in Westpac at \[187\] to \[189\] where Harrison J said : \[187\] However, taking \[107\] as a whole and in context, I do not read Ben Nevis as mandating that the avoidance inquiry will not proceed unless the taxpayer shows that the use made of a specific provision is within its intended scope. I construe the first three sentences in \[107\] as reinforcing the court’s point made in \[106\] that proof of a taxpayer’s compliance with a specific provision does not exclude the scope for a wider inquiry into the arrangement as a whole. Wild J, when postulating a distinctive two-step inquiry, was apparently of the same opinion: BNZ Investments (No 2) at \[122\] and \[123\]. \[188\] An anomaly would arise otherwise; for example, a court might disallow a claim for a relatively minor deduction, thus barring it from proceeding to an avoidance inquiry into the transaction as a whole. That result would be contrary to the way the Commissioner has argued his case and to Miller v C of IR; Managed Fashions Ltd v C of IR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,961; \[1999\] 1 NZLR 275 (CA) at NZTC 13,977; NZLR 298–299. \[189\] There may be cases where the taxpayer’s misuse of a specific provision is so extreme or clear cut that a finding of tax avoidance will inevitably follow. But a wider inquiry will necessarily be appropriate where the arrangement involves a number of composite or interdependent steps, including the step which is the subject of a disputed deductibility claim. Its resolution will not normally be decisive of the avoidance inquiry. Summary 82. The approach to interpreting provisions of the Act should give proper effect to Parliament’s intention for those provisions. The approach is to ascertain the meaning of an enactment from its text and in the light of its purpose. This is done by giving the words their ordinary meaning and taking into account the purpose of the legislation and its context, and, where appropriate, extrinsic materials, in accordance with normal statutory interpretation principles. 83. The inquiry at this first stage will generally involve considering the application of specific provisions to particular parts of the arrangement. In contrast, the inquiry under s BG 1 considers whether the tax outcomes sought were within Parliament’s contemplation when viewed in light of the whole arrangement. The s BG 1 inquiry involves considering the Act as a whole (including any specific provisions). 84. The English courts’ approach to interpreting specific provisions that takes into account economic substance does not apply in New Zealand, unless Parliament has indicated in the particular section that a substance approach is to be adopted. However, it is clear that t his is the role of s BG 1. WITHDRAWN 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 85. It is open to the Commissioner to argue certain provisions of the Act do or do not apply and, in the alternative, that s BG 1 applies. Also, the fact that some part of an arrangement fails to comply with a specific provision does not preclude s BG 1 applying to the arrangement as a whole. WITHDRAWN 22 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] APPROACH TO SECTION BG 1 86. Section BG 1 provides: • a tax avoidance arrangement is void as against the Commissioner, and • the Commissioner may counteract a tax advantage obtained under the arrangement in accordance with Part G. 87. Under the legislation there are some key elements to applying ss BG 1 and GA 1: • arrangement; • tax avoidance; • tax avoidance arrangement; • section GA 1. ARRANGEMENT 88. Section BG 1 applies to a “tax avoidance arrangement”. The term “tax avoidance” will be considered later. The concept of an “arrangement” will be discussed first. 89. “Arrangement” is defined in s YA 1 as: means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. 90. Paragraphs 91 to 135 discuss issues related to the meaning of arrangement and its scope. Paragraphs 136 to 142 deal with analysing and understanding the arrangement. What is within the concept of “arrangement”? “Agreement, contract, plan, or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable” 91. The predecessor to the s YA 1 definition was discussed by Richardson P in BNZ Investments No 1 (CA). His Honour stated with respect to the definition of “arrangement” in s 9 9(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976: \[45\] The words contract, agreement, plan and understanding appear to be in descending order of formality. A contract is more formal than an agreement, and in ordinary usage is usually written while an agreement is generally more formal than a plan, and a plan more formal or more structured that an understanding. And it is accepted in the definition of arrangement that the contract, agreement, plan or understanding need not be enforceable. Section 99 thus contemplates arrangements which are binding only in honour. 92. Richardson P cited with approval the statement by the High Court of Australia in Bell v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1953) 87 CLR 548 that “arrangement” in an earlier Australian general anti-avoidance provision extended beyond contracts and agreements “so as to embrace all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or so as to produce a particular effect” (at \[46\]). His Honour noted that statements to similar effect were made in Newton, where Lord Denning stated (at 465) that the word “arrangement” under the then Australian general anti-avoidance provision: WITHDRAWN 23 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ...is apt to describe something less than a binding contract or agreement, something in the nature of an understanding between two or more persons – a plan arranged between them which may not be enforceable at law. 93. The definition of “arrangement” in s 99(1) of the 1976 Act considered by Richardson P in BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) differs from the definition of “arrangement” in s YA 1. The order of the words has been changed to be listed alphabetically in the 2007 Act (ie, “agreement” precedes “contract”). Despite this, the same observation can be made that the inclusion of the words “agreement, contract, plan, or understanding” mean that the term “arrangement” provides for varying degrees of enforceability and formality. As defined in s YA 1, an “arrangement” may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan that may or may not be legally enforceable, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. Accordingly, the term “arrangement” is defined widely to include all kinds of concerted action by which persons seek to bring about the fulfilment of a particular purpose or the production of a particular effect. It includes agreements, contracts, plans or understandings that are not intended to be legally binding, and arrangements that are unenforceable at law, for example, contracts unenforceable due to reasons of public policy, contractual incapacity or illegality. 94. The words in the definition “an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding” are in the singular. This does not mean that the “arrangement” must be located in a single document or transaction. It is clear that two or more documents or transactions may together amount to one “arrangement”. In Tayles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1982\] 2 NZLR 726 (CA), the appellant farmer executed three documents—a deed of trust, a deed of partnership and an agreement for the bailment of stock. McMullin J stated at 734: It follows that before that section can be said to have application to a particular case there must be an inquiry as to whether there has been an arrangement at all and, if so, what is its nature or purpose. It has never been the case for the taxpayers that the three documents executed by each did not amount to an arrangement. McMullin J examined the various individual transactions and documents in ascertaining the scope of the arrangement. His Honour held that the three documents combined constituted the arrangement. “Including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” 95. Section YA 1 defines the term “arrangement” as “including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect”. In Ben Nevis, the Supreme Court commented on the inclusion of these words at \[105\]: An arrangement includes all steps and transactions by which it is carried out. Thus, tax avoidance can be found in individual steps or, more often, in a combination of steps. Indeed, even if all the steps in an arrangement are unobjectionable in themselves, their combination may give rise to a tax avoidance arrangement. 96. To understand the meaning of the words “including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect”, it is helpful to look at their relationship with the other words in the definition: “means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding”. This requires considering the effect of the words “means” and “including” in the definition. 97. Us e of the words “means” and “including”, in the two parts of the definition, indicates that Parliament intended to distinguish between these WITHDRAWN 24 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] two parts of that definition: Burrows Statute Law in New Zealand at 419. In providing that “arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding” (emphasis added), the definition makes clear that it is exhaustive: BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) at \[121\] per Thomas J. Accordingly an “arrangement” must be “an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding”. 98. The word “including” indicates that the scope of any “arrangement” is extended to cover “all the steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect”. Given that the words “means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding” provide an exhaustive definition, a step or transaction by which the “arrangement” is carried into effect cannot itself be an “arrangement”. It also means that to come within the scope of the “arrangement”, the step or transaction must be related to the agreement, contract, plan, or understanding that constitutes the “arrangement”. 99. This interpretation is supported by the majority’s judgment in BNZ Investments No 1 (CA). In that decision, Richardson P rejected the submission that the words “including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” extended the term “arrangement” so as to include transactions that did not come within the agreement, contract, plan, or understanding reached by the parties. His Honour held that these words were concerned with the implementation of the established “contract, agreement, plan or understanding”, stating that “\[t\]he word ‘it’ in ‘by which it is carried into effect’ refers back to the applicable ‘arrangement’ and does not extend it” (at \[48\]). The Supreme Court in Penny (SC) implicitly recognised that a step is not in itself an arrangement at \[34\]. 100. The inclusion of the words “including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” reflects that the “agreement, contract, plan, or understanding” between the parties may not delineate all, or some of, the practical steps and transactions to be undertaken by the parties. The parties may have discretion as to how to discharge their obligations under the agreement, contract, plan or understanding. Therefore the definition makes clear that an “arrangement” encompasses the various actions undertaken to carry it out even if they are not delineated in the “agreement, contract, plan, or understanding”. This is consistent with Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Penny \[2010\] NZCA 231, \[2010\] 3 NZLR 360, where Randerson J stated: \[78\] I am satisfied that an “arrangement” is not limited to a specific transaction or agreement but may embrace a series of decisions and steps taken which together evidence and constitute an agreement, plan or understanding. Any such arrangement may be continued in each of the income years in question or may be varied from year to year. 101. The words “all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” may also have been included in the definition for the avoidance of doubt. 102. The practical effect of the words “including the steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” was illustrated in Hadlee v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1989\] 2 NZLR 447 (HC). In this decision, Eichelbaum CJ considered the arrangement involved three different transactions that were the steps by which the arrangement was carried into effect. The Chief Justice stated at 466: I do not doubt that what occurred here properly comes within the definition \[of arrangement\]. The assignment was one step in a package or scheme, properly seen WITHDRAWN 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] as a “plan”, prepared for the benefit of those partners who wished to take advantage of it, encompassing the following steps: 1 Establishment of a family trust in standard form; 2 Incorporation of Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd to act as trustee; 3 Execution of the assignment. On appeal the Court of Appeal approved the Chief Justice’s approach: Hadlee v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1991\] 3 NZLR 517 (CA), at 524. 103. In summary, the term “arrangement” provides for varying degrees of enforceability and formality. As defined in s YA 1, an “arrangement” may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan that may or may not be legally enforceable, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. Accordingly, the term “arrangement” is defined widely to include all kinds of concerted action by which persons seek to bring about the fulfilment of a particular purpose or the production of a particular effect. The words “including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” mean that the term “arrangement” covers the actions and transactions undertaken to implement the “agreement, contract, plan, or understanding”. These steps and transactions may or may not be specifically delineated in the “agreement, contract, plan, or understanding”. Practical Issues 104. Some practical aspects of the definition are commented on in the following paragraphs. These aspects are: • whether the definition includes unilateral “arrangements”; • the extent of consensus/understanding required to be party to an “arrangement”; • the circumstances in which two or more documents and transactions will be regarded as constituting one “arrangement”; • whether parts of an “arrangement” can be severed; and • extraterritorial limitations. Can there be unilateral “arrangements”? 105. An arrangement is defined to mean “an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding”. An issue in this context is whether a scheme or undertaking involving only one person can be an “arrangement”. W hile the use of the word “arrangement” is arguably more consistent with the situation where two or more persons enter into a transaction together, “arrangement” is defined to include a “plan”, which could apply to a single-person undertaking or scheme. 106. In Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2012\] NZCA 128, (2012) 25 NZTC 20-120, the Court of Appeal assumed a one-person plan could be an “arrangement”, upholding the view of Wylie J in the court below: \[54\] We agree with the Judge \[Wylie J\] that if consensus is needed, the appellant provided any necessary consensus for the purposes of the overall plan. The appellant orchestrated the whole arrangement. However, we note that the WITHDRAWN 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] statutory definition of “arrangement” does not require such consensus: a plan will suffice. Here the overall plan was that created, designed and executed by the appellant. We note also that an arrangement includes “all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect”. Again, no consensus is needed. \[Emphasis added\] 107. Additionally, Wylie J in the High Court decision in Russell (HC) stated in a footnote that a plan could be devised and carried out by one person (see Russell (HC) at footnote 33 to \[101\]). 108. In the Taxation Review Authority decision in Case G43 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,163, Sheppard DJ suggested that the word “plan” in the definition of “arrangement” might apply to a course of action involving only one person (at 1,168): ... the definition of “arrangement” supplied by sec 99(1) expressly gives a meaning which includes “any ... plan”. Although the other meanings (contract, agreement, understanding) imply participation by two or more persons, “plan” does not. The relevant meaning given to the word “plan” in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (3rd edition) is: “A scheme of action ... the way in which it is proposed to carry out some proceeding.” Such a scheme or way can be devised and adopted by a single person acting alone. However, what the objector did in this case was not only done by him alone without the participation of any other person, it was scarcely a scheme of action or the way in which it was proposed to carry out some proceeding; it did not involve any number of steps or transactions. 109. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers the law to be that a plan undertaken by one person could amount to an “arrangement”. Extent of consensus/understanding required to be party to an “arrangement” 110. In some cases, the evidence will indicate that the taxpayer knew, and agreed with, all of the relevant transactions carried out by another person that are part of a “tax avoidance arrangement”. Accordingly, that taxpayer will be considered to be party to an “arrangement” that encompasses all those transactions. This will be so even if the taxpayer is unaware that the transactions constitute “tax avoidance”, or if the taxpayer genuinely or reasonably believed that the transactions did not constitute “tax avoidance”: Peterson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2005\] UKPC 5, \[2006\] 3 NZLR 433 at \[34\] per Lord Millett; BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) at \[52\], \[127\]–\[128\], \[172\]. 111. In other situations the taxpayer may argue that it was unaware of, and therefore did not agree to, some or all of the transactions that were carried out by another person and which constitute tax avoidance. The taxpayer may argue that accordingly it should not be considered to be party to an “arrangement” that encompasses those transactions. 112. This type of submission was considered by the Court of Appeal in BNZ Investments No 1 (CA). The taxpayer argued it was a party to an “arrangement” with another party involving certain transactions, but this “arrangement” did not encompass other transactions undertaken by the other party. The taxpayer argued this was so because it was unaware of what the other party intended to do in carrying out those other transactions. The majority of the Court of Appeal accepted this argument WITHDRAWN 27 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and held that the taxpayer was not party to an “arrangement” that encompassed those other transactions. 113. However, Thomas J rejected this argument in his dissenting judgment. His Honour considered that a taxpayer may be party to an “arrangement” regardless of whether it can be reasonably considered as having authorised or accepted the mechanism used by the other party. Thomas J considered there could be an “arrangement” even if the taxpayer is innocent, in the sense of lacking conscious involvement in, or awareness of, the tax avoidance transaction or steps (at \[127\] and \[131\]). 114. Thomas J considered such innocence was not relevant, as the definition did not incorporate any reference to such matters. The definition of “arrangement” indicated that only the effect of the agreement, contract, plan or understanding (or any combination of these) was relevant. It did not contain any suggestion that the taxpayer must be privy to both the plan or understanding and the steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect (at \[119\]–\[127\]). 115. Importantly, the majority of the Privy Council in Peterson (PC) endorsed the approach of Thomas J, in preference to that of the majority. Delivering the majority’s judgment in Peterson, Lord Millett stated at \[34\]: Their Lordships do not consider that the “arrangement” requires a consensus or meeting of minds; the taxpayer need not be a party to “the arrangement” and in their view he need not be privy to its details either. On this point they respectfully prefer the dissenting judgment of Thomas J in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v BNZ Investments Ltd. 116. In Ben Nevis, the Supreme Court noted the different approaches taken in Peterson (PC) and BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) (see Ben Nevis at \[160\]). The court stated that “it is unnecessary for us to decide whether to depart from that aspect of the Privy Council’s judgment in Peterson in this case” (at \[161\]). 117. Consequently, in the Commissioner’s view the legal position remains as stated by the Privy Council in Peterson, and therefore, the term “arrangement” in s BG 1 does not require consensus or a meeting of minds. 118. As an aside, i t is worth observing that the practical effect of the different approaches in BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) should not be overstated. A taxpayer may still be liable to an income adjustment under s GA 1(2) even if the taxpayer is not considered to be party to an “arrangement” under the more restrictive approach of the majority in BNZ Investments No 1 (CA). If there is a “tax avoidance arrangement” under s BG 1 and the taxpayer, as a “person affected”, has obtained a “tax advantage ... from or under the arrangement”, s GA 1(2) authorises the Commissioner to adjust the taxpayer’s taxable income to counteract the tax advantage. This point was emphasised in Peterson (PC) by both the majority (at \[34\]) and the minority (at \[59\]) of the Privy Council, and is clear from the words of the statute. When two or more documents and transactions will be regarded as constituting one “arrangement" 119. As already noted, two or more documents and transactions may together constitute an “arrangement” for s BG 1 purposes: see paragraph 94 WITHDRAWN 28 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] above. In Peterson (PC), the Privy Council stated that whether two or more transactions or documents together constitute an “arrangement” is a matter of fact (at \[33\]). The following paragraphs consider the circumstances in which this will occur. 120. This issue can be seen as following directly from the question of whether all of the parts are to be properly regarded as a single agreement, contract, plan or understanding. In some cases, the courts have found it useful to test whether documents and transactions should be together considered a single “arrangement” by looking at whether they are sufficiently interrelated and/or interdependent to constitute a single “agreement, contract, plan or understanding”. This requires consideration of the nature and extent of the relationship between the documents and transactions. 121. In Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd \[1971\] NZLR 641 (PC) \[Europa No 1\], the Privy Council considered whether six agreements should be considered together as constituting a single interrelated complex of agreements. The Privy Council held that the agreements were “far too close, and far too carefully worked out” to isolate and treat the agreements as “a series of independent bargains”. The objective evidence showed an “intimate connection” between the agreements. They were made on the same date and some of them contained references to the other agreements. The agreements indicated that one party never intended to bind itself without entering into the other agreements. The effect of one of the agreements was to enable one party to sue for any breach of the other agreements. Their Lordships concluded at 651– 652: The documents therefore, in their Lordships’ opinion, point unequivocally towards an interdependence of obligations and benefits under a complex of contracts which, though embodied in separate documents represents one contractual whole \[....\] — that the contractual arrangements were interdependent, one on the other. 122. In other decisions, the courts have held that two or more transactions were not sufficiently linked so as to constitute an “arrangement”. These decisions suggest that two or more transactions are not regarded as constituting an “arrangement” simply because one person is party to both transactions and entered into one transaction as a result of the other. 123. AMP Life Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC) is authority for the proposition that a sequence of events will not constitute an “arrangement” merely because one follows the other and/or they are causally related. The Commissioner submitted, in that case, that there was an “arrangement” between AMP and AFS (a subsidiary) that had the following steps: • AMP and its various subsidiaries (including AFS) grouping losses (incurred as a result of the 1987 share market crash) and claiming deductions for these in the income year to 31 March 1988; • AMP’s subscription for capital in AFS in December 1989; • AMP’s sale of its shares in AFS to AMP Discount Corporation in October 1992; and • AMP’s claiming of a deduction for the loss on the disposal of the AFS shares. WITHDRAWN 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 124. The High Court rejected the Commissioner’s submission. McGechan J held that a “mere sequence of events, each with knock-on causative consequences” does not constitute an “arrangement” (at \[125\]). His Honour stated that the “concepts of contract, agreement, plan or understanding predicate some prior planned linking or sequencing or both”. The legislation was not “aimed at simple sequences of events ... without prior overall planning” (at \[126\]). 125. On the evidence, McGechan J held there was an absence of some prior planned linking and/or sequencing between the four transactions identified by the Commissioner. His Honour stated at \[126\]: There were trading losses by the subsidiaries. They are not of course alleged to be part of the arrangement, but set the scene. AMP then procured the deduction for its own benefit of those trading losses. ... There is no direct evidence AMP planned, at the time it took the s 191 deductions, to capitalise the loss-making subsidiaries and to procure repayment of debt in the way which eventually occurred. ... Much more importantly however, there is no direct evidence or room for inference on balance of probabilities that at the time AMP took the benefit of s 191 deductions AMP planned not only capitalisation and debt repayment, but also dissolution of AFS, or sale followed by dissolution of AFS. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. AMP did not need to have such plans at the time of the s 191 deductions. Its plans, if any, for AFS and the other subsidiaries were a further and distinct issue which could await developments. .... On the evidence, not contested by the Commissioner, AMP did take its time. On 15 December 1989 AFS subsidiaries were transferred to AMP, and AFS became moribund. Considerably later, “at some stage during 1992” (in or before April 1992) it was decided AMP no longer needed to retain AFS. This was a new decision. The timing was not challenged by the Commissioner in evidence. It was not, for example, suggested that all this involved carefully staged waiting so as to give the appearance of staged and separate decisions. AFS then resolved to dissolve on 9 April 1992. Then, at some stage in April 1992 after the resolution for winding up, AMP became aware of a possible technical issue as to deductibility under s 204C in event of liquidation; and commencing 4 August 1992 the decision was made to interpose a sale within the group, eventually effected 14 October 1992. \[Emphasis added\] These circumstances indicated that the four transactions identified by the Commissioner were only “a sequence of events” and could not be “strained to fit within concepts involving overall planning such as contracts, agreements, plans or understanding”. 126. Courtney J, in Krukziener v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 3) (2010) 24 NZTC 24,563 (HC), approved of the approach in AMP Life, saying: \[6\] In AMP Life v CIR, McGechan J held that the discrete steps relied on by the Commissioner in that case, as amounting to an arrangement, were not sufficient because: They are a mere sequence of events, each with knock-on causative consequences, but that situation does not suffice. The concepts of contract, agreement, plan or understanding predicate some prior planned linking or sequencing or both, and that element is missing. \[7\] In the present case, referring to AMP Life, the TRA correctly identified the need for an arrangement to be more than merely discrete steps, observing that: These transactions must apply in a concerted way as part of a predetermined end. 127. In summary, whether two or more documents and transactions will be regarded as constituting one “arrangement” will depend on the facts and whether they can properly be regarded as part of the relevant “agreement, contract, plan or understanding”. In many cases, this might be tested by WITHDRAWN 30 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] asking if there is sufficient interrelatedness and/or interdependence between them so that they can be regarded as an “arrangement”. It will not be sufficient that one person is a party to both transactions. A mere sequence of events will not be sufficient unless there is some element of prior planning linking or sequencing the events. Whether parts of an “arrangement” can be severed 128. Another practical issue arises where an arrangement consists of several smaller transactions. The issue is whether one of these smaller transactions can, of itself, be an “arrangement”. This can be an important distinction in practice. Taking a wider or narrower view of related transactions may impact on whether a conclusion is reached that there is a tax avoidance arrangement. 129. The definition of “arrangement” does not provide that part of an “arrangement” is itself an “arrangement”. However, the fact that a transaction is part of a wider “arrangement” does not preclude that transaction being considered as a separate, narrower “arrangement” under s BG 1. A transaction c ould be considered separately if, by itself, it satisfies the definition of “arrangement”, being an “agreement, contract, plan or understanding”. This is recognised by the majority’s judgment in Peterson (PC). In that decision, Lord Millett stated at \[33\]: Their Lordships consider that the Commissioner is entitled at his option to identify the whole or any part or parts of a single composite scheme as the “contract, agreement, plan or understanding” which constitutes the “arrangement” f or the purpose of s 99. 130. If, on the other hand, part of an arrangement does not, by itself, satisfy the definition of “arrangement”, that part cannot be considered separately under s BG 1. In Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Dandelion Investments Ltd (2001) 20 NZTC 17,293 (HC), Tompkins J stated: \[88\] In considering the application of s 99, it is the overall effect of the arrangement that needs to be considered, not each discrete transaction that makes up the arrangement. 131. Similarly, in Case U6 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,038, the Taxation Review Authority stated at 9,059: ... the offending transaction must be treated as a whole. It is impermissible to attempt to sever parts of it ... and characterise them as infringing s 99. Either this is an arrangement which is caught by s 99 or it is not. 132. This approach is consistent with the approach taken by the High Court of Australia under the general anti-avoidance provision in Part IVA of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth): see, for example, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart \[2004\] HCA 26, (2006) 217 CLR 216 at \[55\] and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 383. 133. In summary, s BG 1 can apply to part of an arrangement if that part is itself an “arrangement” within the meaning in the Act. Extraterritorial limitations 134. Sometimes arrangements involve steps or transactions carried out or brought into effect wholly or partly outside New Zealand. This raises a WITHDRAWN 31 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] question about whether s BG 1 applies to such arrangements. No extraterritorial limitation appears in the relevant provisions. Therefore, any arrangement that has a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of avoiding New Zealand income tax is void under s BG 1 irrespective of where it is entered into or carried out. To this effect, McGechan J in BNZ Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2000) 19 NZTC 15,732 (HC) \[BNZ Investments No 1 (HC)\] stated at \[123\]: While he \[the Commissioner\] must respect the building blocks of a transaction, foreign made, for what they are, that does not preclude his coming to a view that what has occurred abroad could have a purpose or effect of avoidance of income tax in New Zealand. What is done abroad is done abroad, but can still be part of an ‘arrangement’ with the purpose or effect of tax avoidance in New Zealand, with s 99 applicable to elements or consequences in New Zealand accordingly. \[Emphasis added\] 135. Accordingly, s BG 1 applies to a tax avoidance arrangement even if the arrangement is carried out or brought into effect outside of New Zealand. Analysing and understanding the arrangement 136. The preceding discussion has considered some legal aspects of the definition of “arrangement”, including what is within the scope of an “arrangement”, and some practical aspects of the meaning of the term. 137. The next few paragraphs discuss how an arrangement is analysed so as to fully understand it. In some cases, arrangements may be very complex and difficult to understand, or aspects of the arrangement may be unclear when first examined. The aim is to fully understand all pertinent facts and information relating to the arrangement, and the effects of the whole transaction must be known. 138. This will include gaining an understanding of the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives of the arrangement. Useful questions in this regard may include asking what benefits were sought in return for amounts paid, why the arrangement was structured the way it was, and what commercial outcomes were achieved. Initially, it may be helpful to be aware of this type of information to help understand the arrangement in its context, even though some of it may not ultimately be relevant when analysing the application of s BG 1 . Such information might include facts that are outside the arrangement, such as the surrounding circumstances, the history of the transaction and statements by those involved. 139. The emphasis on gathering and examining all of the facts can also be seen in the approach of the courts. Wild J in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC) undertook an extensive analysis of the facts before considering the application of s BG 1—see \[11\]–\[106\]. In Westpac, Harrison J took into account evidence from employees who were involved in negotiating and implementing transactions that were the subject of a s BG 1 inquiry (at \[44\]): Their accounts provided a linking narrative, supplementing and explaining the picture available from the primary documents, and were relevant to an assessment of the commercial or economic realities of aspects of the transactions. 140. How to decide what is relevant in analysing whether there is tax avoidance and whether any tax avoidance is merely incidental to a non-tax purpose will be explained later. In short, information will be relevant to reaching a WITHDRAWN 32 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] view on whether there is tax avoidance if it objectively establishes the commercial and economic reality and relates to the particular use of the Act by the arrangement. Information will be relevant to the “not merely incidental” test if it evidences a non-tax avoidance purpose that explains the particular structure of the arrangement. Tax effects 141. The task of identifying and understanding an arrangement will include identifying the tax effects and tax provisions at issue (for example, see Ben Nevis at \[116\] and Westpac at \[56\]). Understanding how the arrangement interacts with the Act will help to gain an understanding of the role of the steps and transactions in the arrangement and also the overall effects of the arrangement. It may also be that the subsequent analysis of the arrangement identifies additional potentially relevant provisions, the tax effects of which will then need to be understood. 142. Also, as discussed above from paragraph 47, some tax avoidance arrangements have the effect of positively utilising provisions, while others may have the effect that certain provisions do not apply. When identifying the tax effects, therefore, these might relate either to particular provisions used by the arrangement, or to any potentially relevant provisions that do not apply to the arrangement. Summary of principles concerning “arrangement” 143. To summarise, for s BG 1 the relevant principles when considering whether an “arrangement” exists and determining its scope, are as follows: • The definition of “arrangement” in s YA 1 provides for varying degrees of enforceability and formality. An “arrangement” may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan that may or may not be legally enforceable, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. Accordingly, the term “arrangement” is defined widely to cover the various means by which persons may indicate their agreement to bring about the fulfilment of a particular purpose or the production of a particular effect (BNZ Investments No 1 (CA), Newton, Bell). • The definition of “arrangement” provides that it extends to include “all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect”. These steps and transactions may not be delineated in the “agreement, contract, plan or understanding”. The word “it” in “by which it is carried into effect” refers back to the applicable “arrangement”. It does not extend the “arrangement” by including steps and transactions that are not concerned with the implementation of the “agreement, contract, plan or understanding” (Ben Nevis, BNZ Investments No 1 (CA), Penny (SC) and (CA), Hadlee (HC)). • An action or transaction undertaken by one person can constitute an “arrangement” (Russell (HC) and (CA), Case G43). • Where the taxpayer knew, and agreed with, all of the relevant transactions that amount to tax avoidance carried out by another person, the taxpayer will be considered to be party to an “arrangement” that encompasses all those transactions. This is so even if the taxpayer is unaware that the transactions constitute tax avoidance or if the taxpayer genuinely or reasonably believed that WITHDRAWN 33 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the transactions did not constitute tax avoidance (Peterson (PC), BNZ Investments No 1 (CA)). • A taxpayer may be considered party to an “arrangement” even if the taxpayer did not know all, or some of, the details or mechanisms by which the “agreement, contract, plan or understanding” would be carried out by another person (Peterson (PC), BNZ Investments No 1 (CA), Ben Nevis). • Whether two or more documents or transactions may together constitute an “arrangement” will depend on the facts, and whether they can be properly regarded as part of the relevant “agreement, contract, plan or understanding”. This requires that they are more than a “mere sequence of events, each with knock-on causative consequences” (Tayles (CA), Peterson (PC), AMP Life, Europa No 1, Krukziener). • A part of an “arrangement” may be considered separately under s BG 1 only if that part, by itself, satisfies the definition of “arrangement” (Peterson (PC), Dandelion (HC), Case U6, Hart, Peabody). • Section BG 1 applies to a tax avoidance arrangement whether or not the arrangement is carried out or brought into effect in New Zealand (BNZ Investments No 1 (HC)). 144. When considering an actual arrangement, it is important to fully understand the arrangement, taking into account all pertinent facts and information relating to it, including the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives. Understanding the arrangement will also involve identifying the tax effects and the provisions at issue. WITHDRAWN 34 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENT Statutory terms Introduction 145. Like “arrangement”, “tax avoidance arrangement” is also a defined term. The court in Ben Nevis described it as the key statutory concept: \[105\] The key statutory concept in the general anti-avoidance provision is of a tax avoidance arrangement, as Parliament has defined it. By means of the definition of “tax avoidance”, a tax avoidance arrangement includes an arrangement which directly or indirectly alters the incidence of any income tax. It is arrangements of that and allied kinds which are void against the Commissioner under s BG 1(1). An arrangement includes all steps and transactions by which it is carried out. Thus, tax avoidance can be found in individual steps or, more often, in a combination of steps. Indeed, even if all the steps in an arrangement are unobjectionable in themselves, their combination may give rise to a tax avoidance arrangement. 146. “Tax avoidance arrangement” is defined in s YA 1 as follows: tax avoidance arrangement means an arrangement, whether entered into by the person affected by the arrangement or by another person, that directly or indirectly— (a) has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or (b) has tax avoidance as 1 of its purposes or effects, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings, if the tax avoidance purpose or effect is not merely incidental. 147. Thus, a tax avoidance arrangement is an arrangement that has a purpose or effect of tax avoidance that is more than merely incidental. “Tax avoidance” is itself defined in s YA 1 as follows: tax avoidance includes— (a) directly or indirectly altering the incidence of any income tax: (b) directly or indirectly relieving a person from liability to pay income tax or from a potential or prospective liability to future income tax: (c) directly or indirectly avoiding, postponing, or reducing any liability to income tax or any potential or prospective liability to future income tax. 148. The Commissioner’s view is that Parliament’s purpose in enacting the definition of “tax avoidance” was to confirm or clarify that certain circumstances will constitute tax avoidance, rather than to provide a comprehensive definition of what constitutes tax avoidance. This is supported by the fact that, i n establishing whether there is tax avoidance, the courts (including the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis) have typically come to a conclusion without embarking on any detailed analysis of the statutory definition of “tax avoidance” and, at times, have not referred to the definition at all. 149. The next section of this statement deals briefly with the role and wording of the statutory definition of “tax avoidance”. It also discusses the meaning of “purpose or effect” in the definition of “tax avoidance arrangement”, before considering in detail the Supreme Court’s approach in Ben Nevis to determining if an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement. WITHDRAWN 35 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The statutory definition of “tax avoidance” 150. Prior to 1974, the statutory provision relating to tax avoidance (s 108 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954) was an exhaustive definition of “tax avoidance”. In Marx v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1970\] NZLR 182 (CA), at 194, North P recognised the deficiencies of the section and suggested that approaches to the words in the section should not involve “critical refinements and subtle distinctions” and the “obvious and popular meaning of the language should be preferred”. As a result of uncertainties such as these about the scope of the words of the section, the courts tended to read down the provision. In 1974, the Act was amended to refer to “tax avoidance” and to provide that “tax avoidance” includes certain things. By amending the definition of “tax avoidance” to make it inclusive rather than exclusive, Parliament ensured the definition includes the “obvious and popular meaning” of “tax avoidance” consistent with North P in Marx. These amendments are also consistent with Parliament’s intention to prevent the section being read down and to give it full effect. 151. Accordingly, the present statutory definition of “tax avoidance” is worded so that it “includes” certain things, rather than the definition being an exhaustive one (see Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 1) (1997) 18 NZTC 13,001 (HC) at 13,033 and Challenge (CA) at 541). 152. The definition contains three paragraphs, each of which lists aspects that are within the defined meaning of the term “tax avoidance”. Some words in the paragraphs, such as “avoiding ... tax” or “relieving a person from a liability to pay income tax”, do not seem to add anything to what would commonly be understood to be meant by the term “tax avoidance”. Other phrases, such as including a “potential or prospective liability to future income tax”, might be considered to add to the ordinary meaning. 153. These features raise the issue of whether the definition is intended to form the basis of what is “tax avoidance” or whether it has been left to the courts to largely give meaning to the term. In the Commissioner’s view, the approach of the courts is very strongly indicative of the latter proposition. 154. In the majority of the decisions prior to Ben Nevis, the courts have discussed the meaning of tax avoidance without undertaking a detailed analysis of the various limbs of the statutory definition—see, for example, Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2001\] 3 NZLR 316 (PC), Peterson (PC) and Dandelion Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2003\] 1 NZLR 600 (CA). 155. In Ben Nevis, the Supreme Court said it would settle the approach to s BG 1 (at \[100\]). It did this by outlining the Parliamentary contemplation test for determining whether an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement (discussed below). The court did not consider it necessary to analyse the statutory definition of tax avoidance to determine what constituted tax avoidance. Although the majority in Ben Nevis briefly referred to the definition (see Ben Nevis at \[105\], set out at paragraph 145 above), there was no discussion of the definition in the decision. The court simply went on to use the opening words of the definition by stating at \[156\]: Having regard to the various features of the arrangement we have discussed, our conclusion is that the appellants’ use of the specific provisions was not within Parliament’s purpose and contemplation when it authorised deductions of the kinds WITHDRAWN 36 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] in question. The appellants altered the incidence of income tax by means of a tax avoidance arrangement which the Commissioner correctly treated as void against him. \[Emphasis added\] 156. Rather than base its decision on the definition of “tax avoidance”, the court set out the approach to be adopted to determine whether there is tax avoidance: \[101\] In doing so we keep in mind that the present form of the general anti-avoidance provision remains largely the same as that adopted in 1974, when Parliament chose, in reframing the then s 108, not to specify with any particularity the kind of arrangements to which it would apply. This was left to the courts to work out. Parliament did not regard it as inconsistent with the judicial function for the courts to decide which arrangements, having a purpose or effect of saving tax, would be caught by the amended general anti-avoidance provision. Of greater legislative concern was that however carefully the general provision might be drafted, the results of taxpayers’ ingenuity in adapting the forms in which they did business could not be predicted. 157. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal in Alesco New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZCA 40 was even more explicit that the question of whether there is tax avoidance is answered by inquiring into whether the particular use of the Act was within Parliament’s contemplation rather than by reference to the statutory definition (at \[25\]). Other decisions delivered since Ben Nevis also have not treated the statutory definition of “tax avoidance” as being of importance in determining whether an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement— see, for example, Penny (CA) and (SC), Westpac, BNZ Investments No 2, Krukziener, Russell (CA) and (HC) and White v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2010) 24 NZTC 24,600 (HC). Although these cases quote the statutory definition, there is no analysis of it. Instead, the courts adopt the Ben Nevis approach and consider what Parliament would have contemplated for the use of the provisions and the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement before them to determine if there is tax avoidance. 158. Therefore, the Commissioner considers the Parliamentary contemplation test set out by the Supreme Court is the primary test to be applied to determine whether an arrangement involves tax avoidance (discussed in detail at paragraphs 210 to 394 below). 159. The courts sometimes incorporate some of the words from the definition in their judgments, but do not analyse them further. See, for example, the quote from Ben Nevis at paragraph 155 above. In Westpac, Harrison J concluded at \[619\]: In my judgment Koch and the other three transactions were tax avoidance arrangements. Their primary or a substantial purpose was to reduce the incidence of the bank’s liability to tax. \[Emphasis added\] 160. Similarly in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), Wild J concluded at \[526\]: The transactions had the purpose or effect of substantially altering the incidence of tax for the BNZ. \[Emphasis added\] 161. Randerson J in Penny (CA) also concluded that the identified arrangements had the purpose or effect of altering the incidence of income tax (at WITHDRAWN 37 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[112\]). See also Penny (SC) at \[50\], Krukziener at \[58\] and Russell (HC) at \[115\]–\[116\]. 162. In summary, Parliament has not exhaustively defined the meaning of “tax avoidance”. Instead, as the court said in Ben Nevis, Parliament left it to the courts to identify tax avoidance. The Commissioner’s opinion, therefore, is that the function of the definition is to confirm that certain defined circumstances are not excluded from the scope of tax avoidance. Some of the words used provide no particular guidance, such as specific inclusion of the words “avoiding ... tax”, and are merely confirmatory in nature. There is nothing to be gained in analysing those words and this statement will not do so. Other words in the definition are included to confirm or even to extend the ordinary meaning of “tax avoidance” so as to make clear that certain things are included in the term when it is used in the section. 163. One example is the inclusion of future tax liabilities, and some comment on that may be helpful. It might be thought that all tax avoidance involves avoiding future liabilities because, as was pointed out in Marx, once a liability is determined for a taxpayer, it is no longer possible to avoid it. The Privy Council in Newton said the section applied to arrangements entered into for the purpose of avoiding future income tax (at 464). If a taxpayer was already liable for an amount of tax and the tax was not paid, that would be a matter of evasion, not avoidance. To give the words in the definition some meaning, therefore, the Commissioner considers the inclusion of “future liabilities” must have been intended to ensure an arrangement that would result in avoiding tax some time in the future is a tax avoidance arrangement. This is in addition to arrangements where tax is avoided in the short term. An instance of a tax avoidance arrangement that may affect future liability is an arrangement that involves accumulating tax losses. If the taxpayer is not able to set off losses in the current year, but does so in a future year, then there may not be any tax avoided in the current year. However, there can still be tax avoidance because the taxpayer’s future liability may potentially be avoided. 164. Although it will not be necessary to work through the statutory definition of tax avoidance in every case, there must still be some income tax actually or potentially avoided by a taxpayer for the section to apply. Section BG 1 is concerned with the avoidance of income tax and, o n the ordinary meaning of the word “avoidance”, there would need to be an alteration of the tax liability of at least one taxpayer. The purpose of the section is also consistent with this view. The purpose of s BG 1 is to prevent parties altering or bringing about a tax position where this involves the use of provisions falling outside their intended scope in the overall scheme of the Act. The need for there to be a change in tax is accepted by all courts considering the application of the section; see, for example, at \[101\] of Ben Nevis: “\[Parliament left it to\] the courts to decide which arrangements, having a purpose or effect of saving tax, would be caught by the amended general anti-avoidance provision”; and at \[106\]: “ The general provision is designed to avoid the fiscal effect of tax avoidance arrangements having a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance”. \[Emphasis added\] 165. It should also be noted that absolute certainty of the amount and timing of the tax avoided is not needed for the section to apply. This is clear WITHDRAWN 38 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] because the definition of “tax avoidance” includes a potential or prospective liability to future income tax. Whether establishing “tax avoidance” requires identifying a specific alternative fact situation 166. It is sometimes argued that the legislative concept of “tax avoidance” inherently involves a comparison between the tax outcomes of an alleged tax avoidance arrangement and some other specific identified alternative fact situation. That other factual situation may be a hypothetical alternative arrangement the taxpayer could have entered into (sometimes referred to as a “counterfactual”) or it may be what might have otherwise arisen had the arrangement not been entered into. 167. There is no mention at all in the words of s BG 1 about a requirement to identify a specific counterfactual. That contrasts with s GA 1(4), which provides that the Commissioner may identify a counterfactual for that section. However, even in s GA 1(4), reference to a counterfactual is at the Commissioner’s discretion. 168. Establishing whether there is tax avoidance requires identifying whether the provisions of the Act apply to the arrangement in the way Parliament contemplated. (The Parliamentary contemplation test is discussed later from paragraph 210). As will be discussed, reaching a view on this is an inquiry about the use of the Act, given the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement, and does not involve identifying what a taxpayer would have otherwise done. 169. New Zealand courts have not relied upon counterfactuals to reach a view on the application of s BG 1. Rather, following the Supreme Court decision in Ben Nevis, the courts apply the Parliamentary contemplation test to reach a view on whether there is tax avoidance. See, for example, the approach of the courts in Penny (SC), Russell (CA ), BNZ Investments No 2 (CA) and Westpac. Nothing in any of these cases supports the view that the Parliamentary contemplation test requires identifying a counterfactual and subsequently the Court of Appeal has rejected an argument based on identifying a counterfactual on the basis it has no legal ground (see Alesco (CA) at \[38\]–\[40\]). 170. This approach can be contrasted with the approach in Australia. The Australian legislation explicitly provides that reference may be made to what might reasonably be expected to have occurred. 171. It is sometimes argued that it is implicit in the words “potential or prospective liability to future income tax” in the statutory definition of “tax avoidance” that a comparison is needed with hypothetical tax outcomes. In the Commissioner’s view, this element of foreseeability relates to the tax outcomes for the arrangement actually entered into that are yet to arise. It is not a case of looking to the tax outcomes of some alternative arrangement. 172. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that in New Zealand there is no requirement to identify a counterfactual in reaching a view on whether s BG 1 applies. WITHDRAWN 39 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Purpose or effect 173. One more aspect of the relevant statutory definitions will now be considered before the Parliamentary contemplation test is discussed. The definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” states: tax avoidance arrangement means an arrangement, whether entered into by the person affected by the arrangement or by another person, that directly or indirectly— (a) has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or (b) has tax avoidance as 1 of its purposes or effects, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings, if the tax avoidance purpose or effect is not merely incidental 174. An arrangement will therefore be a tax avoidance arrangement if the arrangement has a purpose or effect of tax avoidance. The following paragraphs discuss what is meant by “purpose or effect” in this context. Objective test 175. The courts have held that the “purpose or effect” of an arrangement is determined objectively and the motive of the parties is irrelevant. The Privy Council in Ashton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1975\] 2 NZLR 717 (PC) agreed with the earlier Privy Council decision in Newton, stating at 721: In Newton v Commissioner of Taxation \[1958\] AC 450; \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 the Privy Council had to consider s 260 of the Commonwealth of Australia Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936–1951, a section very similar to s 108. In that case Lord Denning delivering the judgment of the Board said: “The word ‘purpose’ means, not motive but the effect which it is sought to achieve — the end in view. The word ‘effect’ means the end accomplished or achieved. The whole set of words denotes concerted action to an end — the end of avoiding tax” (ibid, 465; 763). And: “... the section is not concerned with the motives of individuals. It is not concerned with their desire to avoid tax, but only with the means which they employ to do it. It affects every ‘contract, agreement or arrangement’ (which their Lordships will henceforward refer to compendiously as ‘arrangement’) which has the purpose or effect of avoiding tax. In applying the section you must, by the very words of it, look at the arrangement itself and see which is its effect — which it does — irrespective of the motives of the persons who made it. Williams J put it well when he said: ‘The purpose of a contract, agreement or arrangement must be what it is intended to effect and that intention must be ascertained from its terms. Those terms may be oral or written or may have to be inferred from the circumstances but, when they have been ascertained, their purpose must be what they effect’” (\[1958\] AC 450, 465). These observations of Lord Denning in relation to s 260 of the Australian Act are equally applicable to s 108. 176. The Privy Council in Ashton (PC) agreed with the Court of Appeal (Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ashton \[1974\] 2 NZLR 321 (CA)) that evidence of the parties’ purpose was not relevant. McCarthy P, delivering the Court of Appeal judgment, concluded that Wilson J in the High Court would probably have thought the facts were sufficiently indicative of a tax avoidance purpose had it not been for the oral evidence of the taxpayers that the predominant purpose of the arrangement was to provide security for the taxpayers’ families (see 721 (PC) and 327 (CA)). The taxpayers WITHDRAWN 40 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] had given evidence of the motives that had actuated them, especially of their wish to provide for their families. However, the Court of Appeal confirmed the test was an objective one and excluded reliance on much of the evidence that had influenced Wilson J. The purpose of an arrangement must be determined by what the transaction effects and motive is irrelevant. The Privy Council specifically approved the Court of Appeal’s view. 177. The interpretation of the words “purpose or effect” remains the same following Ben Nevis. Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 116, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359 was a decision of the Supreme Court on GST avoidance and was given on the same day as the decision in Ben Nevis with a very similarly constituted court. Like the Privy Council in Ashton (PC) and Newton, the Supreme Court in Glenharrow also emphasised that it is the purpose of the arrangement that is relevant, and not the purpose of the parties. The court found the same objective test applied and relied on income tax cases to support its views on purpose. It is also significant that the court stated in Glenharrow a t \[38\]: ... the general anti-avoidance provision was concerned not with the purpose of the parties, but with the purpose of the arrangement. That is a crucial distinction. Once you put the purpose of the parties to one side and seek by objective examination to find the purpose of the arrangement, you must necessarily do that by considering the effect which the arrangement has had — what it has achieved — and then, by working backwards as it were from the effect, you are able to determine what objectively the arrangement must be taken to have had as its purpose. That approach is inevitable once any subjective purpose or motive is ruled out of contention, as the authorities say it must be. 178. The court in Glenharrow commented, as the Privy Council had in Ashton, that it is not relevant whether the taxpayers had an intention of avoiding tax (see Glenharrow at \[39\]). 179. Although Glenharrow concerned s 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and not s BG 1, it is helpful in considering s BG 1. The approach in Glenharrow has also since been adopted in both GST and income tax cases—see, for example, Penny (CA) at \[66\]–\[68\], Westpac at \[198\]– \[200\], and Krukziener at \[32\]. 180. The Court of Appeal decision in Tayles illustrates a court distinguishing between subjective and objective evidence, and excluding the subjective evidence when considering the avoidance provision. The taxpayers’ counsel argued that the arrangements were ordinary business dealings to limit the taxpayers’ liability for estate duty, to make provision for dependants, to provide incentives for their sons to take over the farm, and to provide vehicles for gifting. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and confirmed that the court was only concerned with what was achieved as a result of the arrangement and not the motivation or intentions for entering into it. The court found that the objective purposes of the arrangement were: • to create a suitable medium for the transfer of the farms; • to peg the value of the taxpayers’ interests in the farms to 1965 prices; • to peg the number of stock owned by the farms to 1965 prices; and • to shift into the hands of the trusts part of the income that would ordinarily fall to be enjoyed by the taxpayers. WITHDRAWN 41 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The court concluded that the arrangement was implemented in the particular way it was so as to avoid tax. 181. It has been suggested that the courts take subjective evidence into account when assessing the purpose or effect of an arrangement. The Commissioner’s view is that the courts still apply an objective test but may on occasion refer to subjective evidence in the course of their judgments. As seen in Glenharrow and Ben Nevis, the leading authorities remain clear the test is objective. In Ben Nevis, the Supreme Court observed (at \[102\]) that the approach necessitated: ... focusing objectively on features of the arrangements involved, without being distracted by intuitive subjective impressions of the morality of what taxation advisers have set up. Comments to similar effect can be found in Education Administration Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2010) 24 NZTC 24,238 (HC) at \[37\]. 182. In Alesco (CA) at \[28\] the Court of Appeal stated the enquiry must be confined to the contractual instruments and the effect achieved by the taxpayer’s use of the provisions of the Act. It considered that Heath J in the High Court was in error to approach the enquiry from the viewpoint of the taxpayer’s motivation to employ the most tax effective structure. 183. However, often evidence presented to the courts will include subjective evidence. Inevitably, judges will at times refer to this evidence in their judgments. This may be just by way of observation (Ashton (PC)), or as a way of leading into an examination of the possible non-tax avoidance effects and purposes of an arrangement (Ben Nevis and Krukziener) or to confirm a position taken under an objective examination of an arrangement’s terms (Westpac). Referring to subjective evidence in this way does not mean that judges are relying on this type of evidence to work out the purpose or effect of an arrangement. It is clear that, although subjective evidence may at times be referred to in court, the section will only apply if it can be established objectively that the arrangement has a purpose or effect of tax avoidance. 184. In summary, all the leading authorities, in particular Glenharrow, Ben Nevis and Alesco (CA), have not stated anything that casts doubt on the proposition that the test to be applied when working out the purpose or effect of an arrangement is an objective one. Oral evidence 185. The Privy Council in Ashton (PC) made a further point that oral evidence is relevant if it relates to the purpose or effect of the arrangement, but not if it relates to the purpose of the parties. A t 721: A contract, agreement or arrangement to which s 108 applies may be wholly in writing, partly in writing and partly oral or wholly oral. When it appears that any part of it was oral, evidence is properly admissible to determine its terms, and when such evidence is given, it may not be easy to separate evidence relating to the terms of the contract, agreement or arrangement from evidence as to the purpose of the parties to it but it does not follow that their evidence as to their purpose is relevant to the question whether s 108 does or does not apply. 186. Oral evidence that is inconsistent with the purpose or effect of the arrangement is not relevant. The Privy Council said at 722: WITHDRAWN 42 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If an arrangement has a particular purpose, then that will be its intended effect. If it has a particular effect, then that will be its purpose and oral evidence to show that it has a different purpose or different effect to that which is shown by the arrangement itself is irrelevant to the determination of the question whether the arrangement has or purports to have the purpose or effect of in any way altering the incidence of income tax or relieving any person from his liability to pay income tax. 187. More recently, Harrison J in Westpac had the same view about oral evidence. He stated at \[44\]: Their accounts provided a linking narrative, supplementing and explaining the picture available from the primary documents, and were relevant to an assessment of the commercial or economic realities of aspects of the transactions. Subject to certain limited qualifications to be discussed later, oral evidence is otherwise inadmissible to establish that a transaction has a purpose or effect different from that disclosed by the documents themselves: Tayles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1982\] 2 NZLR 726 (CA) at 733. The distinction in the meanings of the words “p urpose” and “effect” 188. The courts have commented on the use of both the words “purpose” and “effect” in the definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” and the difference in the meanings of the words. It has sometimes been argued that the words “purpose” and “effect” are indistinguishable. This is because the test is objective and “purpose” in this context means the purpose of the arrangement and not the parties’ purpose. 189. In the Court of Appeal decision in Tayles, McMullin J said at 734: The issue before the Board of Review, the Supreme Court and this Court involved an inquiry into the purpose or effect of the arrangement admittedly made. Whatever difference of meaning there may be in dictionary terms between the words “purpose” or “effect”, posed as they seem to be as alternatives in s 108, they usually have been looked on in the cases as a composite term. “The word ‘purpose’ means, not motive but the effect which it is sought to achieve – the end in view. The word ‘effect’ means the end accomplished or achieved. The whole set of words denotes concerted action to an end – th e end of avoiding tax” (Newton v Commissioner of Taxation at p 465). The Privy Council also approved Lord Denning’s words in Newton ( at 465) in Ashton (PC) (at 722). 190. The courts have distinguished between the purpose and effect by referring to the purpose of the arrangement as the “intended effect” (Ashton (PC)) and the purpose as “the effect which \[the arrangement\] sought to achieve” (Tayles (CA)). However, i n almost all cases, the purpose and effect of an arrangement will be the same. The intended aim of the arrangement (the objective purpose), if successfully achieved, will be the arrangement’s effect. 191. There may be instances where the purpose of the arrangement is not achieved or the arrangement does not achieve the intended effect, and therefore the effect is different from the purpose. In these instances, a tax avoidance arrangement may still exist, as the definition applies if there is either a purpose or an effect of tax avoidance. However, the Commissioner would have to consider whether pursuing the matter was warranted in such a case. WITHDRAWN 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Summary of purpose or effect 192. The purpose or effect of an arrangement, including any tax avoidance purpose or effect, is determined objectively. The taxpayer’s intentions are not relevant. “Purpose”, in the context of tax avoidance, means the intended effect the arrangement seeks to achieve and not the motive of the parties. “Effect” means the end accomplished or achieved by the arrangement. Oral evidence is relevant if it relates to the purpose or effect of the arrangement, but not if it relates to the purpose of the parties. Oral evidence that is inconsistent with the purpose or effect of the arrangement is not relevant. In most cases, the purpose and effect of an arrangement will be the same because the purpose will be successfully achieved. In the exceptional cases where the purpose and effect are different, a tax avoidance arrangement may still exist, as the definition applies if there is either a purpose or an effect of tax avoidance. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN BEN NEVIS 193. Having dealt with the above issues arising from the relevant statutory definitions, the Supreme Court’s decision in Ben Nevis is now considered. The decision is the leading authority on how to determine whether an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement and has been approved and applied in all subsequent decisions, see, for example, BNZ Investments No 2 (HC) at \[118\] and \[124\], and Westpac at \[186\] to \[187\]. The Supreme Court in Penny (SC) said the court in Ben Nevis had set out the “proper approach to questions of tax avoidance” (at \[33\]). The immediately following paragraphs set out the passages in Ben Nevis where the court outlined its approach and make observations about what the court said. The detail of the approach is discussed under later headings. Relationship between general anti-avoidance provision and the rest of the Act 194. As was discussed earlier, the central issue in Ben Nevis was how to discern the relationship between the general anti-avoidance provision and the operation of the rest of the Act. The court made some general comments about the approach to discerning the relationship: \[102\] It is accordingly the task of the Courts to apply a principled approach which gives proper overall effect to statutory language that expresses different legislative policies. It has long been recognised those policies require reconciliation. The approach must ensure that the particular case before the court is examined by reference to the respective legislative policies. It must enable decisions to be made on individual cases through the application of a process of statutory construction focusing objectively on features of the arrangements involved, without being distracted by intuitive subjective impressions of the morality of what taxation advisers have set up. 195. This approach reconciles the different legislative policies underlying the relevant specific provisions and s BG 1. The court said that proper effect must be given to each: \[103\] We consider Parliament’s overall purpose is best served by construing specific tax provisions and the general anti -avoidance provision so as to give appropriate effect to each. They are meant to work in tandem. Each provides a context which assists in determining the meaning and, in particular, the scope of the other. Neither should be regarded as overriding. Rather they work together. The presence in the New Zealand legislation of a general anti-avoidance provision suggests that our Parliament meant it to be the principal vehicle by means of which tax avoidance is addressed. The general anti-avoidance regime is designed for that purpose, WITHDRAWN 44 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] whereas individual specific provisions have a focus which is determined primarily by their ordinary meaning, as established through their text in the light of their specific purpose. In short, the purpose of specific provisions must be distinguished from that of the general anti-avoidance provision. \[104\] Parliament must have envisaged that the way a specific provision was deployed would, in some circumstances, cross the line and turn what might otherwise have been a permissible arrangement into a tax avoidance arrangement. Ascertaining when that will be so should be firmly grounded in the statutory language of the provisions themselves. Judicial attempts to articulate how the line is to be drawn have in the past too often been seized on as if they were equivalent to statutory language. Judicial glosses and elaborations on the statutory language should be kept to a minimum. 196. The approach to interpreting provisions of the Act other than s BG 1 was dealt with earlier in this statement at paragraphs 55 to 85. 197. It is clear that simply satisfying the terms of a specific provision is not sufficient to dismiss a claim of tax avoidance. As the majority recognised in a footnote to \[104\]: The appellants’ “threshold” argument accordingly cannot be correct. That argument was to the effect that once the ordinary meaning of a specific provision was satisfied there could be no tax avoidance. 198. Although the point was explicitly made only in a footnote, the judgment proceeds on that basis. The majority continued: \[106\] Put at the highest level of generality, a specific provision is designed to give the taxpayer a tax advantage if its use falls within its ordinary meaning. That will be a permissible tax advantage. The general provision is designed to avoid the fiscal effect of tax avoidance arrangements having a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Its function is to prevent uses of the specific provisions which fall outside their intended scope in the overall scheme of the Act. Such uses give rise to an impermissible tax advantage which the Commissioner may counteract. The general anti-avoidance provision and its associated reconstruction power provide explicit authority for the Commissioner and New Zealand courts to avoid what has been done and to reconstruct tax avoidance arrangements. 199. A similar view was expressed by the Supreme Court in Penny (SC) at \[45\]: ... Counsel also submitted that the prescription in the Act of the categories of taxpayers as individuals, companies, trusts and so forth, with some special anti-avoidance rules for related-party transactions including the PSA rules and rules about cross-border services, left no room for the operation of s BG 1 in a case such as the present. \[46\] We do not accept these arguments. 200. Thus, the use of a specific provision may be permissible when the provision is considered alone, but it may be impermissible when the arrangement as a whole is considered. At first glance it might seem that the court’s statement in \[106\] is conflicting, that is, that the use of a provision may be permissible under the Act, yet also impermissible if the general anti-avoidance provision is considered. However, what the court meant here is that a use of a specific provision may be otherwise permissible, were it not for the operation of the anti-avoidance provision. The court spelt out this point in more detail at \[13\], and at \[104\]: ... the way a specific provision was deployed would, in some circumstances, cross the line and turn what might otherwise have been a permissible arrangement into a tax avoidance arrangement. WITHDRAWN 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Approach when applying section BG 1 – key paragraphs of decision 201. The majority then went on to outline their view of the approach required when considering the application of s BG 1 in more detail: \[107\] When, as here, a case involves reliance by the taxpayer on specific provisions, the first inquiry concerns the application of those provisions. The taxpayer must satisfy the Court that the use made of the specific provision is within its intended scope. If that is shown, a further question arises based on the taxpayer’s use of the specific provision viewed in the light of the arrangement as a whole. If, when viewed in that light, it is apparent that the taxpayer has used the specific provision, and thereby altered the incidence of income tax, in a way which cannot have been within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament when it enacted the provision, the arrangement will be a tax avoidance arrangement. For example the licence premium was payable for a “right to use land”, according to the ordinary meaning of those words, which of course includes their purpose. But because of additional features, to which we will come, associated primarily with the method and timing of payment, it represented and was part of a tax avoidance arrangement. \[108\] The general anti-avoidance provision does not confine the Court as to the matters which may be taken into account when considering whether a tax avoidance arrangement exists. Hence the Commissioner and the courts may address a number of relevant factors, the significance of which will depend on the particular facts. The manner in which the arrangement is carried out will often be an important consideration. So will the role of all relevant parties and any relationship they may have with the taxpayer. The economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions may also be significant. Other features that may be relevant include the duration of the arrangement and the nature and extent of the financial consequences that it will have for the taxpayer. As indicated, it will often be the combination of various elements in the arrangement which is significant. A classic indicator of a use that is outside Parliamentary contemplation is the structuring of an arrangement so that the taxpayer gains the benefit of the specific provision in an artificial or contrived way. It is not within Parliament’s purpose for specific provisions to be used in that manner. \[109\] In considering these matters, the courts are not limited to purely legal considerations. They should also consider the use made of the specific provision in the light of the commercial reality and the economic effect of that use. The ultimate question is whether the impugned arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the specific provision in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. If that is so, the arrangement will not, by reason of that use, be a tax avoidance arrangement. If the use of the specific provision is beyond Parliamentary contemplation, its use in that way will result in the arrangement being a tax avoidance arrangement. 202. For present purposes, \[107\]–\[109\] are the key paragraphs in the case. In \[107\] the court said, in cases such as the one before it, the first inquiry is to consider the specific provisions in accordance with ordinary statutory interpretation principles and without reference to s BG 1. The specific provision’s meaning is determined from the ordinary meaning of the words as ascertained from their text and in light of their purpose. The approach to considering the specific provisions was discussed earlier at paragraphs 55 to 85. 203. The court said that if those specific provisions seem to be applicable, a further inquiry is required. This next inquiry, which is the s BG 1 inquiry, considers the use of the specific provisions in light of the arrangement as a whole to determine whether they have been used in a way that cannot have been within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament. The factors set out by the court in \[108\] will be relevant in this inquiry. 204. At \[109\], the court encapsulated the test for the s BG 1 inquiry: WITHDRAWN 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The ultimate question is whether the impugned arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the specific provision in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. 205. This test is discussed in detail under the heading “Is there Tax Avoidance? - Parliamentary contemplation test” below. The focus is on the whole arrangement 206. The court made it clear in \[107\] that when making the inquiry under s BG 1 it is the arrangement as a whole that must be considered: The taxpayer must satisfy the court that the use made of the specific provision is within its intended scope. If that is shown, a further question arises based on the taxpayer’s use of the specific provision viewed in the light of the arrangement as a whole. 207. As discussed above (at paragraphs 55 to 66), when considering the application of any specific provisions, proper effect is given to Parliament’s purpose by ascertaining the meaning of a provision from its text and in light of its purpose. Thus, while a specific section is interpreted in the context of the Act and full effect is given to Parliament’s purpose for that section, it is interpreted standing alone. The inquiry under s BG 1, however, considers whether the use of the provisions by the arrangement was within Parliament’s contemplation when viewed in light of the whole arrangement and any combination of provisions used. This is the case even though parts of the arrangement may comply with specific provisions. 208. It is important to understand that the focus of the test on viewing the whole arrangement in a commercially and economically realistic way means it is often the combination of steps, and the overall commercial and economic effects, that give rise to avoidance. The court in Ben Nevis made this point at \[105\]: An arrangement includes all steps and transactions by which it is carried out. Thus, tax avoidance can be found in individual steps or, more often, in a combination of steps. Indeed, even if all the steps in an arrangement are unobjectionable in themselves, their combination may give rise to a tax avoidance arrangement. 209. The Commissioner acknowledges that individual parts of an arrangement may well have real commercial and economic consequences when looked at on a stand-alone basis. Nevertheless, an approach that restricted the analysis to considering only parts of an arrangement individually, ignoring the effects of the arrangement as a whole, is not correct as it may lead to an erroneous conclusion that the arrangement is within Parliament’s contemplation. The focus must remain on the commercial reality and economic effects when the arrangement is viewed as a whole. WITHDRAWN 47 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] IS THERE TAX AVOIDANCE? – APPLYING THE PARLIAMENTARY CONTEMPLATION TEST Introduction 210. The test to identify whether an arrangement involves tax avoidance is to ask if the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the Act in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. The court in Ben Nevis said at \[109\]: The ultimate question is whether the impugned arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the specific provision in a manner that is consistent with Parliament's purpose. 211. Applying this test involves identifying: • Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions; and • the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement. The order of the analysis when applying the Parliamentary contemplation test 212. It has been established that applying the Parliamentary contemplation test involves identifying Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions and the commercial and economic effects of the arrangement. This might raise the question as to the order in which these two tasks are undertaken. The courts are often not explicit about an order for considering these two aspects of the Parliamentary contemplation test. In the Commissioner’s view, it is preferable—and even necessary—to consider first Parliament’s purpose for the provisions at issue, before the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is examined. The main reason for this is that Parliament’s purpose should, as a matter of logic and principle, guide the inquiry. The ultimate question under the Parliamentary contemplation test is whether the arrangement makes use of the Act in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. The role of s BG 1 is to give effect to provisions of the Act where an arrangement has the effect of defeating that purpose. Therefore, it is logical first to ascertain Parliament’s purpose to see whether the arrangement makes use of the Act in a way that is consistent with its purpose. Knowledge of Parliament’s purpose then provides a principled basis for the inquiry into the facts. This order also would seem to be most consistent with comments in Ben Nevis when the court said, in \[102\] and \[104\], the test is one of “statutory construction” and is “firmly grounded in the statutory language”. 213. Also, ascertaining Parliament’s purpose first can help in practice when analysing an arrangement, as knowledge of Parliament’s purpose gives guidance as to what needs to be identified when considering the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement. This order can be particularly helpful with complex arrangements, as it can be difficult to identify the commercial and economic reality of such arrangements. It also makes sense to ascertain Parliament’s purpose first if the provisions at issue concern a special tax concept created by the taxation legislation. Tax concepts or fictions may not necessarily have any real-world commercial or economic equivalent. An example is an arrangement involving a Portfolio Investment Entity subject to the PIE regime. Simply reducing such an arrangement to its most fundamental level of economic substance will not necessarily aid an understanding of whether WITHDRAWN 48 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Parliament’s purpose for the tax concept is given effect. Instead, when the arrangement is examined with knowledge of Parliament’s purpose for the provisions used, there is guidance as to how to approach and analyse the facts. 214. Therefore, the approach of beginning the Parliamentary contemplation test by identifying Parliament’s purpose is, in the Commissioner’s view, to be preferred as a matter of logic and principle and it is also consistent with Ben Nevis and the decision in Alesco (CA). In addition, this order helps with some practical difficulties when applying the Parliamentary contemplation test to certain types of arrangements. 215. Notwithstanding the order outlined in the previous paragraphs, the Commissioner acknowledges that these two inquiries are interrelated, and that each will potentially inform the other. Knowledge of Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions will guide the inquiry into the facts. Similarly, consideration of the facts and commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement will often raise questions about whether the use or non-application of the provisions gives effect to Parliament’s purpose in the context of the particular arrangement. 216. However, it is important to understand that the approach of first considering the provisions is not at the expense of taking appropriate account of the facts of the arrangement and, in particular, its commercial reality and economic effects at the next step. It should also be emphasised that mere compliance with the black letter of the Act is not the appropriate exercise. The point is to give proper effect to Parliament’s purpose when the commercial and economic effects of the arrangement are taken into account. Parliament’s purpose regarding the relevant provisions What is meant by Parliament’s purpose? 217. Deciding whether provisions are used or circumvented as Parliament contemplated involves identifying Parliament’s purpose for those provisions. Parliament’s purpose is the result Parliament intended to achieve, or the end in mind Parliament had, for the provisions. There may be multiple purposes for any provision. Sometimes Parliament’s relevant purpose will be readily ascertainable from the words used. Other times it will be less obvious and a more in-depth analysis of the Act will be required. Levels of purpose 218. To understand the concept of Parliament’s purpose, it is helpful to appreciate that there can be different levels of purpose or purposes. For any particular provision, there will be a purpose specific to that provision that will pertain to the particular role of that provision in the Act. In addition, provisions may have other broader levels of purpose, which may relate to a part of the Act or a regime, or the Act as a whole, and may concern a particular policy or have been enacted to prevent certain uses of the Act. Burrows, Statute Law in New Zealand and Bennion on Statutory Interpretation: A Code (FAR Bennion, 5th ed, LexisNexis, London, 2008) both discuss the idea of different levels of legislative purpose (see Burrows at 219–224 and Bennion at 947). Examples of provisions with a quite specific purpose are s DA 2(4), that denies a deduction for expenditure or WITHDRAWN 49 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] loss incurred in deriving income from employment, and s DB 2, that provides rules for the treatment of GST for income t ax purposes. Examples of provisions giving effect to a particular policy in the Income Tax Act are the mining regime and provisions relating to the ability to claim credits for foreign tax paid. Harrison J identified the legislative policy behind the foreign tax credit regime in Westpac at \[612\]: As demonstrated by s LC 1(3A), the FTC regime was intended to provide New Zealand taxpayers with credits for tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction. 219. The imputation regime illustrates a set of rules that may have a number of levels of purpose. At the most specific level, a provision in that regime, s OB 4, provides rules for when an imputation credit arises in a company’s imputation credit account. At a broader level, the purpose of the regime can be seen from the context of s OB 4, including the scheme of subpart OB, to be to provide rules for a system under which tax is levied at the company and shareholder levels but shareholders receive a credit for company tax paid (see also The Taxation of Distributions from Companies (Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, Discussion paper, November 1990)). At an even broader level, the policy of the regime is to ensure that, as far as possible, income earned through a company is taxed at the marginal tax rates of the shareholders of the company in accordance with the economic objective of taxing capital income at the tax rates of the individual (see Full Imputation: Report of the Consultative Committee ( Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform, April 1988)). This is not to say these are the only purposes of the imputation regime, but these particular purposes are set out here to help explain the point that any provision may have more than one purpose. 220. As noted above, it is also possible to look at the Act as a whole, and this has been illustrated in a number of GST cases. The courts have held that Parliament intends that GST inputs and outputs balance (Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2007\] NZCA 256, \[2008\] 2 NZLR 342 at \[38\] and Education Administration at \[43\]) and that inputs and outputs have a certain degree of temporal connection (Ch’elle at \[41\] and Education Administration at \[43\]). The courts in each of these cases identified these principles from the scheme of the GST Act. In Ch’elle, at \[50\], the Court of Appeal observed that while the GST Act contemplates the possibility of parties using different accounting regimes, and hence a degree of timing mismatch between when input tax is claimed and when output tax is paid, the GST Act seeks to limit the nature and degree of such mismatching. This was followed in Education Administration at \[43\]. The court in Ch’elle agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that conditions in the GST Act limiting who can register on a payments basis showed any mismatch between taxpayers accounting on a payments basis and an invoice basis was intended to be limited. 221. Similarly in Glenharrow, in the context of considering the secondhand goods provisions, the Supreme Court outlined Parliament’s purpose for the GST Act as a whole. At \[47\]: The whole premise of the Act generally and of the secondhand goods provisions in particular is that transactions will be driven by market forces: that their commercial and fiscal effects will be produced by those forces and will not contain distortions which affect (that is, defeat) the contemplated application of the GST Act. It is when market forces do not prevail that s 76 is available to the Commissioner. Take an obvious example (which on the High Court's finding of fact is not the present case). An unregistered vendor and a registered purchaser, not being associated persons, WITHDRAWN 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] inflate the price of goods in return for a non-recourse loan to the purchaser by the vendor. The purchaser obtains the advantage of a higher input tax deduction/refund. This would plainly defeat the intent and application of the Act, namely that the purchaser’s deduction would be no more than the tax fraction of the market value of the goods. If the price were influenced by the tax advantage, the purchaser would be achieving something not contemplated by the Act - an artificially enhanced deduction. It is the same if the structure of the transaction enables the purchaser to obtain an artificially early deduction, that is, one which is unrelated to the market realities of the transaction. Combinations of provisions 222. In many cases, Parliament’s purpose for a combination of provisions that are relevant to a particular arrangement must be ascertained. In such cases, Parliament may not have explicitly considered the interaction of the provisions when they were enacted. However, it can still be appropriate to consider whether Parliament would or would not have intended them to be used in combination in a particular way. Courts have recognised that Parliament’s purpose may need to be ascertained in such a case. For example, Harrison J in Westpac found that the arrangement used a combination of provisions in a way that would not have been contemplated by Parliament: \[606\] Self-evidently, such a deployment would not have been within Parliament’s contemplation when the ITA was enacted. The legislature would not have contemplated that a taxpayer might lawfully use the deductibility provisions, in conjunction with a pre-existing right to exempt income, to provide funding to a party at a price considerably below market by returning a share of the domestic taxation benefit derived from claiming a deduction for a non-existent expense. What Parliament would have contemplated hypothetically 223. A question that is sometimes asked is whether Parliament’s purpose is the purpose at the time it enacted the provisions, or whether it is what Parliament’s purpose would be at the time the arrangement is being considered. The relevant time is when Parliament enacted the provision(s). The court in Ben Nevis said at \[107\]: If, when viewed in that light, it is apparent that the taxpayer has used the specific provision, and thereby altered the incidence of income tax, in a way which cannot have been within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament when it enacted the provision, the arrangement will be a tax avoidance arrangement. \[Emphasis added\] 224. The test is not, however, an attempt to discern whether Parliament contemplated the actual arrangement with all its steps and transactions. Instead, the question is a hypothetical one, as recognised by Wild J in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC): \[134\] In \[101\] in Ben Nevis the Supreme Court again makes the point — it had earlier been made in the submissions of counsel for the Commissioner referred to by Cooke J at NZTC 5,013; NZLR 541 in Challenge — that no GAAR can anticipate all the results of taxpayers’ ingenuity in crafting arrangements. Thus Parliament could not, and will not, have contemplated the particular arrangement in issue. That arrangement is likely to deploy a number of statutory regimes or provisions. I agree with Mr Brown’s submission for the Commissioner that it is unreal to suggest that Parliament, when it enacted the deductibility and subvention provisions and the FTC and conduit regimes, might actually have contemplated transactions structured as are those in issue in these proceedings. \[135\] It follows that I agree with the Commissioner’s submission that the question for the court at step 2 is necessarily an hypothetical one. Guided by the considerations and the approach set out by the Supreme Court in \[108\] and \[109\] in Ben Nevis, the court is essentially asking itself: had Parliament foreseen transactions WITHDRAWN 51 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] of this type when enacting the specific provisions deployed in the transactions, would it have viewed them as within the scheme and purpose of those specific provisions? 225. Comments to this effect were also made in Russell (CA) at \[39\]. How to determine Parliament’s purpose 226. Parliament’s purpose is identified by considering the meaning of the text of the provisions, the context (including the statutory scheme relevant to the provision) and any relevant legislative history. 227. Generally, the more specific purposes of a provision will be derived primarily from the words of the provision, although the context and scheme may also be relevant. Such a purpose might be, for example, to provide for a specific taxation treatment for a particular type of receipt. An example can be found in Ben Nevis where it was clear from the words of the legislation that one of Parliament’s purposes was to give a deduction for insurance premiums. With broader purposes, typically a greater examination of the statutory context and scheme, along with the words of the section, is required. Harrison J’s consideration of the foreign tax credit regime in Westpac, and the GST cases referred to in paragraphs 218 and 220 above, are examples where the courts considered the context and scheme to identify broader purposes. 228. Where there is a specific anti-avoidance provision that accompanies the provision at issue, it will form part of the relevant context to consider in identifying Parliament’s purpose. However, as discussed earlier in this statement, the presence of a specific anti-avoidance provision does not rule out the application of s BG 1. 229. Extrinsic materials may be of assistance when identifying and understanding Parliament’s purpose (see further on this under the next heading), and sometimes it might also be helpful to refer to judicial decisions where the purpose of legislation has been considered. The admissibility and weight given to extrinsic materials 230. There may be situations where it can be useful to go further than the legislation as enacted and consider extrinsic materials. In this context, extrinsic materials are documents produced in the course of enacting legislation. Some examples of extrinsic materials are law reform reports, discussion documents, Inland Revenue publications, select committee reports and Hansard. Reference to extrinsic materials might more commonly be useful when identifying broader purposes. G enerally, New Zealand courts have taken a pragmatic approach to the use of extrinsic materials, concerning themselves mostly with the appropriate weight to be given to the material, rather than its admissibility. As a result of that weighing exercise, courts have used the material as part of the background to a decision, or to confirm a decision that has been reached by other means, rather than being decisive in itself. (See R v Aylwin \[2008\] NZCA 154, (2008) 24 CRNZ 87 at \[58\] and also Burrows, Statute Law in New Zealand, 258–289.) 231. The courts have made reference to extrinsic materials in a s BG 1 context in a number of cases. In BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), Wild J referred to a discussion document (at \[232\] and \[237\]) when identifying the legislative policies underlying the provisions of the conduit regime. However, Wild J WITHDRAWN 52 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ultimately determined Parliament’s purpose by reference to the scheme of the Act. A t \[235\]: But the \[legislative\] requirements I have listed at \[229\]b)–g) are consistent only with Parliament contemplating that some of the conduit relieved income would in due course be passed on to the foreign owner. Otherwise those requirements are pointless. 232. The extrinsic materials were used by Wild J in support of a decision based on the actual text of the relevant provisions, rather than being determinative of Parliament’s purpose in themselves. 233. Harrison J referred to extrinsic materials in Westpac. In considering the purpose of the conduit regime, his Honour referred to a Consultative Committee report and a report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee (see \[228\]–\[229\]). However, in the Commissioner’s view, these references were made for background purposes rather than to support the conclusion. In Penny (CA), the Court of Appeal considered the commentary to the relevant bill when reviewing the personal services attribution rules (see \[91\]–\[92\]). A gain, this reference was made for background purposes, as the case did not turn on the meaning of those provisions. 234. Therefore, extrinsic material may, depending on the circumstances, be relevant to determining Parliament’s purpose in a s BG 1 context. However, that material is generally used as part of the background to a decision, or to confirm a decision that has been reached by other means, rather than being decisive in itself. Extrinsic materials should be used with care and should not substitute for a careful examination of the legislation. Courts have not demonstrated any willingness to rely on extrinsic materials to arrive at an interpretation that is not consistent with the words. Identifying which purposes are relevant 235. Once Parliament’s purposes have been identified for the provisions used (or any provisions that potentially do not apply), then the purposes relevant to the arrangement’s use of the Act need to be identified. Which purposes are relevant, whether specific or broader, will depend on the particular use made of the Act. All of the potentially relevant purposes should be identified to see if the arrangement uses the provisions in a way Parliament did not intend. It may be that not all purposes pertaining to a provision are ultimately relevant. However, it is important to consider them in analysing the use of the Act to ensure that a use that is outside Parliament’s contemplation is not overlooked. Consideration of the commercial and economic reality may raise further questions about Parliament’s relevant purpose 236. There is an important interaction between the two steps of ascertaining Parliament’s relevant purpose and identifying the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement. It will very often be the case that consideration of the commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement at the next step will raise further questions as to what Parliament’s purpose is in the context of the particular arrangement. Often an arrangement will, on the face of it, appear to comply with Parliament’s purpose. However, once the arrangement is examined, and a better understanding is reached as to the particular way the arrangement WITHDRAWN 53 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] uses the Act, that knowledge may suggest that Parliament’s purpose is not sufficiently identified and understood. 237. An arrangement that uses a combination of provisions is one instance of a use of the Act that might commonly raise questions about Parliament’s purpose that had not previously been identified. Another is the presence of artificiality and contrivance that relate to tax effects and that have not yet been taken into account. 238. This interaction between Parliament’s purpose and the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is reflected in the comments above at paragraph 215, and is shown by the curved arrow on the left-hand side of the flow chart at paragraph 439. 239. Consideration of the arrangement may also serve to focus more accurately the inquiry into Parliament’s purpose. Sometimes it will be clear from an examination of the arrangement that some aspects of Parliament’s purpose are not relevant. Accordingly, those aspects of Parliament’s purpose need not be considered further. There may be two different avoidance aspects in a single arrangement 240. On some occasions, arrangements might avoid tax in more than one way, and these ways might be unrelated. If there are unrelated uses of the Act, each may need to be considered separately, and the Parliamentary contemplation test undertaken for each use. For example, the court in Ben Nevis ascertained Parliament’s purpose, and the relevant commercial and economic reality of the arrangement, for each of two specific provisions. The relevant sections of the 1994 Act were s EG 1 (and related definitions in s OB 1), which gave a deduction for depreciation on a right to use land, and s DL 1(3), which gave a deduction for insurance premiums. The court treated these two uses as two separate inquiries. Identifying what Parliament would have expected would be present (or absent) to give effect to its purpose 241. To consider Parliament’s relevant purposes in the context of taxpayers’ arrangements, those purposes must be translated into facts Parliament would expect to see present or those that Parliament would expect to be absent. This is because taxpayers and arrangements operate in the real world and so the practical application of Parliament’s purposes must be considered. 242. Sometimes the facts Parliament would expect to be present (or absent) will be readily ascertainable. For example, in the context of the depreciation rules, it may be concluded that Parliament’s purpose is (at the very least) to allow deductions against income for owners of assets used to derive that income. Therefore, Parliament would expect that for the depreciation provisions to apply, there must be an asset, the asset must be used in deriving income and the asset must be owned by a taxpayer (see s EE 1). 243. An example of where a judge has identified facts Parliament would expect can be seen in Westpac w hen Harrison J considered the foreign tax credit regime. After identifying the purpose of the regime, Harrison J took the view that Parliament would have expected foreign tax actually to have been paid. At \[612\] his Honour said: WITHDRAWN 54 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] As demonstrated by s LC 1(3A), the FTC regime was intended to provide New Zealand taxpayers with credits for tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction. ... I accept, as Wild J did, the Commissioner’s argument that the actual payment of foreign tax is the policy foundation of the FTC regime and that, without such a payment, there is nothing against which to allow a credit. 244. Sometimes, some or all of the facts may not be specifically identified in the provision in question. If that is so, greater consideration will need to be given to what Parliament would have expected. For example, when considering the application of s CC 1(2), which specifically includes “rent” in income, it might be appropriate to identify that Parliament would expect there to be a landlord and a tenant in relation to a payment of rent, even though the section does not specify that. 245. The courts have also been prepared to identify necessary facts that are even less evident. For example, in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), Wild J found that for the conduit rules to apply Parliament would have expected dividends would be paid to a non-resident shareholder and so non-resident withholding tax would be paid (at \[243\]). In Westpac, Harrison J considered that Parliament would have expected NRWT would be capable of being paid, rather than that it would have to be paid (at \[610\]–\[611\]). 246. While often Parliament would be expecting quite specific facts to be present (or absent), at other times Parliament may expect a more general conceptual notion to be satisfied or be permissive of different combinations of facts. These latter instances could be described as “features” or “attributes” Parliament would expect to be present or absent. Examples might include legal, commercial or economic concepts. For example, a legal concept could arise if a deduction was available for a lease payment, but not for a licence payment. The relevant features or attributes would be those relating to the distinction between the legal concepts of leases and licences (involving, for example, looking at whether the party has exclusive possession). 247. Ben Nevis contains an example of a commercial concept. The court had to decide whether amounts the taxpayer had paid were “insurance premiums” under s DL 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This section provided a deduction for insurance premium expenses incurred by a person carrying on a forestry business. The court identified commercial features of insurance that it considered would be present in a contract of insurance, such as risk management, reinsurance and being open to the public rather than secret. 248. An example of an economic concept can be found in both Ben Nevis and Westpac. In those cases the courts took the view that a feature of an expense is that it needed to be incurred in an economic sense. In the Court of Appeal decision in the Ben Nevis litigation (Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323), the court said at \[126\]: ... it will usually be safe to infer that specific tax rules as to deductibility are premised on the assumption that they should only be invoked in relation to the incurring of real economic consequences of the type contemplated by the legislature when the rules were enacted. 249. Similarly, in Westpac, Harrison J said: WITHDRAWN 55 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[596\] Specific deductibility provisions are to be invoked where the taxpayer has by the transaction incurred “real economic consequences of the type contemplated by the legislature when the rules were enacted”; and where the taxpayer is “engag\[ing\] in business activities for the purpose of making a profit”: Accent at \[126\]. 250. It may also be noted that sometimes Parliament uses a term relying on the fact that it has been given a meaning by the courts, and those judicial decisions will need to be considered to understand Parliament’s purpose. For example, the courts have identified a number of attributes of the concept of income according to ordinary concepts. 251. Therefore, a consideration of Parliament’s purposes requires the identification of relevant facts, features and attributes that Parliament would expect to be present or absent. Importantly, these facts, features and attributes are generated from Parliament’s relevant purpose or purposes. The degree of precision needed to reach a view on the facts, features and attributes 252. It is important to recognise that this exercise of identifying what facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect does not demand absolute precision. It will frequently involve matters of degree and generality. There will often be a limit to the degree of precision that can be achieved in this regard, and in such cases an element of judgement will be necessary and unavoidable. In other words, a view formed as to Parliament’s purpose will not always give rise to very specific facts, features and attributes, or exactness in terms of measures or quantification. However, this is simply a reality and does not undermine the need to translate Parliament’s relevant purposes into facts, features and attributes to whatever degree this is possible. 253. It may not, therefore, be possible to reach an exhaustive and precise view on what Parliament would have expected. However, it can still be determined (at the stage when a decision on the arrangement is made) whether the use of the provisions in question exhibits the requisite facts, features and attributes to a sufficient degree. For example, it might be concluded that Parliament would have contemplated a substantial period of ownership of an asset for the operation of a particular provision. The legislation and other relevant background and sources can be examined to try and understand more exactly what Parliament would have anticipated as the duration of such a period, but sometimes there will be a point when there is no more guidance available. Ultimately, a decision will still have to be made whether the particular use of the Act by the arrangement in question is within what Parliament would have contemplated. 254. In Ch’elle the Court of Appeal said that while the GST Act permits a degree of mismatching in terms of accounting methods, it “seeks to limit the nature and degree of such mismatching” and that a “gross mismatch” in timing is relevant to the avoidance provision (at \[50\]). The court examined the arrangement to see whether there was such a gross mismatch. However, in doing so, the court did not find it necessary to reach any view on the precise point at which a mismatch would cease to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. It was able to conclude at \[ 51\]: As a result, the degree of mismatch contemplated and tolerated by the Act escalated to a level which could never have been intended. WITHDRAWN 56 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Identifying what Parliament would have expected would be present (or absent) can require giving effect to tax concepts 255. A concern is sometimes raised about how the Parliamentary contemplation test applies to special tax concepts that are unique to the Income Tax Act. The concern is that the requirement to identify commercial and economic reality may not recognise those tax concepts. However, this is not the case. Looking at the arrangement as a matter of commercial and economic reality does not require any departure from the requirements of the taxation legislation. What is required is to take what is in the legislation and ascertain what facts, features and attributes are needed to satisfy it. It does not matter that some terminology or concepts used in the Act are themselves artificial or only exist in the legislation. Underlying these terms and concepts, some real-world facts, features and attributes will always need to be present to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. Summary – identifying Parliament’s purpose 256. The Parliamentary contemplation test involves considering both Parliament’s purpose and the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement. The Commissioner considers that the better approach is to identify Parliament’s purpose first, before examining the arrangement. There is, however, an important interaction between the two steps. It is also important to appreciate that the approach of beginning with Parliament’s purpose should not be done at the expense of taking appropriate account of the facts of the arrangement and, in particular, its commercial reality and economic effects. 257. Parliament’s purpose is the result Parliament intended to achieve, or the end in mind Parliament had, for the provisions. There may be multiple purposes. T hese may include quite specific purposes, which arise from the particular role of a provision in the Act, and/or broader purposes. Parliament’s purpose for combinations of provisions may also need to be identified. The relevant time to consider is Parliament’s purpose at the time it enacted the provisions. The test is not an attempt to discern whether Parliament contemplated the actual arrangement with all its steps and transactions. Instead, the question is a hypothetical one. 258. How Parliament’s purpose is identified for any arrangement will depend on how the Act applies or does not apply by virtue of the arrangement. In some cases, the exercise will be focused simply on the text of a particular provision. In others, a broader examination of the Act may be required to identify Parliament’s purpose. Sometimes extrinsic materials and case law may help when reaching a view on Parliament’s purpose. 259. All of Parliament’s relevant purposes need to be identified, although ultimately not every potential purpose will be relevant. Whether a purpose is relevant will depend on the particular use the arrangement makes of the Act. 260. Once Parliament’s relevant purpose has been ascertained, the facts, features and attributes required to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose must then be identified. There may be some variation in the degree of precision necessary, or even possible, in establishing these. WITHDRAWN 57 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement 261. As has been discussed, determining whether there is tax avoidance involves ascertaining Parliament’s purpose for the provisions used, or potentially relevant provisions that do not apply. This can provide the basis for identifying the facts, features and attributes that should be present or absent to give effect to that purpose. The commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement can then be examined to see whether, and to what degree, the facts, features and attributes are present or absent in the particular case. 262. It is very clear from the Supreme Court decision in Ben Nevis that the question whether the required facts, features and attributes to give effect to Parliament’s purpose are present or absent in the arrangement is to be answered from the point of view of the arrangement’s commercial and economic reality. For example, Parliament will expect that if a payment is made or an asset is sold, that this happens in a real sense, and not just on the appearance of the arrangement. Identifying the commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement goes beyond the legal form of an arrangement. It requires identifying the real outcomes for the parties and those affected by it over the duration of the arrangement, to the extent they are relevant to the provisions under consideration. 263. It might be observed that the court in Ben Nevis referred in one place to the “economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions”, in another to the “ commercial reality and economic effect” of a use of the Act, and also to an arrangement “viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way” . The Commissioner’s view is that these phrases are fundamentally about the same concept in this context, and so for convenience in the following discussion the phrase “commercial and economic reality” will generally be used. How to determine the commercial and economic reality of an arrangement 264. Understanding what is actually achieved by or under an arrangement requires a complete understanding of the facts and a thorough grasp of the detail and workings of the arrangement as a whole. It requires identifying the real commercial and economic outcomes for the parties under that arrangement over its life that are relevant to the provisions at issue. This inquiry will be guided by the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present (or absent). In Ben Nevis, the court identified a number of factors that are relevant in this context. These include the manner in which the arrangement is carried out, the role of the parties and the nature and extent of the financial consequences for the taxpayer. 265. When determining the commercial and economic reality of an arrangement, steps in the arrangement that disguise the actual consequences for the parties, particularly steps that seem artificial or that involve pretence or circularity, may be ignored. It is only once the true commercial and economic outcomes of an arrangement that are relevant to the provisions at issue have been identified, that these outcomes can then be tested against Parliament’s purpose and contemplation for the relevant provisions. WITHDRAWN 58 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Case law illustrations of examining the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement 266. In the Commissioner’s view, the following cases illustrate how the courts have examined the arrangement before them to see if the necessary facts, features and attributes are present, and to what degree, when the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is properly understood. 267. In the Ben Nevis case, the court proceeded on the basis that Parliament would have expected the licence premium expenses would be incurred in reality, in the sense of the taxpayers actually having to pay them (see \[118\]–\[ 119\]). At \[128\]: While the law treats the relevant costs as incurred, and shareholders are not generally held personally liable for a company's obligations, the court is permitted, when considering the question of tax avoidance, to examine the commercial nature of the incurred cost and any factors that might indicate that the expenditure will never be truly incurred. 268. The court examined the facts and concluded that the expenses were not truly incurred in this sense. The expenses were licence premiums for the right to use the land. The taxpayers claimed they had the ability to deduct a depreciation allowance of one-fiftieth of the licence premium expense. However, the premiums were paid by the use of promissory notes, and the obligation to pay under the promissory notes was to be satisfied from the proceeds of the trees harvested after 50 years. The court found that the prospect of the business being profitable when the net stumpage was received after harvest was unlikely, saying at \[130\]: It puts a different stamp on the nature of the obligation to pay the licence premium so that, as a matter of commercial reality, its discharge is dependent on the proceeds of the stumpage. There are so many contingencies around events that may occur prior to 2047 that the obligation to pay the licence premium lacks real force. The effect of the arrangement (if permitted) would be to provide a tax concession in circumstances where the commitment to make the payment is dependent on stumpage proceeds and otherwise is illusory. The result of this use of the specific provision is to take the arrangement, insofar as it depends on the licence premium promissory note, outside of the scope of the provision allowing for a deduction for depreciable property and to make what the investors entered into a tax avoidance arrangement. \[Emphasis added\] 269. As well as claiming to deduct licence premiums for the right to use land, the taxpayer also claimed to have incurred insurance premiums. The court examined the facts to determine whether the payments were actually for insurance—as this was what Parliament would expect. The court found that, when analysed commercially, there was no risk involved, no reinsurance and no offers of insurance to the public by the insurance entity. It concluded that the insurance dimension of the arrangement was not insurance as a matter of commercial reality but “was simply a method whereby substantial tax benefits could be obtained by deducting in one lump sum in 1997 a premium not payable in commercial terms until 2047” (at \[146\]). 270. Similarly to the finding on the licence premiums, the court reached the view that the use of a promissory note to pay the insurance premiums meant the insurance premiums were not economically incurred. At \[147\]: As already mentioned, this is technically correct in law, but, in substance, the debt remains unpaid. There is no transfer of real value to the creditor by substituting WITHDRAWN 59 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] one form of obligation for another. Hence the promissory note was an artificial payment implemented for taxation purposes. The simple fact is that the second premium was not paid in any real sense by means of the promissory note. The use of the promissory note as an aspect of the whole arrangement reinforces its artificiality. CSI undertook no real risk and was simply a vehicle to achieve the deductibility of a premium which was not truly paid. The purported payment did not give rise to any economic consequences on either side. \[Emphasis added\] 271. In Westpac, Harrison J also took the view that Parliament would have expected an expense to be economically incurred, in the sense of the taxpayer actually bearing the cost of it. After considering the facts, he concluded that the expense was not in fact incurred economically at \[596\]: The dividend formula explains why Westpac claimed a deduction for an expense which did not incur real economic consequences of the type envisaged by the deductibility provisions. The financial returns enjoyed by both parties were the result of a formula designed to share deductions derived by Westpac where in substance the economic burden and benefit were non-existent. \[Emphasis added\] And at \[597\]: The contrived expense was also, by virtue of the self-cancelling effect of the exchanges inherent in the pricing structure, illusory. 272. The court in Westpac was also concerned with whether, in fact, foreign tax had been paid. At \[612\]: As demonstrated by s LC 1(3A), the FTC regime was intended to provide New Zealand taxpayers with credits for tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction. Yet the economic burden of the US tax on the gross distribution was not in fact paid or economically suffered by either Westpac or the counterparty. As Coopers & Lybrand wrote to Westpac on 25 June 1998: “... the US counter party enjoys what is effectively a double deduction in the United States (for the interest paid, and second in relation to the partnership distribution), in substance the tax in relation to which a credit is claimed in New Zealand is not real. In practical terms, it is refunded.” I accept, as Wild J did, the Commissioner’s argument that the actual payment of foreign tax is the policy foundation of the FTC regime and that, without such a payment, there is nothing against which to allow a credit. The CSFB transaction was, in economic substance, incompatible with the FTC regime. \[Emphasis added\] 273. The Court of Appeal in Alesco (CA) concluded that the word “expenditure” required an actual outflow of money or an obligation to make payment (at \[70\]) and that features of the financial arrangements rules suggested Parliament would not have intended for the rules to be used to claim interest deductions for which the taxpayer was not liable or did not pay (at \[71\]–\[72\]). 274. In Education Administration, French J considered that the fact the taxpayer paid only 10% of each invoice, with the remainder being a purely contingent liability, meant there was no real economic burden as would have been anticipated by Parliament for the relevant provision. At \[61\]: As Mr Clews himself elegantly put it, a core value upon which the granting of the GST input tax credit is based is that the party claiming it should have been subjected to a real and genuine economic burden. On the facts of this case Education Administration was not in my view subject to a real economic burden, and accordingly was using the Act in a way Parliament did not intend. \[Emphasis added\] WITHDRAWN 60 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 275. In the Supreme Court decision in Glenharrow, the court considered both the commercial and economic aspects of the arrangement. The taxpayer had paid an amount for a mining licence. Payment was made by way of a relatively small cash payment and the balance by vendor finance. The purchaser was to repay the vendor finance with proceeds from using the licence. The court identified that Parliament’s broad purpose for GST is that GST would remain neutral as a value-added tax levied on final consumers. From this, the court considered that the premise of the GST Act, and the secondhand provisions in particular, is that transactions will be driven by market forces (see \[46\] and \[47\]). In examining the arrangement, the court recognised the very high price paid for the mining licence and questioned whether the commercial reality was such that there was any likelihood of the taxpayer mining enough stone to generate sufficient sales. In a similar way to the cases already discussed, the court considered the economic aspect of the way payment was to be achieved and considered that there was little likelihood of payment in economic terms: \[52\] In reality the only part of the price which in economic terms would ever be paid — disregarding the possible use of any GST refund for this purpose — was such as could be funded from sales during the third year. An objective observer, when the arrangement was made, would have said that Glenharrow would never be able to mine enough stone during the term of the licence in order to generate sufficient sales. It certainly would not be able to pay the first two annual instalments of the price because it would not have begun mining. Yet the structure adopted was for a “payment” and a “re-advance”. This achieved no economic effect and nothing significant in commercial terms. \[Emphasis added\] And at \[53\]: In economic terms there was no consideration in money given by Glenharrow because of the commercial impossibility of payment by it in circumstances where it was virtually uncapitalised and its obligation was not supported by its shareholder. The terms of the arrangement may well have made business sense from the perspective of each party as a transaction which enabled Glenharrow to exploit the licence and pay the price as and when stone was extracted and sales eventuated. It safeguarded Mr Fahey and Mr Meates to some extent against the risks of the venture. But it had no such reality as a “cash” transaction, despite being structured as if it were. \[Emphasis added\] 276. The cases discussed so far illustrate that in many recent cases the common fact, feature or attribute that is absent is an expense or outgoing that has been incurred in a real sense. In Alesco New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2012\] 2 NZLR 252 (HC), Heath J analysed Parliament’s purpose and established the financial arrangements rules are intended to match “real income and real expenditure”. His Honour then analysed the facts to establish the “real nature of the transactions effected through the Notes”. The Court of Appeal concluded that the underlying premise for the deductibility rules was that they were to apply only when “real economic consequences are incurred” (see Alesco (CA) at \[83\]). 277. Penny (SC) concerned in part the circumvention of the provisions in Part C of the Act that provide that income according to ordinary concepts and business income are income of the taxpayer who derives them. In the Commissioner’s view, Parliament’s relevant purpose at the heart of the Penny (SC) case was that income should be taxed to the person who derives it. The court examined the arrangement to reach a view on who in reality was the person who derived the income. The court concluded that WITHDRAWN 61 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the taxpayers retained control of the economic benefit of earnings that were essentially generated through their personal exertion despite the structure of the arrangement, so the reality was that they continued to derive the income. The court said at \[35\] and \[47\]: The fixing of the low salary enabled most of the profits of the company from the professional practice to be transferred by way of dividends straight through to the trust, avoiding payment of the highest personal tax rate, and then use\[d\] by the trust for the taxpayer's family purposes, including benefiting him by loans (Mr Penny) or funding the family home and holiday home (Mr Hooper). Although neither taxpayer was a trustee, each could naturally expect that the trustees whom they had chosen would act as they in fact did, and that the benefits of the use of the funds would thereby be secured without the impost of the highest personal tax rate. ... That is what the artificially low salary settings did in this case. They reduced each taxpayer’s earnings but at the same time enabled the company's earnings (derived only because of the setting of the salary levels) to be made available to him through the family trusts. In reality, the taxpayers suffered no actual loss of income but obtained a reduction in liability to tax as if they had, to adapt Lord Templeman’s dictum in Challenge. \[Emphasis added\] Factors that may be taken into account when determining the commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement 278. As noted above at paragraph 264, the court in Ben Nevis (at \[108\]) set out some of the factors that may be taken into account as part of the inquiry into the commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement. These include: • the manner in which the arrangement is carried out; • the role of all relevant parties and their relationships; • the economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions; • the duration of the arrangement; • the nature and extent of the financial consequences. 279. The court also said that a “classic indicator” of a use that is outside Parliament’s contemplation is an arrangement structured so the taxpayer gains the benefit of the relevant provision in an artificial or contrived way. 280. The court in Ben Nevis confirmed that the matters to be considered are not limited to the factors listed above: \[108\] The general anti-avoidance provision does not confine the court as to the matters which may be taken into account when considering whether a tax avoidance arrangement exists. Hence the Commissioner and the courts may address a number of relevant factors, the significance of which will depend on the particular facts. 281. These factors are considered when reaching a view on the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement that is relevant to the provisions at issue. They will help to identify which aspects of the arrangement to focus on when reaching a view on whether the provisions are being used as Parliament intended. In particular, they will help with determining whether the necessary facts, features and attributes are present or absent (and to what degree). The relevance of factors will depend on the provisions used, or that it is argued do not apply, and what Parliament would expect to be present (or absent) (Ben Nevis at \[108\] and BNZ Investments No 2 (HC) at \[128\]). For example, the mechanism used in the arrangement in Ben Nevis to separate legal and economic payment WITHDRAWN 62 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] meant that the duration of the arrangement was relevant (see Ben Nevis at \[120\], \[128\], \[130\] and \[147\]). For other arrangements and uses of the Act, duration may not be a helpful factor. 282. The following paragraphs discuss each of the factors set out in Ben Nevis. Some of these factors are closely connected and there is some overlap. However, because the factors were specifically listed in Ben Nevis they are dealt with individually below. Factors that may be particularly closely related are artificiality, the economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions, and the nature and extent of the financial consequences the arrangement will have for the taxpayer. Some other factors found to be significant in cases, and not specifically mentioned in Ben Nevis, are also discussed. These are: • Does the arrangement involve pretence? • Is the arrangement circular? • Does the arrangement involve inflated expenditure or reduced levels of income? • Have the parties undertaken real risk? • The relevance of an arrangement being pre-tax negative. 283. Cases are used to illustrate the presence of the factors in tax avoidance arrangements. The manner in which the arrangement is carried out 284. The manner in which the arrangement is carried out refers to the particular way the arrangement has been structured. It will be relevant to consider whether the particular structure chosen differs from usual commercial practice, whether there are unusual features of the arrangement, whether the structuring is hard to understand from a commercial point of view and whether the structure adopted has the effect that sections of the Act apply or do not apply. Examining these aspects will generally help in reaching a view on what is really achieved commercially and economically and whether the provisions have been used in a way Parliament intended. 285. The court in Ben Nevis referred to the specific way the arrangement was structured in that case: \[128\] All this arises from the manner in which the specific provision has been used. Execution of promissory notes has created a timing mismatch between the dates for legal and economic payment. While the law treats the relevant costs as incurred, and shareholders are not generally held personally liable for a company’s obligations, the court is permitted, when considering the question of tax avoidance, to examine the commercial nature of the incurred cost and any factors that might indicate that the expenditure will never be truly incurred. 286. In Penny (SC), the company and trust structure used was not remarkable, but part of the arrangement involved fixing the taxpayers’ salaries in an artificial manner (at \[47\]). 287. Wild J in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC) also commented on the manner in which the arrangement was carried out: \[404\] To summarise, I answer the points I set out in \[360\] as follows: WITHDRAWN 63 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a) The primary purpose of the swap was to facilitate a fixed distribution rate under the transaction, and thus fix the tax benefits shared by the parties. b) The manner in which the interest rate swaps were transacted was not in accordance with market practice in several respects. This had the consequence that the fixed interest rate in at least two of the transactions was well out of line with the market rate. 288. His Honour also commented on a number of features of the transactions and how they were carried out before reaching the conclusion that the transactions were tax avoidance. For example, he made the following findings on the facts: • The transactions were template transactions. His Honour said a template transaction was a standard form transaction replicated for different businesses (at \[516\]). Wild J noted that this feature, when considered in conjunction with other factors such as the BNZ’s controlled use of its tax capacity to generate exempt income, indicated that the “BNZ used the transactions for a ‘tax avoidance’ purpose” (at \[259\]). • The transactions were complex given that in substance they were straightforward loans (at \[284\]). • Each transaction split the New Zealand tax benefits between the BNZ and the counterparty and moved progressively in favour of the BNZ, reflecting its increasing awareness of the commercial value of its ability to generate exempt income (at \[285\]). • No counterparty approached the BNZ seeking funding. The BNZ attracted the counterparties to these transactions by offering them funds at well below their normal cost of funds, as compensation for their participation (at \[421\]). 289. In Education Administration, French J said: \[57\] On anyone’s view of it, there were some unusual aspects to the agreement between the two companies, most notably the fact that Education Administration was only required to pay 10 per cent of each invoice immediately with the remaining 90 per cent payable at some unspecified time in the future, without any component of interest being charged, and only from revenue generated by sales which were not guaranteed. The role of all relevant parties and their relationships 290. Considering the roles of the relevant parties and any relationships they may have (including with the taxpayer) can be useful in both understanding and analysing the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement. Instances where the roles of the parties might be relevant are where that has enabled the parties to put a different appearance on the facts—which might particularly be the case where they are associated parties—and also where different parties should economically be considered part of the same group. 291. An example where the presence of related parties is relevant is where the taxpayer is legally separate from the other parties (eg, by company and trust structures) but effectively controls those other parties through, for example, directorial influence, shareholding or trustee capacity. In Penny (SC), the Supreme Court accepted that the company and trust structures were legitimate business vehicles to be adopted by taxpayers. However, the court concluded it was a tax avoidance arrangement in that case WITHDRAWN 64 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] because the taxpayers derived all of the income but were not taxed as if they had. T he structures enabled the taxpayers to receive an artificially low salary and to avoid the impost of the highest personal tax rate, while still enjoying the full benefit of the use of the funds. The court commented: \[35\] The fixing of the low salary enabled most of the profits of the company from the professional practice to be transferred by way of dividends straight through to the trust, avoiding payment of the highest personal tax rate, and then use by the trust for the taxpayer’s family purposes, including benefiting him by loans (Mr Penny) or funding the family home and holiday home (Mr Hooper). Although neither taxpayer was a trustee, each could naturally expect that the trustees whom they had chosen would act as they in fact did, and that the benefits of the use of the funds would thereby be secured without the impost of the highest personal tax rate. \[Emphasis added\] 292. Another example of a taxpayer retaining control, despite the presence of other parties, can be seen in Russell (HC). The court observed in that case at \[131\]: Very significantly, Mr Russell retained control of the whole of the income generated; only he could direct how it was to be applied. The income of the Commercial Management partnership was in my judgment derived from Mr Russell’s personal exertions and he retained control over it. 293. The relationship between the parties can also be relevant when the parties are not associated or related. For example, parties might agree to share the tax benefits of an arrangement in a way that is outside Parliament’s contemplation. This may arise in cross-border tax arbitrage where there is a differing tax treatment for cash flows between tax jurisdictions and the parties agree to share the New Zealand tax benefits. An example of this is BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), where the taxpayer and counterparties were unrelated and at arm’s length but there was an arrangement to generate and share tax benefits, as revealed by the negotiations over the splitting of the New Zealand tax benefits. The economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions 294. The documents and transactions can be examined to see whether they are consistent with the real outcomes under the arrangement. In Westpac, Harrison J said: \[603\] The bank’s payment of a gratuitous (and substantial) fee, and its unexplained indifference to critical elements of the transaction, establishes the artificiality of the legal structure which it superimposed and its consequential rights and obligations. This was not a case of a taxpayer choosing the most advantageous structure of a transaction for tax purposes; I am satisfied it was a case of a taxpayer selecting a form which was contrary to and designed to re-characterise the transaction’s economic substance as a loan for the purpose of avoiding liabilities to tax. 295. The court in Glenharrow said at \[53\]: In economic terms there was no consideration in money given by Glenharrow because of the commercial impossibility of payment by it in circumstances where it was virtually uncapitalised and its obligation was not supported by its shareholder ... But it had no such reality as a “cash” transaction, despite being structured as if it were. 296. In Erris Promotions Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 (HC), a joint venture acquired software at grossly inflated prices funded by non-recourse vendor finance (at \[335\]). The High Court WITHDRAWN 65 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] described the software purchases as an arrangement to avoid tax, with “little commercial reality about the purchases” (at \[329\]). There were no valuations, no technical due diligence, and a superficial inquiry of markets by the purchasers. In some cases, the persons claiming to be the vendors did not own the software and, in others, the software did not exist. The transactions had no commercial base and were essentially a means of creating a tax advantage by creating inflated depreciation losses. Ordinary commercial tensions did not exist between the vendor and purchaser. It was clear from the so-called negotiations between the vendors and purchasers that the higher the price the better (at \[338\]). The higher the price the greater the depreciation losses and the greater the attraction to investors. The duration of the arrangement 297. In some cases, the timing aspects of a transaction may evidence that the transaction has been structured in a manner that has the effect that the facts, features and attributes expected by Parliament for the operation of the provisions are not present (or absent). Timing aspects include the duration of the arrangement and the intervals between particular events in a transaction. For example, the duration of an arrangement may artificially increase the size of a timing or real economic advantage. In Ben Nevis, the tax advantage of the licence premiums was based on the timing difference between, on one hand, incurring expenditure and the amortising licence premiums, and, on the other, the ultimate economic payments to be made in 50 years’ time. The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeal’s description of the mismatch as an unusual feature of the licence premium. The court considered that a consequence of the length of time that had to elapse was that the taxpayer might not actually pay the premium in 2048, for which they had already claimed a depreciation allowance, as the LAQCs might not be in existence and the shareholders may not be still alive. The court also observed that there was likely to be mutual benefit in the arrangement being unwound well before 2048. 298. In Ch’elle, the arrangement involved a mismatch between the invoice and payments bases of accounting for GST. Ch’elle accounted for GST on an invoice basis, while the vendor companies were on a payments basis. The invoice prices for the properties were based on their future value in 10–20 years’ time, with cash settlement also deferred for the same period. This provided for a material GST timing advantage. The Court of Appeal observed that the wider the temporal gap between the taxpayer’s eligibility for an input tax credit and a corresponding liability for output tax, the less likely the arrangement would fall within the intent of the GST Act. In the circumstances of the case, the balance between outputs and inputs was grossly distorted by the 10–20 year delay between input and output recognition. Both the TRA and High Court commented that there was doubt as to whether the output would ever arise because of the length of the deferred settlement and the uncertainty of the underlying contractual arrangements. 299. Duration was relevant in a different way to the court’s findings in Glenharrow. In that case, the Supreme Court found it was unlikely there would be commercial returns given the term of the licence that was part of the arrangement. A t \[51\]: WITHDRAWN 66 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Glenharrow accepted the legal obligation to pay the full price but at the outset the parties were well aware, and any objective observer in 1997 would have seen, that payment in full would certainly not occur. The licence had only a little over three years to run. Whatever the parties may have thought, no renewal was available as a matter of law. The parties themselves believed and the objective observer would have concluded, that it would take two years to get started on mining because of the need first to obtain various consents and approvals. The parties to the arrangement may have had an intention to implement their agreement according to its terms but that was plainly an impossible task. No one has ever suggested that the remainder of the term would suffice for the success of the project to a point where it would produce enough extraction of stone to pay the $45m. There was no prospect of the payment being made by any other means. \[Footnotes omitted\] 300. An other example of where the duration of the arrangement may be a relevant factor in the inquiry into the commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement is where a financial instrument is entered into for an unusually long period. This might indicate a departure from normal practice that, in turn, could indicate that the provisions of the Act are not being applied in the way Parliament contemplated. The duration of an arrangement, however, is merely to be taken into account, rather than being something that gives rise to a rule. It should not be presumed that instruments such as, for example, perpetual notes amount to tax avoidance simply because of their duration. The nature and extent of the financial consequences 301. Considering the nature and extent of the financial consequences that an arrangement has for a taxpayer is at the core of a commercial and economic analysis, and will be necessary to reach a view on whether the facts, features and attributes envisaged by Parliament for the provisions are present (or absent). Examples of this include situations where a taxpayer does not actually suffer the financial consequences for which the tax outcome is claimed (such as where a deduction is claimed but the necessary expenditure is never actually incurred) or where the nature of the transaction is not as claimed (such as where an amount is actually paid for something other than what is claimed). 302. The Supreme Court in Glenharrow took the nature and extent of the financial consequences into account when it summed up its view at \[54\]: ...on an objective view of the present case, the effect of the structure, given the gross disparity between the price and the size of the purchaser and given, particularly, the shrinking value of the asset, with its very limited practical life, was to produce a GST refund totally disproportionate to the economic burden undertaken by Glenharrow or the economic benefit obtained by Mr Meates. Indeed, there can be no issue that Glenharrow undertook liability for the $44,920,000 funded by vendor finance. But Glenharrow was a shell company with a share capital of just $100. And as Mr Meates was unregistered, there was no GST impost on the other side of the transaction. 303. Similarly, in Ben Nevis: \[147\] This is a convenient place at which to revert to the promissory note. The syndicate was contractually liable to pay the second premium in 2047. Payment of that premium was secured by debenture. ... \[The promissory note’s\] true purpose was to enable the contractual debt for the premium to be treated as discharged by the giving of the promissory note. By this means the premium payable in 2047 could be said to have been paid in 1997. As already mentioned, this is technically correct in law, but, in substance, the debt remains unpaid. There is no transfer of real value to the creditor by substituting one form of obligation for another. Hence the promissory note was an artificial payment implemented for taxation purposes. The simple fact is that the second premium was not paid in any real sense by means of the promissory note. The use of the promissory note as an aspect of the whole WITHDRAWN 67 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] arrangement reinforces its artificiality. CSI undertook no real risk and was simply a vehicle to achieve the deductibility of a premium which was not truly paid. The purported payment did not give rise to any economic consequences on either side. \[148\] It is inherent in all we have said on this topic that we regard the insurance dimension of the Trinity scheme as both artificial and contrived. The payment of the second premium by means of the promissory note was, in commercial terms, no payment at all. The economic impact of the payment was deferred for 50 years, that being an extreme use of the proposition that a commitment to pay is equivalent to payment, with the time value of money being ignored. 304. And in Education Administration: \[74\] In my view, the fact that Education Administration had no capital of its own would not in itself be sufficient to bring the arrangement within the ambit of s 76. However, when taken in combination with the other factors I have mentioned, it does assume some significance. Those other factors being the creation of two companies by parties essentially engaged in a joint venture, the inflated hourly rate, the registration of those companies on different accounting bases, the issuing of invoices for the full amount but only requiring immediate payment of 10 per cent, and the contingent nature of the liability to pay the remaining 90 per cent. 305. The Privy Council in Challenge (PC) observed that in a tax avoidance arrangement the financial position of the taxpayer may be unaffected, save for the costs of devising and implementing the arrangement ( at 562). The Board said that by a tax avoidance arrangement the taxpayer seeks to obtain a tax advantage without suffering the reduction in income, the loss or the expenditure that other taxpayers suffer and that Parliament intended to be suffered by any taxpayer qualifying for a reduction in their liability to tax. 306. See also Westpac: \[596\] Specific deductibility provisions are to be invoked where the taxpayer has by the transaction incurred ‘ real economic consequences of the type contemplated by the legislature when the rules were enacted’; and where the taxpayer is ‘engag\[ing\] in business activities for the purpose of making a profit’: Accent at \[126\]. 307. In Penny (SC) and (CA), the taxpayers asserted a reduction in personal services income and sought to obtain the benefit of the lower corporate tax rate while still receiving, in economic terms, the benefit of the company’s entire net income for themselves and their families. In Challenge (CA), the taxpayer company grouped its profits with losses that were suffered by an unrelated company. In that way they sought to take advantage of losses they had not truly incurred in the first place. The taxpayer in Dandelion (CA) sought to claim an interest deduction without actually having suffered the expense. It achieved this by contemporaneously deriving exempt dividend income as part of the circular tax avoidance arrangement. The Court of Appeal commented that there was no financial effect for the taxpayer other than a net outlay of $86,080 and advisory fees, as the exempt dividend funded the deductible interest expense. Is the arrangement artificial or contrived? 308. Artificiality and contrivance have for many years been recognised as strong indicators of tax avoidance, and they are particularly relevant to the examination of the commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement. Often this is because the presence of artificiality and contrivance may indicate an arrangement has been structured in a particular way to ensure the provisions of the Act are applied to the legal WITHDRAWN 68 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] form of the arrangement in a manner that does not reflect the commercial reality and economic effects of that arrangement. In other words, the form of the arrangement is artificial and contrived as it creates the appearance that certain facts, features and attributes are present or absent when that is not the reality of the arrangement. As the Supreme Court stated in Ben Nevis at \[108\]: A classic indicator of a use that is outside Parliamentary contemplation is the structuring of an arrangement so that the taxpayer gains the benefit of the specific provision in an artificial or contrived way. It is not within Parliament's purpose for specific provisions to be used in that manner. \[Emphasis added\] 309. Implicit in the Ben Nevis test is the acceptance that generally Parliament contemplates that provisions apply to transactions that correctly reflect their commercial reality and economic effects. In most cases, therefore, if the provisions are sought to be applied in a way that does not reflect this and their use achieves a tax advantage, the use of the provisions will fall outside Parliament’s contemplation and the arrangement will be a tax avoidance arrangement. A strong indicator would be required from within the Act before a conclusion could be reached that a clearly artificial or contrived use was within Parliament’s contemplation and purpose. 310. As to the meaning of “artificiality” and “contrivance”, the Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2012) defines “artificiality” as the quality of being “artificial”, which in turn includes a situation that “does not occur or result naturally, spontaneously, or in the expected manner” or something which is “...fabricated for a particular purpose, esp. for deception; resulting from artifice; feigned, fictitious”. “Contrivance” is defined as including “ the bringing to pass by planning, scheming, or stratagem; manoeuvring, plotting; deceitful practice” and “the action of inventing or making with thought and skill”. These definitions tend to point to a thing or situation being unnatural or unexpected and emphasise elements of deception or pretence in bringing about a certain outcome. In the case of a tax avoidance arrangement, this outcome would be one where, viewed objectively, the arrangement gains the benefit of specific provisions on the Act in circumstances outside of Parliament’s contemplation. 311. While the courts often refer to artificiality and contrivance as indicators of avoidance, none have comprehensively analysed what is meant by these terms. In Seramco Ltd Superannuation Fund Trustees v Commissioner of Income Tax \[1977\] AC 287 (PC) Lord Diplock considered (at 298) that “artificial” was not “a term of legal art” and was “capable of bearing a variety of meanings according to the context in which it is used”. N. Orow, in General Anti-Avoidance Rules: A Comparative International Analysis (Jordans, Bristol, 2000) at 28, identifies four distinct but related concepts of artificiality that have been used by the courts internationally in the anti-avoidance context. These refer to the extent to which a transaction: • is abnormal or uncommon; • lacks any business or other non-tax purpose; • deviates from economic reality; • is structured in such a way or takes a particular form that is contrary to legislative intentions and objectives as expressed in the Act. WITHDRAWN 69 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 312. The first sense in which courts sometimes use the term “ artificiality” is that of something that is abnormal or uncommon (see, for example, Commissioner of Taxpayer Audit and Assessment v Cigarette Co of Jamaica Ltd (in liq) \[2012\] UKPC 9, \[2012\] 1 WLR 1794 at \[22\]). While abnormal or uncommon structures might indicate tax avoidance, some qualifying comments should be made. A structure in common usage can still be a tax avoidance arrangement. Accordingly, just because a tax avoidance arrangement may have become widely used, for instance, where a scheme is used by several taxpayers in an industry, will not make it any less an avoidance arrangement. It is also true that the mere fact a transaction has unusual aspects will not necessarily be suggestive of tax avoidance. Innovation, novelty, uniqueness and new products may be unassociated with tax avoidance. On the other hand, unusual commercial practice may be indicative of a tax avoidance arrangement. Harrison J, in Westpac, said that novelty is “sometimes” associated with avoidance (at \[581\]), although i t was not relevant in the case before him. In Tayles (CA), the Court of Appeal said at 737: But I would not regard the novelty of the scheme as sufficient in itself to bring it within s 108. Nevertheless novelty may be relevant in that a documentary structure not consonant with normal commercial practice may go some distance towards giving it the character of business unreality and taking it outside the ambit of what is ordinary family dealing. 313. In many instances, the relevant unusual aspect when considering tax avoidance is that the arrangement does not give the commercial returns that would be expected in arm’s length transactions. 314. Another sense of “artificiality” sometimes used by the courts is the lack of any business or other non-tax purpose which is not, in itself, a component of the Parliamentary contemplation test. While is it true that an arrangement that exhibits a complete lack of business or other non-tax avoidance purposes would be very likely to be a tax avoidance arrangement, the lack of any business or other non-tax avoidance purpose is not the reason it would be a tax avoidance arrangement. Something is tax avoidance if the arrangement, when the commercial and economic reality is understood, lacks the facts, features and attributes that need to be present or absent to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. The relevance of commercial or other non-tax avoidance purposes to the Parliamentary contemplation test is discussed below at paragraphs 358 to 359 and 362 to 371. 315. The other two concepts mentioned in paragraph 311 above—arrangements that deviate from economic reality and arrangements that are structured in such a way that is contrary to legislative intentions and objectives—are relevant to the Parliamentary contemplation test. They capture the idea of the structure disguising the reality of the arrangement so as to obtain tax results that would not otherwise be obtainable. In these senses of artificiality an arrangement is artificial in that it disguises the commercial and economic reality, making it appear that the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect are present or absent in the arrangement when that is not the commercial and economic reality. 316. Undue complexity is also a concept that is sometimes referred to in relation to artificiality or contrivance. However, complexity does not necessarily equate to tax avoidance. An arrangement that is artificially structured so that it uses the Act in a way Parliament did not contemplate may still be a relatively simple transaction. Equally, the fact an WITHDRAWN 70 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] arrangement is complex does not necessarily mean the arrangement uses the Act in a way that is outside Parliament’s contemplation. It is true, however, that complexity, and particularly complex steps that do not achieve or alter commercial or economic outcomes, will often indicate that the form of the arrangement does not reflect the commercial and economic reality. Such situations will raise questions about whether the necessary facts, features and attributes are present (or absent). 317. The following cases are some examples of where a court has held that the arrangement or elements of the arrangement were artificial and/or contrived, in the sense of being unusual commercial practice. Ben Nevis involved investors in a LAQC that purported to incur expenditure for insurance and licence premiums on an accelerated basis prior to the actual cash outlay to occur some 50 years in the future. The court said at \[119\]: The commercial aspects must, however, be considered because the context is suggestive of tax avoidance. In part that is because requiring that promissory notes be given, before the expenditure was to be incurred in reality, introduced an artificial element into the arrangement. From a business point of view the promissory note was a gratuitous mechanism. We do not accept the appellants' argument that it secured or facilitated the payment of the licence premium by the syndicate in 2048 in any real sense. 318. At \[120\], the court said there were two other unusual features of the arrangement. One was that there was a “real risk that the ... scheme will never be a profitable one”. The second was the timing mismatch between when expenditure is legally incurred and the point at which it is required to be paid in an economic sense. In relation to the insurance dimension of the scheme, the court found on the facts: \[142\] As at 31 March 1997 CSI was formally incorporated and registered in the British Virgin Islands. It had been incorporated and registered there on the instructions of Dr Muir, the architect of the Trinity scheme. Dr Muir was instrumental in formulating CSI’s business plan which must be good evidence of the purpose for which CSI was established. It is not unreasonable to say that CSI was a single purpose company, without any independent substance, brought into being to provide pro forma insurance cover in terms of which the investors in the scheme could achieve substantial tax advantages by deduction of the second premium, without suffering any corresponding economic outlay. 319. The court found it significant that the insurance company did not undertake other insurance business, and the emphasis on secrecy was “hardly consistent with CSI being an arm’s length insurer” (at \[143\]). The court also commented that 90% of the initial premiums were paid to a company that was under the control of the architect of the scheme on terms providing that the loans were not repayable until 2047. The court said at \[144\]: Whether this was justifiable in strictly legal terms is not our present concern, but it demonstrates the extremely unorthodox nature of what was going on. 320. The Supreme Court in Glenharrow, after noting that the price agreed on was the subject of a genuine bargain, said at \[51\]: But, even on that basis, the arrangement still had a very artificial element: the price was not paid in economic terms, even though as between the parties a debt was discharged. In this case it is not the price but the “payment” that created the distorting effect. Glenharrow accepted the legal obligation to pay the full price but at the outset the parties were well aware, and any objective observer in 1997 would have seen, that payment in full would certainly not occur. WITHDRAWN 71 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 321. In Penny (SC), the court said in several places that the level of salary paid was artificially low. The taxpayers had agreed in evidence that the salaries were at levels substantially below what could have been expected had they been employed independently at arm’s length (see \[24\]). 322. In the Court of Appeal decision in Penny (CA), Randerson J found not only that the level of salaries were artificial, but also that the transactions to transfer goodwill were not commercial: \[124\] There are further facts which tend to emphasise the artificiality of the arrangement. For example, when Mr Hooper established his company, the goodwill paid was only $300,000 representing less than half his net annual income before tax. And, in Mr Penny's case, the goodwill paid by POS was a mere $100,000 and was then increased to just over $1 million at the time of the immediate on-sale to OSCL. The ten year employment contract he entered into with POS was not in fact assigned to OSCL and, in any event, was not sufficiently substantial to justify such a large goodwill figure. In reality, the company was most unlikely to have enforced the contract against the wishes of Mr Penny, yet the $1 million goodwill figure enabled him to receive a tax-free capital dividend of $900,000 from POS. 323. In BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), the High Court concluded that the structured finance transactions entered into by the BNZ were tax avoidance. In simple terms, the arrangements involved a “circular” transaction where the BNZ claimed tax deductible expenditure through fixed rate swap payments and a guarantee procurement fee (GPF) and derived effectively exempt income (because of conduit tax relief or having foreign tax credits attached). The High Court concluded that the GPF was a contrivance and its primary function was to create a deductible expense. Instead of the normal commercial tension between one party trying to negotiate the GPF down and the other trying to get it up as high as it could, there was a common interest for both the BNZ and the counterparty to set the GPF as high as possible. This would generate larger tax benefits to be shared between the parties. 324. The High Court also thought the swap was artificial and contrived: \[388\] I conclude that the setting of the fixed swap rate well in advance of the transaction, and/or the failure to re-set it shortly before the transaction closed, was not in accordance with normal commercial practice. Given the analysis I have set out at \[380\]–\[384\], and the differences in the table at \[396\], I find this was contrived to increase the tax benefits flowing from the transactions. For example, when the rate was fixed for the Gen Re 1 and CSFB transactions, the NZ yield curve was significantly downward sloping ie shorter term swap rates were significantly higher than longer term swap rates. Thus, by taking the one year rate the BNZ artificially boosted the tax benefits from those two transactions. Mr Stanton calculated that this boosted the annual tax reductions obtained by the BNZ by NZ$2 million approximately in the Gen Re 1 transaction, and by NZ$1.5 million in the CSFB transaction (PB 5.42–5.43). 325. The High Court considered the level of funding provided by the counterparty and degree of return to be relevant: \[423\] At peril of unnecessarily dealing further with this aspect, I think there is a point to be made. Its relevance is that it further evidences how exceptional the level of funding obtained by the counterparty was, compared with conventional returns on structured transactions. 326. The court concluded by stating (amongst other things) at \[526\]: e) The transactions generated the claimed deductible expenses in a contrived or artificial way: WITHDRAWN 72 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • The 2.95% pa GPF was a contrivance. A guarantee from the parent of the counterparty would have been forthcoming for no fee, or for a fee of no more than 0.65% pa. • The BNZ contrived to set the fixed rate on the interest rate swap at the highest rate it thought defensible, and in the case of some of the transactions this was significantly outside market parameters. 327. In summary, the terms “artificiality” and “contrivance” can have several meanings but, in the context of tax avoidance, together they involve the concept that an arrangement can deviate from commercial and economic reality by being structured in a way that disguises that reality. Artificiality and contrivance can then contribute to making it appear as if the arrangement involves (or does not involve) the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present or absent to give effect to the relevant provisions of the Act. In this sense, they are strong indicators that an arrangement involves tax avoidance. Does the arrangement involve pretence? 328. The existence of pretence has long been recognised by the courts as an indicator of tax avoidance. In Ben Nevis, it was observed that “whether an arrangement is an artifice or involves a pretence will often be highly relevant to whether there is an arrangement that has a purpose of tax avoidance” (at \[97\]). Again, the main relevance of this factor lies in whether there is a pretence that the facts, features and attributes are present (or absent) when the commercial and economic reality is that they are not. Where some aspects of the transaction may not actually be, or produce, what they claim, this will impact upon whether Parliament would have contemplated the particular tax outcome for that transaction. In Challenge (PC), the taxpayer entered into an arrangement to acquire an unrelated loss company to offset the losses against the taxpayer’s assessable income. The Privy Council commented that most tax avoidance involves a pretence and described the Challenge group as pretending to suffer the losses, when in truth they were suffered by unrelated companies (at 562). 329. The taxpayer in Dandelion (CA) entered into a “financing” transaction for the sole purpose of obtaining an interest deduction under an arrangement whereby the taxpayer derived exempt dividend income of approximately the same amount. Interest was deductible under a provision that permitted interest deductions on money borrowed to acquire shares in another group company. The Court of Appeal, confirming the application of s 99, described the transaction as an “artifice involving pretence and not a real group investment transaction at all”. 330. The concept of “pretence” for tax avoidance purposes needs to be distinguished from a sham. A sham is intended to mislead the Commissioner into viewing documentation as representing what the parties have agreed when in fact it does not actually record the true agreement. In the majority of tax avoidance cases, taxpayers will not enter into an arrangement to perpetrate a sham, as they will be relying on the black letter law to deliver the intended tax consequences. In the tax avoidance context, a pretence generally reflects a situation where, although the contractual arrangements are to be respected, the commercial or economic reality of the arrangement is quite different. WITHDRAWN 73 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Is the arrangement circular? 331. The circularity of movements of money in an arrangement is often an indicator of tax avoidance. This is because it will often result in a transaction being self-cancelling or otherwise that the economic outcomes claimed for tax are not in fact sustained. 332. Examples of circularity from case law include BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), as noted at paragraph 323 above, and the majority decision of the Privy Council in the Peterson (PC) case. In Peterson (PC) the majority observed that the “circular movement of money sometimes conceals the fact that there is no underlying activity at all” (at \[45\]). As part of the reasoning in Dandelion (CA) that the arrangement was tax avoidance, the Court of Appeal observed that the “transaction was circular in its inception and unwinding”. In Glenharrow, the court gave the example of parties inflating the price of goods in return for a non-recourse loan to the purchaser by the vendor. (A non-recourse loan is a loan under which repayment of the loan is limited to the collateral securing the loan, and the lender cannot hold the borrower personally liable in the event of a default.) In the court’s example the purchaser would obtain the advantage of a higher input tax deduction and a refund of GST. The High Court in Erris Promotions concluded that the arrangements to acquire software for grossly inflated prices, accompanied by the vendor providing non-recourse loans, were tax avoidance arrangements enabling investors to access inflated depreciation deductions. 333. In Ben Nevis, circularity was relevant in identifying that there was no commercial reality to the insurance arrangements: \[146\] The letter of comfort dated 3 February 1997 given to CSI by the Trinity Foundation Charitable Trust, which was the ultimate beneficial owner of the Trinity Foundation, demonstrates that although technically CSI was at risk, it was, at least in part, an indemnified risk leading to a substantial element of circularity in the whole insurance arrangement. 334. However, transactions may demonstrate some elements of circularity without being offensive. Harrison J in Westpac, while referring to Peterson (PC) at \[45\], said that circularity in this context is a catchphrase frequently cited but infrequently enlightening. In that case, his Honour thought there was no circularity of the type the Privy Council identified because the payments made discharged a genuine contractual liability (Westpac at \[580\]). Many transactions will demonstrate some elements of circularity without being offensive. For example, the borrowing and repaying of money could be said to be circular in one sense. 335. However, in the context of tax avoidance, what is relevant is circularity that leads to the effective neutralisation or distortion of the economic outcomes. The use of circular arrangements may disguise the reality of the absence of genuine economic outlays. Thus, when taking into account form alone, circularity is often encountered in a tax avoidance context when different parts of a circular movement of funds are afforded different tax treatments, such as an arrangement where expenditure is claimed to be deductible but the equivalent receipt is not assessable. An example of circular movement of funds can be found in Dandelion (CA). 336. Circularity is often accompanied by inflated expenditure or reduced levels of income, which is discussed next. WITHDRAWN 74 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Does the arrangement involve inflated expenditure or reduced levels of income? 337. The courts have often found that where amounts of expenditure or income are greater, or less, than might be expected, they may not reflect the economic reality. In Education Administration, French J said that “another important feature of the arrangement was the high hourly rate” charged by the taxpayer’s company. French J said the higher the hourly rate, the larger each invoice and the larger the resulting GST refund (at \[62\], \[66\] and \[67\]). 338. Accordingly, in understanding the commercial and economic reality of an arrangement, it will be relevant to understand how the amounts under the arrangement are arrived at. The court in Ben Nevis commented that there was no evidence that the amount of over two million dollars per plantable hectare was fixed on any assessment of the value of the land or of its use (at \[124\]). Later, the court said there did not appear to have been any independent assessment of the cost of undertaking the risk under the insurance contract (at \[133\]). 339. In Westpac, Harrison J said: \[439\] In summary, I am not satisfied that Westpac has identified a reliable open market value for the GPFs in the relevant years between 1999 and 2002. The bank’s credit enhancement approach could not provide an accurate or realistic measure of fair value. But, if that was possible, I repeat that the GPFs actually agreed did not satisfy any objective or fair measure of value and were not within an acceptable market range. 340. And, in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), Wild J found: • The fixed interest rate in at least two of the transactions was well out of line with the market rate (at \[404\]); • The guarantee procurement fee was substantially overpriced (at \[511\]); • The returns to the BNZ and counterparties via a structured finance transaction were substantially in excess of what could have been expected from a risk free investment negotiated at arm’s length (at \[526\]). 341. As mentioned, a circular flow of money may often be associated in an avoidance context with inflated expenditure and used to increase the tax benefits of the arrangement. One mechanism used is a non-recourse loan (although the presence of a non-recourse loan does not necessarily mean there is avoidance). 342. Erris Promotions is an example of inflated expenditure and circular flows of money. The High Court in that case said that the inflation of the purchase price of the software packages was an important feature of the arrangement and an indicator of tax avoidance (at \[335\]). 343. In other arrangements, particularly those involving altering levels of income, amounts of income received under an arrangement may be low. The Court of Appeal in Penny (CA) noted that the taxpayers accepted “without hesitation” that the salaries they received under the arrangement were at levels substantially below what could have been expected if they had been employed independently at arm’s length (at \[114\]). In Russell (HC), the High Court observed that the salary Mr Russell received bore no WITHDRAWN 75 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] relationship to the work Mr Russell undertook or to salaries payable in the marketplace (at \[131\]). Have the parties undertaken real risks? 344. It is a common feature of avoidance arrangements that the tax consequences sought suggest participants are undertaking financial or commercial risks, when in fact there are no or minimal risks. 345. In Glenharrow, the purchaser company paid the $45 million purchase price (ignoring the $80,000 deposit actually paid) and contemporaneously received vendor finance from Mr Meates of the same amount. Glenharrow was capitalised to $100 and its shareholder, Mr Fahey, did not provide a personal guarantee. The vendor finance was secured by way of mortgage over the licence so that, on default by Glenharrow, Mr Meates would simply receive his licence back. Had s 76 of the GST Act not applied, t he effect of the transaction would have been that Mr Fahey was never personally at risk for the $45 million and Glenharrow would have had the benefit of a $5 million GST credit. 346. The High Court in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC) commented that there was no risk for either party, other than the tax risk for the BNZ (at \[523\]). In Erris Promotions, there was no risk to the investors for the payment of the grossly inflated purchase price as the vendor provided 100% finance with no recourse beyond repossession of the software (at \[339\]). 347. In Dandelion (CA), the Court of Appeal concluded there was no risk to the taxpayer arising from the arrangement. This was because the taxpayer borrowed from a third party and effectively reinvested through a tax haven with that third party. The taxpayer, therefore, did not use its own funds and the counterparty received back on the same day the cash it outlaid. In terms of the taxpayer’s obligation to repay the loan, the effect of the security arrangements was that the taxpayer was not obliged to repay the loan unless it had received repayment of the fund from its investment. Relevance of an arrangement being pre-tax negative 348. A transaction where a party is worse off financially before tax is taken into account can be described as “pre-tax negative”. Where the tax effect is what makes the arrangement profitable, the arrangement can be described as “pre-tax negative, post-tax positive”. The relevance of a transaction being considered to be pre-tax negative, post-tax positive was discussed in Peterson (PC) at \[44\] and BNZ Investments No 2 (HC). In BNZ Investments No 2 (HC) the court stated: \[462\] In Petersen \[sic \] at \[44\] the Privy Council stated the legal position in this way: “Tax relief often makes the difference between profit and loss after tax is taken into account; and the transaction does not become tax avoidance merely because it does so ... (my emphasis) \[463\] It follows that the fact that the BNZ provided the NZ$500 million funding in each of these transactions at substantially less (up to 2.5% less) than its cost of funds is a factor for me in deciding whether these transactions were tax avoidance arrangements. It certainly is not conclusive. It is best approached as one aspect of viewing the transactions in a commercially and economically realistic way, and I now do that. WITHDRAWN 76 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 349. The Commissioner agrees with the statement that a pre-tax negative, post-tax positive arrangement is not necessarily a tax avoidance arrangement. However, it can be a significant indicator of tax avoidance. As Wild J said in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), lending or investing at a substantial loss is a “classic indicator” of tax avoidance (at \[512\]): see also Westpac (at \[529\] and \[546\]), Miller (PC) and Dandelion (CA). Some misconceptions about the concept of commercial and economic reality 350. When examining an arrangement to establish the commercial and economic reality, there are s everal points that, in the Commissioner’s opinion, are important but are not always well understood. In brief, they are: • the inquiry is not limited to the legal form; • an arrangement may still be a tax avoidance arrangement even if it has commercial or other non-tax avoidance purposes; • the relevance of commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes; • examining the economic effects does not involve identifying arrangements that are economically equivalent. The inquiry is not limited to the legal form 351. The point has already been made that the s BG 1 inquiry is not limited to the legal form of the arrangement when considering the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement. It has occasionally been suggested that the idea that the legal form can be ignored under s BG 1 is contrary to legal principle. However, it is well-established in the case law that legal form may be ignored under s BG 1 . The courts have consistently contrasted the purely legal or juristic analysis with the commercial reality of an arrangement. In the Commissioner’s view, the courts’ reference in these cases to a commercial perspective being applied should not be regarded as different from the Ben Nevis commercial and economic reality concept. Economic impacts and effects would be taken into account in any commercial perspective. This is illustrated in Challenge (PC), where the Privy Council acknowledged the necessity to consider the commercial reality of an arrangement, finding the reality in that case was that Challenge never suffered the loss claimed. In Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Auckland Harbour Board \[2001\] 3 NZLR 289 (PC) at \[11\], the Privy Council said the anti-avoidance provision is: ...aimed at transactions which in commercial terms fall within the charge to tax but have been, intentionally or otherwise, structured in such a way that on a purely juristic analysis they do not. 352. In Miller (PC) at \[10\], the Board drew the distinction between viewing an arrangement in commercial terms as a single arrangement and simply analysing the juristic form of each of its parts. 353. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis specifically approved of the approach adopted by the Privy Council in Challenge (PC) and later decisions to consider the commercial and economic reality of a transaction and to contrast that with the legal form: \[95\] Subsequent case law generally has proceeded, sometimes implicitly, on the basis of this scheme and purpose approach, but consistently with the underlying WITHDRAWN 77 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] reasoning of the Privy Council by paying attention to whether the commercial reality of a transaction is consistent with its legal form. ... The underlying reasoning of the Privy Council was later encapsulated by reference to the “commercial” meaning as against the “juristic” meaning of a specific provision. Whatever terminology is used, the important aspect of Challenge Corporation, however, is the underlying approach. 354. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis confirmed that the courts are not limited to the legal form of an arrangement and that an arrangement must be viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way: \[109\] In considering these matters, the courts are not limited to purely legal considerations. They should also consider the use made of the specific provision in the light of the commercial reality and the economic effect of that use. The ultimate question is whether the impugned arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the specific provision in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. If that is so, the arrangement will not, by reason of that use, be a tax avoidance arrangement. If the use of the specific provision is beyond Parliamentary contemplation, its use in that way will result in the arrangement being a tax avoidance arrangement. 355. In Penny (SC), the court looked at the reality of the whole arrangement, rather than confining itself to looking solely at the structure used. The court said at \[34\]: Whether that \[arrangement\] involved tax avoidance can be answered by looking at the effect produced by the fixing of the level of the salary in combination with the operation of the other features of the structure. 356. The Supreme Court found the arrangement to be a tax avoidance arrangement, despite the fact the structures used were “entirely lawful and unremarkable” (at \[33\]). See also, Randerson J in the Court of Appeal, where his Honour stated: \[110\] The Supreme Court has made it clear in Ben Nevis that the adoption of legitimate legal structures or entities will not be a barrier to a finding of tax avoidance if the arrangements are artificial, contrived, or amount to a pretence. Findings of that character will be influenced by assessing them in the light of commercial reality and the economic effect of the arrangements. The conclusion of the Supreme Court in this respect is supported by a substantial body of precedent both in this Court and the Privy Council. \[Emphasis added\] 357. Also, in Westpac, Harrison J stated: \[195\] I read Ben Nevis as prescribing a combined form and substance test. An analysis of the form or nature of the contractual relationship remains as the starting point in a tax avoidance inquiry; I agree with Mr Farmer that Ben Nevis does not authorise a court to bypass the legal structure and move straight to a substance assessment ... \[196\] Conversely, the legal structure cannot shield a transaction from substantive scrutiny where the general anti-avoidance provision is invoked: Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136 (CA) per Richardson J at 168; Buckley & Young Ltd v C of IR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271; \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485 (CA) per Richardson J at NZTC 61,276; NZLR 490; Glenharrow at \[40\]. Mr Farmer does not suggest otherwise or that the form of the transaction prevails over its substance. The ratio of Ben Nevis at \[107\] and \[108\] is, I think, designed to prescribe the permissible scope of the substance inquiry. \[Emphasis added\] An arrangement may still be a tax avoidance arrangement even if it has commercial or other non-tax avoidance purposes 358. Often taxpayers will point to or assert a commercial or other non-tax purpose or driver for an arrangement, thinking it to be a defence against WITHDRAWN 78 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the application of s BG 1. However, the legislation explicitly provides that a tax avoidance arrangement may have more than one purpose, and those other purposes may not be tax avoidance purposes. The section was amended in 1974 to make clear that an arrangement could be a tax avoidance arrangement whether or not other purposes of the arrangement were referable to ordinary business or family dealings (see the discussion in Ben Nevis at \[81\]). This change was made to counteract the case law that had held an arrangement would only be a tax avoidance arrangement if the sole or principal purpose of the arrangement was to avoid tax (see the Privy Council in Mangin at 598). 359. It follows from the legislation, therefore, that the question of whether an arrangement makes use of the provisions within Parliament’s contemplation is not answered simply by pointing to the existence of commercial or other non-tax avoidance purposes of the arrangement. Consequently, the existence of a commercial purpose does not prevent, and is not in any way inconsistent with, the consideration of whether s BG 1 applies. The relevance of non-tax avoidance purposes to s BG 1 360. Non-tax avoidance purposes, including commercial purposes, may be relevant to considering the application of s BG 1, but their relevance will depend on the particular aspect of s BG 1 being considered. Analysing the application of s BG 1 is not a general inquiry into non-tax avoidance purposes. The following paragraphs discuss how and when non-tax avoidance purposes can be relevant. The rel evance of non-tax avoidance purposes to understanding the arrangement 361. First, identifying commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes is part of understanding the arrangement. As discussed from paragraph 136, it is important that the arrangement is fully understood. It may be helpful in reaching this initial understanding to take into account explanations for the commercial or other aims sought, and whether any commercial or other non-tax outcomes were achieved. It is only once the arrangement is fully understood that the inquiry can turn to an analysis of whether the arrangement involves tax avoidance, and then, if it does, to the question of whether any tax avoidance purposes are merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose. However, as will be outlined below, some of the information considered when reaching an understanding of the arrangement will not be relevant when applying the Parliamentary contemplation or merely incidental tests. The r elevance of non-tax avoidance purposes to the Parliamentary contemplation test 362. Taxpayers often argue that the fact that non-tax avoidance purposes exist is relevant to the Parliamentary contemplation test. The Commissioner disagrees with this argument and considers that: • Commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes are not, of themselves, directly relevant to the test. • If commercial and other non-tax purposes coincide with the facts, features and attributes Parliament would have expected, then they may be relevant. WITHDRAWN 79 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • Some things that may be incorrectly described as commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes are not relevant. These are discussed in more detail below. 363. According to the court in Ben Nevis, the test to be applied is whether the taxpayer’s use of the Act is consistent with Parliament’s contemplation. Nowhere did the court indicate that the existence of non-tax purposes was relevant to this inquiry. As discussed, the Commissioner considers that determining tax avoidance using the Parliamentary contemplation test requires identifying the facts, features and attributes necessary to give effect to Parliament’s relevant purpose for the provisions used, or those provisions that potentially do not apply. When the arrangement is examined, it is to see if those facts, features and attributes are present (or absent) in the arrangement to the degree necessary, as a matter of commercial and economic reality. Therefore, commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes are not directly relevant to the Parliamentary contemplation test. 364. If, however, the commercial and other non-tax purposes coincide with the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present or absent, they will be considered. However, if they do not, they will not generally be helpful in determining whether Parliament’s purposes are being fulfilled. For this reason, the Parliamentary contemplation test is not a general inquiry into all of the non-tax avoidance purposes achieved under an arrangement. Nor does the exercise of identifying the commercial and economic reality relevant to the provisions at issue simply involve pointing to the various commercial features of an arrangement. 365. The Commissioner considers this is what Harrison J in Westpac meant when he made the point that the exercise to understand the commercial and economic reality is a different one from that of identifying any commercial purposes: \[590\] I agree with Mr Farmer that each transaction had a genuine commercial purpose. In my judgment the structural aspects, and in particular its taxation benefits, do not derogate from the existence of an objectively ascertainable commercial purpose. That purpose must be distinguished from the transaction’s underlying commerciality or business viability. They are conceptually separate. 366. So, the Parliamentary contemplation test is concerned with determining the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement, and that is not necessarily the same exercise as identifying any commercial or non-tax avoidance purposes. For example, if a provision applies to the owner of an asset for the depreciation rules, examining whether the taxpayer is commercially and economically the owner of that asset will be relevant. T hat the arrangement also had an effect that is unrelated to the depreciation provisions, such as the raising of finance, may not be relevant when determining what Parliament contemplated for the use of that depreciation provision. 367. Another illustration is where an arrangement is not subject to the land sale provisions of the Act because of the non-application of the rules relating to associated persons. In such a circumstance the taxpayers may argue that a purpose of the arrangement is to put in place a structure that will enable the taxpayer’s family members to have an interest in the business. As the question is whether the associated persons provisions have been circumvented, examining whether, when the arrangement is viewed in a WITHDRAWN 80 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] commercially and economically realistic way, the parties are in fact associated will be relevant. The fact that the arrangement may also enable other family members to have an interest in the business does not help with this inquiry. The reasons for the structure may be pertinent later when considering whether any tax avoidance is merely incidental to another purpose. In Ben Nevis, when reaching a view on whether the use of the Act was tax avoidance, the court did not identify the commercial purpose of forestry investment as being relevant. 368. It might be thought by some that the Commissioner’s view on this issue appears to be inconsistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in Penny (SC). T he court there appeared to have some regard for commercial purposes, which may have affected the setting of the salary levels, when considering the Parliamentary contemplation test and whether the arrangement amounted to tax avoidance. In the Commissioner’s view, on a close analysis of the judgment the court should be interpreted as examining commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes in relation to the merely incidental test. This can be seen where the court stated at \[49\]: Parliament must have contemplated and been content that people may structure their transactions for commercial reasons or for family reasons in which any tax advantage is merely incidental, but that they will not be permitted to do so when tax avoidance is more than a merely incidental purpose or effect of the steps they have taken. 369. Even so, if the taxpayer’s commercial and non-tax avoidance purposes coincide with the things that Parliament would have expected would be present or absent, they will be considered in the Parliamentary contemplation test. In Penny (SC), the arrangement had the apparent effect that the taxpayers received just salary income and the company derived the remainder of the income relating to their personal services. The commercial and economic reality, however, was that they still received the full benefit of the income and effectively derived it. The court said that if, instead, the money had stayed in the company and the taxpayer or their families had not received the benefit of the money, the commercial and economic reality would have been different. The Supreme Court said at \[34\]: ... If, for example, in one year the salary was set so as to absorb all the company profits, it could hardly be said that any avoidance was involved. Similarly, the salary might be set at a relatively low level because the company had a commercial need to retain funds in order to make a capital expenditure. Again, no question of avoidance could arise. That would also be the position if the company was experiencing financial difficulties or reasonably considered that it might do so in the future, and could not afford to pay the family member employee the equivalent of a commercial rate for the time being, or reasonably took the view that it was not in the meantime financially prudent to do so. 370. The discussion so far has been about non-tax avoidance purposes that are achieved under the arrangement. There are other things that might be described as non-tax avoidance purposes that are not relevant to the Parliamentary contemplation test. Remembering that the inquiry is only concerned with the arrangement, and with what is objectively achieved under the arrangement, it will not be relevant in reaching a view on how the Parliamentary contemplation test applies to consider: • purposes that are claimed to be achieved but on the facts are not achieved; WITHDRAWN 81 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • subjective purposes and motivations for entering into an arrangement. 371. As was set out in the discussion above on “purpose or effect”, the courts have made it clear that subjective elements are not part of the s BG 1 test. Courtney J in Krukziener said at \[15\]: Evidence of what Mr Krukziener and other witnesses actually said and did at the relevant times is relevant and helpful. However, subjective evidence of what they claim to have believed or intended is not. See also Newton, Ashton (PC), Tayles (CA), Glenharrow and Alesco (CA). The relevance of non-ta x avoidance purposes to the “merely incidental” test 372. Non-tax avoidance purposes will be more directly relevant later in the s BG 1 inquiry when considering whether any tax avoidance purpose identified is merely incidental to any non-tax avoidance purpose. This stage of the analysis is discussed later in this statement (from paragraph 395). Briefly, a tax avoidance purpose or effect will be merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose of an arrangement if it follows as a natural concomitant of the non-tax avoidance purpose and it is not in any way pursued as an end in itself. If the tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental, the arrangement will not be a tax avoidance arrangement. Summary of when non-t ax avoidance purposes may be relevant 373. Non-tax avoidance purposes may be relevant at the initial stage of reaching an understanding of the arrangement, before the Parliamentary contemplation and merely incidental tests are considered. 374. Non-tax avoidance purposes may be relevant to the Parliamentary contemplation stage of the inquiry in a particular case if they coincide with the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present or absent. 375. Non-tax avoidance purposes not achieved and subjective purposes are not relevant. 376. Non-tax avoidance purposes will be relevant when considering whether a tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to a commercial or other non-tax avoidance purpose of the arrangement. Examining the economic effects does not involve identifying arrangements that are economically equivalent 377. Identifying the economic effects of an arrangement should not be confused with an approach that considers economic equivalence. Economic equivalence looks at identifying an arrangement, or one of several arrangements, that is economically equivalent to the arrangement entered into. In contrast, identifying the commercial reality and economic effects involves identifying the real commercial and economic outcomes of the arrangement actually entered into, with a view to seeing whether the facts, features and attributes Parliament would have expected for the operation of the provisions are present. WITHDRAWN 82 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Summary of points about the commercial reality and economic effects of an arrangement 378. The commercial and economic reality of an arrangement is examined to see whether the use of the provisions is within Parliament’s purpose. I n particular, the arrangement is examined to see whether, as a matter of commercial and economic reality, the facts, features and attributes required to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose for the provisions in question are in fact present (or absent) and to what degree. Understanding what is actually achieved requires a complete understanding of the facts and a thorough grasp of the detail and workings of the arrangement as a whole. Identification of the commercial reality and economic effects is not limited by the form of the arrangement. 379. Determining whether a tax avoidance arrangement exists involves a consideration of various factors set out in Ben Nevis, including: • the manner in which the arrangement is carried out; • the role of all relevant parties and their relationships; • the economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions; • the duration of the arrangement; • the nature and extent of the financial consequences; • the presence of artificiality or contrivance. 380. Some other useful factors in this context are: • the presence of pretence; • the presence of circularity; • the presence of inflated expenditure or reduced levels of income; • the undertaking of real risks by the parties; • the relevance of an arrangement being pre-tax negative. 381. Consideration of these factors will help when reaching a view on whether the facts, features and attributes are present (or absent) as a matter of commercial and economic reality, and to what degree. The relevance of factors will depend on the provisions used, or the potentially relevant provisions that do not apply, and what facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present (or absent). 382. The existence of a commercial purpose does not prevent the application of s BG 1. Commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes put forward for a particular arrangement are not, of themselves, directly relevant to the Parliamentary contemplation test. I f they coincide with the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present or absent, they will be considered. However, if they do not, they will not generally be helpful in determining whether Parliament’s purposes are being fulfilled. Commercial and other non-tax avoidance purposes may be relevant when considering the merely incidental test. 383. Identifying the economic effects of an arrangement does not involve identifying an arrangement that is economically equivalent. WITHDRAWN 83 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Apply the Parliamentary contemplation test to reach a view on tax avoidance 384. Having discussed the two elements of the Parliamentary contemplation test in detail, the test can now be applied: Does the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, make use of the Act in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose? 385. To do this, each of the steps discussed in the paragraphs above are worked through. To summarise, these are: Ascertain Parliament’s purpose • Ascertain Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions from their text, the statutory context (including the statutory scheme relevant to the provisions), case law and any relevant extrinsic material. Parliament’s purpose for combinations of provisions may need to be identified at this step. • Then identify any facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to that purpose. ( It may not be necessary, or even possible, to identify these with absolute precision.) Commercial and economic reality • Examine the whole arrangement with a view to determining its commercial reality and economic effects, having particular regard to the facts, features and attributes that need to be present or absent to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. Use relevant factors, including those from Ben Nevis at \[108\], to see whether, and to what degree, the facts, features and attributes are present as a matter of commercial and economic reality. 386. Consideration of the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement may raise further questions as to Parliament’s purpose in the context of the particular arrangement. If necessary, repeat these steps until Parliament’s purpose has been sufficiently ascertained. 387. The question is then, taking into account all of the above, does the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, use (or circumvent) the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose? It may be necessary to exercise judgment over whether any of the requisite facts, features and attributes are present or absent to a sufficient degree. 388. There are some examples from page 95 illustrating how this analytical approach is worked through. Not all complex fact situations or undesirable policy outcomes amount to tax avoidance 389. The Commissioner recognises that not all uses or non-applications of the Act constitute tax avoidance. Section BG 1 will not apply merely because of a particularly complex or unusual set of facts, undesirable policy outcomes, or very substantial tax advantages compared to alternative structures. WITHDRAWN 84 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 390. As a first point, it should be noted that Parliament contemplates that transactions and arrangements may be structured in different ways. Taxpayers may structure arrangements to their best tax advantage, provided the use of the provisions is within what Parliament would have contemplated. In Ben Nevis, the court stated: \[111\] The appellants made a sustained plea that the courts should not deprive commercial and other parties of tax beneficial choices. On the approach we have set out, taxpayers have the freedom to structure transactions to their best tax advantage. They may utilise available tax incentives in whatever way the applicable legislative text, read in the light of its context and purpose, permits. They cannot, however, do so in a way that is proscribed by the general anti-avoidance provision. 391. The Supreme Court in Penny (SC) referred to the example of the provisions enabling the setting up of investment vehicles in the form of Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs). PIEs can be taxed at a lower rate than the rates applying to individual investors. Simply using those provisions as intended by Parliament and receiving a tax advantage, without more, would not attract the application of s BG 1 (see \[49\]). 392. In Penny (CA), Randerson J said “\[t\]here is, and could be, no valid criticism of the adoption of the corporate vehicle as such” (at \[113\]), and “I accept Mr Harley’s submission that, in general terms, the Act is not concerned with the level of salaries paid to employees in family-owned companies such as those incorporated by the respondents” (at \[116\]). However, on the facts of the case, when the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement was examined, it could be seen that the company/trust structure was used in such a way that, while the taxpayers were paid at a level well below market rate, they still retained the economic benefit of earnings generated largely through their personal exertion. 393. However, even though Parliament might specifically provide for a certain use of the Act, and those provisions apply to an arrangement based on its form, s BG 1 will still apply if the provisions have not been used as Parliament contemplated. A literal compliance with provisions will not establish that the use is within Parliament’s contemplation. When considering s BG 1 there is a focus on the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement, and also combinations of provisions that are used (or that are potentially relevant and do not apply) can be taken into account. The law has clearly moved on from the House of Lords decision in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Duke of Westminster \[1936\] AC 1 (HL) (discussed in more detail from paragraph 529). That case stood for the proposition that taxpayers are always entitled to order their affairs so the tax attaching is less than it otherwise would be. In the context of s BG 1, the New Zealand courts have unambiguously held that a use of the Act to reduce tax is only acceptable if the use is within Parliament’s contemplation for the relevant provision. 394. A second point relates to whether the Commissioner can use s BG 1 to plug “gaps” in the legislation. This raises the question of what is meant by a “gap” in the legislation. If Parliament did not intend that the legislation extend to a certain situation, s BG 1 will not apply to bridge that gap, even though there might be undesirable outcomes from a policy point of view. In such a situation, the Commissioner may consider whether the legislation needs amendment. If, on the other hand, t he Act is being used or circumvented in a way that does not give effect to Parliament’s WITHDRAWN 85 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] purpose, even though the particular use (or non-application) is not explicitly dealt within the legislation, s BG 1 will appropriately apply. WITHDRAWN 86 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] MERELY INCIDENTAL 395. If tax avoidance is the only purpose or effect of an arrangement, the arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement (see paragraph (a) of the definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” in s YA 1). If an arrangement has more than one purpose or effect, the arrangement will be a tax avoidance arrangement if the tax avoidance purpose or effect is “not merely incidental” to the other purposes or effects (see paragraph (b) of the definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” in s YA 1). The result is that an arrangement may be outside Parliament’s contemplation but still not be a tax avoidance arrangement if the tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose. Thus Parliament accepts that tax avoidance (meaning an outcome under the Act that is outside what Parliament would have contemplated) can be permissible in some situations, provided the tax avoidance arose only because it naturally follows from some other purpose. Non-tax avoidance purposes 396. The merely incidental test involves identifying any non-tax avoidance purposes of an arrangement so that their relationship with the tax avoidance purpose(s) can be identified. 397. Non-tax avoidance purposes in this context include 1) commercial and private purposes and 2) tax purposes where the use or non-application of the Act is within Parliament’s contemplation ( referred to here as “legitimate” tax purposes). 398. It is important to understand that, in the Commissioner’s view, any tax purposes that are integral to a tax avoidance use of the Act will be part of the tax avoidance purpose, and not treated as a legitimate tax purpose. An example is where a complicated tax avoidance arrangement requires borrowing from a third party at market rates to fund the arrangement. This will be the case even though the tax purpose may seem to be within Parliament’s purpose when viewed in isolation. Harrison J in Westpac, in the contexts of identifying the scope of the arrangement and of s GA 1 , found that the purpose put forward by the taxpayer was integral to a tax avoidance purpose (see \[573\] and \[641\]). 399. When identifying purposes and effects of an arrangement to apply the merely incidental test, the purposes and effects must be objectively ascertainable from the arrangement. As noted above, this is because s BG 1 applies to the arrangement (as distinct from the motives or intentions of the parties to it). Also, it is necessary to remember that “purpose” and “effect” in s BG 1 have related, but slightly different, meanings. As discussed earlier in this statement, the purpose is the intended effect and the effect is the effect itself, or actual result achieved by the arrangement (Ashton (PC) and Tayles (CA)). This means it will generally be necessary for the purposes and effects to be achieved by the arrangement. However, something may still be objectively concluded to be a purpose of an arrangement even if it fails to come to fruition, where that failure happens as a result of unforeseen intervening events. Such a purpose would still be a purpose of the arrangement, as it would be an objectively ascertainable intended effect. 400. Generally, in the following discussion of the merely incidental test the word “purpose” is used to refer to both “purposes” and “effects”. WITHDRAWN 87 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The meaning of “incidental” 401. It is important to understand the meaning of the word “incidental” in this context. “Incidental” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) to mean: incidental adj. 1 occurring as a minor accompaniment. occurring by chance in connection with something else. 2 (incidental to) liable to happen as a consequence of. n an incidental detail, expense, event, etc. 402. Thus, there are two possible meanings of “incidental” in this context. One is that a purpose or effect could be “incidental” if it is relatively minor or small compared to the other purpose or purposes. The second meaning is that a purpose or effect is “incidental” if it follows on from other relevant purposes or effects. 403. A possible example of the first meaning can be found in the High Court decision of Hadlee (HC) (which was approved by Cooke P at the Court of Appeal level), where Eichelbaum CJ concluded at 470: In my opinion the purpose and effect of the arrangement was tax avoidance. Even if it were possible to regard that as one purpose and effect only (the other being to enable the objector’s dependants to accumulate assets which would be secure from the risk of claims against the partnership) I cannot view it as “merely incidental”. The potential tax benefits were too significant and obvious. I agree with the submission on behalf of the Commissioner, that it would require a considerable degree of naivety to conclude that they played merely an incidental part in the scheme. 404. However, it is the second approach which has the greater authoritative and legislative support. In Challenge (CA), Woodhouse P, in his dissenting judgment, discussed the meaning of “merely incidental” in this context at 533: Does it have the rather exiguous meaning and effect of excusing only “the casual” or “the minor” or “the inconsequential” tax avoidance purposes? If so, many “ordinary” dealings would probably be caught by s 99 because inevitably the associated tax purpose could seem stronger than that. And the problem would be magnified if as well the assessment had to include estimates of the taxpayer’s motives. However, I do not think the phrase “merely incidental” does have such a limited effect and in accord with Newton v Commissioner of Taxation \[1958\] AC 450 I am satisfied as well that the issue as to whether or not a tax saving purpose or effect is “merely incidental” to another purpose is something to be decided not subjectively in terms of motive but objectively by reference to the arrangement itself. As a matter of construction I think the phrase “merely incidental purpose or effect” in the context of s 99 points to something which is necessarily linked and without contrivance to some other purpose or effect so that it can be regarded as a natural concomitant. \[Emphasis added\] 405. This suggests that a “merely incidental” tax avoidance purpose or effect is something which naturally follows from or is necessarily linked (without contrivance) to some other purpose or effect. The tax avoidance must only follow as a result of that other purpose and must not in any way be an end in itself. Also, his Honour makes the additional point that whether this is the case is determined objectively by reference to the arrangement itself and not subjectively in terms of motive. 406. The approach taken by Woodhouse P to the meaning of “merely incidental” is consistent with his Honour’s previous judgment in the Supreme Court decision of Elmiger. In that case, Woodhouse J stated that family or business dealings come within the section if the tax avoidance purpose is WITHDRAWN 88 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] not in any respect “pursued as a goal in itself” of the arrangement. At 694: Accordingly it is my opinion that family or business dealings will be caught by s. 108 despite their characterisation as such, if there is associated with them the additional purpose or effect of tax relief ... pursued as a goal in itself and not arising as a natural incident of some other purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 407. The legislative history strongly supports the view that “incidental” means something that naturally follows from something else rather than something that is minor. The merely incidental test was introduced into the predecessor to s BG 1 in 1974 and it is clear that Parliament’s intention in redrafting the provision in 1974 was to amend the law, among other things, so that it was consistent with the views of Woodhouse J in Elmiger. During the second reading of the Bill (which was later enacted as the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1974), Hon Dr A M Finlay (then Minister of Justice) discussed the new clause and referred to the decision of Woodhouse J in Elmiger. This was reported in the New Zealand Parliamentary Debates (30 August 1994) 393 NZPD 4,192: That \[Elmiger\] is a decision which I, for my part, regard as a landmark in our legal and social history, and typical of the enlightened approach one has come to expect from Mr Justice Woodhouse. ... The Elmiger case unfortunately represented something of a high point, and since that time the courts have tended to retire from the position that was taken up. At any rate this is what has been happening in New Zealand; not so in Australia, where there is a difference of opinion and where the Elmiger approach still prevails – they are satisfied that if one of the purposes of a device or scheme that is adopted, and that is of an unusual character, is for the purpose of evading taxation, then it may be struck down, and they need not be satisfied that that is the sole purpose of the arrangement. 408. The Minister continued by citing the decision of Hollyock v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 125 CLR 647, where the High Court of Australia rejected the Mangin “sole or principal purpose” test. He concluded at 4,194: The courts ought to be armed, as they have been on the example of Elmiger, to strike it \[tax avoidance\] down, and I am very much in favour of restoring the authority of Elmiger ... 409. This approach has subsequently been adopted in a number of decisions. For example, in Case M72 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,419 at 2,424; Case S95 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,593 at 7,602; Case X1 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,001 at \[359\]–\[362\] and \[392\]; Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC) at \[300\]; Ben Nevis at \[8\]–\[9\]; and Westpac at \[209\]. 410. In Westpac, Harrison J described Woodhouse P’s comments in Challenge (CA) as continuing to provide authoritative guidance on the merely incidental test (at \[208\]). Harrison J also said at \[205\]: ... A tax avoidance purpose or effect must be more than merely incidental to any other purpose or effect, such as ordinary business or family dealings, to constitute statutory avoidance. Inclusion of an adjectival phrase such as “not merely” is unusual in a statute; and its presence is not without difficulty in the context of tax legislation. WITHDRAWN 89 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[206\] However, when used in conjunction with the word “incidental”, I think the phrase “not merely” is designed to emphasise that a tax avoidance purpose, if found, will offend s BG 1 unless it naturally attaches or is subordinate or subsidiary to a concurrent legitimate purpose or effect, whether of a commercial or family nature. Identification of a business purpose will not immunise a transaction from scrutiny where tax avoidance can be viewed as “a significant or actuating purpose which ha\[s\] been pursued as a goal in itself”: see Tayles per McMullin J at NZTC 61,318; NZLR 736. Conversely, a transaction will not offend where tax avoidance naturally attaches to that other acceptable purpose or effect. 411. Harrison J reiterated the point that something that is “merely incidental” cannot be a goal in itself: \[618\] The tax avoidance purpose here could never be regarded “as a natural concomitant” of a dominant commercial purpose. Deployment of the deductibility provisions to reduce the bank’s liability to income forecast in the following year in accordance with its tax shelter or capacity calculation became a discrete and real end or objective on its own. I find that Westpac’s use of its tax shelter was a significant or actuating purpose which was pursued as a goal in itself in each transaction. As a matter of fact and degree, Westpac’s tax avoidance purpose was more than merely incidental to any legitimate commercial purpose. 412. Similar comments can be found in the Court of Appeal decision of Alesco at \[30\]. 413. In summary, the Commissioner considers, from the decided authority and legislative background, that “merely incidental” in this context means that the tax avoidance purpose must merely follow as a natural concomitant of the arrangement being structured in the particular way to achieve a non-tax avoidance purpose or purposes. Where a non-tax avoidance purpose is underpinned by a tax avoidance purpose 414. Sometimes a taxpayer will put forward as a non-tax avoidance purpose a purpose that is actually underpinned by tax avoidance. For example, it might be argued that an arrangement’s non-tax avoidance purpose is to achieve a better rate of return on an investment. However, if that better rate of return is achieved by amounts not being subject to tax due to a tax avoidance use of the Act, then that purpose is underpinned by tax avoidance. The Commissioner considers that where a non-tax avoidance purpose is underpinned in such a way by a tax avoidance purpose, then that tax avoidance purpose will be an end in itself and will not be merely incidental to the purpose put forward. 415. In the Commissioner’s view, this follows from Woodhouse P’s comments in Challenge (CA) (at 535) and is consistent with the approach adopted by the Australian High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 415. Whether the adoption of the particular structure can be explained by a non-tax avoidance purpose 416. Sometimes, taxpayers will put forward quite general purposes to explain arrangements (such as raising finance), and there is a question how to treat such purposes in the context of the merely incidental test. 417. Section BG 1, including the merely incidental test, is applied to the specific arrangement entered into. Woodhouse P said that whether a tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental is considered “by reference to the WITHDRAWN 90 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] arrangement itself”. General purposes that can potentially be achieved in several different ways will not explain the particular structure of the arrangement. Consequently, the existence of such a purpose will not be sufficient to establish that a tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental to it. More information about the specific requirements that led to the adoption of the particular structure would be needed before it could be assessed whether the tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental to any more specific non-tax avoidance purpose(s). 418. McGechan J talked about the specific way the arrangement was structured in BNZ Investments No 1 (HC) at 15,732: \[103\] I am quite unable to accept submission (a). Clearly, and at the very least, one of the purposes or effects of the downstream transactions was tax avoidance, and that was not a merely incidental purpose or effect. One need not look very far. There was, of course, an ordinary business purpose or a degree of ordinary business purpose in what was done. Fay Richwhite and CML intended to make profits. That is true in all business, including business carried forward in a tax effective way: it is not done for amusement or to tantalise the tax man. They went about it, however, in a way which - tax factors apart - was extraordinarily and unnecessarily complicated. There was no reason - tax factors apart - for the elaborate downstream chain and auxiliary activities being included in something which in essence was a lending of money raised by the RPS transactions on secure investments earning interest. To say otherwise is like travelling from Wellington to Auckland through Stewart Island, the Chathams and Kermadecs (if not Easter Island), then claiming that is just another available route. 419. In Alesco (CA), the court referred to the specific way the arrangement was structured. This was in response to the taxpayer highlighting that their arrangement had an underlying commercial rationale to fund acquisitions. The taxpayer said that their arrangement was unlike other tax avoidance cases where transactions would not have been entered into but for their tax benefits. The court stated: \[112\] However, this distinctive factor does not protect Alesco NZ. The question is whether the particular arrangement, regardless of whether it was the originating or intermediate step, had the purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Size of a tax benefit may be relevant 420. It follows from the meaning of “incidental” adopted earlier that the size of the tax benefit achieved under the arrangement will not on its own establish whether a tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental. Nevertheless, it may be a strong evidential factor a court will consider in reaching a view on whether a tax avoidance purpose follows naturally from a non-tax avoidance purpose. If the tax benefits are very large, it may be difficult to establish that the tax benefits follow naturally from, or are necessarily and concomitantly linked to, some other purpose (Hadlee (HC) at 470; Westpac at \[597\]). Relationship with the Parliamentary contemplation test 421. Two further questions arise in the context of the relationship between the Parliamentary contemplation test and the merely incidental test. One is about the role of artificiality and contrivance to both tests, and the other is whether the merely incidental test has a place following the decision in Ben Nevis. 422. On the first of these—artificiality and contrivance are relevant to both the question of whether the use of the Act falls outside Parliament’s WITHDRAWN 91 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] contemplation, and whether any tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose. As explained above, they are “classic indicators” of a use that is outside Parliament’s contemplation. This is because, as the court in Ben Nevis said, if artificiality and contrivance are used to achieve the benefit of a provision, that will generally not be how Parliament contemplated the provision would apply. If it appears from the form of the arrangement alone that the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect for the provision to operate are present, but the form of the arrangement is artificial and contrived (being at odds with the commercial and economic reality), then that will not be how Parliament contemplated the provision applying. 423. Artificiality and contrivance are also relevant to the merely incidental test because if artificiality and contrivance are involved in achieving the tax avoidance purpose, then it is likely that tax avoidance is an end in itself rather than it being merely incidental to another purpose. Woodhouse P in Challenge (CA) commented on the relevance of artificiality or contrivance to the merely incidental test at 535: When construing s 99 and the qualifying implementations of the reference in subs (2)(b) to “incidental purpose” I think the questions which arise need to be framed in terms of the degree of economic reality associated with a given transaction in contrast to artificiality or contrivance or what may be described as the extent to which it appears to involve exploitation of the statute while in direct pursuit of tax benefits. To put the matter in another way, there is all the difference in the world, I think, between the prudent attention on the one hand that can always be given sensibly and quite properly to the tax implications likely to arise from a course of action when deciding whether or not to pursue it and its pursuit on the other hand simply to achieve a manufactured tax advantage. 424. Artificiality and contrivance may also indicate that an arrangement is structured so that a tax purpose is contrived to appear as if it were incidental to a commercial purpose. Woodhouse P made this point in Challenge (CA) at 533: As a matter of construction I think the phrase “merely incidental purpose or effect” in the context of s 99 points to something which is necessarily linked and without contrivance to some other purpose or effect so that it can be regarded as a natural concomitant. \[Emphasis added\] 425. On the second issue, some commentators have discussed the possibility that the court in Ben Nevis intended to reduce the significance of, or even nullify, the merely incidental test. The court in Ben Nevis made the following observations about the application of the Parliamentary contemplation test and the merely incidental test: \[113\] Before concluding this section of our reasons, we should recognise that paragraph (b) of the definition of a tax avoidance arrangement refers to cases where the tax avoidance purpose or effect of an arrangement is “merely incidental”. If that is so, the arrangement is not a tax avoidance arrangement. It is apparent therefore that the use of a specific provision which alters the incidence of tax is permitted in two situations. \[114\] The first is when the specific provision is used in a manner which is within Parliamentary contemplation, as discussed above. The second is when the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement is “merely incidental”. It will rarely be the case that the use of a specific provision in a manner which is outside Parliamentary contemplation could result in the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement being merely incidental. In the present case the appellants did not seek to rely on the merely incidental concept, so nothing more need be said on that subject. \[Emphasis added\] WITHDRAWN 92 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 426. In the Commissioner’s view, it is clear the court in Ben Nevis did not mean by these comments that the merely incidental test no longer has a role. As a matter of interpretation, the court in fact explicitly recognised the separate existence of the merely incidental test. The court was simply saying that if an arrangement is outside Parliament’s contemplation it is more likely it would also fail the merely incidental test. This will be particularly so where an arrangement has been artificially structured to obtain certain benefits under the Act, as it would often also be the case that the tax avoidance purpose has been pursued as a goal in itself and is therefore not merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose. 427. Penny (SC) demonstrates that the merely incidental test has a continuing role in the s BG 1 inquiry. In Penny (SC) the court said it approved of the approach in Ben Nevis, and so did not need to set out in detail the analytical approach to tax avoidance. The court instead made some comments about particular aspects of avoidance as far as they were relevant to the case before it. As a result, it is sometimes not entirely clear whether the court was discussing whether something was tax avoidance or whether it was talking about the merely incidental test. 428. One thing that is clear is that the court took the view that the tax avoidance purpose in the case was more than merely incidental. At \[34\]: On the other hand, if the setting of the annual salary is influenced in more than an incidental way by a consideration of the impact of taxation, the use of the structure in that way will be tax avoidance. 429. At \[34\], the court discussed possible non-tax avoidance purposes that would have, had they been present, been relevant to the merely incidental test. These purposes included paying a relatively low level of salary because the company had a commercial need to retain funds to make a capital expenditure, or because the company was experiencing financial difficulties and could not afford to pay the equivalent of a commercial rate for the time being. 430. Accordingly, while the court in Ben Nevis indicated it would be very rare to find a tax purpose is merely incidental when it has already been concluded that the use of the Act was not what Parliament contemplated, Penny (SC) illustrates that the merely incidental test has a continuing and important role in the s BG 1 inquiry. Summary 431. The merely incidental test applies to an arrangement that has a tax avoidance purpose or effect as one of its purposes or effects. It provides that even though the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect, it will not be a tax avoidance arrangement if the tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose. 432. Non-tax avoidance purposes in this context are commercial and private purposes and legitimate tax purposes. Legitimate tax purposes do not include purposes that are integral to a tax avoidance purpose. 433. If purposes are not either actual effects or objectively intended effects of the arrangement, they will not be relevant. If, however, a purpose is an objectively intended effect but, because of unforeseen intervening events, the purpose is not achieved, that purpose may still be a purpose of the arrangement. WITHDRAWN 93 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 434. A “merely incidental” tax avoidance purpose or effect is something which follows from or is necessarily and concomitantly linked to, without contrivance, some other purpose or effect. Such a purpose is determined objectively by reference to the arrangement itself and not subjectively in terms of motive. 435. If a purpose, when examined, is actually underpinned by a tax avoidance purpose, then that purpose will not be merely incidental but will be a tax avoidance end in itself. 436. Purposes that are general in nature and do not explain the adoption of the specific structure of the arrangement will not establish that the tax avoidance purpose is merely incidental. 437. The magnitude or significance of the tax advantage will not on its own establish whether tax avoidance is more than merely incidental. The size of the tax benefit may, however, be relevant in reaching a view on whether the tax avoidance purpose follows naturally from another purpose. 438. Artificiality and similar indicia are relevant to both the Parliamentary contemplation test and the merely incidental test. Where an arrangement that uses specific provisions in a way not contemplated by Parliament has been structured to gain a tax advantage in an artificial and contrived way, that artificiality and contrivance will also often indicate that the tax advantage has been pursued as a goal in itself and does not naturally follow from another purpose or effect of the arrangement. This is the reason the court in Ben Nevis indicated it would be rare to find a tax purpose is merely incidental when it has already been concluded that the tax outcomes are not what Parliament contemplated. SEQUENCE OF ANALYSIS IN COMING TO A VIEW ON WHETHER SECTION BG 1 APPLIES TO AN ARRANGEMENT 439. The following flow chart illustrates in simplified form the suggested steps to take in analysing whether s BG 1 applies to an arrangement. WITHDRAWN 94 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section BG 1: a suggested approach Your consideration of the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement may raise further questions as to Parliament’s purpose in the context of this particular arrangement. If necessary, repeat these steps until you are satisfied that you have sufficiently ascertained Parliament’s purpose. 1 You may need to return to this step if your subsequent analysis of the arrangement identifies additional potentially relevant provisions. s BG 1 does not apply arrangement tax avoidance The arrangement and its tax effects •Identify all of the steps and transactions that make up the arrangement. •Gain an understanding of the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives of the arrangement, including the role of each of its individual steps. •Identify the tax effects of the arrangement, the provisions of the Act that apply to it, and any potentially relevant provisions that do not apply. 1 Parliament’s purpose •Ascertain Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions from their text, the statutory context (including the statutory scheme relevant to the provisions), case law and any relevant extrinsic material. 2 Commercial reality and economic effects •Examine the whole arrangement from the point of view of its commercial reality and economic effects, having particular regard to the facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose.

WITHDRAWN 95 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] EXAMPLES The following three examples are intended to illustrate how the Commissioner’s approach outlined in this statement (and summarised in the flow chart) is used to reach a view on whether an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement. The examples are set out using the same headings and structure as that set out in the flow chart. Each example is based on a relatively common fact situation that Inland Revenue has been asked about. The examples are deliberately simplified and do not include all the facts that would arise in a real-life situation if s BG 1 were under consideration. This is because the purpose of the examples is not to give the Commissioner’s view on whether s BG 1 would apply to particular fact situations that might be close to the line. Instead, these examples are only intended to illustrate the analytical process or approach that is to be applied when considering the application of s BG 1. They are not, therefore, intended for application to specific taxpayer situations. It is very possible that further, or even slightly different facts, may lead to a different conclusion when considering the application of s BG 1. There may also be further provisions that could be relevant to the examples but for the sake of simplicity are not considered. For example, in Example 3 in appropriate cases the Commissioner could consider the application of the remuneration provisions as well as the dividend provisions. Example 1 A taxpayer borrows from one of the major banks to invest long-term in a residential rental property on standard terms and conditions. The taxpayer rents out the property to a non-associated person on market terms and conditions. Expenses are incurred by the taxpayer on interest, insurance and rates, and these expenses are deducted from his income. The expenses exceed the taxable rental income. The taxpayer has other income that he derives from salary and wages. Does s BG 1 apply to this arrangement in light of the fact that the rental expenses exceed the rental income and can be offset against the taxpayer’s other income? Arrangement The arrangement and its tax effects Identify all of the steps and transactions that make up the arran gement. The steps of the arrangement are: • the taxpayer obtaining a loan at interest from a bank to fund the purchase of the property; • the taxpayer purchasing the property; • the taxpayer renting out the property (to a non-associated person); • the taxpayer incurring expenses (ie, interest, insurance and rates expenses) in relation to the property that exceed the rental income received for the property. WITHDRAWN 96 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Gain an understanding of the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives of the arrangement, including the role of each of its individual steps. Under the arrangement the taxpayer acquires an income-producing capital asset, in the form of a rental property. The rental property generates income for the taxpayer. To generate that income the taxpayer incurs interest costs and other expenses. Identify the tax effects of the arrangement, the provisions of the Act that apply to it, and any potentially relevant provisions that do not apply. The income derived from the rental property is assessable income (s CC 1 (income from holding property)). The interest, rates and insurance expenses incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the rental income are deductible against the rental income (ss DA 1 and DA 2 (general permission and general limitations), and s DB 6 (interest: not capital expenditure)). The taxpayer’s annual interest, rates and insurance expenses are offset against the taxpayer’s annual rental and salary and wages income. If the taxpayer’s annual rental expenses are more than his annual income the difference is the taxpayer’s net loss. If the taxpayer’s annual rental expenses are less than his annual income the difference is the taxpayer’s net income (s BC 2 (annual gross income), s BC 3 (annual total deductions), s BC 4 (net income and net loss) and s BC 5 (taxable income)). Tax Avoidance: the “Parliamentary contemplation” test Parliament’s purpose Ascertain Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions from their text, the statutory context (including the statutory scheme relevant to the provisions), case law and any relevant extrinsic material. Parliament intended that: • rental income is assessable (ss BC 2, BD 3 and CC 1); • under the interest and general deductibility provisions that expenditure incurred in deriving assessable income is deductible from assessable income (s DA 1, Ben Nevis at \[128\] and Westpac at \[605\]–\[606\]); • any non-capital and non-private expenses incurred in deriving income are deductible from that income (ss DA 1 and DA 2); • interest is deductible where the loan capital, relating to that interest, is used in the production of assessable income (s DB 6, Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 2 NZLR 5,67 (CA)); • the deduction of interest and other expenses is not limited to just the amount of income received (s BC 5, Eggers v CIR \[1988\] 2 NZLR 365 (CA)); • where expenses exceed the amount of income received, the excess is to be deducted against the taxpayer’s other assessable income (ss BC 2, BC 3, BC 4, BC 5 and Grieve v CIR \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA)); and • if the taxpayer does not have any other assessable income, that excess is to become the taxpayer’s net loss to carry forward into the next tax year (ss BC 2, BC 3, BC 4 and BC 5). WITHDRAWN 97 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Identify any facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to that purpose. From the provisions identified, the following facts, features and attributes need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose: • income is derived from rent; • any expenses are incurred in deriving rental income; • any expenses are not of a capital or private nature; • any interest expenses are for loan capital used to produce assessable income; and • assessable income is derived from another income source (eg, salary and wages). Commercial reality and economic effects Examine the whole arrangement from the point of view of its commercial reality and economic effects, having particular regard to the facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. Under the arrangement the taxpayer personally derives real income and personally incurs real expenses to derive that income. There is no evidence of artificiality, pretence and circularity in the arrangement. The income is actually derived by the taxpayer and the expenses are actually incurred by the taxpayer. The interest, rates and insurance costs are personally borne by the taxpayer to derive the rental income. The interest expenses are for the loan used to buy the rental property. Under the arrangement there was a net cash outlay. By incurring the expenses the taxpayer is personally subject to a genuine economic burden and so in reality suffers any economic losses claimed. The loan and lease arrangements are on arm’s length terms and conditions. The expenses are not of a capital or private nature. Under the arrangement the economic reality is that the expenses incurred are greater than the rental income derived. Reach a view on whether the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect Does t he arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, use (or circumvent) the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose? The two different types of income (ie, rental income and salary and wages income) derived by the taxpayer are, in an economic sense, amounts of actual income derived, as Parliament would expect for the income provisions. The expenses are incurred in an economic sense, as Parliament would expect for the deductibility provisions and they are incurred in deriving assessable income. The expenses incurred by the taxpayer may be deducted against any assessable income derived by the taxpayer in that same tax year. This will reduce the amount of tax payable on that income, as Parliament would expect under the core provisions. The facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present for the relevant provisions are present under this arrangement. As such, the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, uses the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. C onclusion: the arrangement does not have a tax avoidance purpose or effect. WITHDRAWN 98 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Merely incidental Other purposes or effects Identify any other (ie, non-t ax avoidance) purposes or effects of the arrangement that are not integral to the tax avoidance purpose or effect. The arrangement does not have a tax avoidance purpose or effect, so there is no need to consider whether a tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to another purpose or effect. Example 2 The taxpayer, a salary and wage earner on the top marginal tax rate (ie, 33%), has a term deposit with her local bank that has just matured. The taxpayer wants to reinvest the amount with her bank for a year. The taxpayer’s bank offers the taxpayer the option of investing the amount in another term deposit earning 5% interest and taxed at 33% or in an investment trust of the bank that is a multi-rate Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE). The PIE is a collective investment vehicle. The PIE is also expected to earn a 5% return but is taxed at 28%. The PIE is effectively equivalent to other collective investment vehicles offered by other banks. The taxpayer chooses to invest the amount in the PIE as it will generate a higher after-tax return than that generated by the term deposit and there seems to be no significantly greater risk. The taxpayer notifies the PIE of her correct prescribed investor rate and provides her IRD number. Does s BG 1 apply to this arrangement in light of the fact that the taxpayer pays a lower rate of tax on her PIE income? Arrangement The arrangement and its tax effects Identify all of the steps and t ransactions that make up the arrangement. The arrangement is the taxpayer investing her money in a PIE. Gain an understanding of the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives of the arrangement, including the role of each of its individual steps. Under the arrangement the taxpayer acquires an investment that generates a 5% return before tax. The after tax-return generated by the PIE is greater than that generated by the term investment offered by the bank but at no greater appreciable risk. Identify the tax effects of the arrangement, the provisions of the Act that apply to it, and any potentially relevant provisions that do not apply. The PIE attributes income from the proceeds of the taxpayer’s investment to the taxpayer and pays the tax on the income attributed to the taxpayer at her prescribed investor rate of 28% (s HM 31 and ss HM 34–40 (rules for multi-rate PIEs) and sch 6). The PIE meets the requirements set out in subpart HM and is a PIE under the Act (ss HM 7 to HM 20 (entry rules), s HM 71 (choosing to become a PIE) and Subpart YA (definition of multi-rate PIE)). The taxpayer has not provided the PIE with a rate lower than her correct p rescribed investor rate and so is not liable for tax on her PIE income for which WITHDRAWN 99 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the PIE has a tax liability (s HM 6(2) (intended effects for investors) and sch 6 (prescribed rates: PIE investments and retirement scheme contributions)). The taxpayer has notified the PIE of her IRD number and her prescribed investor rate and so a default rate will not apply to her investment (s HM 32 (rules and treatment of investors in multi-rate PIEs)). The prescribed investor rate for the taxpayer, a natural person who is a New Zealand resident and on the top tax rate, is in most cases 28% (s HM 56 (prescribed investor rates: schedular rates) and sch 6). The income attributed by the PIE to the taxpayer is her excluded income. This is because the taxpayer’s prescribed investor rate in the relevant calculation period is more than zero and is not more than her notified prescribed investor rate (ss CP 1 and CX 56 (attributed income of certain investors in multi-rate PIEs)). The taxpayer’s excluded income is not assessable income (s BD 1 (income, exempt income, excluded income, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income, and assessable income)). The distribution of the net after-tax return on the taxpayer’s investment is also her excluded income (s CX 56B (distributions to investors in multi-rate PIEs)). Potentially relevant provisions that do not apply to this arrangement: s BC 6 (income tax liability of filing taxpayer), s CC 4 (payments of interest), s CD 1 (income from equity), sub part YA (definition of basic tax rate, and taxpayer) and sch 1—Part A (basic income tax rates). Tax Avoidance: the “Parliamentary Contemplation” test Parliament’s purpose Ascertain Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions from their text, the statutory context (including the statutory scheme relevant to the provisions), case law and any relevant extrinsic material. Parliament intended that: • in general a person deriving interest and dividend income includes that income as their assessable income and that income is taxed at their marginal rate; • in the case of income attributed by a PIE to an investor that income is the investor’s excluded income. This is as long as the investor’s prescribed investor rate in the relevant calculation period is more than zero and is not more than the rate provided to the PIE by the investor (ss CP1 and CX 56); • the tax treatment under the PIE rules would be available to orthodox investment vehicles that met the requirements of the PIE rules (ss HM 7 to HM 20, s HM 71, Subpart YA) \[It is not necessary for present purposes to identify the whole range of entities that Parliament would expect to come within the PIE rules. This is because it is clear that Parliament would intend that an orthodox collective investment vehicle run by a major bank would be within Parliament’s intention for the PIE rules.\]; • PIEs pay the tax on any income attributed to their investors at the investor’s prescribed investor rate with a maximum applicable rate of 28% (ss HM 31, HM 34 to 40 and sch 6); WITHDRAWN 100 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • there should be no tax liability on the PIE income of New Zealand resident natural persons who have provided their prescribed investor rate to the PIEs in which they have invested; and • the PIE regime provides an incentive to New Zealand residents to save through the use of collective investment vehicles (Commentary on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill). Identify any facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to that purpose. From the provisions identified, the following facts, features and attributes need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose: • a natural person who is a New Zealand resident; • an investment in a PIE; • notification to the PIE by an investor of their prescribed investor rate and their IRD number; and • income attributed by the PIE to the investor less the amount of tax calculated at the investor’s prescribed investor rate. Commercial reality and economic effects Examine the whole arrangement from the point of view of its commercial reality and economic effects, having particular regard to the facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. Under the arrangement there is a real investment by the taxpayer in a PIE. The PIE is in commercial and economic terms a collective investment vehicle as envisioned by the PIE provisions and is similar to other collective investment vehicles offered by other banks. The taxpayer is a natural person and is a New Zealand resident. The PIE has been notified of the taxpayer’s correct prescribed investor rate. The taxpayer derives income from their investment in the PIE. The PIE pays tax on any income it attributes to the taxpayer at the taxpayer’s prescribed investor rate. The taxpayer’s prescribed investor rate is the rate set by Parliament. The income the PIE attributes to the investor in a tax year is the investor’s excluded income and is not returned by the taxpayer as assessable income. The income attributed to the investor from their PIE investment is taxed at the rate Parliament intended for that type of investment. Reach a view on whether the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect Does the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, use (or circumvent) the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose? The taxpayer has invested in and derived income from a PIE in both a commercial an d economic sense as Parliament would expect under the provisions of the PIE regime. The PIE in which the taxpayer has invested is also, in a commercial and economic sense, the type of vehicle Parliament would expect under the provisions of the PIE regime. The facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present for the relevant provisions are present under this arrangement. As such, the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, WITHDRAWN 101 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] uses the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. Conclusion: the arrangement does not have a tax avoidance purpose or effect. Merely incidental Other purposes or effects Identify any other (ie, non-t ax avoidance) purposes or effects of the arrangement that are not integral to the tax avoidance purpose or effect. The arrangement does not have a tax avoidance purpose or effect, so there is no need to consider whether a tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to another purpose or effect. Example 3 Shareholders in a profitable trading company sell their shares to a promoter’s loss company, with the purchase price remaining outstanding on an interest-free basis. There is an option granted to the shareholders to buy back the shares in five years’ time for the outstanding balance of the purchase price or, if fully paid, a nominal amount. Every year the profitable trading company pays an amount equal to its annual net profit to the loss company as a management fee. Simultaneously the loss company pays the same amount to the shareholders in partial repayment of the purchase price for the shares. The shareholders retain their management roles in the profitable trading company and there is little, if any, evidence of the loss company providing management services to the profitable trading company. Does s BG 1 apply to this arrangement in light of the fact that: • the shareholders’ receipt of the share purchase price will not be subject to tax, whereas any distributions paid by the profitable trading company to the shareholders would have been taxable to the shareholders; WITHDRAWN 102 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • the management fees paid to the loss company reduce the profitable trading company’s yearly assessable income to nil; and • the loss company’s net losses from previous tax years mean that it is not required to pay tax on the management fees paid to it by the profitable trading company. Arrangement The arrangement and its tax effects Identify all of the steps and transactions that make up the arrangement. The steps of the arrangement are: • the shareholders selling their shares to a loss company, leaving the purchase price outstanding on an interest-free basis; • the loss company granting an option to the shareholders to repurchase the shares in five years’ time for the outstanding balance of the purchase price or, if fully paid, a nominal amount; • the profitable trading company paying the loss company annual management fees that are the same amount as the profitable trading company’s annual net profits; and • the loss company making annual repayments of the purchase price for the shares that are the same amount as the annual management fees it receives from the profitable trading company. Gain an understanding of the commercial, private and other (including tax) objectives of the arrangement, including the role of each of its individual steps. Under the arrangement the shareholders of the profitable trading company transfer their shares in the profitable trading company to the loss company. The loss company repays the purchase price for the cost of the shares out of the management fees it charges the profitable trading company. The management fee paid to the loss company is the same amount as the profitable trading company’s annual net profit. The parties state that a commercial objective was that the shareholders wanted to maximise their financial return from the profitable trading company. The parties also state that the shareholders’ continued roles with the company provided them with employment. Identify the tax effects of the arrangement, the provisions of the Act that apply to it, and any potentially relevant provisions that do not apply. Any business income derived by the loss company or by the profitable trading company is assessable to that company (s BC 6 (income tax liability of filing taxpayer), s CB 1 (business income), sub part YA (definition of basic tax rate, company and taxpayer) and sch 1—Part A (basic income tax rates)). The capital gains derived from the sale of the shares are not taxable to the shareholders (Part C and specifically s CA 1(2) (income under ordinary concepts)). The expenses incurred by the profitable trading company and the loss company in deriving business income are deductible provided they are not capital or private expenses (s BD 2 (deductions), ss DA 1 and DA 2 (general permission and general limitations)). WITHDRAWN 103 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Potentially relevant provisions that do not apply to this arrangement: ss CD 1– CD 6 (income from equity) and possibly other provisions in Part C (income), ss IA 2 and IA 3 (tax losses and using tax losses in tax year), s IC 1 (company making a tax loss available to company B) and s IC 3 (common ownership: group of companies). Tax Avoidance: the “Parliamentary contemplation” test Parliament’s purpose Ascertain Parliament’s purpose for the relevant provisions from their text, the statutory context (including the statutory scheme relevant to the provisions), case law and any relevant extrinsic material. Parliament intended that: • a company is taxed on any business profit it derives (ss BC 6 and s CB 1, sub part YA and sch 1—Part A); • shareholders are taxed on any amounts paid out to them by the companies in which they have shares (ss CD 1–CD 6 and possibly other provisions in Part C); and • capital receipts are generally not taxed (this intention can be ascertained from the fundamental common law distinction between income and capital, evidenced in the Act by, among other things, the specified lists of what amounts are income in Part C (including the meaning of income under ordinary concepts) and the prohibition for deductions of a capital nature (Part C, specifically s CA 1(2), s DA 2(1) and BP Australia Ltd v FCT (1965) 112 CLR 386)). Parliament’s purpose for the general deductibility provisions is that: • expenditure incurred in deriving assessable income is deductible from assessable income (s DA 1, Ben Nevis at \[128\] and Westpac at \[605\]– \[606\]); and • expenses incurred in deriving business income are deductible as long as they are not capital or private expenses (ss DA 1 and DA 2). Parliament intended that a company with tax losses could permit another company to use those tax losses to reduce that second company’s taxable income where both of those companies have a specified degree of common ownership. If there is not the specified degree of common ownership, Parliament did not intend that a company would be able to use the tax losses of another company to reduce its taxable income (ss IA 2, IA 3, IC 1 and IC 3, and Challenge (PC) at 561). Identify any fa cts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to that purpose. From the provisions identified, the following facts, features and attributes need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose: • there is a company; • the company carries on a business and derives business income; • the company’s net profits are paid out as dividends or remuneration (unless accumulated in the company); • there are capital receipts; WITHDRAWN 104 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • any expenses are incurred for something (eg, goods or services) relating to the production of business income; • any expenses deducted are not of a capital or private nature; • there is another company with a net loss; and • the company with the net loss has the specified degree of common ownership with the other company. Commercial reality and economic effects Examine the whole arrangement from the point of view of its commercial reality and economic effects, having particular regard to the facts, features and attributes that need to be present (or absent) to give effect to Parliament’s purpose. Under the arrangement there are two companies. One of the companies, the profitable trading company, is commercially and economically carrying on a business and deriving income from that business. However, there is evidence of artificiality, pretence and circularity in the arrangement. In a commercial and economic sense, the shareholders have retained all significant elements of their original ownership and management of the profitable trading company. The profitable trading company’s payment of its net profit as management fees to the loss company is the same as the amount the loss company pays to the shareholders as the purchase price. The shareholder’s supposed sale of the shares has not in a real sense improved or changed their economic position. These two facts, combined with the shareholders’ option to later repurchase the shares at no genuine economic cost to themselves, demonstrates that they have not in reality disposed of their shares to the loss company. A second feature of the arrangement is the management fees paid by the profitable company to the loss company. As stated above the profitable trading company’s annual net profit determines both the annual amount paid to the loss company as a management fee and the annual amount paid to the shareholders as repayment of the purchase price of the shares. If the profitable trading company does not have a net profit before paying out the management fees, there is no requirement to pay the management fee or to repay the purchase price of the shares. There is little, if any, evidence of the loss company providing any services to the profitable trading company. The management fees are not incurred by the profitable trading company to generate business income in any real sense. Because the shareholders have not in terms of commercial reality disposed of their shares, the loss company’s payments to the shareholders would, therefore, not be regarded as repayments of the purchase price of the shares. Instead, as these payments are the same amounts as that paid by the profitable trading company to the loss company, and then in turn the same amounts as the profitable trading company’s annual net profits, it can be concluded that the loss company’s payments to the shareholders are effectively payments of the profitable trading company’s annual net profits. The purchasing company has net losses. In a commercial and economic sense, th e profitable trading company’s annual net profits are being offset by the purchasing company’s net losses. There is not the specified degree of commonality of ownership between the profitable trading company and the purchasing company that Parliament intended. WITHDRAWN 105 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Reach a view on whether the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect Does the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way , use (or circumvent) the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose? The annual amounts paid to the shareholders as repayment of the purchase price for the shares are not, in a commercial and economic sense, capital payments. They are payments of income that Parliament would expect to be subject to the income provisions. In a commercial sense, no services were provided by the loss company in return for the management fees, unlike what Parliament would expect under the deductibility provisions. As there is no real commonality of ownership between the loss company and the profitable trading company, the effective use of the loss company’s losses to reduce the profitable trading company’s net profit means that the loss company’s losses are not applied as Parliament would expect under the company loss provisions. The facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present for the relevant provisions are not present under this arrangement. As such, the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, does not use the relevant provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. Conclusion: the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. Merely incidental Other purposes or effects Identify any other (ie, non-t ax avoidance) purposes or effects of the arrangement that are not integral to the tax avoidance purpose or effect. The parties state a commercial objective is that the shareholders want to maximise their financial return from the profitable trading company. However, this objective is underpinned by tax avoidance. The shareholders’ financial returns from the profitable trading company are only improved because of the tax that was avoided under the arrangement. This is because the way the arrangement seeks to maximise the shareholders’ returns is by the profitable trading company’s profits being effectively paid to the shareholders as tax-free capital amounts, rather than as taxable distributions. The parties also state that the arrangement provides for the continued employment of the former shareholders. When considering the merely incidental test, the non-tax avoidance purpose or effect needs to explain why the arrangement was structured in that particular way. Under these facts, the purpose of providing continued employment of the shareholders does not explain why the arrangement was structured in the particular way that it was. The tax avoidance purpose or effect of this particular structure is not merely incidental to any non-tax avoidance purposes or effects. WITHDRAWN 106 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] SECTION GA 1 440. Sections BG 1(2) and GA 1 give the Commissioner the power to counteract a tax advantage. The effect of s BG 1 and the application of s GA 1 441. The effect of s BG 1(1) is that a tax avoidance arrangement is void from the beginning of the arrangement against the Commissioner. Section BG 1 always voids the whole arrangement. The words of s BG 1 do not allow for apportionment, so all tax outcomes of the arrangement, including legitimate outcomes, are void. There is no scope under s BG 1 to leave in place part of a tax avoidance arrangement. 442. Section BG 1 is an annihilating provision; it does not of itself create a tax liability (Challenge (CA) at 548; Wisheart, Macnab and Kidd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1972\] NZLR 319 (CA) at 337). The Commissioner applies s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to give effect to an assessment following voiding. 443. Subsections GA 1 (1) and (2) provide: When this section applies (1) This section applies if an arrangement is void under section BG 1 (Tax avoidance). Commissioner’s general power (2) The Commissioner may adjust the taxable income of a person affected by the arrangement in a way the Commissioner thinks appropriate, in order to counteract a tax advantage obtained by the person from or under the arrangement. 444. The word “may” in s GA 1(2) (and in s BG 1(2)) does not mean that the Commissioner has complete choice whether to apply s GA 1. Instead, the word “may” recognises that there may be circumstances where it is not necessary to exercise the power in s GA 1. When the voiding appropriately counteracts the tax advantages, and does no more than that, then the Commissioner will not be required to apply s GA 1. However, if the voiding has not appropriately counteracted the tax avoidance, or the voiding has removed legitimate outcomes, or there are consequential adjustments needed to be made, the Commissioner is required to apply s GA 1. The Privy Council in Miller (PC) stated at \[23\]: The Act says that an arrangement falling within the terms of the section “shall be absolutely void”. Likewise, the Commissioner is under a statutory duty to reassess the taxpayer’s assessable income to counteract any tax advantage. Discretion enters into the matter only as to the method of calculation by which the Commissioner discharges that duty. \[Emphasis added\] The types of adjustments that can be made under s GA 1 445. Section GA 1(2) provides that the adjustment is to be in a manner the Commissioner thinks appropriate to counteract the tax advantage obtained from or under the arrangement. This gives the Commissioner a broad discretion as to how to make adjustments in order to counteract a tax WITHDRAWN 107 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] advantage. Blanchard J referred to the broad nature of the discretion i n Miller (CA) at 302: Section 99(3) gives the Commissioner a wide reconstructive power. He \[the Commissioner\] “may” have regard to the income which the person he is assessing would have or might be expected to have or would in all likelihood have received but for the scheme, but the Commissioner is not inhibited from looking at the matter broadly and making an assessment on the basis of the benefit directly or indirectly received by the taxpayer in question. \[Emphasis added\] 446. The Commissioner considers that the broad nature of the power under s GA 1 (2) empowers the Commissioner to make adjustments to do any of the following: • negate any tax avoidance purposes or effects that have not been counteracted by the annihilation; • reinstate legitimate tax outcomes voided by the arrangement; • make appropriate consequential adjustments. 447. The ability to make this range of adjustments derives from the wording of s GA 1 (2). Section GA 1 (2) empowers the Commissioner to adjust the “taxable income of a person affected by the arrangement in a way the Commissioner thinks appropriate”. The section provides that the Commissioner exercises this power “in order to counteract a tax advantage obtained ... from or under the arrangement”. Even though it provides a broad and flexible discretion, the Commissioner is required to exercise this adjustment power with a particular object in mind. This follows from the fact that the purpose of ss BG 1 and GA 1 is to counteract tax avoidance. It would be outside the purpose for the provisions to apply the power in a way that did more than counteract tax avoidance. Removal of legitimate tax effects, and an inability to put in place consequential adjustments, would potentially be inconsistent with this purpose. 448. The legislative history does not shed particular light on the issue of the type of adjustments open to the Commissioner, but neither does it suggest the power is limited. Prior to the enactment of an adjustment power, the courts had recognised the specific problem of arrangements involving income diversion not being counteracted by voiding (Mangin). Parliament nevertheless enacted a power that was worded in general terms. 449. The scope of the types of adjustments that the Commissioner can make has not been expressly considered by the courts. However, there is some judicial authority for each of the three types of adjustment. Negating tax avoidance purposes or effects not counteracted by the annihilation 450. The adjustments made in Miller (PC) and (CA) are examples of where voiding the arrangement did not sufficiently negate the tax advantages. That litigation involved an arrangement that produced tax advantages for different people at a number of different points that may not have been counteracted by simply voiding the arrangement. Reinstating legitimate tax outcomes voided by the arrangement 451. In a number of cases, the courts have appeared to approve of the Commissioner’s approach of reinstating some tax outcomes from the WITHDRAWN 108 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] arrangement ( the second category); see Ben Nevis at \[31\], Glenharrow at \[55\], and Peterson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) (2002) 20 NZTC 17,761 (HC) at \[70\]. 452. In Ben Nevis, the Commissioner’s reconstruction provided for some of the deductions claimed by the taxpayers, namely the planting and tending costs related to the trees, to be reinstated. The Supreme Court stated: \[31\] None of the expenses claimed related to the costs to the syndicate of planting and tending trees. No issue has arisen concerning the tax treatment of those costs. 453. The Commissioner’s power does not extend beyond making adjustments to counteract the tax advantages. Parliament would not have intended that legitimate tax outcomes would be nullified. In BNZ Investments No 1 (HC), McGechan J considered that it is only a tax advantage obtained out of tax avoidance that may be counteracted: \[200\] While the law does not allow a taxpayer to contend that if there had been no such tax advantage he would never have entered the transaction, and accordingly there can be nothing to reconstruct, I have no doubt s 99(3) is intended to counteract tax advantages obtained out of avoidance, but not otherwise. Where tax advantages are increased through avoidance over a base level which would have existed in any event, it is that increment above base level which is to be counteracted, not the legitimate base level itself. That is all preservation of the tax base – the purpose of the section – requires. 454. However, adjustments to reinstate legitimate tax effects are ones the Commissioner thinks are appropriate. When considering whether a tax effect is legitimate, the Commissioner considers that parts of the arrangement that are so interdependent and interconnected with the tax avoidance parts as to be integral to them would not be reinstated by the operation of s GA 1. This will be the case even if the part of the arrangement, when viewed in isolation, or in the context of a different arrangement, could be argued to be legitimate. 455. This point is well illustrated in Westpac, given Harrison J’s finding that the funding costs could not, in the context of the particular arrangement, be distinguished from the guarantee procurement fee. His Honour said: \[641\] Third, the Commissioner is not bound to isolate out and counteract only particular elements giving rise to a tax advantage. Westpac’s tax advantage combined two principal elements of deductibility falling within the composite label of the cost of funds — funding costs and the GPF. There was no hierarchy or ranking between them. While only the GPF was unlawfully deducted and the separate source of a finding of avoidance, none of the deductions would have been generated without completion of the transaction as a whole. All its elements were integral. The bank was able to set-off or deduct all expenses against its other New Zealand income as a result. Making appropriate consequential adjustments 456. There is some authority for the Commissioner’s ability to make consequential adjustments (the third category). In Miller (CA) the court seemed to accept the Commissioner had power to make consequential adjustments without overtly linking this power to the specific section (now s GA 1(6)) that prevents double counting (at 304). It has long been the Commissioner’s practice to make consequential adjustments and this approach has never been the subject of adverse comment in the courts. WITHDRAWN 109 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The section conveys a broad discretion as to manner in which adjustments are made 457. As noted above, the Commissioner has a broad discretion as to how to make adjustments to counteract a tax advantage. An issue that arises in this context is the degree of specificity the Commissioner must reach in applying s GA 1. The Commissioner is not under a duty to describe precisely the actual basis for an adjustment. In response to a submission that the Commissioner must determine precisely what constitutes tax avoidance, Harrison J, in Westpac, said: \[639\] I do not accept Mr Green’s submission as a matter of principle for a number of reasons. First, the Commissioner’s statutory obligation to reconstruct is simply to counteract a tax advantage obtained from and under a transaction. He is not under any further duty to determine precisely what constitutes the tax avoidance or identify a particular aspect giving rise to a tax advantage. 458. Westpac confirms that the Commissioner may have different options available when counteracting a tax advantage. Harrison J upheld the Commissioner’s adjustment and went on to confirm that an alternative adjustment may also have been appropriate (at \[624\] and \[668\]). 459. Similarly, in Miller (HC) at 13,036, Baragwanath J said: Where the legal construct of a company is used there is likely to be more than one way of defining and counteracting the tax advantage. ... In this sphere there is not inexorably any single right answer... 460. The breadth of the discretion was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Dandelion (CA). McGrath J made the following observations in respect of the adjustment made by the Commissioner under s 99(3) at \[86\]: But in any event the Commissioner was entitled in the exercise of the discretion under s 99(3) to disallow the appellant's claim for deduction and as long as the Commissioner was of the opinion it was a proper adjustment to make under s 99(3) it cannot be attacked on the basis that the Commissioner has not simultaneously amended an inconsistent assessment of another taxpayer: Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1999\] 1 NZLR 275 (CA) at pp 289 and 292 . 461. Harrison J in Westpac also stated that the “traditional principles of judicial restraint” apply to this discretion (at \[622\]): First, once the Commissioner avoids an arrangement he “may” adjust the amounts of gross income, allowable deductions and available net losses including calculating taxable income ”in the manner \[he\] thinks appropriate”. The traditional principles of judicial restraint in determining a challenge to a discretionary power apply; the question is whether the Commissioner “adopted a reconstruction which was outside the scope of his powers”: Ben Nevis at \[170\]. \[Emphasis added\] 462. While the discretion is broad, the statutory language employed in s GA 1(2) requires that the adjustment be undertaken so as to “... counteract a tax advantage ...”. The references in various cases to the Commissioner’s discretion are to be read subject to that requirement. The section applies to future tax advantages 463. The point was made earlier in this statement that an arrangement may be a tax avoidance arrangement even though the tax liability avoided is a prospective or potential future liability to income tax. It is possible that the tax advantage eventuates some time after the arrangement is put in WITHDRAWN 110 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] place, in which case a s GA 1 adjustment will be the result of something that may have happened in a previous year. Who is a “p erson affected” by the arrangement? 464. Under s GA 1(2) the Commissioner may adjust not only the taxable income of the parties to a tax avoidance arrangement, but also the taxable income of persons “ affected” by the arrangement. 465. In Peterson (PC), Lord Millett stated that a person could be affected by an arrangement whether or not they were a party to it and whether or not they were privy to its details: \[34\] Their Lordships are satisfied that the “arrangement” which the commissioner has identified had the purpose or effect of reducing the investors' liability to tax and that, whether or not they were parties to the arrangement or the relevant part or parts of it, they were affected by it. Their Lordships do not consider that the “arrangement” requires a consensus or meeting of minds; the taxpayer need not be a party to “the arrangement” and in their view he need not be privy to its details either. \[Emphasis added\] 466. Further, in Ben Nevis, the court stated: \[164\] On the ordinary meaning of the emphasised language in s GB 1 \[the predecessor to s GA 1\], once the existence of a tax avoidance arrangement has been established, all those taxpayers who have benefited from it may be subject to corrective adjustments by the Commissioner in the exercise of the reconstruction power. No question of mutuality or even awareness by a benefiting taxpayer is a necessary element. \[Emphasis added\] 467. Therefore, “a person affected” may include: • a person whether or not party to the arrangement (Peterson (PC) at \[33\]–\[34\], and BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) at \[175\]; • a person who is unaware that he or she has benefited from the tax avoidance arrangement (Ben Nevis at \[164\]–\[168\]). 468. For example, the beneficiaries of a trust could be persons affected by a tax avoidance arrangement (and, therefore, have their income adjusted) even though they may not be parties to the arrangement or even be aware of it. 469. There may be more than one person affected by an arrangement. Consequently, the Commissioner may need to adjust the taxable income of multiple persons affected to appropriately counteract the tax advantage from the arrangement. Section GA 1 applies to tax credits: s GA 1(3) 470. Section GA 1(3) confirms that the Commissioner can adjust tax credits when using the s GA 1(2) power to counteract a tax advantage. It provides: Commissioner’s specific power over tax credits (3) The Commissioner may— (a) disallow some or all of a tax credit of a person affected by the arrangement; or WITHDRAWN 111 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) allow another person to benefit from some or all of the tax credit. The Commissioner may have regard to hypothetical situations: s GA 1(4) and (5) 471. Subsections (4) and (5) of s GA 1 supplement the Commissioner’s general power in subs (2) by allowing the Commissioner to consider hypothetical alternative situations when deciding on an adjustment: Commissioner’s identification of hypothetical situation (4) When applying subsections (2) and (3), the Commissioner may have regard to 1 or more of the amounts listed in subsection (5) which, in the Commissioner’s opinion, had the arrangement not occurred, the person - (a) would have had; or (b) would in all likelihood have had; or (c) might be expected to have had. Reconstructed amounts (5) The amounts referred to in subsection (4) are— (a) an amount of income of the person: (b) an amount of deduction of the person: (c) an amount of tax loss of the person: (d) an amount of tax credit of the person. 472. Section GA 1(4) provides that the Commissioner may have regard to various factors in determining the most appropriate adjustment. These are an amount of income, deduction, tax loss, or tax credit that, had the arrangement not occurred, a person: • would have had; or • would in all likelihood have had; or • might be expected to have had. 473. However, the Commissioner does not have to base the adjustment on an analysis of these factors. In Ben Nevis, the Supreme Court said at \[169\] that the “general power” of adjustment is supplemented by the “specific powers” in s GB 1(1)(a) (the predecessor to s GA 1(4) and (5)) under which the Commissioner “could have regard to” the amounts listed. The Court of Appeal in Alesco (CA) clearly rejected an argument that the Commissioner is required to identify a counterfactual: \[123\] Mr McKay’s argument fails for two reasons which we can articulate briefly. First, his submission is wrong in law. The terms of s GB 1 are plain. In exercising her discretion the Commissioner “may have regard to” an alternative funding arrangement. But she is not bound to take that step, and nor should she be where the tax advantage can be counteracted simply by disallowing the impermissible deductions. It is immaterial that Alesco NZ required the funding for a new acquisition. That is because the appropriate comparison was available within the available taxation treatments of the OCNs: that was precisely how she adjusted Alesco NZ’s liability. Similarly, in Westpac at \[623\], Harrison J stated that the Commissioner “is entitled” to have regard to such amounts. 474. Consistent with this, Blanchard J noted in Miller (CA) at 302 that the Commissioner: WITHDRAWN 112 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ... “may” have regard to the income which the person he is assessing would have or might be expected to have or would in all likelihood have received but for the scheme, but the Commissioner is not inhibited from looking at the matter broadly and making an assessment on the basis of the benefit directly or indirectly received by the taxpayer in question. \[Emphasis added\] 475. The Privy Council in Miller (PC) stated: \[22\] Their Lordships consider that this argument is based upon a misapprehension about the effect of a reconstruction. The Commissioner’s duty is to make an assessment with regard to what in his opinion was likely to have happened if there had been no scheme. But that does not mean that he is actually rewriting history. The reconstruction is purely hypothetical and provides a yardstick for the assessment. Although the income is deemed to have been derived by the person assessed (see s 99(4)), the nature and source of the income remains what it is was, namely the company’s net profits routed to the shareholders through Mr Russell’s company. None of this was disclosed. 476. The above quote could be seen to suggest that the Commissioner is required to have regard to what was likely to have happened if there had been no arrangement. However, the comment was made in the context of a situation where the Commissioner had put forward an alternative and was made as part of a discussion relating to the application of the time bar provisions. Consequently, the Commissioner’s view is that the Privy Council was not considering whether the Commissioner is required to have regard to a likely alternative. Rather, it was setting out the effect of a reconstruction—that is, it is purely hypothetical, intended to provide a yardstick for assessment and does not change the actual nature or source of the amounts reconstructed. The Commissioner’s view is consistent with Alesco (CA) (at \[126\]) where the Court of Appeal considered that the Privy Council in Miller was not saying the Commissioner is under an affirmative duty to adjust by having regard to what is said to be the most likely counterfactual transaction. 477. Where the Commissioner applies s GA 1(4) and (5), the Commissioner can choose to have regard to one or more amounts of income, deduction, tax loss or tax credit. It is not necessary for the Commissioner to compare the arrangement entered into with a hypothetical alternative arrangement. 478. Further, where the Commissioner applies s GA 1(4) and (5): • They must be applied so as to counteract any tax advantage obtained (Westpac at \[623\]; Ben Nevis at \[169\]); • The Commissioner does not need to determine an alternative beneficial t ransaction that the taxpayer might have entered into but did not (Westpac at \[623\]; Accent (CA) at \[155\]). 479. In determining what is likely to have happened if there had been no arrangement, the Commissioner can consider what was actually done. In the Court of Appeal in Miller (CA), Blanchard J disagreed with the taxpayer’s argument that, in the absence of the arrangement, the taxpayers would likely have retained the profit within the company, rather than the profits being distributed to the shareholders. In determining what was likely in the absence of the arrangement actually entered into, Blanchard J said at 301: We consider that the likelihood of receipt of moneys by the former shareholders must be judged by what they have actually done. They caused all the profits to be removed from the company. It must therefore be taken that these sums would have been distributed in the form of additional salaries, management bonuses, dividends WITHDRAWN 113 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] or in some other manner in the years in which they were earned by Fiorucci and would not have been left in the company. The desire of the shareholders to extract them is demonstrated by what they actually did. They were unlikely to have waited 10 years to get their hands on each instalment of earnings. No double counting of income or deduction 480. A further limit on the Commissioner’s power of adjustment is set out in s GA 1(6). It provides: No double counting (6) When applying subsection (2), if the Commissioner includes an amount of income or deduction in calculating the taxable income of the person, it must not be included in calculating the taxable income of another person. 481. A predecessor to s GA 1(6) was considered in Miller (CA). Blanchard J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated at 292: It is not necessary on each occasion when the Commissioner makes an assessment of one taxpayer which is inconsistent with his earlier assessment of a different taxpayer that he simultaneously should amend that earlier assessment. That must ultimately be done or the Commissioner would, in effect, be collecting the same tax twice over, but he is to be allowed some flexibility in the timing of the adjustment to meet administrative demands and to enable him to await the outcome of objection proceedings in relation to the assessments. \[Emphasis added\] 482. In the Commissioner’s view, this approach would also be followed under s GA 1(6). Therefore, when determining an appropriate adjustment, the Commissioner cannot ultimately include an amount of income or deduction in the taxable income of more than one person. Onus on taxpayer to show adjustment wrong and by how much 483. In Ben Nevis, the court said that in any challenge to an adjustment made by the Commissioner under s GB 1 (the corresponding provision to s GA 1 under the Income Tax Act 2004), the onus is on the taxpayer to show that the adjustment is wrong and by how much it is wrong. The court stated: \[171\] Furthermore, when taxpayers challenge an assessment based on a reconstruction adopted by the Commissioner, the onus is on them to demonstrate, not only that the reconstruction was wrong, but also by how much it was wrong. Unless the taxpayer can demonstrate with reasonable clarity what the correct reconstruction ought to be, the Commissioner’s assessment based on his reconstruction must stand. This is settled law. In this case we are of the view that the appellants have not shown that the Commissioner’s assessment based on his reconstruction was wrong. Even if they had shown that to be so, they have not shown on any reasonably clear basis to what extent it should be varied. The appellants did not submit any specific proposed reconstruction of their own, the validity of which the Court could then have evaluated. The Commissioner’s assessment must therefore stand. \[Footnote omitted. Emphasis added\] Similar comments were also made in Westpac at \[631\]. Summary 484. When the voiding of an arrangement under s BG 1 appropriately counteracts the tax advantages, and does no more than that, then the Commissioner will not be required to apply s GA 1. However, if the voiding has not appropriately counteracted the tax avoidance, or the voiding has removed legitimate outcomes or there are consequential WITHDRAWN 114 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] adjustments needed to be made, the Commissioner is required to apply s GA 1. 485. The Commissioner has a broad discretion as to the adjustments that can be made to counteract the tax advantage. The broad nature of the power under s GA 1 empowers the Commissioner to make any of the following three types of adjustments to parties or persons affected: • negate the tax avoidance purposes or effects that have not been countered by the annihilation; • reinstate legitimate tax outcomes voided by the arrangement; • make appropriate consequential adjustments. 486. Also, in relation to this discretion: • Parts of the arrangement that are so interdependent and interconnected with the tax avoidance parts as to be integral to them would not be reinstated by the operation of s GA 1. This will be the case even if the part of the arrangement, when viewed in isolation, or in the context of a different arrangement, could be argued to be legitimate. • The Commissioner is not under a duty to describe precisely the actual basis for an adjustment. • The Commissioner may adjust the taxable income of any person affected by the arrangement. A person can be affected by an arrangement whether they are a party to the arrangement and whether they are aware that they benefited from a tax avoidance arrangement. • A s GA 1 adjustment may be the result of something that has happened in a previous year. • The Commissioner can adjust tax credits. • The Commissioner may (but does not have to) have regard to the factors and amounts in s GA 1(4) and (5). • Section GA 1(6) provides that the Commissioner cannot ultimately include an amount of income or deduction in the taxable income of more than one person. • If a taxpayer wishes to dispute an adjustment made by the Commissioner, the onus is on the taxpayer to show that the adjustment is wrong and by how much it is wrong. WITHDRAWN 115 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] yes yes ∗“Legitimate tax outcomes” do not include tax outcomes that are integral to the tax avoidance. Section BG 1 applies Has the voiding effect of s BG 1 removed any legitimate tax outcomes?\* Are any consequential adjustments required to ensure appropriate outcomes?

The following flow chart sets out the steps the Commissioner will take in considering the application of s GA 1. Approach to s GA 1 WITHDRAWN 116 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ADDITIONAL ISSUES 488. There are several additional issues that might arise when considering the application of the anti-avoidance provision. They are as follows: • The relevance of pre-Ben Nevis judicial approaches, including the “scheme and purpose” approach, the choice principle, the predication test, the new source doctrine and the approach adopted in the Duke of Westminster decision. • The argument that the Commissioner is not able to use the anti-avoidance provision to dictate how taxpayers should do business. • Whether an arrangement that results in more tax paid overall can be a tax avoidance arrangement. • The relevance of obtaining a tax advantage from another country. • The argument for certainty in how tax laws are applied. These issues are discussed in the following paragraphs. The relevance of pre-Ben Nevis judicial approaches 489. As was discussed at the beginning of this statement, for many years the courts have not been consistent in their approach to reaching a view on whether the provisions of the Act apply as claimed or whether s BG 1 applies. One of the approaches developed was the approach of Richardson J in Challenge (CA) and BNZ Investments No 1 (CA). This approach has become known as the “scheme and purpose” approach. There is a question whether the approach survives following Ben Nevis and this is discussed in the following paragraphs. 490. Also discussed below are the choice principle, the predication test and the new source principle, as well as the approach adopted in the Duke of Westminster decision. Scheme and purpose 491. In Challenge (CA), Richardson J said that considering whether the anti-avoidance provision applies will involve examining the scheme of the legislation and the relevant objectives of the legislation (at 549): Section 99 thus lives in an uneasy compromise with other specific provisions of the income tax legislation. In the end the legal answer must turn on an overall assessment of the respective roles of the particular provision and s 99 under the statute and of the relation between them. That is a matter of statutory construction and the twin pillars on which the approach to statutes mandated by s 5(j) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 rests are the scheme of the legislation and the relevant objectives of the legislation. Consideration of the scheme of the legislation requires a careful reading in its historical context of the whole statute, analysing its structure and examining the relationships between the various provisions and recognising any discernible themes and patterns and underlying policy considerations. ... For the inquiry is as to whether there is room in the statutory scheme for the application of s 99 in the particular case. If not, that is because the state of affairs achieved in compliance with the particular provision relied on by the taxpayer is not tax avoidance in the statutory sense. Reading s 99 in this way is to give it its true purpose and effect in the statutory scheme and so to allow it to serve the purposes WITHDRAWN 117 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] of the Act itself. It is not the function of s 99 to defeat other provisions of the Act or to achieve a result which is inconsistent with them. 492. People have adopted different meanings when they have referred to the scheme and purpose approach. Some have taken the scheme and purpose approach to mean that literal compliance with the specific provisions will establish that Parliament’s purpose for those provisions is met and that will be sufficient to conclude that the anti-avoidance provision does not apply. This view is, or is very similar to, the “threshold argument”. The threshold argument is that once the ordinary meaning of a specific provision has been satisfied there can be no avoidance. As noted above (at paragraph 197), this argument was rejected by the court in Ben Nevis. In the Commissioner’s view, this argument does not reflect Richardson J’s view. 493. Another interpretation, and one the Commissioner thinks better reflects Richardson J’s meaning, has understood the scheme and purpose approach to mean that a careful analysis of the Act is required to understand Parliament’s intention. Arrangements that have tax-induced features outside usual commercial practice or pretence will be subject to the section under this approach (see BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) at \[40\]). 494. There has also been on-going debate about whether Richardson J’s approach has continuing relevance following Ben Nevis. This debate has been kept alive by the continuing use of the phrase “scheme and purpose” in Ben Nevis and in subsequent judgments (see, for example, Ben Nevis at \[96\], \[98\]–\[99\], Glenharrow at \[48\] and Penny (CA) at \[88\]). 495. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis outlined its view of the scheme and purpose test at \[84\]–\[99\], including Richardson J’s application of it in Challenge (CA): \[88\] In Challenge Corporation, Richardson J decided that taking advantage of the statutory provisions in relation to the tax treatment of subvention payments was consistent with the very specific scheme and purpose of the statutory provisions relating to grouping of companies and treatment of losses. These provisions had no purpose but to allow an offset for tax purposes. The transactions contemplated were simply tax concepts which had no reality except in relation to income tax. Parliament could not have intended that s 99 would deprive taxpayers of a specific structure provided for by the Act. Richardson J held, in effect, that literal compliance met the statutory purposes and it was not necessary for him to take into consideration the circumstances in which the loss company became part of the group. It was not consistent with the statutory purposes to treat such subvention arrangements as tax avoidance. \[89\] The effect was to reconcile conflicting provisions by reading down the scope of s 99 so that it did not operate on arrangements that complied with the particular specific provision in the legislation. The scheme and purpose of the legislation required that s 99 be read in the context of the special concession provisions which were dominant. 496. Richardson J’s decision was overturned by the Privy Council. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis preferred the approach of the Privy Council. While still seeing the scheme and purpose of the specific provision as of central importance, the Privy Council differed in its application. The Privy Council took the view that Richardson J’s approach had not taken due account of the economic reality of the arrangement in deciding whether Parliament’s purpose had been given effect. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis discussed the Privy Council’s view: WITHDRAWN 118 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[93\] Finally, the Privy Council took a different view of the outcome of the application of the scheme and purpose approach. Lord Templeman classified the circumstances as tax avoidance, and not tax mitigation, because the Challenge group “never suffered the loss ... which would entitle them to a reduction in their tax liability”. Earlier, the Privy Council had said that s 191 of the 1976 Act, the specific provision, “was intended to give effect to the reality of group profits and losses”. The reality was that the Challenge group did not make a loss. There was, therefore, a failure to construct the transaction in a way that met the purpose of s 191. It was that element in the transaction that meant s 99 applied to strike down an arrangement which otherwise complied with s 191. \[94\] The Privy Council majority accepted the central importance of the scheme and purpose of the specific provision. But it differed from Richardson J’s conclusions on the application of that approach to the case. The Privy Council did not accept that on a purposive approach the application of s 99 could be limited in a way that ignored the economic reality of the transaction as contemplated by the specific provision. For a profitable company to buy into the shareholding of a loss company outside its group, and then to offset those losses, involved “pretence”. When a taxpayer sought to obtain a tax advantage without suffering the cost Parliament intended be suffered, this would amount to tax avoidance. 497. The court in Ben Nevis thought the Privy Council was correct in taking into account Parliament’s intention to give effect to the reality of group profits and losses, as well as the reality that Challenge did not make a loss. The court referred to “this kind of scheme and purpose approach” (at \[96\]) and referred to examples of this kind of approach in BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) and the Privy Council decision in Peterson (PC). The Supreme Court emphasised a passage from BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) (at \[40\]) where the Court of Appeal in that case said (quoted in Ben Nevis at \[96\]): ... that what should reasonably be struck at are artifices and other arrangements which have tax induced features outside the range of acceptable practice ... and also a passage from Peterson (PC) (at \[42\]) where the majority of the Privy Council said (quoted in Ben Nevis at \[98\]): If the commissioner had shown that the features on which he relied, singly or in combination, had the effect that the investors, while purporting to incur a liability to pay $x+y to acquire the film, had not suffered the economic burden of such expenditure before tax which Parliament intended to qualify them for a depreciation allowance, then he could invoke s 99 to disallow the deduction. 498. Therefore, the difference following Ben Nevis is that there is increased clarity that the approach to s BG 1 must take into account the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement when understanding whether the use of the specific provisions is within Parliament’s contemplation. This increased emphasis on commercial and economic reality means it is possible that not all previously decided cases would be decided the same way following Ben Nevis. 499. Harrison J in Westpac commented on the continuing relevance of the scheme and purpose approach: \[176\] I read Ben Nevis at \[84\]–\[89\] as expressing what Ms Ellis called a “diplomatic rejection” of Richardson J’s judgment in Challenge while endorsing Woodhouse P’s approach in the same case. Ben Nevis marked out two clear points of departure from Richardson J. One was from his emphasis on the specific provision, thereby reading down or negating the reach of the general anti-avoidance section. The other was from a formalistic or juristic approach which necessarily excluded an examination of the circumstances in which the deductible loss arose. WITHDRAWN 119 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] And later: \[194\] In summary, Ben Nevis represents, I think, a significant shift in identifying the principles to be applied when construing s BG 1, mandating a broader inquiry than was previously required — a “wider perspective” — consistent with settled principles of statutory interpretation: at \[99\]. Ms Ellis observes that the phrase “scheme and purpose” is conspicuously absent from the ratio. I doubt that the court was rejecting the scheme and purpose approach of itself but was instead expanding its scope. The previous constraints imposed by a legalistic focus, to the exclusion of economic realism, have gone. 500. Randerson J expressed a similar view in Penny (CA) in the Court of Appeal at \[62\]: The scheme and purpose approach adopted in earlier decisions has been endorsed in general terms but with some important clarifications. A key concept clarified by the Court is the relationship between specific tax provisions and a general anti-avoidance provision. While it has long been accepted that compliance with specific tax provisions does not oust the application of the general anti-avoidance provision, the Supreme Court has rejected the approach adopted by Richardson J in the Challenge Corporation case which effectively reconciled conflicting provisions by reading down the scope of the general avoidance provision. 501. It is clear that any approach under which it would be sufficient to merely comply with the ordinary meaning of the words of the provisions of the Act (other than s BG 1) would leave no room for the application of s BG 1 and is not correct. That leaves the question of whether a broader “scheme and purpose” approach still has relevance. The Commissioner’s view is that the Parliamentary contemplation test is different in important respects to the scheme and purpose approach as associated with Richardson J’s approach in Challenge (CA). An important difference is the emphasis placed on the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement under the Parliamentary contemplation test. This difference can be seen to be illustrated in the different approaches taken by the Privy Council and Richardson J in Challenge (PC and CA), a difference observed by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis. 502. Therefore, even though aspects of the Parliamentary contemplation test might be traced to the scheme and purpose approach, as a result of the Supreme Court’s comments and the association of “scheme and purpose” with the reading down of the Act, the term should be used with caution. The Commissioner’s view is that any approach where mere compliance with sections when considered in isolation will be within Parliament’s purpose, without the ability to look at the reality of the whole arrangement, is not the law. The choice principle 503. From time to time taxpayers and judges have referred to a principle known as the “choice principle”. The choice principle refers to a proposition that if a taxpayer chooses between alternative courses of action recognised in the Act, the application of s BG 1 to the choice would remove an advantage Parliament intended to give. 504. This principle was initially developed in the Australian High Court in cases such as WP Keighery Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1957) 100 CLR 66 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Casuarina Pty Ltd (1971) 127 CLR 62. In Keighery, the court took the view that the anti-avoidance provision was not intended to deny the taxpayers the choice between two or more options expressly provided for in the Act. The WITHDRAWN 120 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] taxpayers allotted shares in a way to ensure that the company was taxed as a public company rather than a private company. The court said there was no pretence or unreality about the allotments of the shares. 505. The principle was subsequently expanded in cases such as Mullens v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1976) 135 CLR 290, Slutzkin v The Commissioner of Taxation (1977) 140 CLR 314 and Cridland v The Commissioner of Taxation (1977) 140 CLR 330. In Mullens, Stephen J said the principle was not “confined to cases where the Act offers to the taxpayer a choice of alternative tax consequences either of which he is free to choose”, but should apply also when the Act “offers certain tax benefits to taxpayers who adopt a particular course of conduct” (at 318). Barwick CJ said at 298, “a taxpayer is entitled to create a situation to which the Act attaches taxation advantages for the taxpayer”. 506. The principle was discussed in New Zealand in Challenge (CA). Richardson J supported the principle from the earlier Keighery case that if the Act intends to present taxpayers with a choice of alternative courses of action, and the taxpayer exercises that choice, then that would not be tax avoidance. Woodhouse P , on the other hand, considered the choice principle was not part of New Zealand law (at 538). 507. The choice principle is used to support the argument that by taking advantage of choices recognised in the Act the taxpayer is simply making a choice expressly made available by Parliament, and the arrangement should in such cases be immune from s BG 1. The Commissioner’s view is that there is no such immunity from s BG 1. No matter what provisions are used, the same question always needs to be asked: whether the use of the provisions is within Parliament’s contemplation when the reality of the arrangement is considered. 508. The taxpayers argued in Ben Nevis that the courts should recognise choices in the Act. The court said: \[111\] The appellants made a sustained plea that the courts should not deprive commercial and other parties of tax beneficial choices. On the approach we have set out, taxpayers have the freedom to structure transactions to their best tax advantage. They may utilise available tax incentives in whatever way the applicable legislative text, read in the light of its context and purpose, permits. They cannot, however, do so in a way that is proscribed by the general anti-avoidance provision. 509. The general anti-avoidance provision proscribes arrangements that use the Act in a way Parliament did not contemplate. While taxpayers are free to structure their arrangements using structures recognised in the Act, if those structures use provisions in a way that is outside Parliament’s contemplation, then the arrangement may be a tax avoidance arrangement. For example, a taxpayer may choose to sell or lease an asset and different tax consequences will follow from that choice. If a taxpayer structures an arrangement to use the lease provisions but, when the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is examined, the reality is that the arrangement is a sale, then the use of the lease provisions may be outside Parliament’s contemplation. 510. The Supreme Court in Penny (SC) said that while the taxpayers had a choice to transfer their businesses to companies owned by their family trusts (at \[33\]), other aspects of the arrangement meant it was still a tax avoidance arrangement. The commercial and economic reality of the WITHDRAWN 121 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] arrangement, when looked at as a whole, was that the taxpayers still received the full benefit of the income and effectively derived it. The predication test 511. In Newton, Lord Denning outlined what became known as the predication test. Under the predication test an arrangement might not be a tax avoidance arrangement if it could be explained as ordinary business or family dealing. Lord Denning said at 466: In order to bring the arrangement within the section you must be able to predicate - by looking at the overt acts by which it was implemented - that it was implemented in that particular way so as to avoid tax. If you cannot so predicate, but have to acknowledge that the transactions are capable of explanation by reference to ordinary business or family dealing, without necessarily being labelled as a means to avoid tax, then the arrangement does not come within the section. 512. This test limited the anti-avoidance provision to arrangements that had a sole or principal purpose or effect of tax avoidance. In Mangin, the Privy Council said the relevant purpose of tax avoidance had to be the sole or at least principal purpose of the arrangement (which overturned the view of Woodhouse J in Elmiger). Amendments were made to s 108 (a predecessor to s BG 1) by s 9 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1974 to counter this restrictive gloss on how s 108 applied. The amendments had the effect of clarifying that arrangements that have a more than “merely incidental purpose or effect” of tax avoidance can be tax avoidance arrangements, whether or not such a purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings. 513. The MP for Kapiti, Mr Frank O’Flynn QC, explained the reasons for the new s 108 (New Zealand Parliamentary Debates (17 September 1994) 394 NZPD 4,240): ...the new section clears up quite a number of points that have been litigated on in Wellington, before the High Court of Australia, and in the Privy Council in London. For example, it deals with the question of whether you have to show that the only purpose of the arrangement is tax avoidance, or whether it is enough to show that that is one of the purposes, and what happens if it is merely an incidental purpose. To cut the matter short, it really seeks to restore much of the interpretation that was applied to the section after the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision in Elmiger as long ago as 1966. 514. Woodhouse J had said in Elmiger at 694: Accordingly it is my opinion that family or business dealings will be caught by s. 108 despite their characterisation as such, if there is associated with them the additional purpose or effect of tax relief (in the sense contemplated by the section) pursued as a goal in itself and not arising as a natural incident of some other purpose. If this were not so I suppose an appropriate legal window dressing could still be devised to defeat the general objects of the section. 515. Thus the merely incidental test introduced in 1974 was clearly intended to return the law to the position in Elmiger rather than continue with the position in the Privy Council decisions in Newton and Mangin. The introduction of the phrase “merely incidental” was to ensure if tax avoidance was merely an incidental feature of the transaction then the transaction would not be labelled as tax avoidance. 516. When discussing the 1974 amendments and the legislative history, the majority in Ben Nevis referred to the definition of “tax avoidance arrangement”, and stated at \[81\]: WITHDRAWN 122 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ... the legislation \[has\] dispensed with Lord Denning's predication test in Newton by stating that an arrangement could amount to tax avoidance whether or not other purposes or effects of the arrangement were referable to ordinary business or family dealings. 517. Therefore, in the light of the amendments made in 1974 and the Ben Nevis decision, it would appear that the predication test, as set out in Newton, has been dispensed with or, at the very least, extensively modified in the modern jurisprudence. 518. If the predication test still has any application in modern day avoidance jurisprudence it is simply that, for s BG 1 to apply, it is necessary to “predicate” (in the sense of positively determining or objectively classifying) a purpose or effect of the arrangement as being one of tax avoidance. This will require nothing more than that an objective (predicative), and not subjective, standpoint should be adopted. 519. It has sometimes been argued that the predication test has continuing relevance for the proposition that to be a tax avoidance arrangement there must be certainty at the outset that the arrangement has been entered into to avoid tax. However, there does not appear to be any requirement that it be certain that the arrangement will result in an immediate avoidance of tax. “Tax avoidance” is defined to include relieving a person fr om a potential or prospective liability. Whether an arrangement gives rise to tax avoidance needs to be established not by pointing to a particular amount of tax that has definitely been avoided, but by applying the principles established in Ben Nevis. “New source” doctrine 520. Sometimes taxpayers argue that tax avoidance cannot exist when the arrangement involves a new source of income. The argument is that if the income was not previously derived, and so not previously taxed, then it cannot be said that any tax was avoided by the arrangement. Lord Diplock in Europa No 2 considered that s 108 did not strike at arrangements dealing with new sources of income. His Lordship stated at 556: Secondly, the description of the contracts, agreements and arrangements which are liable to avoidance presupposes the continued receipt by the taxpayer of income from an existing source in respect of which his liability to pay tax would be altered or relieved if legal effect were given to the contract, agreement, or arrangement sought to be avoided as against the Commissioner. The section does not strike at new sources of income or restrict the right of the taxpayer to arrange his affairs in relation to income from a new source in such a way as to attract the least possible liability to tax. Nor does it prevent the taxpayer from parting with a source of income. 521. The doctrine was applied in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Gulland (1985) 160 CLR 55 amongst other cases. The Full Federal Court in Bunting v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 89 ATC 5,245 (FCAFC) said the argument was supported by the absence in Australia (at that time) of an ability to reconstruct a tax avoidance arrangement. Voiding an arrangement involving a new source of income would usually not have the effect of the taxpayer having tax to pay, so, it was argued, such transactions could not have been meant to be subject to the anti-avoidance provision. 522. The new source doctrine, if accepted, would mean s BG 1 could apply differently to two identical uses of the Act. It would not apply if a new WITHDRAWN 123 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] arrangement was entered into using the Act in a certain way, but if another taxpayer made the same use of the Act with an existing source of income, then it could be avoidance. This cannot be correct. 523. This new source doctrine was rejected in New Zealand in the High Court in BNZ Investments No 1 (HC). McGechan J expressed the view that Lord Diplock’s approach was based on the legislation at the time. A t \[122\]: I regard the “new source” doctrine as obsolete. Observations made in Europa Oil (NZ) Limited v C of IR \[1976\] 1 NZLR 546 (PC) \[also reported as Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd v C of IR (No 2); C of IR v Europa Oil (No 2) (1976) 2 NZTC 61,661\] were based on former s 108 which pivoted on “alteration of incidence”. Section 99, in the expanded definition of “tax avoidance” contained in s 99(1), now extends beyond “alteration of incidence” to include even “directly or indirectly avoiding” liability. While there were obvious logical difficulties in regarding creation of a new source of income as “altering incidence”, that does not apply in relation to “avoiding”, and even less so in relation to “indirectly avoiding”. 524. The general anti-avoidance provision was substantially amended in 1974 to make the provision more effective than the section under consideration by Lord Diplock. The Privy Council in Challenge (PC) made this observation at 560: In the words of Richardson J in the present case “the old section 108 was found to be both unreasonably restrictive and too broad in its application” .... Section 108 was amended and replaced by a more extensive general anti-avoidance measure in 1974. 525. As was explained earlier, the Ben Nevis test focuses on whether the use of a provision or provisions is what Parliament would have intended, when the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is understood. There is no distinction in applying this test between existing or new sources of income. 526. A further aspect of the argument that tax avoidance cannot exist when the arrangement involves a new source of income is the suggestion that a change to an existing structure is more likely to invoke s BG 1 than a structure involving a new source of income. That is, if a change is made to an existing structure and a tax advantage is achieved, it may seem more likely that the change was made for that reason. If, instead, a structure is set up to obtain a new source of income, it is less readily apparent that a savings in tax must have been behind the structure. This argument might seem even more sustainable if a structure is set up and then later the law changes and a tax advantage is achieved. 527. If special considerations were to apply when a taxpayer has a new source of income, this might suggest subjective factors are incorrectly being taken into account. These types of arguments are based on the taxpayer’s knowledge about whether the arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement. However, the courts are clear that the test is not a subjective one (Newton at 465, Ashton (PC) at 721, and Glenharrow at \[38\]), and that an arrangement can be a tax avoidance arrangement whether or not the taxpayer has any knowledge that it constitutes tax avoidance (Peterson (PC) at \[34\] and BNZ Investments No 1 (CA) at \[52\], \[127\]–\[128\] and \[172\]). Therefore, whether the arrangement is an existing one or set up for a new source of income is not relevant in considering whether s BG 1 applies. WITHDRAWN 124 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 528. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers the presence of a “new source” of income will not, of itself, exclude the potential application of s BG 1, and variations of this argument based on similar propositions will also fail. Duke of Westminster 529. Taxpayers have also sometimes argued that the decision in Duke of Westminster stands for the proposition that taxpayers are entitled to order their affairs so the tax attaching is less than it otherwise would be. It follows from this argument that arrangements that satisfy the specific provisions will not be tax avoidance. The often quoted passage comes from the judgment of Lord Tomlin in that case at 19: Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax. 530. There is a long line of authority that this case is no longer relevant in considering the application of the anti-avoidance provision. See, for example, Woodhouse J in the Supreme Court decision in Elmiger at 686– 687. Baragwanath J in the High Court in Miller (HC) said at 13,032: Section 99 is not to be construed according to the Duke of Westminster’s case or Rowlatt J’s dictum \[that there is no equity to tax\]. 531. The Australian High Court in Spotless Services said Lord Tomlin’s statement in the Duke of Westminster had no significance in Australia where there is a statutory anti-avoidance provision (at 415). 532. Even in the absence of a specific legislative anti-avoidance measure, Lord Diplock in the House of Lords in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Burmah Oil Company Ltd ( 1982) SC (HL) 114 at 124 said that Lord Tomlin’s dicta was not very helpful in deciding whether a transaction would be recognised by the courts as effective. Also, in Inland Revenue Commissioners v McGuckian \[1997\] 1 WLR 991 (HL) at 999, Lord Steyn said that the dictum from Duke of Westminster was not consistent with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, where the correct approach was said not to be literal but to consider the clear words of the section in the context and scheme of the Act as a whole. 533. The Commissioner considers there is no place in avoidance law for any principle taken from the Duke of Westminster case that a structure that complies with specific provisions cannot be tax avoidance. The case was not referred to at all in Ben Nevis. Following Ben Nevis and other authority, taxpayers can structure their transactions to the best tax advantage if the use made of the Act is within Parliament’s contemplation. However, if, when an arrangement is viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, it can be seen that the use made of the Act is outside Parliament’s contemplation, the arrangement will be a tax avoidance arrangement, regardless of whether the arrangement satisfies the specific provisions. WITHDRAWN 125 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The argument that the Commissioner cannot dictate how taxpayers do business 534. Another argument sometimes put by taxpayers in avoidance cases is that the Commissioner is not allowed to dictate how taxpayers run their businesses. The High Court of Australia in Cecil Bros Pty Ltd v FCT (1964) 111 CLR 430 at 434 is often quoted in support of this proposition. The court said in that case, quoting from Ronpibon Tin NL and Tongkah Compound NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 60, “it is not for the Court or the Commissioner to say how much a taxpayer ought to spend in obtaining his income”. The argument is that in examining the amounts paid and received in an arrangement, and potentially adjusting these under s GA 1, the Commissioner is effectively telling taxpayers how much they should pay and receive in their business dealings. 535. Peterson (PC) is also used to support this argument. In that case, the Privy Council held that once the Commissioner had accepted that the taxpayers had paid an amount of $x+y to acquire a film, the Commissioner could not challenge the legitimacy of that amount. It was not relevant that the production company had made a “secret profit” of the amount of “y” at the expense of the investors (Peterson (PC) at \[42\]–\[43\], applying Europa No 2, which had in turn followed Cecil Bros). 536. It is true that when the specific provisions are considered alone, generally the bargains and pricing agreed on by the parties are taken at face value. In Penny (SC), the Supreme Court said it is accepted there is no concept of a commercially realistic salary in the Act—that it does not require an employee to be remunerated on such a basis and that family transactions may commonly not be based on market valuations. However, the court said if the salary is not commercially realistic, it will be open for the Commissioner to consider the arrangement further and test whether it amounts to a tax avoidance arrangement (at \[49\]). 537. Ben Nevis makes clear that under s BG 1 the true commercial and economic outcomes must be identified. Doing that may involve looking through the legal form to establish what the real outcomes are to identify, for example, inflated expenditure or pricing and circular flows of money. In Penny (CA), Randerson J took into account the fact that reduced salaries were paid while the taxpayers continued to devote their personal exertions to the generation of income exactly as they had before and while they also effectively retained control of the money. 538. The court in Glenharrow made this comment about the relationship between respecting bargains and promoting certainty in the tax system, and the application of s BG 1: \[48\] It may be said, and indeed the appellant does say, that to approach the question of the intent and application of the Act in this way is not to respect the bargain struck by the parties and would allow the Commissioner to restructure their bargain for them, with different GST consequences, and would thus be productive of uncertainty. But that uncertainty is inherent where transactions have artificial features combined with advantageous tax consequences not contemplated by the scheme and purpose of the Act. There will also inevitably be uncertainty whenever a taxing statute contains a general anti-avoidance provision intended to deal with and counteract such artificially favourable transactions. It is simply not possible to meet the objectives of a general anti-avoidance provision by the use, for example, of precise definitions, as may be able to be done where an anti-avoidance provision is directed at a specified type of transaction. WITHDRAWN 126 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 539. The point is, therefore, that while it is true the Commissioner has no ability to tell taxpayers how much they should pay or receive in their businesses under s BG 1, the tax outcomes sought under an arrangement may not be effective if the amounts paid and received do not accord with the commercial and economic reality. So, for example, some or all of an amount ‘paid’ based on the form of an arrangement may not be deductible when the true economic outlay is identified under s BG 1. Similarly, an amount received for a sale may be found not to reflect the true extent of the return for the taxpayer when the arrangement is viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way. Whether an arrangement that results in more tax paid overall can be a tax avoidance arrangement 540. Sometimes a taxpayer might argue that if an arrangement results in the payment of tax, it cannot be a tax avoidance arrangement. This argument might be made when the arrangement results in more tax paid overall, when the arrangement as a whole is considered, than if the arrangement had not been entered into. The same argument might be made in the related factual situation where an arrangement results in more tax being paid in total and, as a defence, the taxpayer points to an alternative arrangement not undertaken under which less tax would have been paid overall. 541. However, it is still possible that such arrangements can be tax avoidance arrangements provided at least one taxpayer affected by the arrangement has avoided tax. The Commissioner considers that this stance is supported by the following propositions. • The Act applies on a single taxpayer basis The primary reason is that the Act does not apply in a global way— rather, the specific provisions apply to individual taxpayers. Therefore, even if an arrangement results in the payment of more tax overall, if it results in an alteration of a single taxpayer's liability to tax (either now or in the future) or to pay tax, in a way not contemplated by Parliament, there will have been tax avoidance in relation to that taxpayer. In taking a view on whether there has been tax avoidance, it should be borne in mind that the test for a tax avoidance arrangement is to establish whether an arrangement makes use of the Act in a way that would not have been within Parliament's contemplation. The focus is on the use made of the Act, and not simply on how much tax is paid overall. This could mean that an arrangement may result in some taxpayers paying more tax as a result of entering into the arrangement while at least one other taxpayer has avoided tax. In such a case, the Commissioner may have regard to care and management responsibilities, and consider whether to allocate resources to investigating and pursuing a dispute because the application of s BG 1, if successful, may result in tax being refunded or a very small amount of tax being paid. Even then, the fact that an arrangement may result in tax being refunded or a very small amount of tax being paid will not necessarily be determinative. The Commissioner's decision would be based on the factors in ss 6 and WITHDRAWN 127 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and would include considering the facts of the case and the degree of concern about the particular tax outcomes under the Act. • No conflict with looking at the arrangement as a whole The Commissioner considers that the fact that the Act applies on a single taxpayer basis does not conflict with the principle that under s BG 1 the overall result of the arrangement is examined. Applying s BG 1 entails looking at the overall result of the arrangement to identify the real outcomes for the parties relevant to the provisions. However, once these real outcomes have been identified, the specific provisions used by, or that potentially apply to, each of the taxpayers involved are examined. • I n some situations, Parliament would have contemplated even more tax paid Even though, in some situations, some tax may have been paid under an arrangement had the arrangement not involved tax avoidance, Parliament could well have contemplated that a taxpayer would have paid even more tax under the provisions used or circumvented. • S ome tax avoidance arrangements require the payment of tax Some tax avoidance arrangements actually require the payment of tax to achieve the result that is outside of Parliament's contemplation. For example, the tax avoidance aspect of an arrangement might require a taxpayer to pay tax to generate imputation credits, so as to stream them to particular shareholders or as part of an arrangement to lower the cost of funding. The relevance of obtaining a tax advantage from another country 542. Some arrangements might have the effect of obtaining a tax advantage from another country’s tax system. The question arises whether this feature of an arrangement is relevant to considering whether s BG 1 applies. 543. The issue of whether this feature is relevant needs to be considered at two stages of the s BG 1 analysis—the Parliamentary contemplation test and the merely incidental test. 544. The Parliamentary contemplation test examines whether there is any tax avoidance. “Tax” for this purpose is defined in the Act to be New Zealand tax. Therefore, avoidance of foreign tax will not be “tax avoidance” for the purposes of applying s BG 1. 545. Under the merely incidental test, a non-tax avoidance purpose for the adoption of the particular specific structure may be relevant. Again, tax for this purpose is New Zealand tax, so avoidance of foreign tax would count as a non-tax avoidance purpose. If the New Zealand tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose, the arrangement is not a tax avoidance arrangement. As was explained, a tax avoidance purpose will be merely incidental if it follows as a natural incident from an arrangement structured a certain way for a non-tax avoidance purpose. If it can be shown that a structure was put in place in the specific way it was to gain a tax advantage from another country, then WITHDRAWN 128 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] it is possible that the New Zealand tax avoidance purpose follows as a natural concomitant. If the New Zealand tax avoidance purpose is pursued as a goal in itself in any respect, however, the tax avoidance purpose will not be merely incidental. 546. It might be suggested that the Court of Appeal in Alesco (at \[116\]) took the view that foreign tax purposes are irrelevant to s BG 1 in all circumstances. The Commissioner considers foreign tax purposes can be relevant to the merely incidental test and that the court should not be interpreted as rejecting this proposition. In that case the taxpayer argued that the tax benefits of an arrangement that took advantage of trans-Tasman tax asymmetry primarily arose in Australia. Although the Court of Appeal stated that “any consideration of the Australian \[tax\] position is rendered irrelevant once an arrangement is impugned in this country”, this was in the context of a discussion primarily concerned with subjective motives versus objective purposes or effects and not the merely incidental test. Therefore, the court can be seen to be saying Alesco’s perception of the Australian tax position was irrelevant. 547. More crucially, the court concluded that the fact that an arrangement was taking advantage of a foreign tax advantage does not immunise the arrangement from s BG 1. The court was emphasising that it will not be enough to simply assert a foreign tax purpose. If the New Zealand tax avoidance purpose is an end in itself and not merely incidental the fact that there is a foreign tax purpose will not preclude the application of s BG 1. 548. It should also be noted that New Zealand has responsibilities under various legal instruments, including tax treaties, to exchange information with other tax authorities. If an arrangement has the effect of gaining a tax advantage from another tax system, New Zealand may provide details and documentation to that other country. Argument for certainty 549. One argument often raised is that taxpayers should have certainty about how the tax laws apply so they can enter into transactions knowing the financial outcomes. It is not desirable, it is argued, that taxpayers do not know for sure whether s BG 1 applies to an arrangement. It is argued that certainty about tax outcomes will assist voluntary compliance, and that any approach to the section that does not give a sufficient level of certainty should not be adopted. 550. It is not as clear cut as might be suggested that such certainty is either possible or desirable. In 1998 the government established a Committee of Experts to consider and make recommendations on (amongst other things) avoidance and evasion. The Committee recognised that an alternate approach of legislating only specific anti-avoidance provisions could not be effective on its own because tax policy makers cannot identify and deal with all the various arbitrage opportunities inherent in the tax system (Tax Compliance: Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (December 1998) at \[6.36\]). In her article Defining taxpayer responsibility: In support of a general anti-avoidance principle \[2004\] BTR 332, United Kingdom author Judith Freedman has gone as far as arguing that clear lines may be an impossibility in avoidance law, and that the focus should be on a framework within which fair decisions can be made on an individual basis WITHDRAWN 129 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (at 344 and 353). She suggests that any attempt to create certainty through ever more detailed rules is not desirable because it leads to creative compliance through manipulation of those rules. 551. The courts have been clear when dealing with this argument that Parliament has deliberately chosen not to provide the desired level of certainty. In Ben Nevis, the Supreme Court said: \[112\] The appellants also argued that tax avoidance legislation should be interpreted in a way which gives taxpayers reasonable certainty in tax planning. But Parliament has left the general anti-avoidance provision deliberately general. That approach has been retained despite the introduction of a civil penalties regime in relation to taxpayers who take certain types of incorrect tax position. The courts should not strive to create greater certainty than Parliament has chosen to provide. We consider that the approach we have outlined gives as much conceptual clarity as can reasonably be achieved. As in many areas of the law, there are bound to be difficult cases at the margins. But in most cases we consider it will be possible, without undue difficulty, to decide on which side of the line a particular arrangement falls. 552. The taxpayer argued in Glenharrrow that the approach adopted to the anti-avoidance provision in the GST Act would enable the Commissioner to restructure the parties’ bargain and thus produce uncertainty for taxpayers. The Supreme Court said in response at \[48\]: But that uncertainty is inherent where transactions have artificial features combined with advantageous tax consequences not contemplated by the scheme and purpose of the Act. There will also inevitably be uncertainty whenever a taxing statute contains a general anti-avoidance provision intended to deal with and counteract such artificially favourable transactions. The above quotes were cited with approval by Randerson J in Penny (CA) at \[127\]–\[128\]. 553. The task for the court in any particular case is to resolve the dispute between the parties on the facts that are before it. In each case, it is for the court to decide on which side of the line each set of facts lies rather than prescribe whether a type of arrangement is in general a tax avoidance arrangement. In Penny (CA), Hammond J makes the following comment about the degree to which certainty can be attained or the form in which any certainty can take at \[162\]: Finally, courts exist to resolve particular controversies. Much as professional advisers may yearn for all-encompassing templates, to ask courts to attempt to anticipate other possible situations and produce clear, bright-line rules is undesirable and impracticable in taxation law. The function of the court is to see that the legislative purpose of Parliament is not overtaken by “merely clever” manipulation of particular rules, as happened in this case. And the court can only determine one case at a time. 554. Wild J, in BNZ Investments No 2 (HC), makes the same point (referring to paragraphs in Ben Nevis): \[131\] It is at step 2 that the court must decide “on which side of the line a particular arrangement falls” (\[112\]). Thus, line-calling remains the court’s function. By contrast, it is not the court’s function “to articulate how the line is to be drawn” (\[104\]). The certainty which tax advisers desire must continue to elude them. 555. Therefore, as with any other area of law, it is for the taxpayers and the Commissioner to apply the law in each case to reach a view on whether the facts before them may be subject to s BG 1. WITHDRAWN 130 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 556. Even though it is not possible for there to be the level of certainty taxpayers might desire about whether arrangements are tax avoidance arrangements, it is to be borne in mind that the scope of s BG 1 does not extend to every arrangement. If a use of provisions, or non-application of provisions, is contemplated by Parliament, then that use or non-application will not be tax avoidance. As discussed above (at paragraphs 389 to 394) a taxpayer may structure arrangements to their best tax advantage, provided the use of the provisions is within what Parliament would have contemplated. 557. It might also be that in many cases the level of uncertainty may not be as great as might be claimed. Many avoidance arrangements are not close to a line that would be discerned by a reasonable application of the Ben Nevis test. A number of the cases that have been held to be tax avoidance in recent years have involved more extreme facts. For example, the Court of Appeal in Accent (CA) said “we are satisfied that this scheme is well and truly across the ‘line’” (at \[146\]), and the Privy Council in Miller (PC) said at \[9\]: Given the highly artificial nature of the scheme, Their Lordships are not surprised that the Commissioner and every Judge who has considered the matter have been of opinion that it amounted to an arrangement which had the purpose or effect of tax avoidance within the meaning of s 99(2). As this is such a plain case, Their Lordships think it unnecessary to examine in any depth the criteria by which arrangements caught by s 99 may be distinguished from those which are not. 558. The fact that many tax avoidance arrangements are not close to the line is, in the Commissioner’s view, consistent with the point about certainty being made by the court in Ben Nevis where it said (at \[112\]): As in many areas of the law, there are bound to be difficult cases at the margins. But in most cases we consider it will be possible, without undue difficulty, to decide on which side of the line a particular arrangement falls. 559. Consequently, the Commissioner is of the view that the tax avoidance law in New Zealand, including the Parliamentary contemplation test, does provide an acceptable degree of clarity for the great majority of taxpayers. In this statement the Commissioner has sought to provide a framework and an approach to ss BG 1 and GA 1 that will guide taxpayers and their agents in their consideration of whether the tax avoidance provisions apply to their arrangements.
