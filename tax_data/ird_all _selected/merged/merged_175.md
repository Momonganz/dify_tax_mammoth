Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 1 SHORTFALL PENALTY—EVASION 1. SUMMARY 1.1 All legislative references in this interpretation statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the Act”) unless otherwise stated. 1.2 This statement provides a detailed interpretative explanation of the shortfall penalty imposed under section 141E for “evasion or a similar act”, with particular emphasis on what constitutes evasion “or a similar act”. 1.3 Section 141E(1) imposes a penalty for two types of behaviour that may occur in taking a tax position. • The first, in paragraph (a), is evasion (of the assessment or payment of tax by a taxpayer for themselves or another). • The second type, in the remaining paragraphs of section 141E(1), requires knowledge of the breaches set out in those paragraphs (misapplying a deduction or withholding tax, or not making tax deductions, or obtaining or attempting to obtain a refund for the taxpayer themselves or another knowing there is no entitlement to such a refund). 1.4 Evasion occurs when a taxpayer deliberately breaches a tax obligation. The required mental element for evasion will be present if the taxpayer knew or strongly suspected that the taxpayer’s course of conduct would breach a tax obligation. In other words, evasion requires intentional behaviour or subjective recklessness; negligence and carelessness are insufficient. 1.5 The other paragraphs of section 141E(1) set out various acts or omissions which constitute a “similar act” to evasion. They all require that the act or omission occurs “knowingly”. The following points should be noted in relation to this knowledge requirement: • These other paragraphs require that the taxpayer has knowledge of doing the act (or the omission); unlike evasion they do not require that the taxpayer has knowledge that the act or omission is in breach of a tax obligation; • The knowledge requirement can be satisfied by actual knowledge of or subjective recklessness toward the doing of the act (or of the omission). Like evasion, negligence and carelessness are insufficient to satisfy the test. 1.6 The statutory defence (in section 141E(2)) that can apply to section 141E(1)(b) (misapplying a deduction or withholding tax) applies only where the deduction has since been accounted for, and the taxpayer establishes (on the balance of Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 2 probabilities) that the illness, accident, or other cause beyond their control directly caused the breach. 1.7 Apportionment of a shortfall penalty (provided for in section 141F(2)) between the taxpayer (for example, a company) and the officer of the taxpayer involved is possible where the breach is failing to make or account for a deduction, or misapplying or permitting misapplication of a deduction. The criteria for determining the apportionment are the relative actions or omissions of the company and the officer involved, and the reasonableness of those actions or omissions. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 In March 1998, a Standard Practice Statement was published which dealt with the evasion or similar act penalty (INV-220). This appeared in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998). This Standard Practice Statement has now been withdrawn in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003. Standard Practice Statements dealing with shortfall penalties were withdrawn at this time due to the enactment of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, which made various changes to the shortfall penalty regime. One of these changes was the introduction of section 141FB, which deals with the reduction of penalties for previous behaviour. 2.2 The focus of this Interpretation Statement is on what constitutes “evasion or a similar offence”. As no changes were made to this concept, this Interpretation Statement will cover some of the same ground as the Standard Practice Statement, but will reflect recent amendments to the legislation and incorporate case law issued since the Standard Practice Statement was issued. The principles outlined in this statement are consistent with the Standard Practice Statement. They are also consistent with the brief examples of evasion contained in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 7 (October 1996) and the example of evasion given in “Shortfall penalties for failure to deduct or account for PAYE”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000). It should be noted, however, that of the factors set out in bullet points as factors to consider in the latter Tax Information Bulletin, only the fifth bullet point is relevant where it is the evasion shortfall penalty that is under consideration. 3. LEGISLATION 3.1 Section 3(1) includes the following definitions: 3 Definitions (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... “Shortfall penalty” means a penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections: ...

Construction of certain provisions— (1) In this Act— Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 4 (a) A provision referring to a tax liability or to a tax obligation, or to something a person must do, refers to a taxpayer's liability or obligation under a tax law: (b) A provision referring to a taxpayer taking a tax position or to a taxpayer's tax position, also refers to the taxpayer's— (i) Claiming or returning or not claiming or returning the tax position; or (ii) Paying or deducting or not paying or deducting an amount of tax; or (iii) Being placed in the tax position,— whether knowingly or intentionally or involuntarily: (c) A provision referring to a tax position taken in a tax return refers to a tax position taken explicitly or implicitly in the tax return: (ca) A provision referring to a tax position taken in an income statement refers to a tax position taken explicitly or implicitly in the income statement, whether or not the tax position was included by the Commissioner in the income statement: (d) A provision referring to a taxpayer's obligation to pay an amount of tax refers to the taxpayer's obligation to pay tax to the Commissioner: (e) A provision referring to a taxpayer's obligation to provide a tax return refers to the taxpayer's obligation to complete and provide the tax return to the Commissioner: (f) A provision referring to a taxpayer's obligation to provide a tax form refers to the taxpayer's obligation to complete and provide the tax form to the person entitled to it: (g) A provision referring to any tax (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a penalty) or interest is to be taken to be a reference to all, or part, or the relevant part, of the tax or interest. (2) For the purposes of this Act— (a) A company is deemed to make a dividend withholding payment deduction when payment is made to the company of a foreign withholding payment dividend: (b) A deduction is deemed to be made when payment is made of the net amount of any source deduction payment: (c) The amount of a deduction described in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) is deemed to have been applied for a purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner if the amount is not paid to the Commissioner by the relevant due date: (d) If the amount of a deduction described in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) is not paid to the Commissioner by the due date, the amount is deemed to be unpaid tax. (3) References in this Act to tax liabilities in respect of making, or accounting for, deductions of tax under the PAYE rules, to the extent necessary, are also to be construed as including references to liabilities in respect of making, or accounting for,— (a) Deductions of premiums payable under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or regulations made under Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 5 that Act or the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or a regulation made under that Act; or (aa) deductions of levies under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 or a regulation made under that Act; or (b) Deductions under the Child Support Act 1991; or (c) Repayment deductions or other deductions under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992,— where the relevant liabilities arise or are to be performed at the same time as the tax liabilities under the PAYE rules. (4) Where a taxpayer required to provide a return under any of sections NC 15, NF 4, NG 11, and NH 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004— (a) Furnishes a return that shows a liability to pay tax under that section; and (b) The tax is required to be paid by a due date for a return period; and (c) The liability shown in the return is greater than the tax that the taxpayer paid by the due date— the taxpayer's tax position in respect of the due date is the tax paid and not the amount of tax shown as payable in the tax return. (5) If a taxpayer does not provide a tax return for a return period, the taxpayer is deemed, in relation to each type of tax, to take, in respect of every due date that would be covered by a tax return for the return period if a return were provided, a tax position that is based on the tax of that type paid by the taxpayer for that return period. (6) Where— (a) A provision (in this subsection referred to as \`\`the relevant provision'') of this Act applies in respect of a taxpayer making an objection to or a challenge in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision, but not to both; and (b) It is necessary or appropriate for the purposes of another provision of this Act that applies with respect to objections or challenges, but not to both, that the relevant provision apply,— the relevant provision is to be read as if it referred with respect to both objections and challenges. 3.3 Section 141E imposes a liability for a shortfall penalty in the following terms: 141E Evasion or similar act (1) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if, in taking a tax position, the taxpayer— (a) Evades the assessment or payment of tax by the taxpayer or another person under a tax law; or (b) Knowingly applies or permits the application of the amount of a deduction or withholding of tax made or deemed to be made under a tax law for any purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner; or (c) Knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax required to be made by a tax law; or Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 6 (d) Obtains a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (da) Attempts to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (e) Enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (f) Attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law— (referred to as “evasion or a similar act”). (2) No person shall be chargeable with a shortfall penalty under subsection (1)(b) if that person satisfies the Commissioner that the amount of the deduction has been accounted for, and that the person's failure to account for it within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident, or some other causes beyond the person’s control. (3) If a taxpayer enables or attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law, the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person's tax position had been the taxpayer's tax position. (4) The penalty payable for evasion or a similar act described in subsection (1) is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. 3.4 Section 141F provides: 141F Commissioner to determine portions in which shortfall penalty payable by taxpayer and officers of taxpayer (1) If— (a) A taxpayer is required to make or account for a deduction or withholding of tax under a tax law; and (b) An officer of the taxpayer fails to make a deduction or withholding of tax under a tax law or applies or permits to be applied the amount of the deduction or withholding of tax other than in payment to the Commissioner,— one shortfall penalty, calculated in accordance with this Part, may be imposed in respect of each tax position taken by the taxpayer. (2) If the Commissioner determines that a shortfall penalty is required to be imposed, the Commissioner may determine the portion that each of the taxpayer and the officers is to be liable for that penalty having regard to— (a) The acts or omissions of the taxpayer and the officers; and (b) Whether those acts or omissions were reasonable in the circumstances of the case. Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 7 4. EVASION OR A SIMILAR ACT BACKGROUND TO THE SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR EVASION OR A SIMILAR ACT A tax position 4.1 Section 141E imposes a shortfall penalty for “evasion or a similar act”. A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer. For a shortfall penalty to apply, a “taxpayer’s tax position” must have been taken and have resulted in a “tax shortfall”. “Taxpayer’s tax position” is defined in section 3(1) to mean a “tax position” taken by a taxpayer in or in respect of a tax return, an income statement or a due date. The term “tax position” is defined in section 3(1) to mean a position or approach with regard to tax under one or more tax laws. The definition includes a non-exhaustive list of tax laws, a position or approach to which would constitute a tax position; e.g. a liability for an amount of tax; a right to a rebate etc. This definition is “without limitation” and, therefore, very broad. This is further indicated by section 4A, which defines the construction of certain provisions, and, in respect of “tax position” provides: 4A. Construction of certain provisions— (1) In this Act— (a) A provision referring to a tax liability or to a tax obligation, or to something a person must do, refers to a taxpayer’s liability or obligation under a tax law: (b) A provision referring to a taxpayer taking a tax position or to a taxpayer's tax position, also refers to the taxpayer’s— (i) Claiming or returning or not claiming or returning the tax position; or (ii) Paying or deducting or not paying or deducting an amount of tax; or (iii) Being placed in the tax position,— whether knowingly or intentionally or involuntarily: (c) A provision referring to a tax position taken in a tax return refers to a tax position taken explicitly or implicitly in the tax return: (ca) A provision referring to a tax position taken in an income statement refers to a tax position taken explicitly or implicitly in the income statement, whether or not the tax position was included by the Commissioner in the income statement: 4.2 “Tax position” is, thus, a wide term and would appear to encompass all eventualities: it includes acts and omissions (including filing a return or not filing a return) whether involuntary or knowing, and if a return is made it includes implicit as well as explicit tax positions. The term “tax shortfall” is defined in section 3(1) to mean the difference between the taxpayer’s tax position for the return period and the correct tax position. Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 8 The penalty 4.3 The Act divides actions of taxpayers which would result in a tax shortfall into five categories of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category. At the extreme end of the scale is behaviour covered by section 141E and subject to a penalty of 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. 4.4 Section 141E(1) imposes a shortfall penalty on a taxpayer who evades the assessment or payment of tax for themselves or others, or who knowingly misapplies a deduction or withholding tax, or who knowingly does not make tax deductions, or who obtains or attempts to obtain a refund for themselves or another knowing there is no entitlement to such a refund. Thus section 141E(1) essentially contains two types of behaviour: the first, in paragraph (a) is evasion; the second type, in the remaining paragraphs of section 141E(1), requires knowledge of the breaches set out in those paragraphs. 4.5 The shortfall penalty of 150% of the resulting tax shortfall is subject to various reductions potentially available under sections 141FB (previous behaviour: 50%), 141FD (shareholders of loss attributing qualifying companies); 141G (voluntary disclosure: 40% or 75%), 141I (temporary shortfall: 75%) and 141J (limitation of reduction). The penalty is also subject to a 25% increase under section 141K if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position. The following related Standard Practice Statements may assist in the interpretation and application of these adjustment provisions: • INV-231 Temporary Shortfall - permanent reversal (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 8 (September 1999)); • INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002)); • INV-260 Notification of a Pending Audit or Investigation (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000)); • INV-295 Reduction of Shortfall Penalties for Previous Behaviour (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 3 (April 2004)) (NB: this item was under review when this Exposure Draft was published; see Exposure Draft ED-0086); 4.6 It should also be noted that where the shortfall penalty results from the failure to make or account for deductions or withholding taxes or from applying those to a purpose other than payment to the Commissioner, there is an ability (section 141F) for the Commissioner to apportion the shortfall penalty between a company taxpayer and its officers involved. 4.7 Unlike the other shortfall penalties, the burden of proving “evasion or a similar act” to which section 141E applies is specifically placed on the Commissioner (section 149A(2)). However, as with the other shortfall penalties, it is a civil penalty and the standard of proof is therefore the balance of probabilities (section 149A(1)). Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 9 The relationship of the shortfall penalty with criminal prosecution 4.8 Another unique feature of “evasion or a similar act” is that, as well as giving rise to liability for a shortfall penalty, there is the prospect of a criminal prosecution. Section 143B(2) provides that it is a criminal offence for a person to evade or attempt to evade the assessment or payment of tax by themselves or another. Section 143B(1) covers acts (such as not making tax deductions or providing false returns) which are done either with the intent of evading the assessment or payment of tax, or in order to obtain a refund or payment of tax for themselves or any other person with the knowledge that there is no entitlement to such a refund or payment. The penalty for an offence under section 143B is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $50,000, or both. 4.9 Criminal liability for the tax deduction offences (misapplying or not making deductions) is imposed by section 143A. It is headed “knowledge offences” and includes the same tax deduction offences in paragraphs 143A(1)(d) and (e) as set out in paragraphs 141E(1)(b) and (c). The penalty for an offence against section 143A is $25,000 for a first offence and $50,000 for subsequent offences. For misapplying deductions there is provision, in some situations, for imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $50,000, or both (section 143A(8)). For these criminal prosecutions the onus of proof is on the Commissioner (section 149A(4)). The standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt (section 149A(3)). 4.10 Section 149(5) states that the Commissioner may not prosecute a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position if a shortfall penalty has been imposed for taking that incorrect tax position. However, section 149(4) specifically provides that the Commissioner can impose civil penalties (which includes the evasion shortfall penalty) after a taxpayer has been prosecuted for an offence under the Act, regardless of whether the prosecution was successful or not. 4.11 It is considered that the reference to whether or not the prosecution was successful is an acknowledgement of the different standards of proof on the Commissioner in this area. As noted above, in criminal prosecutions the Commissioner has the onus of proof to the standard of “beyond reasonable doubt” (see sections 149(3) and 149A(4)). For the shortfall penalty of evasion, the Commissioner has the onus of proof to the standard of “balance of probabilities” (see sections 149A(1) and 149A(2)). Because of this difference, it is possible that the Commissioner may fail to satisfy the evidential standard in a criminal prosecution, yet have sufficient evidence to satisfy the lower threshold of the balance of probabilities for the evasion shortfall penalty. 4.12 In determining whether to impose a shortfall penalty for evasion the Commissioner will consider a number of criteria including: • Whether the taxpayer has been previously prosecuted and/or been subject to shortfall penalties for evasion; • The reason given by the taxpayer for his/her behaviour; Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 10 • The degree of culpability of the taxpayer; • The likelihood of future compliance; • The degree of cooperation received from the taxpayer; • The effect on promoting voluntary compliance; and • The duty to protect the integrity of the tax system. 4.13 Where the taxpayer has been prosecuted for evasion the following additional factors will be considered: • Whether the taxpayer was successfully prosecuted under section 143B of the Act; and • Comments made by the judge in sentencing the offender (in the event of a successful prosecution). 4.14 Although the Act provides for both civil and criminal forms of evasion, in the remainder of this Interpretation Statement the focus will be on the civil shortfall penalty for “evasion or a similar act” provided for by section 141E(1). The concept of “evasion” in paragraph (a) will be considered first, followed by the knowledge offences in the remaining paragraphs of section 141E(1). The concept of evasion 4.15 Evasion is unique amongst the shortfall penalties in that it requires mens rea or the mental element of intention. This distinction was recognised in Case W4 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,034 where Judge Barber stated: 44 .... “gross carelessness” refers to a high level of disregard for the consequences and is characterised by conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring where this risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances \[but may not have been foreseen by the taxpayer in question\]. 45 It seems to me that if mens rea is involved then there must be tax evasion rather than gross carelessness. \[Emphasis and bracketed words added\] 4.16 The need for a mental element was also recognised in an obiter comment in CIR v Peterson (2002) 20 NZTC 17,589 where Hammond J stated that evasion occurs when a taxpayer seeks to reduce tax through fraudulent misrepresentation: 30 It has long been recognised that there are three broad categories by which taxpayers may seek to reduce the burden of tax. The first is outright taxation evasion. This is really a form of fraudulent misrepresentation, and is subject to heavy penalties, and even the criminal law. Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 11 Mens rea or the mental element of evasion 4.17 There is long-standing case law on the specific mental element required to constitute evasion. The requirement is that the taxpayer has endeavoured or intended to avoid the payment of tax. In Taylor v Attorney-General \[1963\] NZLR 261, in relation to section 231 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, McGregor J considered the meaning of the word “evade”. At page 262 he stated: The meaning... most consonant with the intention of the Legislature is that adopted in the High Court of Australia in Wilson v Chambers Proprietary Ltd. (1926) 38 C.L.R. 131. In dealing with a section of the Customs Act “No person shall evade payment of any duty which is payable”. Higgins J (ibid., 148) expresses the view “To say the least ‘evade’ would seem to connote the exercise of will in avoiding; whereas a mere failure to pay may be by accident or mistake”. Starke J adverts to the intentional avoidance of payment and says: “Clearly, in my opinion, the word ‘evade’ in the Act does not necessarily involve any device or underhand dealing for the purpose of escaping duty; but on the other hand it involves something more than a mere omission or neglect to pay the duty. It involves, in my opinion, the intentional avoidance of payment in circumstances indicating to the party that he is or may be under some obligation to pay duty. The circumstances may consist of knowledge, or neglect of available means of knowledge, that the omission to pay is or may be in contravention of the Customs law' (ibid., 151). In my view the word “evade” associated with the expressions “attempts to evade” or “does any act with intent to evade” includes an element of intent ....This also seems to be in conformity with the view of Knox CJ in the same case, when he says: “The distinction in meaning between the words ‘evade’ and ‘avoid’ is well established, and a charge of evading payment is not made out by evidence which proves no more than that the person charged failed or omitted to pay an amount payable by him” (ibid.,136). \[emphasis added\] 4.18 It can be seen from these comments that the taxpayer’s intention is relevant in determining whether the person has evaded the assessment or payment of tax. Simply establishing that a person has failed to return or pay tax on an amount will not be sufficient to prove evasion. The intention or mens rea element of evasion will be satisfied if the taxpayer knew that their act or omission was in breach of a tax obligation. Recklessness is sufficient mens rea 4.19 It is clear that intention or actual knowledge will satisfy the mens rea element of evasion. In addition, in a number of cases decided under the previous penal tax regime the courts have also held that in some cases recklessness will also satisfy the mens rea element of evasion. This is illustrated by Judge Barber in Case S100 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,626 at page 7,627: The respondent accepts that it must prove an intent on behalf of the objector to evade payment of tax and that evade is more than failing or omitting to pay and is more than mere negligence. However, recklessness can amount to evasion. A deliberate disregard of one’s obligations may amount to recklessness as may an appreciation of a positive risk and proceeding regardless. \[Emphasis added\] Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 12 4.20 For further examples where recklessness has been held to be sufficient to constitute evasion see Case N6 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,043, 3,046; Case N53 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,419, 3,420; Case Q19 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,104, 5,107; and Case Q20 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,108. 4.21 In considering the meaning of “recklessness” it is helpful to refer to the meaning given to the term in the criminal law. This was the approach taken by Judge Willy in Case P29 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,213 discussed at paragraph 4.26 below. 4.22 In the criminal law “recklessness” has in the past been given two inconsistent meanings: objective or inadvertent recklessness and subjective recklessness. The general position in the criminal law in New Zealand is that recklessness is to be tested subjectively, unless the context of the legislation requires an objective interpretation. Adams on Criminal Law (Brookers, April 2006) at paragraph CA20.24 states: Two meanings of “recklessness” In modern case law “recklessness” has been given two inconsistent meanings; one requires actual awareness of the risk of committing the alleged offence while the other does not require such awareness. While the first of these has been recognised as the basic meaning of the concept in this country and in other common law jurisdictions, (see CA20.25; Sansregret v R (1985) 17 DLR (4th) 577; \[1985\] 1 SCR 570 (SCC); R v Smith (1982) A Crim R 437 (HC); R v G \[2003\] UKHL 50; \[2003\] 4 All ER 765 (HL)), “inadvertent recklessness” may still be relevant in some contexts. ... (1) Recklessness as the conscious taking of an unreasonable risk This is commonly described as “subjective recklessness”, to emphasise the need for actual awareness, or “Cunningham recklessness”, after the first modern English case which clearly adopted this meaning: R v Cunningham \[1957\] 2 QB 396; \[1957\] 2 All ER 412 (CA). In 1970 a UK Law Commission Working Paper formulated the test as follows: “A person is reckless if, (a) knowing that there is a risk that an event may result from his conduct or that a circumstance may exist, he takes that risk; and (b) it is unreasonable for him to take it having regard to the degree and nature of the risk which he knows to be present.” This was adopted in R v Stephenson \[1979\] QB 695 (CA). (2) Inadvertent recklessness In Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis v Caldwell \[1982\] AC 341, also reported as R v Caldwell \[1981\] 1 All ER 961 (HL), the House of Lords had to interpret s 1 Criminal Damage Act 1971 (UK) which makes it an offence to damage property “being reckless” as to whether property would be damaged. The majority held that “reckless” should be given its ordinary meaning, which it held was not confined to cases where the risk was actually foreseen, and that a person is reckless as to whether property would be damaged if (p 354; p 966): (1) He does an act which in fact creates an obvious risk that property will be damaged; and Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 13 (2) When he does the act he either has not given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or has recognised that there was some risk involved and has nevertheless gone on to do it. 4.23 The extract above from Adams on Criminal Law notes that subjective recklessness has been recognised as the basic meaning of the concept in this country and in other common law jurisdictions. However, it also notes that inadvertent or objective recklessness may still be relevant in some contexts. This has been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in R v Harney \[1987\] 2 NZLR 576 at 579: Subject to the requirements of particular contexts, however, we incline to the view that “recklessly” has usually been understood in New Zealand to have the meaning given in pre-Caldwell textbooks \[i.e. a subjective meaning\]. 4.24 Harney can be compared with R v Howe \[1982\] 1 NZLR 618, an earlier Court of Appeal case in which an objective meaning of recklessness was adopted. However, it has been suggested that the objective meaning adopted in Howe can be attributed to the particular context in which that case was decided and that it does not support the general application of an objective standard in New Zealand (see Adams on Criminal Law at paragraph 20.25). 4.25 For other non-tax cases, which support the subjective interpretation of recklessness see Bottrill v A \[2001\] 3 NZLR 622 (CA) at para 170; R v H (1989) 4 CRNZ 461, 464 and R v Stephens (unreported, High Court, T 91/83, Auckland, 8 December 1983) 4.26 In Case P29 Judge Willy traversed the taxation case law and the New Zealand criminal law cases on recklessness. Following the case law discussion, he held that recklessness was to be tested subjectively. At page 4,222 he stated: Although those expressions of what is the proper test to be applied in New Zealand relate to specific provisions of the Crimes Act I nevertheless think they are of general guidance to this Authority in deciding how to approach questions of recklessness in the context of the objector's obligation to disclose all of his taxable income in any given year. In doing so however it must be borne clearly in mind that there is still an ingredient of moral turpitude in a finding of recklessness. It must never in my view be confused with mere negligence or inattention. Before recklessness can be said to exist some degree of knowledge must be present. As it is put by Mr Simon France in his article "A reckless approach to liability" 1988 18 VUWLR 144 at p 146 the person must: Have ignored a risk they knew to be present so as to avoid the unpleasantness of having their suspicions confirmed. Where negligence is alleged no actual knowledge of the relevant matter of fact need be present. For various policy reasons the law of negligence has substituted for actual knowledge of the facts some presumed knowledge which would have been acquired by the use of reasonable foresight. Where recklessness is alleged the Commissioner must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the facts which were actually known to the taxpayer were such that they must have put him on enquiry that the income returned for tax purpose was understated. Faced with those facts the Commissioner must then show that the taxpayer made the conscious decision to ignore them and to return the understated income without making any further enquiry. Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 14 Conclusion I endeavour to approach the question of whether the objector in this case was reckless having regard to that subjective test. 4.27 Judge Willy’s adoption in Case P29 of the subjective meaning of recklessness is supported by Judge Barber’s comment in Case S100 set out in paragraph 4.19 above, where he states that a deliberate disregard of one’s obligations may amount to recklessness. The “deliberate disregard” of an obligation implies that the taxpayer has knowledge of the risk that the obligation exists. 4.28 While Cases P29 and S100 support a subjective meaning of recklessness, it is noted that in Case M117 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,749, a case involving a knowledge offence, Judge Barber made the obiter comment that recklessness should be tested objectively. At page 2,755 Judge Barber stated: My analysis of the objector's conduct, as shown by the evidence, does not reveal to me any degree of recklessness. Possibly, she has been rather careless, or even negligent, but she was always concerned about her obligations and failed to meet them through pressures of work and pressures in her personal life and, apparently, due to a certain amount of confusion and muddlement. These aspects are quite inconsistent with recklessness. I was not addressed on the concept of recklessness but it seems helpful to refer to the criminal law. In R v Caldwell \[1982\] AC 341 the House of Lords applied an objective test of whether or not a defendant is shown to have acted recklessly. The New Zealand Court of Appeal applied Caldwell in R v Howe \[1982\] 1 NZLR 618, a case involving allegations of riotous damage, and said at p 623: - “As to recklessness, there has been a line of cases in England of high authority affirming that this word has no separate legal meaning. And that, although involving more than mere carelessness, it is not limited to deliberate risk-taking but includes failing to give any thought to an obvious and serious risk: R v Caldwell \[1982\] AC 341; \[1981\] 1 All ER 961, R v Lawrence, R v Pigg \[1982\] 2 All ER 591; \[1982\] 1 WLR 762.” All in all, the approach of the objector may have been casual, but not to the extent of recklessness. 4.29 Judge Barber’s comment in Case M117 that recklessness is to be tested objectively is based on a brief analysis of Howe and Caldwell. However, as represented by Harney (discussed from paragraph 4.23) the general position in the criminal law in New Zealand is that recklessness is to be tested subjectively, unless the context of the legislation requires an objective interpretation. It is noted that Case M117 was decided three years after Harney. It is unclear why Judge Barber did not refer to this case. 4.30 It is considered that when balanced against Cases P29 and S100 and the comments of the Court of Appeal in Harney on recklessness in the criminal law, the weight of authority indicates that recklessness is to be tested subjectively for the purposes of the evasion penalty. 4.31 It is considered that based on the case law discussed above subjective recklessness is sufficient to satisfy the mens rea requirement of evasion. A taxpayer will be subjectively reckless if the taxpayer avoids tax in Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 15 circumstances where the taxpayer knew or strongly suspected that the taxpayer’s conduct would breach a tax obligation. 4.32 The next question is whether recklessness is sufficient mens rea for evasion under the current penalties regime. Section 141E sets out the current evasion civil penalty: 141E Evasion or similar act— (1) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if, in taking a tax position, the taxpayer— (a) Evades the assessment or payment of tax by the taxpayer or another person under a tax law; or (b) Knowingly applies or permits the application of the amount of a deduction or withholding of tax made or deemed to be made under a tax law for any purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner; or (c) Knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax required to be made by a tax law; or (d) Obtains a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (da) attempts to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (e) Enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (f) attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law— (referred to as “evasion or a similar act”). (2) No person shall be chargeable with a shortfall penalty under subsection (1)(b) if that person satisfies the Commissioner that the amount of the deduction has been accounted for, and that the person's failure to account for it within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident, or some other cause beyond the person's control. (3) If a taxpayer enables or attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law, the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person's tax position had been the taxpayer's tax position. (4) The penalty payable for evasion or a similar act described in subsection (1) is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. \[Emphasis added\] 4.33 From the words of section 141E(1) it can be seen that the evasion penalty is a knowledge offence. The evasion penalty is imposed upon a taxpayer who evades or knowingly commits an action that affects their liability to pay tax. It is noted that the current penalty regime continues to use the word “evade”. Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 16 This word has not been defined under either regime, although the courts have discussed the meaning of the word in cases decided under the previous regime (see paragraph 4.19 above). It is considered that the word “evade” in section 141E(1)(a) has the same meaning as it did in the previous regime in section 420 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and that the case law on the meaning of “evades” will continue to apply under the current regime. 4.34 In Cases P29 and S100 (discussed at paragraphs 4.26 and 4.27), which were decided under the previous penal tax regime, it was held that subjective recklessness is sufficient mens rea for evasion. It is considered that the reasoning underlying these decisions will also apply to evasion under the current penalties regime as the term “evasion” continues to be used in section 141E. 4.35 In addition, the conclusion that the recklessness must be subjective is supported by paragraphs (b) to (f) of section 141E(1), which each deal with an act committed with the knowledge that the act is unlawful. This knowledge requirement is consistent with a subjective approach to recklessness in section 141E(1)(a). That the recklessness must be subjective is also supported by non- tax case law. This non-tax case law has held that the general position is that recklessness is to be tested subjectively unless the context requires otherwise (see discussion from paragraph 4.22). The context of section 141E does not require an objective approach. Rather the context of section 141E, and in particular the knowledge requirement discussed above, supports a subjective approach to recklessness. 4.36 It is considered that subjective recklessness will continue to be sufficient mens rea for evasion under the current penalty regime. Relationship between evasion and gross carelessness 4.37 Having concluded that subjective recklessness is sufficient mens rea for evasion under section 141E, the final matter to resolve is the interaction between the evasion and gross carelessness shortfall penalties in respect to recklessness. There is potential for some confusion as to the interaction between these penalties, which is highlighted by Judge Barber’s comments in Case W4 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,034 that “gross carelessness must be something similar to recklessness”. 4.38 Section 141C sets out the gross carelessness civil penalty: 141C Gross carelessness— (1) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer is grossly careless in taking a taxpayer's tax position (referred to as “gross carelessness”). (2) The penalty payable for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3) For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences. Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 17 (4) A taxpayer who takes an acceptable tax position is also a taxpayer who has not been grossly careless in taking the taxpayer's tax position. 4.39 It is considered that gross carelessness is similar to objective recklessness. Doing or not doing something in a way that suggests a “high level of disregard for the consequences” could be regarded as reckless. In addition, the words “in all the circumstances” and “suggests or implies”, suggest the application of a reasonable person test. Under this wording it appears that the person need not actually have a high level of disregard for the consequences. The definition simply requires that after considering all the circumstances, the taxpayer’s conduct “suggests or implies” a high level of disregard for the consequences. 4.40 It is considered that when Judge Barber made the statement in Case W4 that “gross carelessness must be something similar to recklessness” he was comparing gross carelessness with objective recklessness. In interpreting the term “gross carelessness” Judge Barber adopted an objective test. At paragraph 44 he stated: The term “gross carelessness” for the purposes of the penalties provisions of the Act is defined in s 141C(3) as “doing or not doing of something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies a complete or high level of disregard for the consequences”. I agree with Ms Parkash that the definition of “gross carelessness” refers to a high level of disregard for the consequences and is characterised by conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring where this risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances. \[Emphasis added\] 4.41 Given that Judge Barber adopted an objective test in interpreting the term “gross carelessness”, his subsequent statement that gross carelessness must be something similar to recklessness is considered to have been referring to objective recklessness. This is confirmed by his subsequent comments that if mens rea is involved, there is evasion not gross carelessness. Judge Barber stated: It seems to me that if mens rea is involved then there must be tax evasion rather than gross carelessness. The defendant seems to accept that, in this case, there was no mens rea or the mental element of intention. While I accept that stance of the defendant, I find it rather generous. 4.42 Judge Barber also found the Commissioner’s acceptance that there was no mens rea in Case W4 “rather generous”. 4.43 The concept of recklessness can be relevant to both evasion and gross carelessness. Where the taxpayer is subjectively reckless, that is, where the taxpayer strongly suspects that their conduct will result in a breach of a tax obligation and proceeds regardless, this is sufficient mens rea for evasion. However, if the taxpayer is objectively reckless; that is, the taxpayer is genuinely unaware that their conduct has created a high risk of a tax shortfall, but the risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances, then this will give rise to a shortfall penalty for Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 18 gross carelessness. This is consistent with paragraph 1.2 of the Gross Carelessness Statement published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 8 (September 2004). “Gross carelessness” is defined in section 141C(3) to mean doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences. The test for gross carelessness is objective and is based on what a reasonable person would foresee as being conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring. Gross carelessness involves recklessness but, unlike evasion, does not require an element of mens rea or intent to breach a tax obligation. 4.44 A person who is subjectively reckless in taking a tax position could in some situations satisfy the criteria for both a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness and a shortfall penalty for evasion. Subjective recklessness is likely to satisfy the gross carelessness standard as well as the mental element required for evasion. In such situations, subsections (2) and (3) of section 149 will apply. Subsection (2) states that the taxpayer can only be liable for one shortfall penalty for each tax shortfall and subsection (3) states that the highest penalty will apply. Therefore, if the taxpayer is potentially liable for both evasion and gross carelessness, only the evasion shortfall penalty will apply. 4.45 Thus, subjective recklessness is sufficient mens rea for evasion to exist. Recklessness is the conscious taking of a risk; knowing the facts and choosing to ignore them or the need to be on enquiry to which they give rise. If the taxpayer strongly suspects an obligation may exist but does not investigate further before taking a tax position this could amount to recklessness and evasion if a tax shortfall results. By contrast, if the taxpayer is honestly unaware of (and has no reason to be on enquiry as to) an obligation so has no intention to endeavour to avoid it, the penalty for evasion will not apply (although the gross carelessness or lack of reasonable care penalties may). Proving intent 4.46 As mentioned earlier, the burden of proof is on the Commissioner and the standard is that of the balance of probabilities. This means the Commissioner must prove that it is more likely than not that the taxpayer had the requisite mens rea for evasion. This mens rea requires that the taxpayer knew or strongly suspected that the taxpayer’s course of conduct would breach a tax obligation. The test for evasion is a subjective test – it must be proved that the particular taxpayer had certain knowledge, but it can be tested objectively. In other words the requisite knowledge or intention may be inferred through an objective analysis of the surrounding circumstances and conduct. 4.47 In Lloyds Bank Ltd v Marcan \[1973\] 2 All ER 359, the Court stated at page 367-8: The word ‘intent’ denotes a state of mind. A man’s intention is a question of fact. Actual intent may unquestionably be proved by direct evidence or may be inferred Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 19 from surrounding circumstances. Intent may also be imputed on the basis that a man must be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own act: see the judgments of Lord Hatherley LC and Giffard LJ in Freeman v Pope. 4.48 In Case H90 (1986) 8 NZTC 619 at 624 Barber DJ made a similar statement regarding inferring intent: ... recklessness may amount to intention and that intent can be inferred by reference to such factors as the taxpayer’s background and business experience. Evasion includes an element of intent, and actual knowledge can be established by direct evidence or by inference. Evasion– summary 4.49 In summary, evasion: • Occurs when a taxpayer breaches a tax obligation and the taxpayer knew or strongly suspected that the taxpayer’s conduct would result in that breach: • Requires intentional behaviour or subjective recklessness. Similar acts 4.50 As mentioned earlier, section 141E(1) essentially contains two types of behaviour. The first is evasion, which is set out in paragraph (a). The second type is set out in the remaining paragraphs of section 141E(1) and requires that the breaches set out in those paragraphs occurred “knowingly”. It is this knowledge requirement that makes a breach of one of these paragraphs a “similar act” to evasion. Evasion requires knowledge in that the taxpayer must know or strongly suspect that their conduct will result in the breach of a tax obligation. “Knowingly” 4.51 The concept of “knowingly” has been discussed in a recent case. Case W3 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,014 concerned PAYE deductions made by the taxpayer but applied for a purpose other than payment to the Commissioner (section 141E(1)(b)). It was held that the taxpayer had done so knowingly, and Judge Barber made the following observations on “knowingly”: \[53\] .... It is not seriously in dispute that this was done “knowingly” in terms of s 141E(1)(b) so there is little point in my traversing the case authorities cited on that concept. However, in looking at that concept, it is settled law that the test of knowledge is subjective, refer Meulen's Hair Stylists Ltd v C of IR \[1963\] NZLR 797 (SC); and that negligence or carelessness are insufficient to satisfy the test of “knowingly” , refer Meulen's case and Godfrey Allan Ltd v C of IR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,548 (HC). Actually, that is consistent with the current shortfall penalty regime which has separate shortfall penalties for “lack of reasonable care” and “carelessness”. The test is whether the failure to account for PAYE was something known to the defendant to have occurred. Recklessness as to whether the PAYE has been paid is sufficient to amount to a known failure to pay — refer Case R31 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,171. Knowledge of the existence of the facts in question without knowledge of the unlawfulness of an act will be sufficient — Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 20 refer C of IR v Gordon (1989) 11 NZTC 6,082 (HC). Knowledge of a responsible officer of a taxpayer company may be attributed to the company — refer Meulens case. 4.52 It is worth considering the point regarding the Gordon case referred to by Judge Barber. There it was held that as the taxpayer’s conduct was only considered to be that of carelessness and failure to interest himself in his obligation to account for tax deductions in that case, it could not be shown that he had “knowingly” done so in terms of section 368(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Jeffries J held that there had to be knowledge of the facts relating to the act that was required to be done, but that knowledge that the law made it an offence was not necessary. He stated at page 6,084: In my view the word “knowingly”, as used in the section, imports only a knowledge of the existence of the facts in question, when those facts are such as bring the act within the provision of the law. The word does not require in its meaning any knowledge of the unlawfulness of such acts. See CIR v Orme (1984) 6 NZTC 61,831; (1984) 8 TRNZ 129. A requirement of knowledge does not mean that the act must be done with any specific intent. 4.53 For example, in Meulens it was stated at page 799: In my opinion if the prosecution proved in each case (not necessarily by direct evidence, which would usually be quite unobtainable but at least by necessary inference from proved facts) that on the 21 st day of the relevant month the appellant company, by some responsible officer, had knowledge that a payment was due on the preceding 20 th and that it had not then been paid that would clearly be sufficient to establish that the appellant knowingly failed to make the payment. 4.54 Although Case W3 was on paragraph (b) of section 141E(1), the observations on “knowingly” are applicable to all the paragraphs of section 141E(1) which use that term. It can be seen that many of the points made are consistent with the discussion above on “evasion”, however, unlike evasion it does not require any “blameworthy” intent to breach a law that is either known or suspected to exist. “Knowingly”: • requires knowledge of the doing of the act (or of the omission) that amounts to a breach; • is a subjective test; • can be satisfied by recklessness, but • negligence or carelessness is insufficient to satisfy the test. Paragraph (b) of section 141E(1) 4.55 Paragraph (b) imposes a shortfall penalty on a taxpayer who knowingly applies or permits the application of the amount of a deduction or withholding of tax made or deemed to be made under a tax law for any purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner. As was said in Case W3 (paragraph 47), three elements must be satisfied before a taxpayer’s liability for a shortfall penalty for failure to account for PAYE deductions can be established; namely, he or she must have taken a “tax position”, applied or permitted the Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 21 application of PAYE deductions for a purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner, and done so knowingly. Barber DJ went on to note that the first two elements are easily satisfied: \[48\] The relevant tax law is s NC 15(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 which states that the disputant is required to make PAYE deduction payments to the defendant. The disputant made the relevant deductions from the wages of employees and was therefore required to pay same to the defendant but failed to do so. Refraining from filing a return or from making payment of an amount of tax constitutes taking a “tax position” for the purposes of s 141E. It is clear from s 4A(1)(b)(ii) of the TAA that non-payment of PAYE to the defendant by the due date is the taking of a tax position. Further, s 4A(2)(d), together with (b), deems a deduction to be unpaid tax if not paid by the due date. By failing to pay the PAYE deductions by the due date, the defendant has taken a tax position and that is so with a failure to pay any amount of tax. .... \[53\] In accordance with s 4A(2)(c) it is deemed that all those failures to pass on PAYE have been applied for a purpose other than in payment to the defendant. 4.56 The tax position element has been discussed earlier in this statement (see paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2) where the breadth of that term and consequent ease of satisfying it is discussed. In terms of tax positions relating to the deduction offences (such as section 141E(1)(b)) it is worth discussing Judge Barber’s reference to “s 4A(2)(d), together with (b)”. These are construction provisions which state that a deduction is deemed to be made when payment of any net source deduction payment occurs and, if such a deemed deduction is not paid to the Commissioner by due date it is deemed to be unpaid tax. As mentioned earlier, the section 3(1)(a) definition of “tax position” includes a liability for the payment of an amount of tax, and thus the effect of these construction provisions is that a tax position has been taken. 4.57 Similarly, the second element (that the taxpayer has applied or permitted the application of the amount for any purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner) is satisfied by a deeming provision. Section 4A(2)(c) provides that deemed deduction payments are deemed to have been applied for a purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner. The effect of these construction provisions is that the only element that remains to be proved when section 141E(1)(b) is considered is whether the element of “knowingly” has been met. 4.58 “Knowingly” has been discussed above: it requires knowledge (or subjective recklessness) of the doing of the act (or of the omission) that amounts to a breach. In Case W3 Judge Barber said (paragraph 53): It is settled law that the test of knowledge is subjective, refer Meulen's Hair Sylists \[sic\] Ltd v CIR \[1963\] NZLR 797 (SC); and that negligence or carelessness are insufficient to satisfy the test of "knowingly", refer Meulen's case and Godfrey Allan Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,548 (HC)... The test is whether the failure to account for PAYE was something known to the defendant to have occurred. Recklessness as to whether the PAYE has been paid is sufficient to amount to a known failure to pay - refer Case R31 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,171. Knowledge of the existence of the facts in question without knowledge of the unlawfulness of an act Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 22 will be sufficient - refer CIR v Gordon (1989) 11 NZTC 6,082 (HC). Knowledge of a responsible officer of a taxpayer company may be attributed to the company - refer Meulens case. Statutory defence to section 141E(1)(b) 4.59 Section 141E(2) provides no shortfall penalty is chargeable under section 141E(1)(b) if the taxpayer establishes that the PAYE deduction has been accounted for and the failure was due to illness, accident, or some other cause beyond their control. The section states that the taxpayer must “satisfy” the Commissioner that the failure was due to illness. Therefore, the burden of proving the defence is on the taxpayer. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (section 149A(1)). 4.60 This defence was raised in Case W3 where the taxpayer stated the reason he had not paid over the PAYE deductions was due to the Commissioner not releasing a GST refund. Judge Barber traversed case law establishing that a cause beyond the person’s control does not refer to liquidity problems: \[61\] It is settled law that liquidity problems are not a matter coming within the confines of provisions equivalent to s 141E(2): refer Driscoll v C of IR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,861(HC), Hammond v Walesby and Paramount Graphics Limited (1986) 8 NZTC 5,185(HC), and C of IR v JF McCormick Ltd \[1964\] NZLR 56 in particular. These cases show that liquidity problems in general do not constitute a cause beyond the employer's control. This must be particularly so where a taxpayer makes payments of tax deductions with the knowledge that bank overdraft limits are being exceeded as was the case with the present disputant. .... 4.61 The High Court case C of IR v Joy Wright Ltd (1984) 6 NZTC 61,788 dealt with the defence for illness. The taxpayer company in that case was charged with knowingly applying PAYE tax deductions for a purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner (under the then effective provision, section 368(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976). Its defence was that the principal officer of the company was in a depressed state due to family and business worries and so the failure was due to illness or other cause beyond the officer’s control. The defence was successful in the District Court and on appeal. In dismissing the Commissioner's appeal from the acquittal, Gallen J stated at page 61,790: There is very little authority on the interpretation of the section concerned. In C of IR v JF McCormick Ltd \[1964\] NZLR 56, Macarthur J held that the words “illness, accident or other cause beyond his control” appearing in the equivalent section of the Act then in force were not to be construed ejusdem generis and that therefore the words “beyond his control” were not to be interpreted in some way as pertaining to illness or accident. He did, however, hold that that particular defence was only available when it was proved that a situation existed where there was some cause beyond the defendant's control which prevented him from paying to the Commissioner moneys already held by him and impressed with a trust in favour of the Crown. ... In essence, I consider the situation will always be a matter of degree and will depend upon a factual finding that circumstances existed whereby there was a direct causal connection between the circumstances put forward as a defence and failure to pay. ..... Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 23 \[I\]n this case the learned District Court judge clearly found as a fact that the depressive illness of the principal officer of the respondent resulted in her being unable to integrate her activities sufficiently to carry out that part of her business responsibility which related to the accounting to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for PAYE deductions. This is a finding of fact made after hearing the evidence. Clearly he accepted that the degree of disability was sufficient to bring the respondent within the provisions of the proviso to the section. I consider he was entitled so to find. \[Emphasis added\] 4.62 The following can be distilled from the words of section 141E(2) and the case law: • The amount of the deduction must have been accounted for to the Commissioner before the defence can apply; • There must be a direct causal connection between the circumstances put forward as a defence and the failure to pay; and • A lack of funds (including due to awaiting payment from the Commissioner on other matters) does not establish the defence. Apportionment of the penalty 4.63 Section 141F(2) provides that the Commissioner may apportion a shortfall penalty between the taxpayer (for example, a company) and the officer of the taxpayer involved in failing to make or account for a deduction, or in misapplying or permitting misapplication of a deduction. “Officer” is defined (albeit in an inclusive manner) in section 3(1) as: for the purposes of sections 89C, 141F, 141G, 142C, and 147 and the definition of “taxpayer” in section 157(10), in relation to a corporate body, includes - (a) A director or secretary or other statutory officer of the corporate body: (b) A receiver or a manager of any property of the corporate body, or a person having powers or responsibilities, similar to those of such a receiver or manager, in relation to the corporate body: (c) A liquidator of the corporate body: 4.64 Section 141F(2) provides that in deciding the apportionment regard is to be had to: (a) The acts or omissions of the taxpayer and the officers; and (b) Whether those acts or omissions were reasonable in the circumstances of the case. 4.65 There is no case law on the section, but it may be relevant to note the following. Despite a submission in relation to section 141F being made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand that: • the maximum penalty applicable to the officer who commits the offence should be specified, and Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 24 • if no such specification is made, guidelines should be provided on how the Commissioner will undertake the apportionment, the Officials in the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill (1997) (to whom the submission was made) declined to make any such specification or provide such a guideline. The reasoning was given as follows (at page 39 of the report): The legislation clearly sets out the criteria to be used to determine how any shortfall penalty should be apportioned. The criteria are the relative actions or omissions of the taxpayer and the officers and whether those acts or omissions were reasonable. We see no reason to limit the potential penalty imposed on an officer beyond the natural limit of the size of the penalty being imposed. There may be cases where it is appropriate that the officer face a significant penalty, which might be prevented from being imposed if a cap were introduced. 4.66 Thus, while there is not any guidance given by case law (as there is no case law on the section) and not a great deal of specificity in section 141F, it is clear that significant penalties to the officers involved were envisaged, and that in determining the apportionment what is to be considered is the relative actions or omissions of the taxpayer and the officers involved, and the reasonableness of those actions or omissions. Where more than one officer is involved, the reasonableness of the acts or omissions of each officer will be considered with a view to establishing whether an apportionment of the penalty between the various officers to take into account relative culpability is appropriate. 4.67 It might be thought that as it is the taxpayer’s (ie. the company’s) tax liability, the taxpayer is primarily responsible and if the taxpayer has taken no action to monitor the actions of its officers then it is liable for the entire penalty. However, this is not what the legislation and background material indicates. In each case, the acts or omissions of both the taxpayer and the officer are to be considered; it is their relative culpability that will determine the apportionment of the penalty. Therefore, even in a situation where the taxpayer (company) is at fault through not having set up monitoring processes, the nature or character of the actions or omissions of the officer could result in part of the penalty being imposed on him or her. The remaining paragraphs of section 141E(1) and subsection (3) 4.68 The remaining paragraphs of section 141E(1) describe other acts or omissions that will be subject to a shortfall penalty for evasion. When the application of one of the other paragraphs of section 141E(1) is considered, all that must be decided is whether the specified breach (act or omission) occurred, and whether it has occurred “knowingly”, which requires only knowledge of, or recklessness towards, the doing of the act (or of the omission) that amounts to the breach. Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 25 4.69 The remaining paragraphs of section 141E(1) provide that the following acts or omissions are offences. The knowledge requirement of each paragraph is emphasised. (c) Knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax required to be made by a tax law; or (d) Obtains a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (da) Attempts to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (e) Enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (f) Attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law – 4.70 Paragraph (c) will apply if taxpayer knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax that is required to be made under a tax law. 4.71 Paragraphs (d), (da), (e), and (f) relate to the obtaining of a refund or payment of tax, knowing that there is no entitlement to that refund or payment of tax. Paragraphs (d) and (da) provide that the penalty will apply whether or not the taxpayer is successful in obtaining the refund or payment of tax. Paragraphs (e) and (f) provide that the penalty will also apply to a person who enables or attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax. 4.72 Section 141E(3) quantifies the shortfall penalty imposed on a taxpayer who enables, or attempts to enable, another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to that refund or payment of tax. For the purposes of section 141E(3) the tax position of the taxpayer for whom the refund or payment was sought is treated as being the tax position of the enabling taxpayer. This tax position is then used to calculate the shortfall penalty for evasion that is imposed on the enabling taxpayer. 4.73 This means that two penalties could potentially be imposed in these situations. One penalty could be imposed on the person for whom the refund or payment was sought, and a second penalty could be imposed on the enabling taxpayer. Examples 4.74 The following examples illustrate the application of the “evasion or a similar act” shortfall penalty. The focus of these examples is on whether the facts constitute “evasion or a similar act”. Therefore, it can be assumed that the taxpayer has taken a tax position which has resulted in a shortfall, and this point (and any potential application of the variation in penalty provisions) will not be discussed in the examples. There are further examples in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 7 (October 1996). Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 26 Example 1 Mrs A, a small-business person, does not include several items of income in her accounts or tax return as she feels she cannot afford to pay tax on this income. Should a shortfall penalty for evasion be imposed? Here, the intention or mens rea element of evasion is met, as Mrs A is breaching a known tax obligation. Example 2 Mr B, who had been teaching overseas, returned to New Zealand leaving $300,000 invested in the country in which he had been living. He had been told by the investment company at the time of investing the money that the investment was tax free within that country and New Zealand. For some time after his return to New Zealand he continued to hold that view. He did not mention the investment income when filing his New Zealand tax returns for the next 10 years. During these 10 years, he said he had gradually become unsure as to whether the income was taxable. The uncertainty, he said, had come from discussions with friends, where he had been given two differing viewpoints. He said he thought perhaps he was not liable for tax, but as time went on his doubts grew. He said that after making further enquiries in about year 5 he was almost certain that the investment income was taxable, but by that stage he was too afraid of the financial consequences of contacting the Department. Should a shortfall penalty for evasion be imposed? The intention or mens rea element of evasion relates to breaching a known tax obligation or a tax obligation which the taxpayer strongly suspects may exist. Initially there is no intent to evade a known or suspected obligation, so the behaviour does not amount to evasion, although the taxpayer may be liable to a gross carelessness penalty. However, the behaviour later crosses the borderline into evasion. Here, from at least year 5, Mr B strongly suspected an obligation may exist but he chose not to investigate further (for example, by making enquiries of the Department or getting advice from an accountant or lawyer) as he did not want to have his suspicions confirmed. He chose to close his eyes to this issue by deliberately and intentionally refraining from taking any steps to discover the tax status of the income he received. This disregard of a suspected obligation from at least year 5 amounts to subjective recklessness which is sufficient mens rea for evasion. Example 3 Ms C was one of three shareholders and directors of a company which had operated a garden centre from 1993. Ms C had always been the person who prepared and filed the company’s PAYE returns. From April this year until October (when it ceased trading) the company’s PAYE returns which it filed Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 27 were not accompanied by payments. Ms C states that full disclosure has been made to Inland Revenue as to the correct PAYE amounts payable on PAYE returns filed, so she was not trying to evade tax. Ms C also states that since her return from Malaysia in March she has been suffering from a rare disease she contracted there which makes her confused at times and generally has put her under significant stress. Should a shortfall penalty under section 141E(1)(b) be imposed? Section 141E(1)(b) imposes a shortfall penalty on a taxpayer who knowingly applies or permits the application of the amount of a deduction or withholding of tax made or deemed to be made under a tax law for any purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner. As discussed earlier in this interpretation statement, the elements of this offence, other than “knowingly”, are easily established by virtue of deeming provisions that exist in the Act. The key element is therefore “knowingly”. This requires only knowledge of the doing of the act (or of the omission) that amounts to a breach, not any specific (such as evasive) intent. It also does not require knowledge that the act (or omission) amounts to a breach of law, merely that the act (or omission) occurred. The question here then, is whether Ms C (and, therefore, the company for which she is a responsible officer) knew she had failed to make a payment of the PAYE due to the Commissioner. As Ms C normally completes the PAYE returns, it can be inferred that she (and therefore the company) knew that payments were due each month. She also had filed returns for the months in question, and so had knowledge that payments were due in respect of those months. In this respect it is noted that the fact she did continue to file returns and conduct other business suggests that the disease and stress did not affect her ability to function to the extent that it could be said she did not act “knowingly”. While a lapse in concentration occasioned by the stress or the confusion brought on by the disease could be a plausible explanation for a single lapse, this was repetitive and, therefore it can be inferred, knowing behaviour. It can be concluded that Ms C knowingly failed to make the payments. The next issue is whether the section 141E(2) exclusion applies to prevent section 141(1)(b) applying. For this defence to apply the deductions must since have been paid to the Commissioner, which they have not been. However, assuming they had been, it must be shown that the illness caused the failure to pay the PAYE deductions. Here, when the illness is weighed with the other evidence, it has not been shown that it was the illness which was responsible for the failures. Despite the illness Ms C managed to prepare and file the returns and continue other operations of the company, and while a lapse in concentration or confusion could be a plausible explanation for a single lapse, this was repetitive and, therefore it can be inferred, deliberate behaviour occasioned by something other than confusion. The defence is not an ongoing one, and if Ms C felt unable to prepare and file such returns there was ample time for her to arrange for someone else such as an accountant to Interpretation Statement IS0062 issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel in November 2006. 28 do it instead. Accordingly, the defence under section 141E(2) is not available to the company. How should the penalty be apportioned between the company and Ms C? The starting point under section 141E(1)(b) is that the penalty is imposed on the company. However, section 141F(2) allows the Commissioner to apportion certain penalties imposed on a taxpayer between the taxpayer and an officer of the taxpayer. Section 141F(2) can apply where the taxpayer is required to make or account for a deduction or withholding of tax and an officer of the taxpayer fails to do so. In this example, section 141F(2) would allow the Commissioner to apportion the shortfall penalty that the company is liable for under section 141E(1)(b) between the company and Ms C. To determine the portions that the company and Ms C are to be liable for, it is necessary to consider the relative actions or omissions of the company and Ms C and whether they were reasonable. The history and experience of both will be relevant. Here, this was ongoing and deliberate behaviour by Ms C not to pay the PAYE deductions to the Commissioner for a period of 7 months, not a one-off misunderstanding. The company too, however, may be considered blameworthy in not having any systems in place to check such behaviour i.e. the lack of realisation by the other two shareholders and directors as to what was going on over such a prolonged period. Taking into account the deliberateness of Ms C’s actions and the company’s lack of systems to check such behaviour, it could be considered that Ms C and the company were equally to blame for the shortfall. In this situation, the Commissioner could therefore consider it reasonable to apportion the penalty 50:50.
\[Issued by Adjudication & Rulings on 16 June 2005; previously released as draft IS0081\] THE IMPACT OF COMPANY AMALGAMATIONS ON BINDING RULINGS SUMMARY This interpretation statement considers whether an amalgamated company is entitled to rely on a private, product, or status ruling which was issued to an amalgamating company prior to the amalgamation. This statement concludes that an amalgamated company is entitled to rely on private, product, or status rulings which an amalgamating company was previously entitled to rely on. However, the ability to rely on a pre-amalgamation ruling is subject to the continued fulfilment of any conditions and assumptions, and the Arrangement not being materially different to the Arrangement ruled upon. LEGISLATION Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) The relevant provisions of the TAA in relation to binding rulings are as follows: 76 AMALGAMATED COMPANY TO ASSUME RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF AMALGAMATING COMPANY 76 Where any amalgamating company ceases to exist on an amalgamation, the amalgamated company shall, in accordance with section 209G of the Companies Act 1955 or section 225 of the Companies Act 1993,— (a) Comply with all obligations of and meet all liabilities of, and be entitled to all rights, powers and privileges of, the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts with respect to the income year in which the amalgamation occurs and all preceding income years; and (b) In particular but without limitation, make a return of income in respect of the amalgamating company and the income year in which the amalgamation takes place. ... 91EA EFFECT OF A PRIVATE RULING 91EA(1) Notwithstanding anything in any other Act, if— (a) A private ruling on a taxation law applies to a person in relation to an arrangement; and (b) The person applies the taxation law in the way stated in the ruling,— the Commissioner must apply the taxation law in relation to the person and the arrangement in accordance with the ruling. ... 91EB(2) A private ruling does not apply to a person in relation to an arrangement if— 1 (a) The arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling; or (b) There was a material omission or misrepresentation in, or in connection with, the application for the ruling; or (c) The Commissioner makes an assumption about a future event or another matter that is material to the ruling , and the assumption subsequently proves to be incorrect; or (d) The Commissioner stipulates a condition that is not satisfied. ... 91EI WITHDRAWAL OF A PRIVATE RULING 91EI(1) The Commissioner may at any time withdraw a private ruling by notifying the person to whom the ruling applies in writing that the ruling has been withdrawn. 91EI(2) The private ruling is withdrawn from the date specified in the notice of withdrawal. That date may not be earlier than the date on which the person could reasonably be expected to receive the notice of withdrawal. 91EI(2A) A status ruling on a withdrawn private ruling does not apply on and after the date specified in the notice of withdrawal. 91EI(3) If the Commissioner withdraws a private ruling— (a) The ruling does not apply if the arrangement was entered into after the date of withdrawal; but (b) The ruling continues to apply, for the remainder of the period or income year specified in the ruling, if the arrangement was entered into before the date of withdrawal; and (c) A status ruling that has been made on the private ruling continues to apply, for the remainder of the period or income year specified in the private ruling, if the arrangement was entered into before the date of withdrawal. ... 91FA EFFECT OF A PRODUCT RULING 91FA(1) Notwithstanding anything in any other Act, if— (a) A product ruling on a taxation law applies to an arrangement; and (b) A person who enters into the arrangement applies the taxation law in the way stated in the ruling,— the Commissioner must apply the taxation law in relation to the arrangement in accordance with the ruling. ... 91FB(2) A product ruling does not apply to an arrangement if— (a) The arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling; or (b) There was a material omission or misrepresentation in, or in connection with, the application for the ruling; or 2 (c) The Commissioner makes an assumption about a future event or another matter that is material to the application of the ruling, and the assumption subsequently proves to be incorrect; or (d) The Commissioner stipulates a condition that is not satisfied. ... 91FJ WITHDRAWAL OF A PRODUCT RULING 91FJ(1) The Commissioner may at any time withdraw a product ruling. 91FJ(2) The Commissioner must notify the withdrawal by giving adequate notice in the Gazette. 91FJ(3) A product ruling is withdrawn on the date stated in the notice of withdrawal. The date cannot be before the date on which notice is given under subsection (2). 91FJ(3A) A status ruling on a withdrawn product ruling does not apply on and after the date specified in the notice of withdrawal. 91FJ(4) If the Commissioner withdraws a product ruling— (a) The ruling does not apply to an arrangement entered into after the date of withdrawal; but (b) The ruling continues to apply, for the remainder of the period or income year specified in the ruling, to any arrangement to which it previously applied that was entered into before the date of withdrawal; and (c) A status ruling that has been made on the product ruling continues to apply, for the remainder of the period or income year specified in the product ruling, if the arrangement to which it previously applied was entered into before the date of withdrawal. 91FJ(5) A notice of withdrawal must specify— (a) That it is a withdrawal of a product ruling under this section; and (b) The ruling that is being withdrawn; and (c) The original period or income year for which the ruling applied; and (ca) Any status ruling that applied to the product ruling; and (cb) That the status ruling is also being withdrawn; and (d) The date of the withdrawal. Anything that does not contain these statements is not a notice of withdrawal of a product ruling. 91FJ (6) The Commissioner shall also notify the withdrawal in writing to the person who applied for the product ruling. ... 91GH EFFECT OF STATUS RULING 91GH If a person applies a taxation law in accordance with a status ruling, the Commissioner must also apply the taxation law in accordance with the status ruling. 3 Income Tax Act 2004 (“the ITA”) FE 1 AMALGAMATION OF COMPANIES: PURPOSE FE 1(1) Subject always to the express provisions of the amalgamation provisions, those provisions are intended— (a) to specify certain taxation consequences of the amalgamation of companies; and (b) in the case of a qualifying amalgamation, to permit certain property to be transferred to an amalgamated company on a concessional taxation basis and an amalgamated company to succeed to the net losses and imputation credit account and other credits of amalgamating companies, subject to tests of continuity and commonality of ownership being met; and (c) to apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 225(d) of the Companies Act 1993. ... FE 8 AMALGAMATED COMPANY TO ASSUME RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF AMALGAMATING COMPANY FE 8 Where any amalgamating company ceases to exist on an amalgamation, the amalgamated company must, in accordance with section 209G of the Companies Act 1955 or section 225 of the Companies Act 1993, comply with all obligations of and meet all liabilities of, and be entitled to all rights, powers, and privileges of, the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts with respect to the tax year in which the amalgamation occurs and all preceding tax years. ... OB 1 DEFINITIONS OB 1 For the purposes of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... amalgamated company means the 1 company that results from and continues after an amalgamation and that may be 1 of the amalgamating companies or a new company amalgamating company means a company that amalgamates with 1 or more other companies under an amalgamation amalgamation means an amalgamation to which both the following apply: (a) it— (i) occurs under Part 13 or 15 of the Companies Act 1993; or ... and (b) it causes 2 or more companies to amalgamate and continue as 1 company Companies Act 1993 (“the Companies Act”) 219.

(d) The amalgamated company succeeds to all the property, rights, powers, and privileges of each of the amalgamating companies; and (e) The amalgamated company succeeds to all the liabilities and obligations of each of the amalgamating companies; and ... APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION Binding rulings Where a company which is entitled to rely on a private, product, or status ruling is amalgamated, an issue arises as to whether the amalgamated company is entitled to rely on that ruling. This issue is directly relevant to the applicants of private, product, and status rulings, as well as to the consumers of product rulings (being persons who are entitled to rely on product rulings). There are two possible scenarios in relation to amalgamations involving companies which are entitled to rely upon a binding ruling: • firstly, where a company which is entitled to rely upon a binding ruling undergoes an amalgamation as an amalgamating company which “ceases to exist”; and • secondly, where a company which is entitled to rely upon a binding ruling undergoes an amalgamation and continues as the amalgamated company. The conclusions in this interpretation statement are equally applicable to either situation. The issue of whether an amalgamated company is entitled to rely on a ruling the amalgamating company could previously rely on is obviously relevant from the perspective of the amalgamated company. It is also relevant in the context of the Commissioner considering new ruling applications from amalgamated companies, as the TAA precludes the Commissioner from issuing private or product rulings if one already exists in relation to how the taxation laws apply, and the proposed ruling would apply to a period or income year already covered by an existing ruling (sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e) of the TAA). 5 Application to private rulings Section FE 8 It is noted that there is nothing in either the TAA or the amalgamation provisions of the ITA which specifically addresses the issue of whether an amalgamated company is entitled to rely on a ruling after the amalgamation of the company that was originally entitled to rely on that ruling. However, section FE 8 of the ITA provides as follows: FE 8 Where any amalgamating company ceases to exist on an amalgamation, the amalgamated company must, in accordance with section 209G of the Companies Act 1955 or section 225 of the Companies Act 1993, comply with all obligations of and meet all liabilities of, and be entitled to all rights, powers, and privileges of, the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts with respect to the tax year in which the amalgamation occurs and all preceding tax years. Amalgamating company previously entitled to rely on ruling ceasing to exist If the entitlement to rely on a ruling can be considered to be a “right, power or privilege under the Inland Revenue Acts”, an amalgamated company may, pursuant to section FE 8, be entitled to rely on a ruling which could previously have been relied upon by an amalgamating company which ceases to exist on the amalgamation. However, the question then arising is whether it may be argued that section FE 8 restricts the assumption of Inland Revenue Act rights, powers and privileges to those with respect to the income year in which the amalgamation occurs and preceding income years. “rights, powers and privileges” The phrase “rights, powers and privileges” is not defined in the ITA 1 . There is also nothing in the TAA which specifically states whether the entitlement to rely on a ruling gives rise to a “right, power or privilege”. However, one of the ordinary meanings of the word “right” is “a moral or legal entitlement to have or do something” (the Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed, Revised)). It is considered that the entitlement to rely on a ruling can be considered a “right”, in line with the ordinary meaning of that word, because it gives rise to a moral or legal entitlement to have or do something. Sections 91EA(1) and 91FA(1) of the TAA state that, where the requirements of those respective provisions have been met, the Commissioner must apply the taxation law in relation to the person and the Arrangement, and the Arrangement, respectively, in accordance with the ruling. Therefore, it is considered that the entitlement to rely on a ruling gives rise to a “right”. Income year in which the amalgamation occurs and all preceding income years Because the entitlement to rely on a ruling can be considered a “right”, it is clear from section FE 8 that an amalgamated company will be entitled to the rights arising under a ruling originally relied on by an amalgamating company (which ceases to exist on 1 Section OB 1 of the ITA does define a “right” in relation to a film, however this is obviously not relevant in an amalgamation context. 6 the amalgamation) with respect to the year in which the amalgamation occurs and all preceding income years. However, section FE 8 is silent in relation to the assumption of “rights, powers and privileges” for future years. It is potentially arguable that by specifically stipulating that an amalgamated company will be entitled to Inland Revenue Act rights, powers and privileges in respect of the income year of amalgamation and preceding income years, the implication is that those are the only years in respect of which Inland Revenue Act rights etc will be assumed by the amalgamated company. It could possibly be argued that section FE 8 is intended to exhaustively stipulate which Inland Revenue Act rights etc. will pass to the amalgamated company. Alternatively, it may be that section FE 8 was intended only to clarify that Inland Revenue Act rights, powers and privileges of amalgamating companies (which cease to exist on an amalgamation) with respect to past years will also become rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamated company. In particular, it is noted that some rights with respect to the income year of amalgamation and preceding years may not in fact arise until subsequent years – for example, rights relating to disputes procedures. This latter view is considered preferable. If Parliament had intended section FE 8 to alter what would otherwise be the position at company law, it is considered that this would have been done in unambiguous terms. As it is, section FE 8 uses the phrase “... in accordance with ... section 225 of the Companies Act 1993” (emphasis added), which it is considered further supports the view that section FE 8 is intended to clarify the succession of Inland Revenue Act rights with respect to past income years, rather than limit the succession of rights in the case of amalgamations to those particular years. This would seem consistent with what might be expected to be the case, as it would arguably seem somewhat unusual if an amalgamated company could rely on the ruling of an amalgamating company with respect to past income years, but not going forward. It is noted that section 76 of the TAA has the same effect as section FE 8 – though it does, in addition, give an example of an obligation with which an amalgamated company must comply (that is, to make a return of income in respect of the amalgamating company and the year of amalgamation). On the basis of the above, it is concluded that section FE 8 does not restrict the assumption of Inland Revenue Act rights, powers and privileges to those with respect to the year of amalgamation and previous years, as opposed to what would otherwise be the position under company law. Accordingly, where an amalgamating company to which a private ruling applies ceases to exist upon an amalgamation, the amalgamated company will be entitled to the benefit of the ruling (which can be considered to be a right under the Inland Revenue Acts). 7 Amalgamated company previously entitled to rely upon a binding ruling It is noted that section FE 8 does not explicitly provide for the situation where an amalgamating company continues as the amalgamated company. However, where an amalgamating company continues as an amalgamated company it continues to exist as a legal entity, and so, subject to there being any material differences to the Arrangement ruled upon, and subject to any conditions or assumptions, it may continue to rely upon any pre-amalgamation rulings applicable to it. The above conclusions are consistent with the company law principle of “continuance”, which (as discussed below) is considered to be prima facie applicable for the purposes of the ITA. The above conclusions are subject to the continued fulfilment of any conditions and assumptions, and the Arrangement not being materially different to the Arrangement ruled upon (see further below). The principle of “continuance” In any event, it is considered that the same result arises by virtue of the principle of “continuance”, which is discussed briefly below. Companies Act 1993 Section 219 of the Companies Act provides that two or more companies may amalgamate and continue as one company, which may be either one of the amalgamating companies, or a new company. Section 225(d) of the Companies Act provides that on the date shown in a certificate of amalgamation, the amalgamated company succeeds to all the property, rights, powers, and privileges of each of the amalgamating companies. The concept of “continuance” provided for in the Companies Act 1955 (the predecessor to the Companies Act) was considered by the Court of Appeal in Carter Holt Harvey Ltd v McKernan \[1998\] 3 NZLR 403 (“Carter Holt Harvey”), where the Court of Appeal noted as follows (at 411): ... In a short form amalgamation involving a parent (under s 209D(1)), the entity “succeeds” to property and liabilities which have been its property and liabilities beforehand, as well as succeeding to those of the other entities. But, as the parent continues and is not deemed to be dissolved, it is clear that “succeeds”, a word used in Canadian case law though not in the legislation in that country to which we have been referred, is not to be read as requiring that there be a predecessor and a successor. The merged entity succeeds to the assets and liabilities because that is where they are to be recognised as being or remaining as a result of the continuance of all parties to the amalgamation. \[Emphasis added\] Amalgamating company previously entitled to rely on ruling ceasing to exist As noted above, it is considered that the entitlement to rely on a binding ruling is a “right”. Accordingly, at company law, an amalgamated company would be entitled to rely on a binding ruling on which an amalgamating company was previously entitled to rely. 8 Amalgamated company previously entitled to rely on a ruling The same can be said in relation to a company that has continued after an amalgamation as the amalgamated company. It is apparent from the amalgamation provisions in the Companies Act that an existing company which continues after an amalgamation as the amalgamated company is also regarded as an amalgamating company. In particular, it is noted that section 219 of the Companies Act states that the amalgamated company may be one of the amalgamating companies or a new company. Accordingly, if a company which continues as an amalgamated company was a previously existing company entitled to rely upon a binding ruling, the principle of continuance means that, at company law, the company would be entitled to continue to rely upon the ruling after the amalgamation. Having considered the position under the Companies Act in terms of the effect an amalgamation would have on the ability to continue to rely on a pre-amalgamation ruling, it is necessary to consider if this is modified in any way by the amalgamation regime in the ITA. Income Tax Act 2004 Section FE 1(1) of the ITA sets out the purpose of the amalgamation provisions. It is noted that section FE 1(1)(c) states that the amalgamation provisions are intended to apply “notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 225(d) of the Companies Act 1993”. Whilst section FE 1(1)(c) indicates that there may be a divergence between the position in relation to the succession to rights, powers and privileges under the Inland Revenue Acts, and what would otherwise be the case under company law, the analysis below will conclude that there is in fact no such divergence. “ceases to exist” Throughout the amalgamation provisions in the ITA, there is wording which indicates that an amalgamating company may “cease to exist”. This description could, prima facie, suggest that an amalgamated company is not entitled to rely on a ruling previously relied on by an amalgamating company. However, it is noted that section OB 1 of the ITA defines “amalgamation” as meaning any amalgamation under certain laws (including the Companies Act) which causes two or more companies to “... amalgamate and continue as 1 company”. Therefore, it is not considered that the use of the words “ceases to exist” suggests that the principle of continuance is modified for income tax purposes. It is considered that the words “ceases to exist” in the ITA refer only to the fact that an amalgamating company may cease to exist as a separate entity, not that it will cease to exist as a legal entity (within the amalgamated company). Indeed, the fact that an amalgamating company will continue to exist in the form of the new amalgamated entity seems apparent from the definition of “amalgamation” in section OB 1, which is consistent with the company law concept of an amalgamation. If Parliament had intended the principle of continuance not to be prima facie applicable for tax purposes, it would be expected to have done so in more explicit terms. 9 Whilst it is considered that the prima facie position is that the concept of continuance remains applicable for ITA purposes, it is noted that in some circumstances the Act alters what would otherwise be the tax consequences of an amalgamation by deeming the effect of an amalgamation to be other than what would be the case at company law. It is considered that the principle of continuance is applicable for the purposes of the Act only to the extent that that principle is not altered by specific provisions in the Act. Why is the amalgamation issue relevant in the product rulings context? Product rulings are made in relation to how a taxation law applies either to an “arrangement”, or to the “consumer” of the product that is the subject of the ruling and to the “arrangement” (section 91FC(1) of the TAA). Amalgamation of “applicant” In the product rulings context there is no specifically identifiable “person” to whom the ruling applies. This differs from private rulings, which apply to a “person” in relation to an “arrangement”. However, the applicant for a product ruling is named in the product ruling. Section 91FH(1) of the TAA 1994 states: 91FH CONTENT AND NOTIFICATION OF A PRODUCT RULING 91FH(1) A product ruling must state— (a) That it is a product ruling made under section 91F; and (b) The name of the person who applied for the ruling; and (c) The taxation law and the arrangement to which the ruling applies; and (d) How the taxation law applies to the arrangement; and (e) The period or income year for which the ruling applies; and (f) Material assumptions about future events or other matters made by the Commissioner; and (g) Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner. Anything that does not contain these statements is not a product ruling. In addition, the applicant must intend to be a party to the proposed Arrangement. Section 91FC of the TAA 1994 states: 91FC APPLYING FOR A PRODUCT RULING 91FC(1) A person, in their own right or on behalf of a person who is yet to come into legal existence, may apply to the Commissioner for a product ruling on how a taxation law applies, or would apply— (a) To an arrangement; or (b) To the consumer of the product that is the subject of the ruling, and to the arrangement. 10 91FC(1A) A person making an application under subsection (1) or a prospective person, as the case may be, must intend to be a party to the proposed arrangement. 91FC(1B) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), a “consumer” is a party to the arrangement who is not the applicant. ... Therefore, there is an issue of whether the subsequent amalgamation of the “applicant” for a product ruling will mean that the product ruling no longer applies. That is, whether in the event of an amalgamation the company that applied for the ruling (and is required to be a party to the Arrangement) continues in existence so that the consumers are still entitled to rely on the product ruling. As stated above, a product ruling applies to an Arrangement and the consumers who enter into an Arrangement. In contrast to private rulings, there is no requirement that a product ruling applies to a particular person. Arguably, if an applicant does “cease to exist” this will not affect the entitlement of a “consumer” to continue to rely upon the ruling as there is no legislative requirement that the applicant continues to exist for the duration of the ruling. On this basis there would be no issue about whether a product ruling will apply if the original applicant “ceases to exist”. In any event, it is considered that the above analysis in relation to private rulings and the continuance of amalgamating entities would also apply in the product ruling context in respect of applicants. It is also noted for completeness that in most instances the applicant for a product ruling is the promoter or manager of a particular product. Where this is the case, it is unlikely that the amalgamation of the applicant would result in any material differences to the Arrangement, and so such an amalgamation would be unlikely to affect the application of the product ruling. Amalgamation of “consumer” Section 91FA(1) of the TAA states that if a product ruling on a taxation law applies to an Arrangement, and a person (i.e. the consumer) who enters into the Arrangement applies the taxation law in the way stated in the ruling, the Commissioner must apply the taxation law in relation to the Arrangement in accordance with the ruling. Therefore, if a consumer, who has entered into the Arrangement and applied the taxation law in the way stated in the ruling, subsequently undergoes an amalgamation, this would not appear to affect the application of the product ruling, as that person will have fulfilled the requirements in section 91FA(1). The conclusion that the product ruling will remain applicable is, again, subject to the continued fulfilment of any conditions and assumptions, and the Arrangement not being materially different to the Arrangement ruled upon. In addition, section 91F(1) of the TAA provides that the Commissioner can only make a product ruling where it is not practicable to identify the taxpayers who may enter into the Arrangement, and where the characteristics of the taxpayers who may enter into the Arrangement would not affect the content of the ruling. This provides further support for the view that the amalgamation of a person who enters an Arrangement 11 the subject of a product ruling (i.e. a consumer) will not affect the application of the ruling to the amalgamated company, provided that any conditions and assumptions are satisfied, and the Arrangement is not materially different to the Arrangement ruled upon. Based on the analysis above, it is concluded that the entitlement to rely upon a product ruling will continue after the amalgamation of either the applicant for the ruling or a consumer of the Arrangement. However, notwithstanding this conclusion, if the Arrangement is materially different to that ruled upon (whether by virtue of the amalgamation or otherwise) the ruling will no longer apply. This will need to be considered on the specific facts. Status rulings The effect of a status ruling is the same as that of private rulings (section 91EA of the TAA) and product rulings (section 91FA of the TAA). Section 91GH of the TAA states, in relation to the effect of status rulings: 91GH EFFECT OF STATUS RULING 91GH If a person applies a taxation law in accordance with a status ruling, the Commissioner must also apply the taxation law in accordance with the status ruling. Therefore, the above analysis is equally applicable to status rulings. It has already been concluded that an amalgamated company will be entitled to rely upon a private or product ruling after the amalgamation of the applicant/consumer. For the same reasons, a status ruling made in respect of either a private or a product ruling can also continue to be relied upon. Material difference to Arrangement However, notwithstanding the above analysis, if the amalgamation causes a material difference to the Arrangement, the ruling will not apply. Sections 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) of the TAA state that private and product rulings, respectively, do not apply if the Arrangement is materially different to the Arrangement identified in the ruling. Whether a ruling can continue to be relied on after an amalgamation will depend on the new characteristics of the surviving entity. If these characteristics are such that they result in a material difference to the Arrangement identified in the ruling, the ruling can no longer be relied on. This would need to be considered on the specific facts. However, some direction can be given as to what might be considered to be a material difference in this context. For example, where the ruling concerns the capital or revenue nature of an activity and the amalgamation is of a company (the subject of a ruling) which is trading, with a non-trading enterprise, the new characteristics of the surviving entity may result in a material difference to the Arrangement. In this situation the characteristics of the amalgamated taxpayer could be different, which could alter whether the activities are 12 reported on revenue account or capital account. This could constitute a material difference to the Arrangement. Another example may be where the ruling concerns whether a capital asset is depreciable and a company (the subject of a ruling) amalgamates with a company that deals in these assets, and so holds them on revenue account. If the classification of the asset changes as a result of the characteristics of the new amalgamated entity, this may also constitute a material difference to the Arrangement. Conditions Sections 91EB(2)(d) and 91FB(2)(d) of the TAA state that private and product rulings, respectively, do not apply to an Arrangement if the Commissioner stipulates a condition that is not satisfied. Therefore, notwithstanding the above conclusions that a ruling will apply after the person to whom the ruling applies has undergone an amalgamation, if a condition is not satisfied (whether by virtue of the amalgamation or otherwise), the ruling will not apply. References in any condition to an amalgamating company which ceases to exist upon the amalgamation should, after the amalgamation, be treated as references to the amalgamated company. For example, a condition that the amalgamating company will do something should, after the amalgamation, be read as requiring that the amalgamated company do it, rather than the ruling being precluded from applying because the amalgamating company has not satisfied that condition. Withdrawal of a ruling Sections 91EI and 91FJ of the TAA state that the Commissioner may at any time withdraw private and product rulings, respectively, by giving the required notice. These sections also provide that a status ruling on a withdrawn ruling will not apply from the date specified in the notice of withdrawal. However, if the Commissioner withdraws a private or product ruling, but the Arrangement was entered into before the date of the withdrawal, the ruling continues to apply for the remainder of the period or income year specified in the ruling, and any status ruling made on that ruling will also continue to apply. In the case of an amalgamation, this raises the issue of when the amalgamated company entered into the Arrangement – i.e. whether at the date the amalgamating company to which the ruling applies entered into the Arrangement, or at the date of the amalgamation (when the amalgamated company succeeded to the property, rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamating companies). As discussed above, section FE 8 of the ITA confirms the succession of Inland Revenue Act rights with respect to past income years, where the amalgamating company ceases to exist upon the amalgamation. Therefore a ruling in respect of an Arrangement which has been entered into by an amalgamating company will be effectively saved, for the benefit of the amalgamated company. It is considered that this suggests that the Arrangement should be considered to have been entered into by the amalgamated company at the date the amalgamating company to which the ruling applied entered into it, and not at the time of the amalgamation. 13 Further, as discussed above, the application of the principle of “continuance” means that the amalgamated company is a continuation of all the amalgamating companies. The Court of Appeal decision of Carter Holt Harvey confirms that all the amalgamating companies “continue as one company”, and the amalgamated company “succeeds to” all the benefits and obligations of the amalgamating companies. It is noted (as discussed above) that the ITA retains the principle of “continuance” for income tax purposes (except to the extent that it is altered by specific provisions in the Act). This further supports the view that the Arrangement should be considered to have been entered into by the amalgamated company at the date the amalgamating company to which the ruling applied entered into it (and not at the time of the amalgamation). CONCLUSION Based on the above analysis, it is concluded that an amalgamated company is entitled to rely on private, product, or status rulings which an amalgamating company was previously entitled to rely on. However, the ability to rely on a pre-amalgamation ruling is subject to the continued fulfilment of any conditions and assumptions, and the Arrangement not being materially different to the Arrangement ruled upon. 14
INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY—PUBLIC TRUSTEE V CIR This interpretation statement expresses the Commissioner’s view of the principles relating to interest deductibility from the Court of Appeal decision in Public Trustee v CIR \[1938\] NZLR 436. The analysis in this statement considers the application of Public Trustee in Williams v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,078 and the more recent case of Borlase & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2001) 20 NZTC 17,261. The cases of Pacific Rendezvous v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146 and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184 are also discussed. There are four main parts to this statement. Part 1 is a summary of the Commissioner’s view of when interest is deductible when applying Public Trustee. Part 2 is an expanded analysis section discussing the Commissioner’s view. Some background and specific comments on alternative approaches not accepted by the Commissioner are covered in Part 3. Part 4 contains the conclusions. The position outlined in this statement replaces the Commissioner’s interpretation of Public Trustee in a statement in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 9 (June 1992). That statement in the TIB, to the extent that it relates to the interpretation and application of Public Trustee, is hereby withdrawn. This statement originates from issues paper IRRUIP 5: Interest deductibility in certain arrangements, which was issued for public consultation in March 2001. (IRRUIP 5 had superseded an earlier issues paper, IRRUIP 3.) IRRUIP 5 should not be relied upon as stating the Commissioner’s current view on matters of interest deductibility. Other issues discussed in IRRUIP 5 may be covered in future statements PART 1 – SUMMARY 1. The interest deductibility test is satisfied if there is a sufficient connection between interest and assessable income. In Public Trustee, the borrowed funds were not used to acquire income earning assets, but were used to retain income earning assets. 2. When borrowings are used to acquire assets, the connection with assessable income is different in nature from any connection made when borrowings retain assets. The case of Pacific Rendezvous has held that if the borrowed funds are used to acquire income earning assets, that would in itself be sufficient to establish the connection between interest incurred on the borrowed funds and the derivation of assessable income. Where funds are 1 instead used to retain income earning assets, the interest is not necessarily deductible. It may be deductible if, in the circumstances, a sufficient connection with assessable income exists. 3. Following Public Trustee, the Commissioner considers that interest on borrowings will be deductible when the borrowed funds retain income earning assets, if the taxpayer can establish that: • the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge was involuntary; and • the taxpayer definitely would have realised particular income earning assets, if the taxpayer had not borrowed; and • the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge arose in connection with the income earning assets retained. The factors in the second and third bullet points may entail apportionment. 4. When the three factors are all present, taxpayers have certainty about how the Commissioner will apply the law. The Commissioner accepts that it may be possible for taxpayers to establish that interest is deductible when borrowings are made in order to retain assets, even though the three factors are not present. Interest may be deductible in such circumstances if the nexus is similar in strength to the nexus established when the three factors are present. In considering these situations, a guiding principle will be whether, on the particular facts, the borrowing prevented a realisation of income earning assets. All the circumstances will be relevant in considering whether there is a sufficient connection with income. 5. Pacific Rendezvous and Public Trustee also establish that where there is a sufficient connection with assessable income, whether through income earning assets being acquired or retained, the fact that the borrowed funds concurrently serve another use, unrelated to income, will not break that sufficient connection.

The interest deductibility legislation distinguishes between companies and other taxpayers. Interest incurred by companies is automatically deductible— that is, there is no requirement to satisfy a nexus test—except for certain exceptions. The impact of this is that the interest deductibility principle derived from Public Trustee will have limited application. Public Trustee will apply in relation to the deductibility of interest expense incurred by individuals, partners, trusts and qualifying companies, and to other companies unable to obtain a deduction under section DB 7. 7. Interest incurred by companies is deductible, subject to certain exceptions. Under section DB 7, interest incurred by a company is deductible, provided the statutory exceptions in subsections DB 7(2) – (5) do not apply. The exceptions are: • qualifying companies; • companies deriving exempt income except if that exempt income is dividends, exempt income arising from a disposal of a company’s own shares or exempt income related to stake money and a breeding business; • non-resident companies to the extent to which interest is not incurred in the course of carrying on a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; and • interest on unpaid taxes payable to another country and substantially the same as civil or criminal penalties as defined under certain laws in New Zealand. 8. The effect of section DB 7 is discussed in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). How the sections of the Act, other than section DB 7, apply in relation to interest deductibility 9. Section DB 6(1) provides that: A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. 10. Section DB 6(3) states that This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 11. Therefore, a person seeking to deduct interest is subject to the general permission, which states: DA 1 General permission DA 1(1) Nexus with income A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation loss) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— 5 (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. DA 1(2) General permission Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 12. So in applying the Act to interest, a person must satisfy the test under the general permission that the expenditure (interest in this case) is incurred in deriving assessable income (or excluded income) or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (or excluded income). This test is the same in all relevant respects to the test under the 1994 Act. 13. The concept of “excluded income” requires some comment. “Excluded income” is defined and specified to include, for example, GST, fringe benefits, certain life insurance premiums or claims derived by persons carrying on the business of life insurance, and other specific classes of income (see sections OB 1, BD 1(3) and subpart CX). The addition of the reference to “excluded income” in the general permission does not alter the principles applying to the deductibility of interest. Because the concept of “excluded income” is a statutory mechanism used to deal with certain types of income, and does not affect the principles of interest deductibility, “excluded income” is not referred to further in this statement. 14. The general permission is subject to the general limitations, pursuant to section DA 2(7). The general limitations include the private limitation and the capital limitation: DA 2 General limitations DA 2(1) Capital limitation A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. DA 2(2) Private limitation A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. ... DA 2(7) Relationship of general limitations to general permission 15. The private limitation applies to interest expense, pursuant to sections DA 2(2). The capital limitation, on the other hand, does not apply. This result is achieved in the Act by the capital limitation being expressly overridden. Sections DA 3(4) and DA 3(5) state the general rule that a limitation (such as that applying to capital expenditure) does not apply if it is expressly overridden: DA 3(4) Relationship between other specific provisions and general permission or general limitations A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ may override any 1 or more of the general permission and the general limitations. DA 3(5) Express reference needed to override 6 A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ takes effect to override the general permission or a general limitation only if it expressly states— (a) that it overrides the general permission or the relevant limitation; or (b) that the general permission or the relevant limitation does not apply. ... 16. The capital limitation is expressly overridden by section DB 6(3) (subsections DB 6(1) is reproduced to give context): DB 6 Interest: not capital expenditure DB 6(1) Deduction A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. ... DB 6(3) Link with subpart DA This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. Defined in this Act: capital limitation, deduction, general limitation, general permission, interest Summary of the legislation relating to interest deductions 17. In summary, the legislation provides the following general rules relating to interest deductibility: • Interest incurred by companies is usually automatically deductible; • For other taxpayers, interest is deductible if it is incurred in deriving assessable income or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; • Interest is not deductible if it is private or domestic in nature; • Being capital in nature will not, on its own, mean that interest is non- deductible. Case law on the deductibility of interest 18. Before Public Trustee is discussed, general principles relating to interest deductibility will be outlined. Pacific Rendezvous 19. In Pacific Rendezvous, the Court of Appeal held that the test for interest deductibility was whether borrowed funds on which the interest is incurred have been used in deriving income or in a business carried on to derive income. Richardson J said: It is both necessary and sufficient that the capital was employed in the production of assessable income. “Employed” bears its plain ordinary meaning and is synonymous with “used”. The difficulty lies in determining whether or not the statutory nexus is satisfied in the particular case. 7 20. The borrowed funds had all been put into additions and improvements. Although the company in that case had another dominant purpose of increasing the capital value of the property, and even received capital amounts, that was not relevant. The sole question was whether the capital was employed in the production of the assessable income, and the Court held that it was. 21. At that time the interest deductibility provision referred to capital “employed” in the production of income. The Court in Pacific Rendezvous said that there was no difference between “employed” and “used”. It can be assumed therefore that in the context of interest deductibility the meaning of “employed” is the same as the meaning of “used”. For the purposes of this statement, the word “used” will generally be used instead of “employed”. The old and the new interest deductibility tests— is the “use” of the funds still the test? 22. Richardson J commented in Pacific Rendezvous on the similarities between the interest deductibility test the Court was considering and the general deductibility test. The comments are of particular interest because the interest deductibility test was amended after Pacific Rendezvous to mirror the general deductibility test. Under the test the Court was considering in Pacific Rendezvous, interest was deductible if it was payable on capital employed in the production of assessable income. The general deductibility provision was satisfied if the expenditure was incurred in the gaining or producing of assessable income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income. 23. Richardson J said that the considerations under both provisions will ordinarily be the same. Therefore, an examination of the use of borrowed funds remained relevant under the reworded interest deductibility provision. The legislation was amended again in the rewritten Income Tax Act 2004, to provide that expenditure (including interest) is deductible if it is incurred in deriving assessable income. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this latest change has not affected the test. If a sufficient connection exists through the use of borrowed funds, the interest will be deductible. 24. The courts have continued to examine the use of the funds and continued to regard Pacific Rendezvous as the leading authority on interest deductions, despite the change in wording. For example, in Borlase, a 2001 decision, the High Court applied a “use” test. Since Pacific Rendezvous, Taxation Review Authority decisions concerned with interest deductions all examine the use of funds, for example, Case L76 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,441, Case L81 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,648, Case R8 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,049 and Case S17 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,127. A reason for the continued reliance on an examination of the borrowed funds is that usually the interest itself is not connected with the income earning activity. The interest is the cost of the funds and is not itself used in deriving income. Rather, it is the borrowed funds that are invested in an income earning activity or business, and so it is the borrowed funds that may have a connection with income (Ure v FC of T 81 ATC). 8 The relevance of other factors, including purpose 25. Although the use of funds remains the primary test, the courts have indicated that in some situations other factors may be relevant. Interest arising under financial arrangements is deductible if a sufficient connection is established, though there is no principal amount. Roberts and Smith can be argued to be authority that interest may be deductible if borrowing replaces funds used in an income earning activity, without the necessity of tracing the payment of the borrowings to the funds replaced. Following Roberts and Smith, arguably the deduction can be obtained if the funds are paid elsewhere (in that case to partners) and in effect replace capital in the partnership. 26. Another factor that may sometimes be relevant is a taxpayer’s purpose. In Pacific Rendezvous, Richardson J said a taxpayer’s purpose may be relevant, but only in considering whether capital has been employed in the production of assessable income. Brierley 27. Pacific Rendezvous was followed in Brierley. In Brierley, the taxpayer had borrowed money to take up annual cash issues made by the public company. A number of different types of returns, including non-assessable amounts, were received by the taxpayer. 28. The Commissioner argued that there were several uses to which the borrowed moneys were put, and only one was a use connected with income. Like Pacific Rendezvous, the taxpayer’s purpose included deriving capital gain amounts and other non-assessable amounts. The Commissioner considered that the interest should be apportioned not just on the basis of the taxpayer’s purposes, but on the basis of the actual amounts the taxpayer received. 29. The Court concluded: It is the standard case of an investment which may provide both an income and a capital return. It was in that same situation that the Court in Pacific Rendezvous held that the moneys borrowed were fully employed in the production of assessable income even though they were also used for a purpose other than the production of assessable income, and even though capital profits were actually realised during the relevant income years. In short, it was not considered appropriate to dissect and apportion in such a case where separate uses in respect of different parts of the assets involved or for different periods of time could not be identified. THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE CASE 30. Public Trustee concerned an estate that did not have sufficient cash to pay death duties. The death duties constituted a charge on all of the assets of the estate. The trustee of the estate borrowed to pay the death duties. In a majority judgment, the Court held that the interest was deductible. 31. The leading judgment was given by Myers CJ. At p. 452, Myers CJ said: 9 For the determination of this question the substance of the transaction must be regarded. The death duties were a charge on the whole estate. If the estate had had the necessary money available in cash and had paid the duties with that cash, and had then found it necessary to borrow ... for the purpose of maintaining the income of the estate, and had borrowed accordingly, could it be doubted that in such circumstances the interest on the money borrowed would be deductible under para. (h) of s. 80 (1)? What the estate has in fact done is substantially the same thing, and has the same effect. ... The true inference, I think, in the present case is that the money borrowed enabled the trustee to pay out of the estate the amount of the death duties and left the money so borrowed or its equivalent in capital assets in the estate to be employed in the production of income. 32. He then went on to say (at p. 453): Where moneys are borrowed as in this case, it seems to me that they are in reality borrowed for the dual purposes of enabling the death duties to be paid and of maintaining the income from the assets of the estate. 33. Myers CJ considered that there was a sufficient connection between the interest and the Public Trust’s income earning assets. Myers CJ considered that the borrowing “left the money so borrowed or its equivalent in capital assets”. 34. Myers CJ says in this passage that the situation he was dealing with was equivalent to the situation where an estate had had the necessary money available in cash and had paid the duties with that cash, and had then found it necessary to borrow. His Honour viewed the situation as one where it was necessary to borrow, and not one where the taxpayer had a choice of methods to meet liabilities. His Honour referred again to this element of necessity in distinguishing Ward and Co., Ltd. v Commissioner of Taxes \[1923\] A.C. 145 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1926) 38 C.L.R. 153. Myers CJ said that unlike the facts of Ward, the death duties were not a voluntary debt. After discussing the Munro case, Myers CJ said at p. 454: Here, the death duties were not a voluntary debt. They were a debt of the estate, which was charged upon the estate, and which the trustee was compelled to pay. The Death Duties Act, 1923, authorizes him to borrow money upon the security of the assets of the estate in order to enable him to pay the duties. It was not therefore a voluntary expense incurred by the estate as the Privy Council held the payment in Ward and Co.’s case to have been. Here, also, the money was borrowed in order to prevent reduction of the income. The borrowed money was not employed, to quote the words of Isaacs, J. \[in Munro\], for purposes alien to or independent of the property, and, to use the language of Knox, C.J. the loan here was instrumental in or conducive to the production of the assessable income. It cannot be said that the debt was incurred for a purpose wholly unconnected with the production of the assessable income of the estate. On the contrary, it was incurred for the very purpose of maintaining the income of the estate and preventing its reduction. 35. The involuntary element in Public Trustee will be discussed later in this statement. 10 What is meant by the “use” of borrowed funds 36. Two of the most recent Court of Appeal judgments on the deductibility of interest, Pacific Rendezvous and Brierley, have held that the statutory provision is concerned with how the capital was used during the period in which the interest in question was incurred. The next issue is to understand what is meant by “use” in the context of interest deductibility. 37. In Public Trustee the borrowed funds were applied in payment of the death duties. The actual payment made with the funds was to the Crown in satisfaction of a death duties liability. It was argued that the funds were used to retain assets. The dissenting judge in Public Trustee, Northcroft J, had the following view about how the borrowed funds were used: ... if money be borrowed to discharge a debt of the owner of the business which debt is otherwise unconnected with the business and if the alternative be a sale of business assets with a consequent diminution of profits, then, in my opinion, this would be capital employed in the payment of the debt and not in the production of income. The result would be the maintenance of income, but nevertheless, the employment of the capital would not be in the production of income but in the payment of the debt. 38. Northcroft J’s view was not shared by the majority. The majority held that the capital was used in the payment of the debt and to retain assets. Callan J held that borrowed capital used in retaining assets is employed in the production of assessable income, just as capital used in acquiring assets is employed in the production of assessable income. Therefore, the case is authority that in identifying how borrowed funds are used as required by the statutory test, the use of funds will not only be the actual application, but will include the outcome of the application. This interpretation is consistent with the meaning of “use” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (11 th ed, Oxford University Press, 2004): use take, hold, or deploy as a means of achieving something. 39. This definition involves two aspects: deployment (i.e. application) and outcome. In the Commissioner’s view, the majority in Public Trustee considered that “use” includes these dual aspects in the interest context. In Public Trustee, the funds were applied to pay death duties, but were held to be used in two ways—to pay the death duties and to retain assets forming part of the income earning activity. 40. A similar conclusion was reached in Pacific Rendezvous. In Pacific Rendezvous, the actual application of the funds was presumably payment to builders and other contractors for the construction of the assets. The use of the funds was held to be in acquiring assets for the motel business and in augmenting the company’s capital. 41. Although there were differences in the facts in Public Trustee and Pacific Rendezvous, in that in one assets were retained and in the other assets were acquired, Richardson J in Pacific Rendezvous referred to funds being used in the production of assessable income in Public Trustee. The Court in Pacific 11 Rendezvous considered that in both cases, the borrowed funds were used to derive assessable income. 42. In Williams, another case concerned with interest deductibility and retention of income earning assets, Barker J also stated this view, saying that payments made to retain assets are no different in principle to payments made to acquire assets. Establishing the sufficient connection in Public Trustee 43. With this understanding of the meaning of “use” or “employment” in the context of interest deductibility (the outcome achieved by the application of the borrowed funds), the degree of the connection with income in Public Trustee will now be considered. 44. The statutory test requires a connection between the deriving of assessable income and the relevant interest. The courts have held that this connection must be of a sufficient strength (Pacific Rendezvous). When borrowings are used to fund income earning assets, the test is to consider whether there is a sufficient connection between assessable income derived from those assets and the interest incurred. 45. In the Pacific Rendezvous situation, it is true to say that, generally, application of funds to acquire assets which form part of the income earning activity or business means that the funds are used in that income earning activity or business. In most cases it will necessarily follow that the application of the borrowed funds connects those funds with the assessable income derived from the assets forming part of the income earning activity or business. Borrowed funds used directly on consumable items that contribute to the derivation of assessable income also have a direct connection with income. It is difficult to conceive of a stronger connection between borrowed funds and income earning assets than exists in these two situations. 46. In contrast, where a taxpayer argues that borrowed funds retain income earning assets, the sufficient connection required is not so easily established. The connection with assessable income, through retention of the assets, does not arise as a matter of necessity from the application of the borrowed funds. In the two New Zealand cases, Public Trustee and Williams, where the Courts have accepted that interest is deductible when borrowings retain income earning assets, certain factors were present which the Commissioner considers established the sufficient connection with assessable income in those cases. These factors are that: • the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge was involuntary; and • the taxpayer definitely would have realised particular income earning assets, had the taxpayer not borrowed; and • the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge arose in connection with the income earning assets retained. 12 47. The Commissioner considers that where these factors are present, the borrowing retains particular income earning assets, and the sufficient connection between the interest and assessable income is established. If the last two factors are established only to a certain extent, an apportionment or adjustment will be required. Each of these factors, and also apportionment and adjustments, are discussed further below. Concurrent uses of borrowed funds 48. Pacific Rendezvous established that if borrowed funds are used in deriving assessable income, and the sufficient connection is established, it does not matter that the funds are also used to achieve a non-taxable outcome. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this same reasoning applies to the Public Trustee situation. If the sufficient connection is established through the use of the borrowed funds, that connection is not lost if there is a second, non-income- related outcome. In Public Trustee, the two outcomes were the payment of death duties, and the retention of income earning assets. 49. Pacific Rendezvous and Public Trustee are compared in the following diagram. The degree of connection in each case, and the concurrent outcomes can be seen. 13 Pacific Rendezvous Borrowing Application Outcome 1 Acquisition of assets forming part of the income earning activity Outcome 2 Capital gains Connects ConnectsConnects S u f fi c i e n t c o n n e c ti o n Borrowing Application Outcome 1 Retention of assets forming part of the income earning activity Outcome 2 Capital gains Connects Connects only in certain circumstances Connects S u f fi c i e n t c o n n e c ti o n Public Trustee Application of Public Trustee by the High Court 50. The decision in Public Trustee has been applied in two High Court cases in relation to whether interest is deductible. Williams v CIR 51. In Williams v CIR the facts were that the taxpayer and his wife, who had been farming during their married life, had separated. The former wife registered a notice of claim under section 42 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 against the taxpayer’s title to the farm. Eventually the parties entered into an agreement under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act. Section 21 enables spouses to contract out of the Matrimonial Property Act. The agreement in Williams was stated to be entered into in settlement of the litigation and provided for the division of matrimonial and separate property. 14 The taxpayer was required to pay his ex-wife a lump sum, some of that within six weeks and the remainder after five years. The taxpayer borrowed to comply with the terms of the agreement. 52. Barker J held that the interest was deductible, on the grounds that the borrowing retained the income earning assets. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the connection was sufficient because the liability was involuntary, the taxpayer would have sold the farm if he had not borrowed, and the liability arose in connection with the farming assets retained. The concurrent use of the money to meet the matrimonial claim did not affect this conclusion. Borlase v CIR 53. Public Trustee was also applied in the High Court decision in Borlase & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In that case, the husband and wife taxpayers moved from one city to another on account of the husband’s work. They retained their former home, which was subject to a mortgage of $23,326, and let it. They bought a home in which to live in the second city for $185,000. They borrowed $208,000 to buy the home and to refinance the mortgage on their old home. The mortgage was secured over both properties. The taxpayers sought to deduct interest relating to both properties, arguing that by borrowing they retained their rental property. 54. Pankhurst J held that the funds were used to purchase a private dwelling. Public Trustee did not apply because, unlike Public Trustee and Williams, the requirement to pay and the amount of the payment were not involuntary because they were not external to and beyond the control of the taxpayer. Further, in the Commissioner’s opinion, another factor contributing to the fact that the connection was not established was that the liability had not arisen in connection with income earning assets. THE THREE FACTORS FROM PUBLIC TRUSTEE 55. When taxpayers argue that borrowings are made in order to retain income earning assets, the Commissioner’s opinion is that a sufficient connection will be established and the interest on those borrowed funds will be deductible when: • the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge was involuntary; and • the taxpayer definitely would have realised income earning assets, if the taxpayer had not borrowed; and • the liability arose in connection with the income earning assets retained. Each of these three factors will now be discussed. 15 The first factor—the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge was involuntary 56. In Public Trustee the borrowed funds were used to pay death duties. Myers CJ said in Public Trustee that the circumstances he was dealing with were equivalent to those where an estate had had the necessary money available in cash, paid the duties with that cash, and then found it necessary to borrow. His Honour viewed the situation he was considering as one where it was necessary to borrow, and not one where the taxpayer had a choice of methods to meet liabilities. His Honour also referred to the involuntariness of the liability in distinguishing Ward and Munro. 57. In Munro, the Court had rejected the idea that because loans were secured over rent-producing property, the interest would be deductible, despite the fact that the loans were used for private purposes. Isaacs J concluded in Munro (p.197): But in employing the borrowed money for purposes independent of the property, leaving its condition entirely unaffected, that result cannot be postulated. 58. In Public Trustee Myers CJ quoted Munro, including the above statement of Isaacs J (Public Trustee at p 454), and italicised the quote as follows: The assessable income of the taxpayer was in no way referable to the transaction with the bank out of which the liability to pay interest arose, and the loan by the bank was in no way instrumental in or conducive to the production of the assessable income ... The debt having been incurred for a purpose wholly unconnected with the production of assessable income of the respondent, I think it impossible to say that the interest paid on the amount of the debt was money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the production of his assessable income. 59. Directly after this quotation, Myers CJ said: Here, the death duties were not a voluntary debt. They were a debt of the estate, which was charged upon the estate, and which the trustee was compelled to pay. The Death Duties Act, 1923, authorizes him to borrow money upon the security of the assets of the estate in order to enable him to pay the duties. It was not therefore a voluntary expense incurred by the estate as the Privy Council held the payment in Ward and Co.’s case (supra) to have been. Here, also, the money was borrowed in order to prevent reduction of the income. The borrowed money was not employed, to quote the words of Isaacs J., for purposes alien to or independent of the property, and, to use the language of Knox C.J., the loan here was instrumental in or conducive to the production of the assessable income. It cannot be said that the debt was incurred for a purpose wholly unconnected with the production of the assessable income of the estate. On the contrary, it was incurred for the very purpose of maintaining the income of the estate and preventing its reduction. 60. Myers CJ made the point that a crucial factor which differentiated the facts of Public Trustee from Munro was that the liability was involuntary. Unlike the taxpayer in Munro, the taxpayer in Public Trustee did not have any discretion over the fact of the liability arising and the amount of the liability. The fact that the debt was involuntary was a factor in concluding that but for the borrowing, the assets really would have been sold. In Munro, arguably the 16 taxpayer could have arranged matters so that he was not faced with the choice of borrowing or selling, and further, it was only a possibility that the assets would be sold if the interest was not paid and the lenders consequentially exercised their rights over the assets. 61. Myers CJ also relied on the involuntary nature of the liability to distinguish the Privy Council decision in Ward. The fact that the liability was involuntary therefore formed part of Myers CJ’s reasoning. Glazebrook and James 1 have argued that the reference to involuntariness was unnecessary, because the case was distinguishable on the basis that the expenditure was not incurred for the direct purpose of producing profits, so was not deductible under the general deductibility test that, at the time, required expenses to be exclusively incurred in deriving income. They say that the reference to involuntariness was merely a convenient means of distinguishing Ward. In the Commissioner’s opinion, it was relevant in Ward that the expense was incurred voluntarily, because if it was, in the circumstances it was harder to say that it was exclusively incurred in deriving assessable income. The fact that the involuntary nature of the expense was relevant to the judgment in Ward made it relevant therefore in distinguishing Ward in Public Trustee. Myers CJ did in fact note the point from Callan J’s judgment that the wording of the legislative test was different, and also that the nature of the expense in Ward was different than in Public Trustee, but despite these differences, his Honour still made a point of distinguishing Ward. Ward was concerned with expenditure aimed at preventing the destruction of the profit making thing—and so was Public Trustee. Ward was therefore relevant law. 62. The involuntary nature of the liability was seen as crucial by Pankhurst J in Borlase to the application of Public Trustee: \[26\] The case \[Public Trustee\] is now of course of long-standing \[sic\]. But in my view it is also well-settled that the involuntary nature of the expenditure (payment of death duties) is pivotal to the outcome. Significantly there have been very few cases since in which it has been accepted that some form of private expenditure was involuntary, such that income \[sic\] on borrowings against an income-producing asset were deductible in whole or in part. One such case is Williams v C of IR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,078 in which the taxpayer borrowed against the security of his farm (an income-producing asset) in order to settle his wife‘s matrimonial property claim. Given the involuntary nature of the payment, it was accepted that the funds were used to retain an income-producing asset, and hence the interest expense was deductible. 63. Keane DJ held in Case L76 that Public Trustee did not apply, because the lack of discretion present in Public Trustee did not arise. The taxpayer in that case financed the purchase of a home with borrowings rather than break her short- term interest earning investments. 64. In the Australian case Begg v FC of T (1937) 4 ATD 257 the facts were similar to Public Trustee and it was also decided in the taxpayer’s favour. It could be argued that involuntariness was not a decisive factor in this decision, but, on the other hand, the judge did find that the liability arose in a manner that was 1 “Taxation Implications of Company Law Reform” by Susan Glazebrook and Jan James, New Zealand Journal of Taxation Law and Policy, Volume 1, pages 152 to 158. 17 outside the taxpayer’s control. The issue in Begg was whether interest paid on moneys borrowed by an executor to pay succession and estate duties and other outgoings for the general administration of the estate was deductible. Reed AJ said that the borrowing preserved the assets, and that there was a relation between the payment of the interest and the production of the assessable income. In coming to this conclusion, his Honour said that “the very circumstances under which \[the executors\] acquired the estate imposed a liability, the satisfaction of which would necessarily reduce that income”. So because of this fact, the executors had no choice whether to incur the liability, or, in other words, it was involuntary. Also, it is notable that this case has been criticised and not applied in the later decisions of Roberts and Smith and Hayden v FCT (1996) 33 ATR 352. 65. In conclusion, although Myers CJ did not explicitly state involuntariness to be a factor in ensuring deductibility in the circumstances he was considering, his Honour relied on the fact that the expense was involuntary to distinguish Ward and Munro and spoke of borrowings that were necessary. The involuntariness of the liability was seen as a crucial factor in Borlase and Case L76, and was arguably present in Begg. The Commissioner’s opinion 66. In the Commissioner’s view, the presence of the involuntary factor (along with the other two factors) means that the statutory test for deductibility is satisfied, because the connection with assessable income is stronger when the liability met is incurred involuntarily. The connection is strengthened because it is more likely that income earning assets would have been sold when there was no choice but to meet the liability. Therefore, in the circumstances, the borrowing retains income earning assets and prevents them from having to be sold. What is meant by “involuntary” 67. Pankhurst J in Borlase discussed what was meant by an “involuntary” liability. His Honour held that the expenditure on a domestic house was discretionary, rather than voluntary. His Honour said: In both Public Trustee and Williams the requirement to pay, and the quantum of the payment at issue was truly external to and beyond the control of the taxpayer. The same cannot be said of the expenditure in this case. 68. Therefore, a liability will be involuntary if the taxpayer has no control over the circumstances of the liability arising and the quantum of the payment. 69. It might be argued that there was some possibility in Williams of the taxpayer being able to influence the amount of the settlement, and similarly in Public Trustee to mitigate the amount of the death duties. However, the extent of the taxpayer’s control over the liability in both cases was limited. Pankhurst J in Borlase considered that the quantum of the liability in Williams was outside the control of the taxpayer. Any ability to negotiate the amount was not mentioned in Williams as a feature of the liability. Barker J describes the settlement process which involved competing claims from both parties 18 following separation, negotiations through counsel and a settlement agreement made under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act. Given the statutory overlay and the formal nature of the settlement, the taxpayer had little scope to alter the amount of his liability. In Public Trustee, as the amount of the liability was based on the amount of the estate’s assets at the time of death, a time before the taxpayer Trustee had control over the assets, any ability to alter the amount of the liability must be seen as limited. Pankhurst J considered the liability in Public Trustee to be involuntary and did not refer to any ability of the taxpayer to alter the amount. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a liability will be involuntary in this context where the taxpayer has no control over the amount of the liability, or only very limited scope to negotiate the final amount of a liability, which has arisen involuntarily. 70. It may be that a future court would accept that a liability, though not involuntary to the degree just discussed, was still sufficiently involuntarily incurred so as to establish a sufficient connection with assessable income. A court may go further and hold that even in the absence of an involuntary liability, other circumstances establish that the borrowing prevents income earning assets from being sold so that the nexus with assessable income is established. The Commissioner will consider such situations on a case-by- case basis. The second factor—the taxpayer definitely would have otherwise realised income earning assets Case law 71. In Public Trustee Myers CJ found on the facts that the borrowing left the money in the estate and enabled the Trustee to maintain the income from the assets. In other words, if it had not borrowed it could not have maintained the income because it would have sold income earning assets. Callan J found on the facts that: ... the payment of the duties with the borrowed money saved from sale an ascertainable portion of the tangible assets by the use of which the assessable income was produced. 72. Similarly in Williams, if the taxpayer had not borrowed he would have had to have sold income earning assets. Barker J in Williams stated the facts as follows, referring to the taxpayer’s subjective intention: The objector was then faced with the necessity of raising money to comply with the terms of the agreement. He had no major asset, other than the farm; he did not want to sacrifice the farm at a giveaway price. In order to remain in farming, he eventually borrowed from a trust ... 73. In these two cases, the facts were such that the Court could conclude that but for the borrowing, the taxpayer definitely would have realised income earning assets. The focus is on what the taxpayer actually would have done if the taxpayer had not borrowed. 19 The Commissioner’s opinion 74. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this factor is central to establishing a nexus when it is argued that borrowings are made in order to retain assets. When it is clear from the facts that the taxpayer definitely would have sold income earning assets if it had not borrowed, the Commissioner will treat the interest as deductible (assuming the other two factors are present i.e. the liability is involuntary and the liability arose in connection with the income earning assets retained). When it is less clear what the taxpayer would have done if it had not borrowed, the Commissioner may still form the view that interest is deductible, but will still need to be satisfied that the borrowings in fact had the effect of preventing income earning assets from being sold. When can it be concluded that the taxpayer would have otherwise sold? 75. Establishing whether the taxpayer really would have realised the income earning assets involves considering the taxpayer’s state of mind before the borrowing. This involves a consideration of a hypothetical situation based on the taxpayer’s intentions – what would this particular taxpayer have done if the funds had not been borrowed? Certain factual features will help to answer this question. 76. If the circumstances suggest that it was necessary or inevitable that the taxpayer would have otherwise realised income earning assets, for example, if the taxpayer only had income earning assets, it might be argued that an intention to have otherwise realised income earning assets is not necessary. However, the Commissioner’s view is that in no situation is it certain from the objective facts alone that a taxpayer would have otherwise realised assets, because there is always the possibility that the taxpayer would have chosen not to pay the liability, or managed to obtain funds in some other way, had the taxpayer not borrowed. 77. It will be relevant to consider whether the taxpayer had actually formed a definite intention to realise income earning assets, had the funds not been borrowed. In some situations, a taxpayer may not have clearly formed a view of what would have been done if the borrowing had not taken place. There may have been some plan to realise income earning assets, but the taxpayer may not have put any thought into which option the taxpayer really would have taken if the funds had not been borrowed. If these are the facts, the taxpayer may not necessarily be able to satisfy the Commissioner that the requisite intention had been present to realise assets if the amount had not been borrowed. 78. It may be difficult from a practical perspective for a taxpayer to establish what the taxpayer had in mind immediately before the funds were borrowed. The practicality of testing a subjective intention was considered in Grieve v C of IR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. Although the context was different, it is considered that the same difficulty applied, so the Court’s approach is relevant. Richardson J said in Grieve: “Now the existence of a bona fide intention is often tested or assessed having regard to objective factors such as the conduct of the person concerned.” Therefore, in order to prove to the Commissioner’s 20 satisfaction that a taxpayer would have realised income earning assets, it will be appropriate to consider objective evidence to support a conclusion regarding the taxpayer’s state of mind. Proof that the intention to realise income earning assets had been formed might be supported by documentation, and a past history of realising the type of income earning assets owned at the time of borrowing. 79. If a taxpayer had some income earning assets and some other assets (non- income earning assets or assets earning exempt income) at the time of borrowing, the taxpayer would have had several choices apart from realising income earning assets or borrowing. In that situation it may often be difficult for the taxpayer to provide objective evidence supportive of an intention to have otherwise realised income earning assets, particularly if cash is one of the non-income earning assets. In contrast, it might be easier for a taxpayer with only income earning assets at the time of borrowing to prove that the intention was to have otherwise realised income earning assets. 80. This element of Public Trustee—that the taxpayer definitely would have otherwise realised income earning assets if the taxpayer had not borrowed— may entail apportionment. Apportionment will be appropriate when: • a taxpayer can satisfy the onus of proof only to a certain extent, that is, the taxpayer can prove only that some income earning assets definitely would have been realised if not for the borrowing, but cannot prove to the required standard that other income earning assets would have been realised; and • a taxpayer borrows to retain both income earning and non-income earning assets; and • a taxpayer would have otherwise realised income earning assets, but the amount realised would have been a lesser amount than the amount borrowed. Apportionment is discussed further below. Could the taxpayer in Public Trustee have realised non-income producing assets? 81. In Public Trustee the estate consisted partly of assets producing assessable income but principally of assets producing non-assessable income (p 445). The taxpayer had borrowed money to pay death duties that related not only to assets producing assessable income, but also to assets producing non- assessable income. The Commissioner and the taxpayer agreed that, if the Court found for the taxpayer, deductible interest would equal: total interest x (assets producing assessable income/total assets) 82. The formula arrived at between the parties assumed that the taxpayer would have realised both income producing and non-income producing assets on a pro rata basis, and that interest would have been deductible on the basis of the 21 proportion of income producing assets. On the basis of the formula, the Court assumed that some income earning assets definitely would have been realised, and the interest was deductible to the extent it related to those assets. Therefore, the Court did not need to consider which assets would be realised. 83. This formula was agreed to between the parties and was not sanctioned by the Court. The Commissioner now considers that the taxpayer must show that particular income earning assets definitely would have otherwise been realised, and would no longer simply agree to a pro rata approach. No assets to realise 84. Public Trustee applies when borrowings retain income earning assets and a sufficient connection with income derivation is established. In some instances, a taxpayer may not have sufficient value in income earning assets that could be retained through borrowing to meet a liability. The interest would not be deductible to the extent that the amount borrowed exceeded the value of the particular income earning assets retained. An example would be a business consultant whose only business assets comprise a computer, telephone, facsimile and furniture, who could not realise sufficient funds from the realisation of those items to meet a liability. The third factor—the liability arose in connection with the income earning assets retained 85. The third factor that needs to be present is a liability that arises in connection with the income earning assets retained. In Public Trustee, Myers CJ noted that the liability was charged over the income earning assets (p 452): The question then is whether the money which was borrowed by the estate from the Public Trustee under special statutory authority and which was charged over the whole estate – i.e. the assets producing both assessable and non-assessable income alike – was employed “in the production of income”. For the determination of this question the substance of the transaction must be regarded. The death duties were a charge on the whole estate. 86. Also, Myers CJ in Public Trustee distinguished Munro (where interest was held not to be deductible) on the basis that in Munro the liability was in no way referable to the income earning assets. 87. In Williams, the only other New Zealand case where a court has held that interest incurred in retaining income earning assets is deductible, the liability also arose in connection with the income earning assets. The liability represented the taxpayer’s ex-wife’s interest in the farm assets and was calculated with reference to the value of those assets. 88. Support for this view can also be found in Begg. Begg, discussed above, was the Australian case decided in the taxpayer’s favour. In considering whether interest was deductible, the Court found that the liability arose in connection with the assets forming part of an estate. Reed AJ said: ... the very circumstances under which \[the executors\] acquired the estate imposed a liability, the satisfaction of which would necessarily reduce that income. 22 The Commissioner’s opinion 89. When the liability has arisen in connection with the income earning assets retained, the connection with assessable income is strengthened, because there is another link between the interest and the liability. This aspect of the connection is not as strong as it is in the Pacific Rendezvous situation, where the borrowings were applied directly to a liability that was the acquisition of income earning assets themselves. On the other hand, the connection is not as remote as it is in the situation where the liability does not relate at all to the income earning assets retained. There is no authority that the sufficient connection can be established in this latter scenario. Apportionment relating to the third factor 90. Apportionment will be required when the factors that have been discussed are present only to a certain extent. Apportionments relating to the second factor were outlined above. An apportionment will be required in relation to the third factor if the liability met by the borrowed funds arose in connection with both income earning assets and non-income earning assets. This adjustment involves calculation of a ceiling, being the maximum deduction available. How are assets valued? 91. The essence of the Public Trustee case is that interest on borrowings may be deductible if, in the circumstances, the borrowings retain income earning assets. To put it another way, the assets would have otherwise been realised but for the borrowing and the amount realised would have been used to meet the liability. The relevant value of the assets in considering the extent to which borrowed funds retain income earning assets is therefore the realisable value, less the costs of realisation, or in other words, the net realisable value. Examples showing apportionment 92. The circumstances of a taxpayer’s mix of assets and the valuation of the liability will affect the calculation of apportionment when applying the Commissioner’s interpretation of Public Trustee, as the following examples illustrate. Example 1—a mix of income and non-income earning assets 93. In this example, taxpayer A has both income earning and non-income earning assets. The income earning assets have a net realisable value of $60 and the non-income earning assets have a net realisable value of $40. Taxpayer A borrows to fund an involuntary liability of $10. If Taxpayer A can prove that he would have otherwise realised only income earning assets to the required extent, the $10 liability would have been met out of the $60 obtained from the realisation of those assets, so all of the interest would be deductible. 94. If, instead, it can be established that he would have realised the non-income earning assets first, then the $10 liability would have been met out of the $40 23 obtained from non-income earning assets, and so none of the interest would be deductible. 95. If, on the facts, he would have realised some income earning and some non- income earning assets, then the interest deduction will be calculated according to those proportions. 96. If there is no convincing evidence that Taxpayer A definitely would have otherwise sold income earning assets, none of the interest will be deductible. Example 2—how to calculate the deduction when the liability is only partially related to income earning assets and the taxpayer has a mix of income earning and non-income earning assets 97. In Example 1, it has been assumed that the liability arose in connection with the income earning assets. In some situations, the liability may be only partially related to income earning assets. If so, the deduction will be available only to the extent to which the liability arose in connection with the income earning assets. A taxpayer in this situation may have a mix of non- income earning and income earning assets. Two adjustments would be needed for such a taxpayer to calculate the deductible portion of the interest. 98. In Example 2, Taxpayer B faces a liability which is related to only 20% of her income earning assets. The interest will only be deductible to the extent that the liability arose in connection with income earning assets. The maximum deduction here would be 20%, as that portion is the extent to which the liability arose in connection with the income earning assets. Taxpayer B has income earning assets with a net realisable value of $60 and non-income earning assets with a net realisable value of $40. 99. As in Example 1, if Taxpayer B can prove she would have realised only income earning assets, the $10 liability would have otherwise been met out of the $60 received from the realisation of income earning assets, had Taxpayer B not borrowed. However, although 100% of the retained assets are income earning assets, only 20% of the interest would be deductible because it relates to income earning assets only to that extent. 100. If, instead, Taxpayer B would have realised the non-income earning assets first, none of the interest would be deductible, and, if Taxpayer B would have realised some income earning and some non-income earning assets, then the interest deduction will be calculated according to those proportions, but to a maximum of 20%. 101. If there is no convincing evidence that Taxpayer B definitely would have otherwise sold income earning assets, none of the interest will be deductible. SITUATIONS FALLING OUTSIDE THE THREE FACTORS 102. The general test is that interest will be deductible when there is a sufficient connection between the interest and assessable income. When it has been argued that interest is deductible where borrowings retain income earning 24 assets, the Courts have so far decided that interest is deductible when the three factors have been present (Public Trustee and Williams) and have held that it is not deductible when the factors are not present (see for example Borlase and Case S87 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,545). When the three factors are present, the Commissioner considers interest is deductible, and so taxpayers can have certainty about how Inland Revenue will apply the law. 103. However, it is acknowledged that there may be situations where the sufficient connection is met where not all of the three factors are present. Inland Revenue will consider deductibility in situations falling outside the three factors on a case-by-case basis. In considering these situations, Inland Revenue will be asking whether the nexus between earning assessable income and the application of the borrowed funds is sufficient. That is, whether the degree of connection between interest and assessable income approaches the degree present in the facts of Public Trustee and Williams, or whether the degree of connection is closer to the facts in, for example, Borlase, Case L76 or Case S87. In asking this question, a guiding principle will be whether the borrowing does in fact have the effect of preventing income earning assets from being sold. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this consideration reflects the broad principle underlying the approaches of the Courts that have accepted interest is deductible when borrowings retain assets. It will also be relevant to consider other elements that establish a connection with assessable income. An example of another element that may contribute to a connection with assessable income is a connection between the liability met by the borrowed funds and the income earning assets. PART 3 – FURTHER BACKGROUND AND OTHER APPROACHES CONSIDERED The floodgates argument 104. The Commissioner’s approach to interpreting the cases in this area is not governed by a concern that a wide interpretation would “open the floodgates” and therefore mean that, in the Commissioner’s eyes, too much interest would be deductible. This suggestion had previously been made about an earlier view expressed in the area of interest deductibility. Rather, the Commissioner’s view is based on applying the statutory words as they have been interpreted by the Courts. Interest is only deductible if a sufficient connection can be established, and the use of the words “to the extent that” in the statutory provision indicates that it was assumed that certain interest would not meet this test and apportionment of non-deductible interest would be appropriate in some circumstances. Difficulties in satisfying the test 105. This statement has outlined the factors that need to be present if the taxpayer is to be certain that the Commissioner will agree that interest is deductible when applying the Public Trustee case. In some circumstances it may be difficult for practical reasons for taxpayers to satisfy the Commissioner that these 25 factors are present. It could also be said that the situations where the three factors are present may be limited. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the Courts have only accepted that interest is deductible when Public Trustee is argued if these factors have been present. Further, as has been pointed out, the Commissioner may agree that interest is deductible when the three factors are not present, if the taxpayer can establish that there is a sufficient connection between interest and the taxpayer’s assessable income. 106. The compliance problems are not relevant to all taxpayers. This area of case law will generally not apply to company taxpayers because interest incurred by companies is in most cases deductible without the necessity of satisfying the nexus test. The rules applying to companies are discussed earlier in this statement and in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). 107. Finally, it should be noted that any practical considerations relate to what is only a secondary test of deductibility. If interest has a connection with assessable income through the borrowed funds being used to acquire income earning assets or otherwise through a direct use in an income earning activity or business, there is no need to rely on Public Trustee and any practical considerations relating to that case do not arise. More restrictive approach in other jurisdictions 108. The Commissioner’s approach discussed in this statement permits greater deductibility than would apply in some other comparative jurisdictions. The judicial trend overseas has been to deny deductions when retention of assets is argued. In the Australian Full Federal Court decision in Roberts and Smith, Hill J referred to Begg as a “difficult case” and said: The case has stood for a long time and the present is not an appropriate occasion to consider its correctness. There may, however, be thought to be some difficulties in reconciling what was said there with the decision of the High Court in Munro. 109. Hill J’s opinion was therefore that there was an insufficient nexus with assessable income in Begg. 110. In Hayden v FCT (1996) 33 ATR 352 the Federal Court did not apply Begg and did not consider that there was a principle that borrowing may retain income earning assets. The taxpayer was the executor of a deceased estate. As a result of an action by the testator’s son, the Supreme Court made an order that provision be made out of the estate for the testator’s son of the amount of $150,000. The liability was therefore incurred involuntarily. The executor borrowed the amount and paid it to the son. A factor influencing her decision to borrow was to avoid selling two properties and so carry out the testator’s wish to preserve the properties for the ultimate use of a religious organisation. 111. The taxpayer argued that the interest was incurred to satisfy the order so as to maintain the income earning assets of the estate. Spender J in the Federal Court rejected this argument, and held that the focus must be on the use to which the borrowed funds are put. His Honour discussed Public Trustee and Begg, noting that both decisions were factually similar to the one he was 26 concerned with. His Honour found himself unable to reconcile Public Trustee and Begg with the decision in Munro. 112. Canadian authorities have generally been decided on the basis that for interest to be deductible, borrowed funds must be directly used in producing income. In The Queen v Phyllis Bronfman Trust \[1987\] 1 CTC 117, a decision of the Supreme Court, the trustees borrowed to make distributions to the beneficiary of the trust rather than realise assets. The Chief Justice held that the courts could not ignore the direct use of the borrowed funds. The direct use of the funds was to make capital allocations to the beneficiaries, a use that earned the trust no income. The decision in Bronfman was followed in the Canadian Federal Court in 74712 Alberta Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1997\] 2 C.T.C. 30. The taxpayer in 74712 Alberta borrowed to pay a guarantee in respect of its parent companies’ debt obligations. The Court applied Bronfman Trust, deciding that the interest was not incurred for the purpose of earning income and was not deductible. 113. The decisions in Bronfman and Alberta limited the application of the decision in Trans-Prairie Pipelines Ltd. v MNR \[1920\] CTC 537. In Trans-Prairie the taxpayer issued debentures and used the money to redeem preference shares. The Exchequer Court held that although the direct use of the money was to return amounts to preference shareholders, the interest was deductible because the money borrowed through the debentures had the effect of filling the hole left by the amount that was returned to the shareholders. Therefore, the borrowed funds were used for the purpose of earning income. In the Tax Court decision in Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada v R \[1997\] 2 CTC 3097, McArthur T.C.J. held that following the decisions in Bronfman and 74712 Alberta, Trans-Prairie “has been confined to its own special circumstances”. 114. The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency has a practice of allowing indirect interest deductions in a limited range of situations. These situations, such as money borrowed to redeem shares, are seen as a class of arrangements where borrowed money replaces funds in a business. The CCRA does not recognise retention of income earning assets as a principle of deductibility. Use of money interest 115. This statement has its origins in two issues papers issued by the Public Rulings Unit on interest deductibility issues. The second of these issues papers, IRRUIP 5, discussed the issue of the deductibility of use-of-money interest. The issue of the deductibility of use-of-money interest is not considered in this statement. The Commissioner intends to consider whether to publish a view on the deductibility of use-of-money interest in a separate statement or statements. Reasons for rejecting other analyses 116. In reaching the conclusions in this statement, the Commissioner has considered and rejected arguments for other analyses of the cases. These will now be briefly outlined. 27 Argument 1—Pacific Rendezvous and Public Trustee are distinguishable 117. In IRRUIP 5 the Commissioner expressed the view that the situation in Public Trustee is different in nature from that in Pacific Rendezvous, because in Public Trustee the connection with assessable income was indirect, and not direct as it was in Pacific Rendezvous. In Pacific Rendezvous there were two direct outcomes arising from the application of the borrowed funds—the receipt of assessable income and the receipt of capital gains. In contrast, in Public Trustee arguably only one outcome arose directly from the application of the funds, and that outcome was not related to assessable income. The other outcome, which was related to assessable income, arose only indirectly from the application of the funds. Therefore, it can be argued that the cases are precedents for two quite different principles. 118. Applying this analysis in IRRUIP 5, it was suggested that in the Public Trustee situation, certain factors will need to be present to make a sufficient connection with assessable income (which view the Commissioner also takes in this statement). The point of difference with this statement is the argument that as the two cases can be seen as standing for two distinct principles, the private prohibition applies differently to each. The argument was that under the Public Trustee principle, a deduction could never be taken for interest where the direct application of the funds is for private use. This was because under the statutory scheme, the prohibition against deductions for private expenditure applies even though the permissive provision in section DD 1 is satisfied. The principle from Pacific Rendezvous that a second non-income related use does not invalidate a connection with assessable income does not apply to this situation because that case is distinguishable. The result also could be argued to be consistent with the intention of the Act to tax income, and to prohibit deductions of a private nature. 119. The problem with this approach is that there is a strong argument that there is no conceptual difference between Public Trustee and Pacific Rendezvous. In both cases the funds were used in an income earning activity or business, and the second non-income producing use was achieved simultaneously with the use connected with income. Although the connection with assessable income in the Public Trustee scenario is indirect, once the sufficient connection is established, through the involuntariness of the liability, the fact that the taxpayer definitely would have otherwise realised income earning assets and the fact that the liability arose in connection with the assets, the situation would seem then to be analogous to Pacific Rendezvous. Any simultaneous use, although not related to assessable income, should not require an apportionment. 120. Further, the approach would seem to be inconsistent with the decision in Williams. In Williams a deduction was available even though one use of the funds—to fund a matrimonial claim—appeared to be private in nature. 28 Argument 2—Pacific Rendezvous and Brierley are wrong; other cases suggest apportionment 121. Another approach would be to apply the private prohibition in both the Public Trustee and Pacific Rendezvous situations, and to view the decisions in Pacific Rendezvous and Brierley as wrong or misunderstood on this point. Arguably, an apportionment should be made when borrowed funds are used to some extent for a use that is a prohibited deduction. Ronpibon Tin NL v FC of T; Tongkah NL v FC of T (1949) 78 CLR 47 at p 59), approved in Banks and Buckley & Young, arguably supports the proposition that apportionment is required not only when expenditure can be divided between a part related exclusively to income and a part related exclusively to something other than income (a “time and space apportionment”). The Court in Ronpibon Tin considered that apportionment is required not only when the expenditure can be divided on a time and space basis, but also when the expenditure serves two outcomes indifferently. 122. In Pacific Rendezvous, Richardson J appeared to consider the only issue was whether a time and space apportionment was appropriate. It could be argued that the question of whether an apportionment should be made for expenditure which serves both income earning and other purposes indifferently was not sufficiently appreciated in Pacific Rendezvous. Arguably it was open to the Court to apply the principle from Ronpibon Tin and require an apportionment. The expenditure in Pacific Rendezvous can be seen as expenditure which served both income earning and other purposes indifferently. In contrast to Pacific Rendezvous, in Public Trustee, the Court treated the expenditure as achieving both income-related and non-income related outcomes indifferently and the interest was apportioned. 123. However, the Commissioner’s view is that despite possible contrary indications in Ronpibon, Banks and Buckley & Young, the law on interest deductibility in New Zealand seems settled on this point. In two authoritative cases—Pacific Rendezvous and Brierley—the Court of Appeal has given the view that an apportionment is not required when borrowed funds are all used in an income earning activity, despite co-existing advantages. Argument 3—special nature of capital 124. A third possible approach also assumes that the private prohibition applies in both the Pacific Rendezvous and the Public Trustee situations. The argument is that the private prohibition would have applied in Pacific Rendezvous if the non-income use had been a private one. Similarly it could be argued that the private prohibition would have applied in Public Trustee, had it existed at that time. The private prohibition was introduced into the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 in 1968. The issue before the Court in Public Trustee was whether the deduction should be denied for a lack of connection with assessable income, not whether it was private in nature. Also, had the prohibition applied, on the facts of Public Trustee, it could have been argued that the payment of death duties by a trustee is not a private use of funds. 29 125. This argument is that it was the nature of the non-income use of borrowed funds in Pacific Rendezvous, and in Brierley, that meant that an apportionment was not required. This use of the borrowed funds in Pacific Rendezvous and Brierley was to achieve a capital gain. In Brierley, Richardson J recognised that it could be said that an asset is always employed in the production of both assessable income and prospective capital benefits. His Honour said that it would be contrary to the capital/revenue distinction and the scheme of the Act, to refuse a deduction for an assumed capital element of interest. Similarly, Cooke J said in Pacific Rendezvous that in applying funds, “often a taxpayer would not be prudent to have regard for income only; capital appreciation is commonly an important consideration”. It could be argued that when funds are used for two uses, and one of those is private, such private use is not intrinsically linked with the use of the funds in the income earning activity as capital gains are, and therefore the interest should be apportioned. 126. However, Richardson J in Pacific Rendezvous stated a broader principle, and did not refer to the nature of the non-income outcome. His Honour said that interest is deductible if the borrowed capital was all used in the income earning activity. His Honour did not qualify this statement by adding that in contrast, the deduction would have been apportioned if the second use had instead been a use that was not a capital one. Richardson and Cooke JJ said that the test is simply to examine the use of the borrowed funds, and if all of the funds are used in an income earning activity, then the interest is deductible. Although Cooke J went on to explain this in terms of the intrinsic link between interest and capital, it is not clear that his Honour was intending to limit non-deductibility to joint income/capital outcomes. On balance, it is considered that the better view is that Pacific Rendezvous stands for this wider principle. Argument 4—the deductibility test provides for a wide range of deductions 127. Another potential approach is to view the general permission in section DA 1 as broad enough to apply to interest incurred in respect of expenditure not directly connected with the income earning activity, without the need to apply Public Trustee. An example is interest incurred on money borrowed to pay tax. This argument was more obvious under a previous wording of the deductibility provision, which specifically provided for deductions necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. However, the cases have held that the “necessarily incurred in carrying on a business” test is, like the more general test, concerned with the relationship between an expense and the income earning activity. The connection with assessable income must be sufficient for expenditure, including interest, to be deductible. 128. In the example of borrowing to pay tax, a payment of tax might be a transaction typical of a business, but it is not part of the carrying on of the income earning activity or business. Interest incurred on money borrowed and used for such transactions is not sufficiently connected with assessable income merely on the basis that these are business transactions. Payment of tax is a payment made after income has been derived. In Smiths’ Potato Crisps (1929) Ltd v IR. \[1948\] AC 508, Lord Normand said at pp 529-530 “... income 30 tax is an impost made upon profits after they have been earned, and ... a payment out of profits after they have been earned is not within the purposes of the trade carried on by the taxpayer.” Comparison with the Commissioner’s previous statements Issues paper - IRRUIP 5 (2001) 129. IRRUIP 5 was published to replace IRRUIP 3. The conclusions in IRRUIP 5, and the reasons why the Commissioner has departed from that view, have already been outlined under the heading “Argument 1- Pacific Rendezvous and Public Trustee are distinguishable”. In summary, the view put forward in IRRUIP 5 was that Public Trustee was fundamentally different from Pacific Rendezvous, and that the private prohibition in section BD 2 prevents a deduction of interest where the direct application of the funds is a private use. The Commissioner now considers that the two cases are analogous in this regard as in both cases the borrowed funds were used in relation to assessable income. The Commissioner considers that in the circumstances of both cases the private prohibition will not prevent a deduction if the borrowed funds are used to acquire or retain income earning assets. Another difference is the Commissioner’s view of the circumstances in which the sufficient connection is met. The Commissioner’s view is now that Public Trustee will apply if the liability met by the borrowed funds was involuntary, to the extent to which the taxpayer can prove that the taxpayer definitely would have otherwise realised particular income earning assets to meet the liability, and to the extent to which the liability arose in connection with the income earning assets. The Commissioner may take the view that interest is deductible in situations when these three factors are not present, if the nexus is sufficient. In considering whether the nexus is sufficient, the Commissioner will consider whether, in the circumstances, the borrowing has the effect of preventing a realisation of income earning assets. 130. IRRUIP 5 also dealt with deductibility issues arising from the decision in Roberts and Smith. The Commissioner’s intention is that these issues will now be dealt with in a separate statement or statements. IRRUIP 5 should not be relied upon as stating the Commissioner’s current view in relation to interest deductibility issues. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 9 (June 1992) 131. In TIB Vol 3, No 9 the Commissioner’s view of the Public Trustee decision was stated to be as follows: Interest is deductible if a taxpayer establishes that the capital was borrowed to meet involuntary expenditure to retain assets used in producing assessable income. However, if the capital was borrowed for purposes quite alien from the income producing asset (such as meeting personal obligations), the interest will not be deductible. The onus is on the taxpayer to establish that the interest is deductible, and what portion of it is deductible. 31 132. The view in the TIB is that the liability must be involuntary, and that the liability met with the borrowed funds must not be “alien” from the income producing assets, or, in other words, must be connected in some way with the income earning assets. In these respects, the view in the TIB and the view in this statement are similar. This statement analyses in more depth when borrowing retains income earning assets, and concludes that for assets to be retained, the taxpayer must at least prove that the borrowing prevented a realisation of income earning assets. Also, the Commissioner has clarified that a private use of the funds will not on its own prevent a deduction of the interest, and, that in such a situation, interest may be deductible if there is another use of the borrowed funds that has a sufficient connection with assessable income to establish deductibility. 133. The item in TIB Vol 3, No 9, to the extent that it relates to Public Trustee, is replaced by this statement. PART 4 – CONCLUSIONS Establishing the sufficient connection – acquiring and retaining 134. The test of interest deductibility is whether there is a sufficient connection between the interest incurred and the income earning activity or business. This connection is established and interest will be deductible if the borrowed funds are used in an income earning activity or business. “Used” or “employed” refers to the outcomes achieved by the application of the borrowed funds. 135. Funds are used in an income earning activity or business if they are used to acquire assets or otherwise directly in that activity or business, or to retain assets which form part of that activity or business. 136. When funds are applied to acquire income earning assets, that acquisition has a direct link with the income derivation activity and the connection with the income earning activity or business is established. In contrast, when funds retain assets, the application of the funds—to pay death duties, to settle a matrimonial obligation, or to buy a private house, for example—does not necessarily contribute to the income earning activity business without further facts being present. The Commissioner’s opinion on when interest will be deductible when income earning assets are retained 137. The Commissioner will be satisfied that a sufficient nexus with assessable income is established where the borrowing retains income earning assets if the taxpayer can establish that: • the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge was involuntary; and 32 • the taxpayer definitely would have realised particular income earning assets, if the taxpayer had not borrowed; and • the liability that the borrowed funds were used to discharge arose in connection with the income earning assets retained. 138. This interpretation of Public Trustee is consistent with the High Court decisions in Williams and Borlase. 139. When the three factors are present, taxpayers have certainty about how the Commissioner will apply the law. Situations falling outside the three factors 140. Inland Revenue will consider situations falling outside the three factors on a case-by-case basis. In each case Inland Revenue will be considering whether the nexus between interest and assessable income is sufficient. That is, whether the degree of connection between interest and assessable income approaches the degree present in the facts of Public Trustee and Williams, or whether the degree of connection is closer to the facts in, for example, Borlase, Case L76 or Case S87. In asking this question, it will be relevant to consider: • whether the borrowing does in fact have the effect of preventing income earning assets from being sold, and • other elements that establish a connection with assessable income. Concurrent non-income earning use 141. When borrowed funds are used to retain income earning assets, a concurrent non-income earning use of the funds will not on its own prevent a deduction of the interest (Pacific Rendezvous, Borlase, and Williams). The involuntary factor 142. Myers CJ stated that the borrowing in Public Trustee had been necessary and relied on the fact that the liability was involuntary to distinguish Ward and Munro. Pankhurst J in Borlase stated that the involuntary nature of the liability is an essential element of the Public Trustee test. The fact of a liability being involuntary contributes to the formation of a sufficient connection with assessable income, and is therefore consistent with the statutory test. 143. A liability is involuntary if the requirement to pay, and the quantum, is external to and beyond the control of the taxpayer (Borlase). Apportionment 144. Apportionment is appropriate when applying Public Trustee to reflect the extent to which: 33 • a taxpayer can satisfy the onus of proof; • the borrowing retains non-income producing assets; • the amount otherwise realised from the income earning assets would have been a lesser amount than the amount borrowed. 145. In addition, an adjustment may be required to reflect the extent to which the liability arose in connection with income earning assets. 34
\[This interpretation statement was issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel on 15 May 2007. It was previously released for public consultation as exposure draft IS0059: Sale of long-term residential rental properties—GST implications.\] IS 07/01: GST TREATMENT OF SALE OF LONG-TERM RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES This interpretation statement replaces public ruling BR Pub 97/12, which was published as “Sale of long-term residential properties—GST implications” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 13 (December 1997), and applied until 31 March 2001. Summary 1. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. 2. Under section 14(1)(d) the following supplies are exempt from GST. • The sale, in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, of a property used by the supplier for the purpose of providing residential accommodation by way of rental, service occupancy agreement or licence (“residential rental purposes”), if the property has been used by the supplier exclusively for that purpose for a period of not less than five years up to the date of sale. • The sale in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of a reversionary interest in land that has been leased by the supplier for the principal purpose of residential accommodation by way of rental, service occupancy agreement or licence in a dwelling erected on that land, if the land has been used by the supplier exclusively for that purpose for a period of not less than five years up to the date of sale. 3. As section 14(1)(d) applies only to sales made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the vendor of the property, if the sale is not made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, it is not necessary to consider whether section 14(1)(d) could apply to exempt the sale from GST. 4. Section 14(1)(d) will not apply to the sale of a property acquired for the principal purpose of a taxable activity of property development where the principal purpose in respect of the property remains unchanged and the principal purpose continues to be the ultimate sale of the property. In such circumstances, the property would continue to be used for a property development activity, in the sense that the owner obtains an advantage from retaining the property for sale in carrying on that activity. That being the case, the property would not be used exclusively for residential rental purposes and section 14(1)(d) would not apply to exempt the sale of the property. This is so even though on a time and space basis 100 percent of the property has been used for residential rental purposes for a period of five years before the sale of the property. 1 5. For section 14(1)(d) to apply, the vendor must have used the property exclusively for residential rental purposes for not less than five years up to the date of sale. It would not be sufficient that the property had been rented out for that period by different owners. However, the property need not be occupied by the same tenant throughout the five-year period. 6. For the purpose of calculating the five-year period, a property will continue to be used for residential rental purposes even if it was vacant for periods during the five years while attempts were made to rent out the property as residential accommodation: Schwerzerhof v Wilkins \[1898\] 1 QB 640. Background 7. Generally, the sale of a residential rental property (a property that has been used for residential rental purposes) is not subject to GST. This is because the provision of residential accommodation under any such arrangement is exempt from GST; therefore, the sale of a residential rental property is not in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. However, in some circumstances a residential rental property may be sold by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. This will occur if the sales are on a sufficient scale as to be continuous and regular, and do not form part of the winding down or cessation of the exempt activity. When a registered person (“the vendor”) sells a residential rental property in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, GST is chargeable on the sale of the property unless section 14(1)(d) applies to exempt the sale from GST. 8. Public ruling BR Pub 97/12 was published as “Sale of long-term residential properties—GST implications” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 13 (December 1997). That ruling applied up to 31 March 2001. It is not intended to reissue the ruling as it is considered that an interpretation statement setting out general principles relating to the interpretation of section 14(1)(d) is more useful. 9. This interpretation statement concerns the following aspects of the interpretation of section 14(1)(d). • The requirement that the sale be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. • What constitutes exclusive use for residential rental purposes. Legislation 10. Section 8(1) provides: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 2 11. Sections 6(1), 6(2) and 6(3)(d) provide: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. (2) Anything done in connection with the beginning or ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person,— .... (d) Any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies. 12. Sections 14(1)(c), (ca) and (d) provide: The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: ... (c) The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of— (i) Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii) A licence to occupy: (ca) The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land: ... (d) The supply, being a sale, by any registered person in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity of— (i) Any dwelling; or (ii) The reversionary interest in the fee simple estate of any leasehold land,— that has been used by the registered person for a period of 5 years or more before the date of the supply exclusively for the making of any supply or supplies referred to in paragraph (c) or paragraph (ca) of this section: Analysis 13. For section 14(1)(d) to apply the following criteria must be satisfied. 3 • The supply must be by way of sale. • The supply must be by a registered person in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity. • The property must have been used for the purpose of supplying residential accommodation by way of hire, service occupancy agreement or licence. • The property must have been used exclusively for that purpose. • The vendor must have used the property for that purpose for a period of not less than five years up to the date of sale. “Supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity” 14. Section 14(1)(d) exempts from GST supplies that would otherwise be subject to GST. GST is chargeable on the supply of goods or services (other than an exempt supply) by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person: section 8(1). An “exempt supply” is a supply that is exempt from tax pursuant to section 14: section 2(1). A taxable activity is an activity that is “carried on continuously or regularly” and involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods or services for a consideration: section 6(1). However, “any activity to the extent to which it involves the making of exempt supplies” is not a taxable activity: section 6(3)(d). 15. In CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 Richardson J suggested that one of the reasons for the express exclusion of exempt supplies in section 8(1) may have been to make it clear that a supply to which section 14 applied would not be subject to GST, even if it was made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 16. To the extent that an activity involves the making of exempt supplies, it is not a taxable activity: see Databank p. 6,103). Therefore, if the sale of a property were made as part of an activity involving the making of exempt supplies, it would not be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 17. These principles are illustrated by Case S36 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,237. The taxpayers in Case S36 had purchased several residential properties for leasing as rental properties as part of their retirement plan, but were forced to sell the properties due to financial difficulties. The Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) found on the facts that the property sales were made in order to wind up an exempt activity and that, therefore, the sales were not made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The TRA accepted that the sale of 20 properties over a two-and-a-half-year period was a continuous or regular activity, but considered the sales were excluded from the scope of the definition of “taxable activity” by section 6(3)(d). The sales were part of the exempt activity of the supply of residential rental accommodation being the winding down or cessation of that activity. The TRA did not accept that the sales constituted a separate activity of property development or dealing. 4 18. The assumption on which section 14(1)(d) is based is that the sale of rental properties by a residential landlord could constitute a taxable activity if the sales were on a sufficient scale. Section 14(1)(d) was enacted to make it clear that the sale of properties used for residential rental purposes by the Housing Corporation (now Housing New Zealand Ltd), which may regularly sell rental properties to its tenants (or otherwise), would be exempt from GST. This achieves symmetry of treatment, as input tax credits would not have been allowed in respect of the acquisition of such properties. There could also be other “large-scale” residential landlords to whom section 14(1)(d) potentially applies. 19. Therefore, a sale of a residential property is not chargeable with GST if either of the following circumstances applied: • Although the sale is in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, the sale is an exempt supply under section 14(1)(d) because the property has been used by the supplier exclusively for the purpose of residential rental for not less than five years. • The sale is not made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity (for example, the sale is in the course or furtherance of an activity involving the making of exempt supplies). (In those circumstances, it is not necessary to consider whether section 14(1)(d) applies.) 20. Section 14(1)(d) refers to a supply by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, but goes on to provide for a situation where the supply will be treated as exempt (that is, the sale of a property that has been used exclusively for the supply of residential accommodation by way of hire for not less than five years before the date of the sale). Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether section 14(1)(d) applies only if the supplier is a registered person who carries on a taxable activity and the supply is made in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. 21. Whether section 14(1)(d) applies to the sale of a property made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, depends on whether the property is a dwelling that has been used exclusively for the purpose of the supply of residential accommodation by way of hire for the required five-year period. Meaning of “used ... exclusively” 22. “Use” has a wide meaning. Its primary meanings are: • To employ or make use of for a particular aim or purpose; • To use up or consume. See Thornton Estates Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577 (CA). 5 23. In Thornton the taxpayer argued that “used” in the context of section 104A meant “employed, applied, committed or dedicated”; therefore, land held by a property developer at balance date had been used in the production of assessable income as the land had been employed in, and dedicated to, a subdivision development during the income year in which the land was acquired. This argument was rejected. The Court of Appeal considered that in the context of section 104A “not used” meant “not used up”. The court noted that the statutory definition of “unexpired portion” referred to that which is left and considered that this interpretation was confirmed by the purpose of section 104A (to achieve a closer matching between the timing of deductions and the recognition of income for income tax purposes). 24. The Commissioner considers that in the context of section 14(1)(d) “used” means “employed for a particular purpose”—in this case, residential rental purposes. The issue in respect of section 14(1)(d) is how a property has been used during the period of five years up to the date of sale, rather than whether the property had been used at a particular point in time (as under section 104A). 25. A property may be used (employed) in a variety of ways. In Sloss v Sloss \[1989\] 3 NZLR 31, 36Richardson J said: The physical occupation of property is clearly a use of that property. In its ordinary meaning, “uses” is not, however, confined in that way. In its natural meaning it is a word of wide import. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary gives as the first meaning, “\[the\] act of using or fact of being used”, and amongst the more detailed definitions is, “utilisation or employment for or with some aim or purpose”. The owner of land may be said to use the land when, without doing anything on that land, he obtains advantages from the land (Newcastle CC v Royal Newcastle Hospital \[1959\] AC 248, 255), and in R v Heyworth (1866) 14 LT 600, 601, Lush J observed that: “The owner ‘uses’ the place \[a slaughter house\] by letting it out”. Even the giving away of property may be a “use” of that property (R v Wampole (Henry K) & Co \[1931\] 3 DLR 754). 26. Therefore, the following is the case. • A property may be said to be “used” by the owner when it is physically occupied by the owner. • A property would also be used when it is rented out by the owner. • A property could be said to be used by the owner when the owner obtains some advantage from the property without doing anything to it. In Sloss Casey J observed that: “Use” can attract many shades of meaning in the various contexts in which it appears, but one of its primary definitions in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary relevant to the present inquiry is “employment for or with some aim or purpose”. The degree of involvement by the user must vary according to the nature of the particular object. In an ordinary domestic situation, the ability of both spouses to exercise direct physical advantage or control will usually establish whether it is for their common use and benefit,—eg a holiday cottage or the family car. But other assets may not be capable of 6 such a physical relationship, and this is the case with the commercial property here. Its functions were to generate income and serve (hopefully) as an appreciating asset .... Those functions make up its “use” to its owner. (p. 44)\[Emphasis added\] In Newcastle City Council v Royal Newcastle Hospital \[1959\] 1 All ER 734 (PC) Lord Denning said: Counsel for the city council submitted that an owner of land could not be said to use the land by leaving it unused; and that was all that had been done here. Their Lordships cannot accept this view. An owner can use land by keeping it in its virgin state for his own special purposes. An owner of a powder magazine or a rifle range uses the land he has acquired nearby for the purpose of ensuring safety even though he never sets foot on it. The owner of an island uses it for the purposes of a bird sanctuary even though he does nothing on it, except prevent people building there or disturbing the birds. In the same way this hospital gets, and purposely gets, fresh air, peace and quiet, which are no mean advantages to it and its patients. (p. 735) A property could be used simultaneously in more than one of the ways outlined above. 27. The definition of “exclusive” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary reads as follows. 1 excluding other things 2 ... excluding all but what is specified 28. Therefore, for section 14(1)(d) to apply, the property must have been used for residential rental purposes and for no other purpose for the required period. What constitutes exclusive use for residential rental purposes? 29. A property that has been rented out for residential rental purposes has clearly been used for that purpose. However, the property could at the same time be used for the purpose of property development (in the sense that an advantage is obtained for the purpose of the property development activity by having the property available for sale as part of the property development activity at that time or in the future). This view is supported by CIR v Lundy (2005) 22 NZTC 19,637 (HC); (2005) 22 NZTC 19,637 (CA), which concerned property developers who had acquired properties for sale and had rented out the properties for residential purposes pending sale. The High Court had held that the principal purpose did not change while the properties were rented. It was accepted that the properties had been applied for a non-taxable purpose, and that, therefore, an adjustment under section 21(1) was required. In discussing whether periodic or one-off adjustments were required, the Court of Appeal made the following comments: \[41\] Periodic adjustments, on the other hand, may be suitable where the use for non- taxable purposes is variable or where it is temporary and coincides with continued use in a taxable activity. In the latter case, one-off adjustments may be difficult to calculate and unfairly large where assets are of any size. In this case, the taxpayers' principal purpose of the sale of the properties in the course of their taxable activities subsisted. The properties were therefore at all times being used for that taxable purpose. They were part of the taxpayers’ trading stock and, 7 indeed, remained on the market at all times. At the same time, they were let for residential purposes, but on a temporary basis. Periodic adjustments were therefore appropriate. \[Emphasis added\] 30. In considering the amount of the adjustments required under section 21, the court said: \[43\] The above exercise spreads only the cost of the land and buildings between periods, however. There still needs to be an apportionment between taxable and non- taxable uses in the particular period. This creates conceptual difficulties because it is not possible to separate out the use of the properties on any time or space basis. In terms of both time and space the properties in this case are 100% dedicated to use for both purposes—see the discussion at \[41\] above. There must be an apportionment, however. Apportioning the depreciation on the buildings (but not the land) would be a possible (if somewhat rough and ready) means of recognising both uses. This is what the taxpayers did in this case. This was a reasonable allocation method and thus within the scope of the legislation. \[Emphasis added\] 31. Section 14(1)(d) contains the word “used”, while section 21(1) refers to goods or services that a person applies for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. The “term “applied” has a wider meaning than “used”: Case N2 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,187. For a property to be “applied” for a particular purpose, it is not necessary that the property be ”used” for that purpose, although some overt act on the part of the taxpayer would be required to demonstrate that the property had been so applied. “Applied” has the flavour of allocation for a particular use. The Concise Oxford Dictionary definition of “apply” includes “to devote”. In this context it is not necessary to draw a distinction between “applied” in section 21(1) and “used” in section 14(1)(1)(d). The use of a property for a particular purpose would normally indicate that the property had been applied for that purpose. If a property has been applied for residential rental purposes, it is also used for residential rental purposes. 32. In Lundy the principal purpose in respect of the properties continued to be property development. The properties were part of the taxpayer’s trading stock and were on the market at all times. The Court of Appeal considered that the properties were both used and applied for taxable and non-taxable purposes. Although the court in Lundy did not directly consider the meaning of “use”, the discussion in Lundy makes it clear that the court considered the properties were used for taxable purposes as the principal purpose of sale in the course of the taxpayer’s taxable activities subsisted (paragraph 41). At the same time the properties were used 100 percent on a time and space basis for residential rental purposes. 33. Lundy supports the view that when the principal purpose in respect of a property remains unchanged and the principal purpose in respect of the property continues to be the ultimate sale of the property, the property continues to be used for that activity. That being the case, the property would not be used exclusively for residential rental purposes. This would be so although the property was used 100 percent on a time and space basis for residential rental purposes. These uses are not incompatible. The 8 Commissioner notes that rather than excluding the use of a property for a property development activity, the rental of the property pending sale could actually facilitate and promote the use of the property for the property development activity (by reducing holding costs or by enhancing sale prospects): Case S81 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,505; CIR v Lundy (2004) 21 NZTC 18,595 (HC). 34. Therefore, section 14(1)(d) will not apply to the sale of a property acquired for the principal purpose of a taxable activity of property development, where the principal purpose in respect of the property remains unchanged and the principal purpose continues to be the ultimate sale of the property. In those circumstances, the property would be used for the property development activity, although on a time and space basis 100 percent of the property may also have been used for the purpose of rental for residential accommodation. 35. This interpretation is consistent with the policy objective underlying section 14(1)(d), which is to ensure symmetry of treatment of properties acquired for the principal purpose of providing residential rental accommodation. An input tax credit would not be available on the purchase of such properties. The effect of section 14(1)(d) is that the sale of the properties is not subject to GST in circumstances where the sale of the properties would otherwise be regarded as a taxable supply (being a supply made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity). Section 14(1)(d) was not intended to exempt the sale of a property in respect of which the vendor had obtained an input tax credit. 36. The vendor must have used the property for residential rental purposes for not less than five years up to the date of the sale. It would not be sufficient that the property has been rented out for residential accommodation for a minimum of five years by different owners. However, section 14(1)(d) does not require that the property be occupied by the same tenant throughout the five-year period. Section 14(1)(d) refers to the use of the property by the person selling the property. 37. Section 14(1)(d)(i) could apply even if the property were vacant for periods during the five years while attempts are made to obtain a tenant for the property. In Schwerzerhof v Wilkins \[1898\] 1 QB 640 it was held that premises were used as a bakehouse, although actually vacant, during a period when the owner continued to make attempts to let out the property. That case concerned a provision that permitted an underground place to be used as a bakehouse if it was so used at the commencement of the relevant Act. The premises in question had long been used as a bakehouse, but were vacant at the commencement of the Act. The premises were vacant for a period of five months, during which time the premises were repaired. While the repair work was in progress the owner advertised the premises for lease. The new tenant began to use the premises as a bakehouse immediately and continued to do so. The court considered that the premises were used as a bakehouse at the commencement of the Act. Therefore, if the vendor has continued to be actively engaged in attempting to rent out a property for residential purposes, 9 the property will continue to be used for residential rental purposes for the purposes of section 14(1)(d). 10
\[This interpretation statement was issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel on 28 June 2007. It was previously released for public consultation as exposure draft IS0092.\] IS 07/02: IS AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AN “INVOICE” FOR GST PURPOSES? This interpretation statement applies to agreements for the sale and purchase of property entered into on or after 1 July 2007. This interpretation statement was originally released for consultation on 11 May 2005 under the title “Whether a Standard Form Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Real Estate Constitutes an “Invoice” under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 thus Triggering the Time of Supply under that Act”. As a result of comments received, the scope of the statement has been broadened from agreements for the sale and purchase of real estate to agreements for the sale and purchase of property more generally. As from 1 July 2007 this interpretation statement withdraws and replaces Part (a) of the Commissioner’s previous public item “GST—Time of Supply of Real Estate” published in Public Information Bulletin 173 (April 1988), p10. SUMMARY 1. This interpretation statement considers whether an agreement for the sale and purchase of property constitutes an “invoice” under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”) thus triggering the time of supply under that Act. 1 In doing so it considers three types of agreements for the sale and purchase of property: (i) conditional agreements; (ii) conditional agreements that become unconditional; and (iii) unconditional agreements. 2. It is concluded that a conditional agreement for sale and purchase of property will not constitute an “invoice” for the purposes of the Act. Also, it is concluded that a conditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property that becomes unconditional will not constitute an “invoice” for the purposes of the Act. Therefore, a conditional standard form agreement for sale and 1 The time of supply determines when a registered vendor is required to account for output tax on the sale of a property but (as recipients must also hold a tax invoice in respect of a supply in order to be entitled to an input tax credit: section 20(2)) the time of supply does not determine when a registered purchaser is entitled to an input tax credit on the purchase of a property. The time of supply is also relevant to determining whether the sale of a property could be zero-rated under section 11(1)(m) (as for section 11(1)(m) to apply the sale must be the supply of a taxable activity or part of a taxable activity that is a going concern at the time of supply). 1 purchase of property will not trigger the time of supply—even if the conditional agreement becomes unconditional. This conclusion is consistent with the Commissioner’s previous public item “GST—Time of Supply of Real Estate” published in Public Information Bulletin 173. 3. It is also concluded that unconditional agreements for the sale and purchase of property will not constitute “invoices” for the purposes of the Act. Therefore, the formation of an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property will not trigger the time of supply. This conclusion is different to the Commissioner’s previous public item “GST—Time of Supply of Real Estate” found in Public Information Bulletin 173. 4. While the Commissioner’s previous public item “GST—Time of Supply of Real Estate” only dealt with agreements for the sale and purchase of real estate, the principles and discussion within this interpretation statement will also apply to contracts more generally. Thus, the discussion in this statement should be considered when considering whether a document (including a contract) meets the statutory definition of “invoice” for the purposes of the time of supply rules under the Act. BACKGROUND 5. Inland Revenue has previously considered the issue of whether an agreement for the sale and purchase of real estate triggers the time of supply for GST purposes in Public Information Bulletin 173 under the title of “GST—Time of Supply of Real Estate” (April 1988). According to the previous statement in PIB 173, a conditional agreement for sale and purchase cannot be an invoice—either when it is executed or once the conditions are satisfied. However, the previous statement in PIB 173 did accept that an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase could constitute an “invoice” and could trigger the time of supply under section 9(1) of the Act. THE ISSUE 6. This interpretation statement considers whether the previous conclusions in respect of agreements for sale and purchase triggering the time of supply in the earlier PIB 173 are correct. Accordingly, it considers whether an agreement for the sale and purchase of property that is: (i) conditional on execution; (ii) conditional on execution, that later becomes unconditional; and (iii) unconditional on execution; can constitute an “invoice” and thus trigger the time of supply under section 9(1) of the Act. 2 LEGISLATION 7. Section 9(1) of the Act states: 9(1) Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. 8. Section 2 of the Act defines “invoice” as follows: 2(1) In this Act, other than in section 12, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... “Document” includes any electronic data, computer programmes, computer tapes, and computer discs: ... “Invoice” means a document notifying an obligation to make payment: .... APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION—THE COMMISSIONER’S INTERPRETATION Meaning of “invoice” 9. Section 9(1) of the Act states that “a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient... ” (emphasis added). 10. Under section 2(1) of the Act, “invoice” means “a document notifying an obligation to make payment”. 11. The earlier public statement in PIB 173 appears to have accepted that an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase of real estate could be an “invoice” based on what was thought to be a literal reading of the words of the definition. It appears that as an unconditional contract is not contingent on the completion of a condition and obliges the purchaser to make payment in accordance with its terms this was regarded as “notifying” the purchaser of their obligation to make payment. However, since the publication of PIB 173, the Commissioner has reconsidered this issue. To be an “invoice” an agreement for sale and purchase: • Must be a document that notifies an obligation to make payment; • In the context of section 9(1), must be issued. Notify 12. The term “notify” is not defined in the Act. In the absence of a statutory definition the meaning of a term will generally be determined in accordance with the ordinary meaning. “Notify” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as follows: 3 notify • v. (notifies, notified) inform, typically in a formal or official manner. ¾ report formally or officially. 13. The meaning of “notify” has been discussed in two Canadian cases. Lacombe JA said in Briere v Canada (Employment & Immigration Commission) (1988) 57 DLR (4th) 402 (CA): The word ‘notify’ means, in its everyday sense, “to inform expressly,” and in law: ... “to make known, to give notice, to inform”. 14. In Re Hornby (1993) 63 FTR 188 at 194 Cullan J said: The word ‘notify’ is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, seventh edition as: Make known, announce, report; inform, give notice to (person of, that)...which connotes, in my opinion, some sort of concrete action. 15. In Shell NZ Holding Co Ltd v CIR \[1994\] 3 NZLR 276 the Court of Appeal discussed the meaning of “notify” in the context of the definition of “invoice”. The Court of Appeal commented (p. 283): “Notify” has its ordinary dictionary meaning of “to give notice to -, to inform”. 16. Therefore, the term “notify” connotes information passing from one person to another and appears to require some deliberate action on the part of the person “notifying” – whether by formal or official communication or merely “some sort of concrete action”. Obligation 17. “Obligation” is also not defined in the Act. The Concise Oxford Dictionary definition of “obligation” reads as follows: obligation • n. 1 an act or course of action to which a person is morally or legally bound. ¾ the condition of being so bound. 2 a debt of gratitude for a service or favour. 18. The ordinary meaning of “obligation” refers to a situation where a person is legally or morally bound. The case law on the meaning of “obligation” indicates that for there to be an obligation, there must be a present obligation. 19. In Watkinson v Hollington \[1943\] 2 All ER 573 Scott LJ stated: The word “obligation” primarily means a tie, and legally it was in origin the binding tie established by what is called a “bond” as between the obligor and the obligee, and I see no reason for disregarding that ordinary legal meaning of the word “obligation” in construing the long title. (p. 575) 20. Thus, the court considered that the word “obligation” referred to a situation involving a “binding tie”. In order for the “tie” to be “binding”, it is considered that there would need to be a present obligation. 4 21. In Mercer v Pearson (1973-1978) 51 TC 213 Fox J considered that “obligation” in the context of a provision which limited concessionary tax treatment for redundancy payments to payments “made in pursuance of an obligation incurred before 6 th April 1960” meant a legally binding obligation. Fox J held: It seems to me that the normal meaning of ‘obligation’ in a legal context is a legally binding obligation, not necessarily contractual–it could be statutory–but it must be some tie or obligation which is legally enforceable. (p. 217) 22. The Commissioner considers that in the context of the definition of “invoice” an obligation means a present legal obligation. In the High Court in Shell NZ Holding Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,136 Heron J said: Invoice is defined as “a document notifying an obligation to make payment”. There is no immediate obligation to make payment on the passing of the entry in the circumstances of this case. The Act does not speak in terms of future obligation or conditional obligation or contingent obligation. It speaks of obligation. It is an obligation to make payment. 23. While the taxpayer’s appeal was successful the observations of Heron J regarding the meaning of the term “obligation” remain relevant. An “obligation”, then, means a present legally binding tie to make payment. Future, conditional or contingent obligations to make payment will not suffice. 24. A present or existing obligation to make payment for the goods or services is to be distinguished from a credit facility granted by the supplier of the goods or services which allows the necessary payment to be made at any time up until the date specified in a statement issued by the supplier e.g. on the 20 th day of the following month. The obligation to make the payment for the goods and services would have arisen on the day the goods were handed over or the services were performed and, from that date, the supplier would have been legally entitled to payment and could have sued for its payment if necessary e.g. if bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings were instigated against the recipient before the date specified in the statement. Thus, in cases where credit facilities have been granted, the distinction needs to be drawn between the conditions that concern the creation of the liability (i.e. the goods being handed over or the services performed) and the conditions that merely affect the discharge of the liability. At the time the monthly statement is issued, the liability would already have been created and so the statement would constitute a document notifying an obligation to make payment i.e. it would constitute an “invoice”. How an invoice is issued 25. The Concise Oxford Dictionary definition of the verb “issue” is as follows:: issue • v. (issues, issued, issuing) 1 supply or distribute for use or sale. ¾ (issue someone with) supply someone with. ¾ formally send out or make known. 26. As with the ordinary meaning of “notify”, the ordinary meaning of “issued” connotes a situation involving two parties, one of whom issues something which is received by the other. The term “issue” also seems to require a positive deliberate act on the part of the person who has “issued” the item in question. 5 27. In Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Woolfold Motor Co Ltd (1983) 1 BVC 564 the meaning of “issue” in the context of the UK VAT rules was considered. The primary rules regarding time of supply under the VAT rules in the Finance Act 1972 relates to when the goods are removed. However, there is a general exception to those rules that if a tax invoice is issued prior to that time, then the time of supply is “at the time the invoice is issued”. After considering the dictionary meanings of the term “issued”, McNeill J summarised counsels’ arguments and concluded as follows: Both counsel argued that the ordinary and natural meaning of the words ‘issue a tax invoice’ supported the conclusion for which they respectively contended. Mr. Shirley \[counsel for the taxpayer\] did not suggest that mere communication of the fact or existence of a tax invoice was sufficient, but he said communication plus acceptance was. That was truly publication or emission of the tax invoice. Mr. Brown \[counsel of the Commissioners\] submitted that such a contention emphasised the artificial construction Mr. Shirley was seeking to put on the word ‘issue’. Having considered the submissions on both sides and having regard to the careful decision of the tribunal, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Brown’s submissions are correct. In my view the ‘issue’ of a tax invoice for the purposes of the Act requires the provision to the customer of the tax invoice. (p. 569) 28. These comments reinforce the dictionary definition of “issued”. It is acknowledged that under the UK legislation, the issue of a “tax invoice” rather than an ordinary invoice is required to trigger the time of supply. As a tax invoice also had to be held by the purchaser under the UK legislation in order to support an input tax credit claim, McNeill J concluded that the scheme of the Act required the tax invoice to be actually provided to the purchaser in order for it to trigger the time of supply by being “issued”. However, given that to be an “invoice” under the New Zealand legislation, there must be a document “notifying” an obligation to make payment, the New Zealand legislation also contemplates that when an invoice is issued, a document would be provided by one person to another. 29. Therefore, the statutory definition of “invoice” refers to a document which is provided by one person to another and gives notice to or informs the recipient of the document of an existing legal obligation to make payment. This appears to be consistent with the ordinary meaning of “invoice”. Ordinary meaning of “invoice” 30. The term “invoice” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999) as follows: invoice • n. a list of goods sent or services provided, with a statement of the sum due. 31. This same meaning is also reflected in definitions from commercial and legal dictionaries. The Penguin Macquarie Dictionary of Economics and Finance (Penguin Books Australia, Ringwood, Victoria. 1988) states: invoice A bill for goods or services provided. It is sent by a creditor to a debtor, as the document against which payment of the debt will be made. 6 32. Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (5 th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2002) states: invoice A list of goods that have been sold by one person to another, stating the particulars and prices. The invoice is sent by the seller to the buyer, either along with the goods or separately by post. 33. These definitions indicate that: • an “invoice” is a record of a past transaction where goods and services have been provided; • an invoice lists the goods and services provided and the price for those services; and • ordinarily, an invoice will be provided by the seller to the purchaser. 34. The Commissioner considers that the statutory definition of “invoice” in the context of section 9(1) is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “invoice”. Generally an invoice: • will not be issued until the transaction has occurred; • will be issued as the result of a positive act by the vendor to the purchaser; • will be a document listing what has been provided and stating the price payable; and • will give notice of a present obligation to make payment. 35. This approach is consistent with the approach of the Court of Appeal in Shell. Shell concerned whether an “import entry form” completed by the Customs Department on the importation of goods was an invoice for the purposes of triggering the time of supply. The Court concluded that the import entry form was an invoice and did trigger the time of supply. In commenting on the meaning of “invoice” Richardson J, for the Court, stated (at page 283): Invoices are rendered in commercial transactions where goods are supplied or work is done by one party for another. Invoices record what was done and the charge. It may be a cash or credit transaction and in the latter case it is common for a monthly or other periodic statement to be issued subsequently. Whether payable on delivery or under the credit arrangement the invoice states the price or charge involved. And it is both unnecessary and uncommon in practice for commercial invoices to specify the time for payment. In our view the GST obligation is in the same position. The statutory definition of “invoice” recognises that it is not a commercial two party transaction. It uses the central feature of an invoice which is “a document notifying an obligation to make payment”. The time for payment is not part of the definition. “Notify” has its ordinary dictionary meaning of “to give notice to -, to inform”. Certainly when completed by the Customs officer it is the Customs’ document and a copy is furnished to the importer. It is the signing of the document by the Customs officer which under the statute is the entry of the goods. It is that act which constitutes the duty as a debt due to the Crown. At that point the document is notice to the importer of the obligation to make payment. On its face it states the Total Duty, Total GST and Total Payable. 7 36. Given the Court’s conclusion that the import entry form was an “invoice” for GST purposes, the deferred payment statement (issued in cases where the Collector of Customs had exercised his discretion to allow payment of duty to be deferred) could not be an “invoice”. A supply involves only one taxable event and the same goods and services cannot be supplied twice. Only one document can be the “invoice” which triggers the time of supply. 37. Despite “invoice” being defined in section 2 of the Act, Richardson J commences his comments by considering the ordinary meaning of the word “invoice”. The reason for considering the ordinary meaning of the word “invoice” is that he considers the words of the definition of “invoice” to be consistent with its ordinary meaning. 38. Richardson J notes the role that invoices generally play in commercial transactions. When there has been a supply of goods or services, an invoice is created detailing “what was done” and “the charge” for that supply. He states that the definition of “invoice” in the Act recognises that it “is not a commercial two party transaction”. He also says that an “invoice” does not require a due date for payment: “it is both unnecessary and uncommon in practice for commercial invoices to specify the time for payment.” 39. Richardson J reads the statutory definition in light of the ordinary meaning. He says that the statutory definition reflects the “central feature” of an invoice which is “a document notifying an obligation to make payment”. With regard to the statutory definition four points are noted. 40. Firstly, Richardson J readily accepted that the word “notify” should bear its ordinary meaning:—being “to give notice to, to inform”. This ordinary meaning of “notify” implies that the notice moves from the person giving notice to the person receiving notice. This is consistent with the idea of an invoice being sent by the seller to the purchaser. 41. Secondly, although there was no direct comment on the words “obligation to make payment” in the Court of Appeal judgment, the Court’s focus upon the ordinary meaning of an “invoice” would indicate that the “obligation” that is to be paid must be an existing obligation or an obligation that has arisen and is due for payment. This contrasts with an obligation that will or may arise in the future. As Richardson J stated: “\[i\]nvoices record what was done and the charge”. This point is consistent with the dictionary definitions which illustrate that commonly an invoice lists what has been provided or sent—not what has been agreed or what will be provided or sent—and requires payment for the supplier completing their part of the agreement. This can be contrasted with a contract that is entered into by the parties—a contract creates rather than notifies the obligation to make payment. A contract records an agreement—it evidences the parties’ meeting of minds. 42. Thirdly, to be an “invoice” there need only be a “document notifying an obligation to make payment”—the document is not required additionally to specify a due date for payment. Richardson J stated that “\[t\]he time for payment is not part of the \[statutory\] definition” and noted that “it is both 8 unnecessary and uncommon in practice for commercial invoices to specify the time for payment.” 43. Fourthly, Richardson J’s interpretation of “invoice” is also consistent with the requirement of section 9 that the invoice must be “issued”. The fact that an invoice must be “issued” from one party to another is consistent with the idea that an invoice “notifies” the purchaser/recipient of their “obligation to make payment”. It is the issuing of the invoice which triggers the time of supply. A contract, in contrast, is entered into by both parties and records their agreement. It does not follow that a contract is issued by one party to the other. 44. In summary, Richardson J confirms that the statutory definition of “invoice” is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “invoice” and should be read in that light. The inference from Richardson J’s judgment is that an “invoice” is a document issued by one party that has supplied goods or services to another party and is requesting payment for the goods or services supplied from that other party. A number of key findings in relation to the meaning of the term “invoice” as it occurs in section 9 of the Act can be identified. It is considered that the case is authority for the following propositions: • While the word “invoice” is defined in section 2 of the Act, the definition is to be interpreted consistently with the ordinary meaning of the term as it is generally understood in commercial parlance. • An “invoice” is a post-transaction record—“it records what was done and the charge for the work” or goods supplied and notifies the recipient of the supply that payment is now due in respect of the work carried out or the goods supplied. In contrast, a contract creates the obligations between the parties. • An “invoice” is not a two party transaction. It is ordinarily issued by the supplier to the recipient. In contrast, a contract is entered into by two parties—it records the meeting of minds. • The ordinary meaning of the term “notify” implies a positive act in which notice moves from one person to another. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of an invoice being “issued”. In contrast, a contract creates and evidences an agreement rather than notifying the parties’ obligations and being issued from one party to another. • An obligation to make payment has to be a present legal liability. Thus, an invoice will notify a present obligation to make payment. This is to be contrasted with a contract which creates the obligation, but it is not necessarily a present obligation. • An invoice need not provide a due date for payment, it need only notify that there is an obligation to make payment and be issued. 45. It is noted that Alastair McKenzie in his book GST: A Practical Guide (7ed, CCH, Auckland, 2002, paragraph 403) makes reference to the earlier approach in the PIB item as representing the Commissioner’s view, but seems to prefer a “contrary approach”. A number of the points McKenzie makes in support of the “contrary approach” are consistent with the principles set out above. 9 Other case law 46. Other cases have also commented on the meaning of “invoice” and/or observed that an agreement for sale and purchase of property, whether in conditional or unconditional form, could be an invoice for the purposes of the Act. These cases are: • In Case K24 (1988) 10 NZTC 236, Judge Barber makes the obiter comment that an agreement for sale and purchase may be an “invoice” (p 238). Judge Barber also recognised that he did not hear argument on the issue (p 238). • In Case N1 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,001, Judge Bathgate considered that contracts, whether conditional or not, could be “invoices” as they notified (informed) the purchaser of their obligation to pay (p 3,011). However, with respect, Judge Bathgate’s comments must be read in light of the subsequent Court of Appeal decision in Shell where a number of his propositions were rejected. Judge Bathgate also specifically states that these points were not subject to detailed argument and should be read in that light (p 3,012). • In Shell NZ Holding Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,136 (HC), Heron J noted that the parties accepted that an agreement would be an invoice (p 10,140), although this point does not appear to have been in dispute between the parties. • In Lanauze v King (2001) 20 NZTC 17,360 (HC), Young J had to determine the time of supply in the context of a swap of paua quota for a house and contents. It was held that an “approved form of transfer and notification of transfer of individual transferable quota or transferable term quota” was not an invoice. In the course of the judgment, Young J considered that the transfer form was not an “invoice” in the “traditional commercial sense of a notification by the supplier of goods and services to the recipient of the amount which is due” (following Shell) and nor was it akin to an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase of property, which he considered was an “invoice” on the basis of the decision in Case K24 (p 17,363). However, Young J accepted that an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase of property is an invoice without any analysis or specific reference to any particular paragraph or quote from Case K24. 47. While these cases make reference to unconditional or conditional contracts being “invoices” for the purposes of the Act, none of these cases considered or analysed the issue in any detail and none of these cases are more authoritative than the Court of Appeal decision in Shell. The Commissioner was not a party to Lanauze v King where the High Court referred to Case K24 as authority for the proposition that an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase is an invoice. In Case K24 Judge Barber suggested that in some instances an agreement for sale and purchase might be an invoice, however, there was no analysis supporting that proposition. The decision in Case N1 and the decision in Shell at the High Court must be regarded as being superseded by the Shell 10 Court of Appeal decision. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal decision in Shell remains the leading judgment on the interpretation of “invoice”. Form of agreement for the sale and purchase of property 48. Obviously, the parties to a sale and purchase of property transaction can choose to document it in a variety of ways. The Auckland District Law Society / Real Estate Institute of New Zealand form of agreement for sale and purchase tends to be used in a significant number of cases. This is a word processed or printed document which comprises a number of pages. The matters particular to a specific transaction are generally handwritten or typewritten onto the standard form. In draft form, it may record an offer or counter-offer, but in its final form it records the agreement ultimately reached between a vendor and purchaser of real estate. Generally, this document will be signed on one day and the settlement of the contract will be at a time in the future. Applying the previous discussion of what is an “invoice” to agreements for sale and purchase of property in relation to the three fact situations leads to the following results. An unconditional agreement for sale and purchase 49. While an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property document creates the legal obligations between the parties, the issue is whether an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase can constitute an “invoice” from the time of execution and thus trigger the time of supply under section 9(1) of the Act. With regard to the propositions based on the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the legislation and identified in Shell, the following points are noted. 50. Firstly, an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property is a contract. It is an agreement signed by a purchaser and a vendor. It sets out the terms and conditions of the agreement, what will be supplied and the purchase price. An agreement for the sale and purchase of property does not have the characteristics of an invoice. It does not on its face state what has been supplied and the actual amount that the purchaser is required to pay. That function is fulfilled by the settlement statement which includes the adjustments (apportionments of incomings and outgoings in respect of the property) which affect the final amount payable by the purchaser under the agreement. 51. Secondly, an invoice is a demand or request for payment. An agreement for sale and purchase is not a demand or request for payment. It is a document which evidences an agreement between the parties and creates rights and obligations on the part of both parties. Such obligations are interdependent. The agreement documents a transaction that will be completed in the future. The agreement will generally provide, for example, that at settlement date, the property will be provided and the purchase price will be payable. It is not a demand or request for payment issued by one party to another. 52. Thirdly, an invoice is not a “two party transaction”. The ordinary meaning of the term invoice (as noted by the Court of Appeal in Shell) indicates that one would ordinarily see an invoice completed by one party to the transaction (the 11 supplier) and provided to the recipient with, or following, the supply of goods or the completion of the contracted work giving notice that payment was now due. An unconditional agreement for sale and purchase of property is a two party transaction—it is a contract that records the parties’ “meeting of minds”. Some commentators have suggested that the import entry form considered in Shell was, in fact, a “two-party document” as import entry forms were required to be prepared by the importer. The Commissioner’s view is that the Court considered that the import entry form was a document that was issued by the Customs Department rather than a two-party document. It was irrelevant that the information on the import entry form was completed by the importer as the Customs officer was not obliged to act on that information and could make a different assessment of the value of goods for the purpose of the assessment of duty: see p. 11,168. The provision of a copy of the import entry form signed by the Customs officer to the importer constituted notification of an obligation to make payment of the duty assessed. 53. Fourthly, the ordinary meaning of the term “notify” implies a positive act in which notice moves from one person to another. This is also consistent with the ordinary meaning of an invoice being “issued”. The fact that two parties sign the unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property raises difficulties with that document “notifying” a present obligation to pay and actually being “issued”. As an agreement for sale and purchase ultimately reflects an agreement reached between two parties, it will not always be the case that the vendor provides the final version that is accepted by the purchaser. There may be further counter-offers by both parties. It may be that it is the purchaser’s offer that is accepted by the vendor. As such, there may not be any positive act of issuing a document by the vendor to the purchaser notifying an obligation to make payment. 54. Finally, there must be an existing obligation to make payment of a present legal liability. This is consistent with an invoice seeking payment from the recipient as the supplier is entitled to do from the terms of the original obligation. Admittedly, from the terms of an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of real property, it is possible that there could be a present and legal obligation to make payment although the obligation may not in fact arise until settlement occurs. In situations where a present obligation to make payment exists, this would result from the unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property creating the bargain and the obligation. However, merely having this element is not considered to satisfy the general characteristics of an invoice. 55. Accordingly, it is considered that an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase of property would not conform to these requirements to constitute an invoice. For there to be an “invoice” for GST purposes, there must be a document issued which notifies an obligation to make payment. These are cumulative requirements and must be read in light of the ordinary understanding of an invoice. The fact that a document may appear to satisfy one of the requirements does not mean that it will constitute an invoice as the whole of the statutory definition (read in light of the ordinary meaning) needs to be satisfied. An agreement for the sale and purchase of property does not come within the 12 expression “document notifying an obligation to make payment” considered as a whole. Even if an agreement is formed by the vendor’s acceptance of the purchaser’s offer and that acceptance is communicated by the vendor providing a copy of the agreement to the purchaser, an agreement for sale and purchase is not a document that is issued by the vendor and it does not perform and is not intended to perform the function of notifying the purchaser of an obligation to make payment. The formation of an agreement for the sale and purchase of property results in obligations on the part of both parties. These obligations are interdependent. An agreement for sale and purchase does not on its face state the exact amount that the purchaser is required to pay. It does not contain the adjustments affecting the final amount which the purchaser is required to pay under the agreement. 56. While this statement considers agreements for sale and purchase of property, the principles stated here will generally apply when considering whether other contracts and other “documents” may meet the statutory definition of “invoice”. A conditional agreement for sale and purchase of property 57. For similar reasons discussed in relation to an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property (paragraphs 49 to 56), a conditional agreement for sale and purchase cannot be an invoice. As it is a conditional contract it is an agreement for a supply that may not even proceed, due to the agreement being conditional on the fulfilment or waiver of its conditions. Further, a conditional agreement for sale and purchase is a document evidencing a contractual agreement between two parties, stating that a sale and supply may take place if the conditions are satisfied. It cannot be a demand or request for payment as it is not clear whether the transaction will proceed. There is no list of goods supplied and a price to pay. Therefore it cannot notify a present legal obligation to make payment. The nature of a conditional agreement for sale and purchase is also that it is a two party transaction. It is the document in which two parties record their agreement. Being an agreement, it is likely to reflect negotiations between the parties. As such, it will not necessarily be a notice provided by the supplier to the recipient, or issued, either. A conditional agreement for sale and purchase of property that becomes unconditional 58. If a conditional agreement for sale and purchase becomes unconditional, this also cannot be an “invoice”. This is for similar reasons discussed in relation to unconditional and conditional agreements for the sale and purchase of property (paragraphs 49 to 57). A conditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property that goes unconditional cannot be a demand or request for payment. Once the conditions are satisfied there may be a present and legal obligation to make payment. However, that obligation does not arise from the execution of the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement for sale and purchase, the agreement was conditional. It is only through the subsequent satisfaction of the conditions and the notification of that fact that the price for the supply becomes payable. Therefore, the agreement did not notify a present and legal obligation to make payment—it was the subsequent notification (due to satisfying the 13 conditions) in conjunction with the agreement for sale and purchase that brought the obligation into effect. 59. Moreover, a conditional agreement that becomes unconditional is not issued; it would already be in the possession of the parties when it goes unconditional. If the contract was conditional on one party completing a condition of the contract then a question might arise as to whether the notice to the other party that the condition is satisfied might constitute an “invoice”. In determining whether such a notice is an “invoice” one should consider the principles discussed earlier. What if no other invoice is issued? 60. It is noted that an agreement for the sale and purchase of property may not always be followed with an “invoice”, though it may be. In determining whether a document is an “invoice” one should consider the principles discussed earlier. 61. Nonetheless, even if there is no other document which could be regarded as an “invoice”, this fact does not lead to or support the conclusion that an unconditional, conditional, or conditional that goes unconditional, agreement for the sale and purchase of property must be an invoice. The absence of an invoice on any particular supply does not mean that the Act ceases to function. As stated in section 9 of the Act, the time of supply will be triggered “at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or at the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply”. Thus, if there is no invoice, the Act directs one to consider “the \[first\] time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply” as triggering the time of supply. This point is consistent with the earlier PIB 173 statement. 62. It is noted that in the case of an unconditional agreement, a deposit will often be paid to the vendor when the agreement is signed. If this is done, the time of supply will generally be triggered at that time irrespective of whether an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property is an invoice. General application to contracts 63. The principles stated in this interpretation statement are generally also applicable when considering whether other contracts and other “documents” meet the statutory definition of “invoice” the purposes of the Act. Generally, a contract does not perform and is not intended to perform the function of notifying the purchaser of an obligation to make payment. CONCLUSION 64. The statutory definition of “invoice” is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “invoice” and should be read in that light. An “invoice” is a document issued by one party to another party setting out the details of the goods and services supplied and noting the payment due. This is supported by the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Shell. Therefore, for an “invoice” to trigger the time of 14 supply, there must be an invoice, in the ordinary sense of the word, that notifies the purchaser of the obligation to make payment. 65. It is considered that an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of property will not constitute an “invoice” as it will not satisfy the definition in the Act, which is to be read consistently with the ordinary meaning of “invoice”. Similarly, a standard form agreement for sale and purchase of property that is conditional on execution, or is conditional on execution that later goes unconditional, will also not constitute an invoice. 66. The conclusion that a conditional agreement and a conditional standard form agreement that goes unconditional, for the sale and purchase of property are not “invoices” is consistent with the earlier public statement in PIB 173. The conclusion with regard to the unconditional agreement is inconsistent with earlier public statement. 67. The principles stated in this interpretation statement will generally also be applicable when considering whether other contracts and “documents” may meet the statutory definition of “invoice”. The Commissioner considers that a contract would not meet the statutory definition of an “invoice”. 15
Interpretation Statement: IS 08/01 GST – ROLE OF SECTION 5(14) OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT 1985 IN REGARD TO THE ZERO-RATING OF PART OF A SUPPLY Summary 1. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. 2. This statement sets out the Commissioner’s view of the interpretation of section 5(14). It concludes that section 5(14) does not operate by itself to create standard- and zero-rated supplies, but rather is applied after it has been determined that: • there is “a supply” that is charged with goods and services tax (GST) at the standard rate under section 8; and • the applicable provision in section 11, 11A, 11AB, or 11B (“the zero-rating provisions”) requires that part of a supply be charged with GST at the rate of zero percent. 3. Section 5(14) is applied with the result that the zero-rated part is to be treated as being a separate supply for the purposes of the Act. 4. This statement considers only the interpretation of section 5(14). It does not consider the principles of apportionment that have been developed by the courts. These principles are used to determine whether a “package” of goods and/or services is a single supply, or consists of two or more supplies, for the purposes of the Act: see, for example, Auckland Institute of Studies v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC); CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140 (HC). Background 5. The Commissioner is aware confusion exists about the correct interpretation of section 5(14). Section 5(14) provides: If a supply is charged with tax under section 8, but section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of the supply to be charged at the rate of 0%, that part of the supply is treated as being a separate supply. 6. There are two competing views of the role of section 5(14). • Section 5(14) applies after part of a supply has been zero-rated under the zero-rating provisions, and requires that the zero-rated part of a supply be treated as a separate supply. • Section 5(14) operates by itself to divide a supply into its standard-rated and zero-rated parts, and requires that these parts be treated as separate supplies. These separate supplies are then zero-rated under the zero-rating provisions. 2 7. The competing views affect when section 5(14) is applied and the availability of zero-rating. Under the first view, section 5(14) applies only if the relevant zero- rating provision requires part of the supply to be zero-rated. If the relevant zero-rating provision does not, section 5(14) cannot apply and the whole supply must be charged with GST at the standard-rate. 8. Under the second view, section 5(14) would apply even if the relevant zero- rating provision does not by itself require part of the supply to be zero-rated. Section 5(14) would enable the zero-rated parts of the supply to be isolated and then treated as separate supplies under the Act. The zero-rating provisions would then be applied to zero-rate these supplies. Legislation 9. Sections 5(1) and 5(14) provide: 5 Meaning of the term supply (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term supply includes all forms of supply. ... (14) If a supply is charged with tax under section 8, but section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of the supply to be charged at the rate of 0%, that part of the supply is treated as being a separate supply. 10. Before it was amended in 2000 and 2003, section 5(14) provided: For the purposes of this Act, where a supply is charged with tax in part under section 8 of this Act and in part under section 11 of this Act, each part shall be deemed to be a separate supply. 11. Section 8(1) provides: 8 Imposition of goods and services tax on supply (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 12. Sections 11, 11A, 11AB and 11B list the circumstances in which taxable supplies of goods and services must be charged with GST at the rate of zero percent. The zero-rating provisions provide that a “supply” must be zero-rated, but it is possible that only part of a supply must be zero-rated. It is a matter of statutory interpretation whether the relevant zero-rating provision provides for part of a supply to be zero-rated. It is noted that some of the zero-rating provisions expressly indicate that part of a supply can be zero-rated by using the words “to the extent that”. These provisions are set out below. 3 11A Zero-rating of services (1) A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ... (b) the services are the transport of passengers from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand to the extent that the transport is by aircraft, as defined in section 2 of the Civil Aviation Act 1990, and is international carriage for the purpose of that Act; or ... (c) the services, including ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading and handling, are the transport of goods from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand to the extent that the services are supplied by the same supplier as part of the supply of services to which paragraph (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) applies; or ... (ma) the services relate to goods under warranty to the extent that the services are— (i) provided under the warranty; and (ii) supplied for consideration that is given by a warrantor who is a non- resident, not a registered person and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; and (iii) in respect of goods that were subject to tax under section 12(1); or ... (o) the services are the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from pursuing or exercising in whole or in part rights listed in paragraph (n) to the extent that the rights are for use outside New Zealand; or ... 11B Zero-rating of some supplies by territorial authorities, some supplies involving contributions to local authorities ... (1B) If a supply under section 5(7B) of goods and services by a local authority to a registered person is chargeable with tax under section 8, the supply must be charged at the rate of 0% to the extent that the contribution made by the registered person to the local authority consists of land. Analysis Ordinary meaning of the words 13. Section 5(14) provides: If a supply is charged with tax under section 8, but section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of the supply to be charged at the rate of 0%, that part of the supply is treated as being a separate supply. 4 14. The ordinary meaning of some of the words of section 5(14) appear to be clear. The words “\[i\]f a supply is charged with tax under section 8” indicates that section 8 has been applied and a supply has been identified that is charged with GST at the standard rate. 15. The words “that part of the supply is treated as being a separate supply” state the result of section 5(14) being applied: the zero-rated part of the supply is deemed to be a separate supply for the purposes of the Act. 16. The meaning of the words “but section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of the supply to be charged at the rate of 0%” is less clear. 17. The words “to be charged”, being in the future tense, can be read as indicating that the zero-rating provisions have not yet been applied. According to this interpretation, section 5(14) is referred to after it has been found that there is a supply charged with GST at the standard rate under section 8 and before the zero-rating provisions are applied. Section 5(14) refers the person applying the Act to determine whether any part of the supply comes within any of the zero- rating provisions. If there is such a part, section 5(14) is applied to deem that part to be a separate supply and the zero-rating provisions are then applied to zero-rate this new supply. 18. However, this interpretation appears inconsistent with the words “section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of the supply” (emphasis added) to be zero- rated. These words suggest that whether part of a supply must be zero-rated is governed by the zero-rating provisions alone without reference to section 5(14). When section 5(14) is read as a whole these words qualify the words “to be charged”: the zero-rating provisions have been applied to zero-rate part of the supply, but that part has not been treated as a separate zero-rated supply for the purposes of the Act. 19. According to this interpretation, section 5(14) is referred to after both section 8 and the zero-rating provisions have been applied. Section 5(14) is applied only if the applicable zero-rating provision requires that part of the supply be zero- rated. Section 5(14) then gives effect to the zero-rating of part of the supply required under the applicable zero-rating provision by deeming the zero-rated part to be a separate supply. 20. This analysis of the ordinary meaning of section 5(14) indicates that the words “but section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of the supply to be charged at the rate of 0%” can be interpreted to support two competing views of section 5(14). However, the ordinary meaning of the words seems to be that section 5(14) gives effect to the zero-rating of part of a supply required under the zero-rating provisions, rather than the view that section 5(14) operates by itself to create standard- and zero-rated supplies. Scheme of the Act 21. Section 8(1) is the core provision by which GST at the standard rate is imposed on supplies of goods and services in New Zealand that have been made by a 5 registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. 22. Section 5(1) defines “supply” for the purposes of the Act, and the rest of section 5 details particular circumstances that give rise to supplies. 23. Section 8 is subject to the zero-rating provisions, which list the circumstances in which taxable supplies of goods and services must be charged with GST at the rate of zero percent. 24. The view that section 5(14) operates by itself to create standard- and zero-rated supplies is arguably consistent with the role of section 5 in defining the “supply” for the purposes of the Act. According to this view, section 5(14) isolates the zero-rated parts of a supply, and then requires these parts to be treated as separate supplies for the purposes of the Act. Under this interpretation, section 5(14) would assist in defining the “supply” for the purposes of the Act. 25. However, interpreting section 5(14) as giving effect to zero-rating of part of a supply required under the zero-rating provisions is also arguably consistent with the scheme of the Act. According to this interpretation, it would be first determined whether the supply is charged with GST at the standard rate under section 8. If section 8 applies, it would then be determined whether the supply must be zero-rated under the zero-rating provisions. It seems logical for the zero-rating provisions to be applied after section 8 has been applied, because they negate the effect of the tax liability established under section 8. Section 5(14) is then applied only if part of the supply has been zero-rated under the zero-rating provisions. 26. On this basis, section 5(14) has the role of clarifying the status of any zero-rated part of a supply. The Act refers to “a supply” or “the supply” throughout, in particular when defining “input tax”, “output tax”, and “taxable supply”. Without section 5(14) deeming the zero-rated part to be “a supply”, it could be unclear whether the zero-rated part must be taken into account in calculating “input tax”, “output tax”, and a “taxable supply”. 27. This purpose is also consistent with the fact that section 5 defines the term “supply” for the purposes of the Act. On this basis, section 5(14) would define what “a supply” is, where “part of a supply” has been zero-rated under the zero- rating provisions, by deeming the zero-rated part of a supply to be a separate supply. Case law 28. No case law exists on the current wording of section 5(14). There is case law on section 5(14) as it was enacted before its 2000 amendment (“the earlier section 5(14)”). 29. The earlier section 5(14) provided: For the purposes of this Act, where a supply is charged with tax in part under section 8 of this Act and in part under section 11 of this Act, each part shall be deemed to be a separate supply. 6 30. The earlier section 5(14) was repealed and substituted by the current section 5(14) by section 86(9) of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 with application on and after 10 October 2000. The current section 5(14) was amended by section 153 of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 by inserting “11AB”. 31. The amendments under the 2000 and 2003 Acts reflected that new zero-rating provisions (ie, sections 11A, 11AB and 11B) had been inserted into the Act. The earlier section 5(14) referred to “where a supply is charged with tax in part under section 8 of this Act and in part under section 11”. The 2000 amendment replaced this with “\[i\]f a supply is charged with tax under section 8, but section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of the supply to be charged at the rate of 0%”. This change may reflect that the wording of the earlier section 5(14) was incorrect insofar as it suggested that section 11 “charged \[part of a supply\] with tax”. The reference in the current section 5(14) to the zero-rating provisions requiring part of the supply “to be charged at the rate of 0%” more accurately describes the effect of these provisions. 32. Despite the different wording, there are clear similarities between the wording of the earlier section 5(14) and the current section 5(14). Therefore, the case law on the earlier section 5(14) may be relevant to interpreting the current section 5(14). 33. The earlier section 5(14) was referred to by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 (at pages 12,195–12,196) and the Taxation Review Authority in Case S27 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,189. However, in these judgments, the earlier section 5(14) was not material to the decision and was only restated without further analysis. 34. The High Court decision in Coveney v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328 contains the most extensive discussion of the earlier section 5(14). In this decision the Commissioner submitted that the Act expressly contemplates apportionment when there has been a composite supply of second-hand goods. In his submissions, the Commissioner relied on, amongst other provisions of the Act, sections 10(18) and 5(14) read together. 35. Fraser J rejected the Commissioner’s submissions concerning sections 5(14) and 10(18). His Honour recognised that sections 5(14) and 10(18) both dealt expressly with taxable supplies and that apportionment of one sort or another was clearly contemplated, but held (at pages 11,334–11,335): Sections 5(14) and 10(18) are applicable to particular circumstances and I do not agree that they provide a basis for determining that in other circumstances to which the sections do not apply, and for which a separate regime is prescribed, the Commissioner is required or permitted to apportion the supply into separate component parts and to deal with them as if they were separate supplies. 36. It is considered that Fraser’s J comment that section 5(14) clearly contemplates apportionment casts little light on its interpretation, as it does not indicate whether the authority to apportion derives from section 5(14) or from section 11 (as then enacted). Earlier in the judgment, Fraser J stated “\[b\]y s5(14) where a 7 supply is charged with tax in part under s8 and in part under s11, each part is deemed to be a separate supply” (at page 11,334). This comment also does not assist in interpreting the current section 5(14) because it merely restates the earlier section 5(14) without further analysis. 37. Elsewhere in the judgment, Fraser J stated (at page 11,335): I think that C of IR v Smiths City Group Ltd is to be distinguished from the present case. The Court there was dealing with a taxable supply, partly taxed under s8 and partly under s11. Apportionment was seen as appropriate on the basis of s 10(18). Section 5(14) provides that where a supply is charged with tax in part under s8 and in part under s11, each part is deemed to be a separate supply. 38. This comment could be read as suggesting that CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140 is relevant to interpreting section 5(14). However, section 5(14) was not mentioned in Smiths City Group. This supports the view that Fraser J did not intend his reference to section 5(14) to be considered relevant to his reasons for distinguishing the Smiths City Group decision. Smiths City Group and section 5(14) appear to have been mentioned in the same paragraph because both section 10(18) (which Smiths City Group did consider) and section 5(14) were mentioned together in the Commissioner’s submissions. 39. In the Taxation Review Authority decision in Case Q46 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,227, Barber DJ stated (at page 5,233): I also note that s 5(14) reads: For the purposes of this Act, where a supply is charged with tax in part under section 8 of this Act and is \[sic\] part under section 11 of this Act, each such part shall be deemed to be a separate supply. This enables apportionment or separate valuation of each supply. 40. The above comment could be interpreted as supporting both the view that section 5(14) operates by itself to create standard- and zero-rated supplies and the view that section 5(14) gives effect to zero-rating of part of a supply as required under the zero-rating provisions. 41. If the former interpretation of the comment is correct, Case Q46 is arguably of little persuasive weight. Barber DJ did not provide reasons for the comment. The comment is moreover obiter, because Barber DJ did not use section 5(14) to create standard- and zero-rated supplies. His Honour referred to the earlier section 5(14) only in order to demonstrate that the Act contemplated apportionment. Conclusion 42. The Commissioner’s view of the interpretation of section 5(14) is that it applies after it has been determined that: • there is “a supply” that is charged with GST at the standard rate under section 8; and 8 • the applicable zero-rating provision requires that part of a supply be charged with GST at the rate of zero percent. 43. Section 5(14) is then applied with the result that the zero-rated part is to be treated as being a separate supply for the purposes of the Act. 44. The Commissioner acknowledges that the view that section 5(14) operates by itself to create standard- and zero-rated supplies can be seen as consistent with the scheme of the Act. However, the Commissioner considers that the view that section 5(14) gives effect to zero-rating of part of a supply required by the zero- rating provisions is to be preferred. This view is supported by the ordinary meaning of section 5(14), is consistent with the scheme of the Act and is not inconsistent with the case law on the earlier section 5(14). Example 45. ABC Ltd, a non-resident company, supplies a New Zealand resident a computer system with a warranty to repair any defects that appear within 12 months. A defect appears in the computer system within the 12-month period. The New Zealand resident asks ABC Ltd to repair the computer system under the warranty and to upgrade it at the same time. The New Zealand resident pays ABC Ltd for the cost of the upgrade. ABC Ltd contracts with its preferred computer specialist in New Zealand to provide the repairs and to upgrade the computer system. The computer specialist invoices ABC Ltd for the supply of services it provided in repairing and upgrading the computer system. 46. Section 11A(1) requires that a supply of services be zero-rated where: (ma) the services relate to goods under warranty to the extent that the services are— (i) provided under the warranty; and (ii) supplied for consideration that is given by a warrantor who is a non-resident, not a registered person and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; and (iii) in respect of goods that were subject to tax under section 12(1); or 47. For the purposes of the example, it is assumed that all the requirements of section 11A(1)(ma) are satisfied and no other zero-rating provisions apply and that there is only one supply for the purposes of section 8. 48. The words “to the extent that” in section 11A(1)(ma) indicate that zero-rating of part of the supply is required. Consequently, the supply of services by the computer specialist to ABC Ltd is divided under section 11A(1)(ma) into the part that represents the repairing of the computer system under the warranty, which must be zero-rated, and the part that represents the upgrading of the computer system, which must be standard-rated. Section 5(14) is then applied to deem the zero-rated part of the supply to be a separate supply for the purposes of the Act. 9 Submissions received 49. Submissions received by Inland Revenue on the exposure draft of this item raised issues concerning the relationship between the item and two other matters. 50. Some submissions queried the relationship between the item and the exercise of determining whether a “package” of goods and/or services is a single supply, or comprises two or more supplies, for the purposes of the Act. The latter exercise involves identifying the supply or supplies to which section 8(1) and the zero- rating provisions are applied. It is undertaken before section 5(14) is applied, so does not concern the interpretation of this provision. For this reason paragraph 4 above now more clearly states that the item is not concerned with the principles of apportionment that the courts have developed to assist them to determine whether a “package” of goods and/or services is a single supply, or comprises of two or more supplies, for the purposes of the Act. 51. Some submissions queried when the zero-rating provisions require part of the supply to be zero-rated. The exposure draft of this item suggested that Parliament intended part of a supply to be zero-rated only when the zero-rating provision contains “apportioning language” such as “to the extent that”. However, it is now acknowledged that this view may be too restrictive. Consequently, paragraph 12 above states that whether the relevant zero-rating provision authorises part of a supply to be zero-rated is a matter of statutory interpretation.
1 IS 08/02: DEDUCTIBILITY OF FEASIBILITY EXPENDITURE INTRODUCTION 1. This interpretation statement contains guidelines that the Commissioner considers relevant in determining whether feasibility study expenditure is deductible under the general deductibility provisions in section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. 3. This statement does not consider specific deductibility provisions that may be applicable to some types of feasibility expenditure; for example, provisions such as those found in Part D Subpart B, Part D Subpart T (petroleum mining), and Part D Subpart U (mineral mining). 4. This statement also does not consider the timing of any deduction to which a taxpayer might be entitled or Part E Subpart E (depreciation). 5. This statement is in two parts. The first part considers the application of section DA 1(1) (the general permission) to feasibility expenditure. The second part considers the application of section DA 2(1) (the capital limitation). SUMMARY 6. In many situations it is likely that feasibility expenditure will be non-deductible on the basis that it is either incurred preliminary to or preparatory to the commencement of a business or income-earning activity or it is capital in nature. Deductibility: General principles 7. For a deduction to be claimed it will be necessary for the feasibility expenditure to be incurred by the taxpayer: • in the derivation of assessable income (either from the ultimate exploitation of the product of the expenditure in a business or income-earning activity, or by sale of the product of the expenditure); and • as an ordinary incident of a particular business or income-earning activity. 8. The deductibility of feasibility expenditure is subject to the application of the general principles under section DA 1(1), the general deductibility provision in the Act. Thus, for feasibility expenditure to be deductible under either paragraph of section DA 1(1) there must be a sufficient relationship or nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. Any expenditure incurred before the establishment of a business or an income- earning process will not fulfil this statutory nexus because the expenditure will 2 have been incurred too soon. Therefore, feasibility expenditure incurred preliminary to or preparatory to the establishment of a business or income- earning activity will not be deductible. 9. The decision whether a business or income-earning activity is being carried on is always one of fact and degree. Its resolution depends on a consideration of the nature of the activities carried on and the taxpayer’s intention in engaging in those activities (as set down in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682). A determination of the point at which a taxpayer makes a firm commitment to go into a business or income-earning activity is critical for establishing the earliest time at which that business or income-earning activity may have commenced. Commitment alone, however, is insufficient. The profit-making structure must also have been established and current operations must have begun in order to conclude that the business or income-earning process has commenced. 10. The correct characterisation of the nature of the relevant business is vital to resolving whether there is a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and a taxpayer’s business. The activities must be characteristic of that kind of business and the expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary business operations. 11. The profit-making structure must also be in place for a business to have commenced. However, the extent of the profit-making structure required depends on the nature of the particular business. 12. The element of commitment is also critical. To conclude that a business or an income-earning activity has commenced, it must be shown that a decision has been made to enter into that business or activity. If expenditure relates to activities undertaken in order to decide whether to enter into a particular business or income-earning activity, that expenditure will lack the required nexus and will be non-deductible. 13. For feasibility expenditure incurred after a business or an income-earning activity has commenced to be deductible, it must be incurred as an ordinary incident of the business or income-earning process. This requires that the particular activities must be undertaken as part of the income-earning process (ie, the activities must be carried out with the intention of obtaining assessable income). Capital limitation 14. When feasibility expenditure is deductible under section DA 1(1), it is still necessary to consider whether the expenditure is denied a deduction under section DA 2(1) as being expenditure of a capital nature. 15. Whether particular feasibility expenditure is capital or revenue in nature must be determined on the facts of any particular case. The most important factors to weigh in determining whether feasibility expenditure is capital or revenue in nature are whether the expenditure: 3 • is recurrent or once and for all expenditure; • is on the profit-yielding structure or the income-earning process; • creates an identifiable asset; and • produces an enduring benefit. 16. In relation to the other three factors, it is necessary to identify the particular nature of the taxpayer’s business. When incurring feasibility expenditure of the type in question forms part of the normal business operations (ie, part of the constant demands on the enterprise), case law indicates that the feasibility expenditure is more likely to be treated as being on revenue account and deductible. 17. In relation to the enduring asset and profit-making structure factors, it is necessary to consider how far along the process the expenditure was incurred and whether a particular asset has been identified. In these circumstances whether a decision has been made to commit to a particular proposal is likely to be important. 18. Feasibility expenditure incurred principally for the purpose of placing a taxpayer in a position to make an informed decision about the acquisition of an asset (or other enduring advantage) will not generally be expenditure incurred in relation to that particular asset or advantage. However, once the decision has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of a particular capital asset, any expenditure incurred beyond that point will relate to the acquisition of that asset and will indicate that the expenditure is more likely to be of a capital nature. 19. The same principle applies in relation to determining whether the expenditure relates to the business or profit-making structure. If the feasibility expenditure is incurred principally for evaluating one or more proposals, it is unlikely the expenditure will relate to the business structure sufficiently to indicate the expenditure is capital in nature. However, when the feasibility expenditure goes beyond simply placing a taxpayer in a position to make an informed decision, it is necessary to consider whether the expenditure relates to the profit-making structure or profit-making process. 20. Once a decision has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of an asset, any expenditure incurred after that time will more readily be treated as being related to the underlying capital project and thereby the profit-making structure of the business, so will not be deductible. For these purposes, it is irrelevant whether the expenditure is successful. In addition, commitment in this context does not necessarily mean a taxpayer will proceed with the acquisition or development regardless of future events (eg, the availability or otherwise of suitable planning consent), only that the taxpayer has made a firm decision to proceed. Similarly, it is considered that the fact the decision to proceed, or aspects of the process, may be contingent on factors beyond the taxpayer’s control will not mean that a taxpayer is not committed to pursuing a 4 certain course of action. Identifying when a decision to proceed has been reached in any particular situation will always be a question of fact and degree, and it is necessary to weigh all the relevant factors to determine whether a commitment has been made to a project. LEGISLATION 21. Whether feasibility expenditure is an allowable deduction is determined under sections DA 1 and DA 2(1), which provide as follows. DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation loss) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. 22. It is the Commissioner’s view that his conclusions in this statement as to the deductibility or non-deductibility of feasibility expenditure would not be altered if the same items were considered under the provisions of the 1994 Act or the 2004 Act. WHAT IS FEASIBILITY EXPENDITURE? 23. Feasibility expenditure is neither a defined term for the purposes of the Act nor a term of art. However, it is generally used to describe expenditure incurred by a taxpayer for determining the practicability of a new proposal. A typical feasibility exercise would involve determining whether a particular course of action should be taken or certain capital assets acquired or developed. Depending on the circumstances, feasibility expenditure may include the cost of 5 carrying out surveys or studies (eg, engineering surveys, environmental studies, and geological and geophysical studies), conducting comparative industry and market research, engaging professionals (eg, lawyers, consultants, and financial analysts), producing samples or prototypes, and travel costs. These costs may be incurred “externally” if a third party is contracted to provide the services to the taxpayer, or “in-house” if the taxpayer’s employees are paid to undertake the work. Feasibility expenses may arise at the outset of a new business venture or in the course of an existing business. In the latter case, they may be closely related to existing operations or may relate to proposals to expand the existing business or commence a new business. 24. Section DA 1(1) is the general deductibility provision in the Act, and relevantly provides that a deduction is allowed to the extent to which any expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving assessable income, or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. For feasibility expenditure to be deductible, therefore, it must first fall within one of these two bases of deductibility. In addition, simply satisfying section DA 1(1) may not be sufficient to ensure deductibility. A deduction may still be prohibited under a specific provision of the Act; for example, under section DA 2(1), which prohibits a deduction for expenditure of a capital nature. 25. Little New Zealand case law exists on the deductibility of feasibility expenditure. However, some overseas authorities, in particular, Australian and Canadian cases, are on point. DEDUCTIBILITY UNDER SECTION DA 1(1) General principles 26. The two leading New Zealand cases relevant to the interpretation of the general deductibility provision are the Court of Appeal decisions in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. The following general principles can be taken from the cases: • Expenditure will be deductible only when it has the necessary relationship both with the taxpayer concerned and with the gaining or producing of the taxpayer’s assessable income or with the carrying on of a business for that purpose (Banks at page 61,240; Buckley & Young at page 61,274). • A statutory nexus must exist between the particular expenditure and the assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction (Banks at page 61,240). • The heart of the inquiry is the identification of the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income- earning process. That in turn requires determining the payment’s true character. It then becomes a matter of degree, and so a question of fact, to determine whether a sufficient relationship exists between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand, and the income- 6 earning process on the other, for the expenditure to fall within the words of the section (Banks at page 61,242; Buckley & Young at page 61,274). • Whether the expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income has to be judged as at the time the taxpayer became definitively committed to the expenditure for which the deduction is sought (Banks at page 61,241). • The phrase “to the extent that” expressly contemplates apportionment (Banks at page 61,240; Buckley & Young at page 61,274). • The amount of expenditure is not material. It is not a question of what a reasonable and prudent taxpayer would have expended. It is what the taxpayer has in fact paid (Buckley & Young at page 61,282). Application to feasibility expenditure 27. The primary test for deductibility of expenditure under either paragraph of section DA 1(1) is that there must be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. Feasibility expenditure is often incurred at the early stages of a new venture. This means the deductibility of such expenditure is often inextricably linked to the issue of whether and/or when a taxpayer has commenced business or commenced a new business or, in other than business cases, established an income-earning process. 28. Expenditure incurred before the establishment of a business or an income- earning process will not fulfil the statutory nexus required in terms of section DA 1(1) and will not be deductible. This is because the expenditure will have been incurred too soon. If a taxpayer has incurred feasibility expenditure before a business has commenced, or a new business to which the feasibility expenditure relates has commenced, or an income-earning process is established, as the case may be, a deduction will be denied. “In business” 29. The leading New Zealand case on what constitutes being in business is Grieve. The Court of Appeal found that determining whether a taxpayer is in business involves a two-fold inquiry as to: (i) the nature of the activities carried on and (ii) the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. Richardson J (at page 61,691) identified several factors relevant to determining whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business, namely the: • nature of the activity; • period over which the taxpayer engages in that activity; • scale of operations and the volume of transactions; • commitment of time, money, and effort; 7 • pattern of the activity; and • financial results. 30. Richardson J went on to note that it may also be helpful to consider whether the operations involved are of the same kind, and are carried on in the same way, as those that are characteristic of ordinary trade in the line of business in which the venture is conducted. However, in the end it is the character and circumstances of the particular venture that are crucial. Commencement of business or income-earning activity 31. Although relevant to the issue of preliminary expenditure, the focus in Grieve was essentially on whether a business was being carried on, rather than on the issue of when it could be said that a business had commenced. The latter issue has been more specifically considered in other New Zealand and overseas cases, generally seen as commencing with the English case Birmingham & District Cattle By-Products Co Ltd v IRC (1919) 12 TC 92. 32. In Birmingham, Rowlatt J concluded that the taxpayer had not commenced business until the date it started to receive raw material and produce finished products. Until then all its actions were merely preparatory to the commencement of business; it was in the process of “getting ready”. 33. Birmingham was cited by Barker J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131, 61,144, as being authority for the proposition that a business does not commence until the plant is ready and the owner is ready to commence dealings in the articles from which the owner is to derive profit; preparatory activities do not constitute the running of a business. 34. Birmingham was also confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Calkin v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,781, where Richardson J noted the difficulty in distinguishing between transactions that are preparatory to the commencement of business and those that occur once the business has begun and concluded (at page 61,786): Clearly it is not sufficient that the taxpayer has made a commitment to engage in business: he must first establish a profitmaking structure and begin ordinary current business operations. 35. Calkin was applied in the High Court decision Stevens & Stevens v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,001. In Stevens & Stevens, Gallen J also noted that it is not always easy to establish when a business commences and stated (at page 6,006): Preliminary investigations will clearly not be enough, nor will the expenditure of capital requirements in order to enable the business to be carried on, see Birmingham and District Cattle By-Products Company Limited v Commrs of IR. The business must involve trading. 36. Gallen J considered the Canadian case Minister of National Revenue v MP Drilling Ltd \[1976\] CTC 58 (discussed in paragraphs 90–92) where it was held that a business had commenced when the permanent structure, the market, and the products all existed and the efforts of the respondent were directed to bringing them together with a resultant profit to it. 8 37. Thus, deciding when a taxpayer ceases incurring preliminary expenditure, preparatory to the commencement of a business or an income-earning activity, and commences incurring expenditure made during the course or conduct of a business or an income-earning activity is often difficult to determine. Preliminary investigations are not enough, and neither is expenditure on capital requirements to enable the business or activity to be carried on. The income- earning process must have begun and the expenditure must be incurred as part of that process (ie, as part of the ordinary business or income-earning activities). Cases: New Zealand 38. Very little New Zealand case law considers whether a business has commenced in the context of a claim for the deduction of feasibility expenditure. However, a few decisions are relevant to some extent in this context. These cases consider the issue of the deductibility of pre-commencement expenditure. The general principles exhibited in these cases are equally applicable in the context of feasibility expenditure. 39. In Case L74 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,431 the taxpayers were in partnership as property developers. They bought, renovated, and sold properties. They decided to investigate buying land in the Cook Islands, building a motel, and operating it. They travelled there and found that their proposed venture was not possible. When they sought to deduct the costs of travel, the Commissioner disallowed the claim on the basis that it was expenditure preparatory to the commencement of a new business. 40. Judge Barber agreed. The Taxation Review Authority (TRA) concluded the expenditure was both preparatory to the commencement of a new business as moteliers and related to the capital structure of such a new business. 41. The Canadian MP Drilling case (noted in Stevens & Stevens and discussed in paragraphs 90–92) was also briefly considered in New Zealand in Case M68 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,384. That decision concerned a taxpayer incorporated in 1985 as an exporter, a marketing agent, and an agricultural consultant. From 1985 to 1988, its managing director and principal shareholder was heavily involved in establishing a business for exporting certain agricultural products and services to developing countries. The taxpayer declared no income for the years ending 31 March 1986 to 31 March 1988 and sought deductions for expenditure incurred during that period. The largest components of the expenditure were travel costs and the manager’s salary. 42. Bathgate DJ held that for the years ending 31 March 1986 and 31 March 1987 the taxpayer had not commenced business. In the TRA’s opinion, the activities undertaken in that period were exploratory, preliminary to the undertaking of an income-earning process, and were to establish connections and build goodwill. This was the establishment of the company’s business structure, before the commencement of business. The TRA stated (at page 2,391): 9 Feasibility study, costs of inquiry, research and investigation, market testing and introduction expenses at the start, to build or establish a goodwill and until establishment and the undertaking of an income earning process, are generally in the nature of establishment expenses, designed to create and secure a lasting advantage, more remote from income earning, and are usually not deductible under either limb of s 104. They are capital in nature or character. 43. However, Bathgate DJ considered that the taxpayer’s business had commenced in and from the 1988 income year. In that year, the taxpayer had established an overseas office and, notwithstanding that trading had not commenced and no profit had been generated, Bathgate DJ was satisfied that the income-earning process had commenced. He stated (at page 2,394): There was then in my opinion a close and discernible nexus between the expenditure and the income earning process, which by then had started, albeit only just started, so that the expenditure was then of revenue rather than of capital. The preliminary and preparatory work of the objector had largely ceased, an income earnings structure was then in existence, its goodwill was established and growing, and the business was carried on as had been initially intended, but had been delayed until the preliminaries had been completed and a decision made as to how and where the business would operate from. The advantages sought by the expenditure were those looked for in the nature of a trading operation, in the way of gaining or producing assessable income, rather than advantages of a preliminary and preparatory nature, of the once and for all type in establishing a structure, of the preceding years. Current business operations had begun. 44. Although this decision may at first glance seem inconsistent with cases such as Stevens & Stevens and MP Drilling, in reaching his decision Bathgate DJ noted (at page 2,395) that he had not overlooked the cases referred to by counsel for the taxpayer, including MP Drilling. In the TRA’s opinion, the distinction between those cases and the taxpayer’s case was one of fact and degree. The TRA also emphasised (at page 2,394) that a business may have commenced before a taxpayer was actually trading or earning assessable income. 45. In Case S39 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,264 two friends incorporated the taxpayer company with the objective of developing a major media company. The majority shareholder was the company’s managing director. He looked for media production opportunities for the company. Although he worked on many proposals with a view to making a profit, some of which were developed into projects, none had come to fruition during the period in question. The taxpayer company claimed various items of expenditure, the major item being management fees paid to the managing director’s company for services provided by the managing director to the taxpayer. The Commissioner argued that the taxpayer’s activities were preliminary and investigatory, so any expenditure was not deductible because business had not commenced and the expenditure was capital in nature. 46. Barber DJ found for the taxpayer and concluded that the type of work undertaken by the managing director for the taxpayer was not work that was preliminary to, and investigatory of, commencing business, but work that was preliminary to and investigatory of business projects. This was part of the business of media and entertainment production. Even though the work may have been entrepreneurial, speculative and prone not to result in completion or profit, it was work of the normal media and entertainment production type. The taxpayer was established to investigate and carry out or sell profitable 10 production opportunities in the media area. The work was part of the taxpayer’s business or income-earning process. 47. Counsel for the Commissioner argued that a project must get past development proposals and feasibility studies and achieve something. Barber DJ acknowledged that it is unusual for a business not to achieve income-earning transactions. However, Barber DJ stated (at page 7,272): It seems to me that development proposals and feasibility studies are very much part of a media production project and were part of the income earning process of the objector even though a project needs to progress much further for fees or profit to be obtained. I do not accept Mr Willox’s submission that because there were no income earning transactions, a business had never been commenced by the objector. 48. Thus, Case S39 supports the deductibility of feasibility expenditure in limited circumstances. In that case the TRA concluded that the investigatory work undertaken by the majority shareholder on behalf of the objector was part of the normal business operations of the objector as a media production company. The feasibility expenditure was held to relate to the business of the company (ie, the investigations were part of the company’s income-earning process, not the profit-making structure) and were calculated to result in income to the taxpayer. 49. However, the important distinction between Case S39 and the other cases discussed above is that in Case S39 the feasibility studies and investigatory work were part of the company’s ordinary business operations of the company. The business of a media production company required that the company investigate production opportunities. In other words, the feasibility expenditure incurred was incurred as part of the business activity of identifying profitable projects. This can be contrasted with feasibility expenditure incurred to determine whether to go into business, which is incurred before the commencement of business and lacks sufficient nexus to satisfy the deductibility provision. The situations where feasibility expenditure will constitute an ordinary incident of the business or income-earning process, such as was the case in Case S39, are limited. The deductibility or otherwise of any such expenditure must be determined on the application of the statutory language to the facts in any particular case. 50. Although there are few New Zealand cases in the area of pre-commencement expenditure, those that do exist illustrate the application of the general principles discussed earlier in this statement. No special rules apply to feasibility expenditure. Thus, the cases emphasise that the deductibility or otherwise of feasibility expenditure will depend on the particular facts of the case. A sufficient nexus must exist between the expenditure and the business or income- earning activity. When the expenditure is incurred before any decision is made to enter into the business or income-earning activity, the expenditure will have been incurred too soon and will be non-deductible (Case M68). When a business already exists, feasibility expenditure incurred in relation to a new business will still need to satisfy these tests (Case L74). When feasibility expenditure is incurred as part of the ordinary income-earning process of a business, it may satisfy the requirements of section DA 1(1)(b) for deductibility (Case S39). 11 51. However, the few authorities that do exist concern relatively simple fact situations, primarily concerning pre-commencement expenditure, and do not exhibit any detailed legal analysis of applicable principles. In addition, the decisions are all TRA decisions, being the court of first instance in each case. In these circumstances, a consideration of relevant decisions from other jurisdictions is of benefit. Cases: Australia 52. A leading Australian case in the context of feasibility expenditure is Softwood Pulp and Paper Co Ltd v FCT 76 ATC 4,438. In that case the taxpayer company was incorporated in 1961 to establish a new paper production industry in South Australia. This would involve building a new mill complex to process particular kinds of paper and other products. The company was owned by Australian promoters and a Canadian company that had experience in the same paper industry. The company incurred significant expenditure in relation to the proposed mill development. However, in February 1962, the Canadian company withdrew. No other promoter could be found, so the project was abandoned. The taxpayer sought a deduction for its expenditure. These expenses included overseas and local travel costs, legal and accounting expenses, the acquisition and testing of raw materials, and professional fees for the carrying out of feasibility studies by expert consultants. 53. The Supreme Court of Victoria rejected the taxpayer’s claim. Menhennitt J considered the case, first, from the perspective of whether the taxpayer company was carrying on a business and, secondly, assuming it was carrying on a business, whether the expenditure was of a capital or revenue nature. On the first point, he concluded that everything the company had done was merely preparatory to the commencement of business. The key factor for the court was that at no stage had the company definitely decided to proceed with the mill. Menhennitt J, referring to Birmingham in support of his conclusion, stated (at page 4,451): The critical point is that the company had not reached a stage remotely near the carrying on of a business. Even assuming that at some stage prior to the mill turning, the company could be said to be carrying on a business, in this case the company had not even approached the stage of making a decision about carrying on a business. All that had happened had been that certain investigations had been made to decide whether or not the business was feasible, and whether or not it was economically viable on a competitive basis, but nothing had been done which could be said to be carrying on a business or anything associated with or incidental to the actual carrying on of a business. Everything which was done was concerned with making a decision whether or not steps should be taken to set up a business, but no decision on even that matter had been reached. \[Emphasis added\] 54. The Australian full Federal Court decision in FCT v Ampol Exploration Ltd 86 ATC 4,859 is usually cited in support of the deductibility of feasibility expenditure. In that case, the taxpayer carried on business as an oil exploration company, the “exploration arm” of the Ampol group of companies. In 1979, the taxpayer entered into several agreements with the Chinese Government to participate in geographical (seismic) surveys of offshore China to discover possible oil and gas fields. Participation involved no more than the possibility 12 of the Chinese Government granting the right to bid to undertake further seismic and exploration work. 55. An existing company within the group was used as a joint venture vehicle by the taxpayer and another company in the group. The taxpayer assigned its interest under the agreements with the Chinese Government to the joint venture company. The consideration for the assignment was to be a sum agreed on or the taxpayer’s costs in connection with the surveys plus a percentage. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for its survey expenditure and the costs of consultants who interpreted the data obtained. The Commissioner disallowed the claim and the taxpayer appealed. A majority (two to one) of the full Federal Court found for the taxpayer. 56. Lockhart J first considered whether the expenditure came within section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), the equivalent of section DA 1(1). His Honour stated that for expenditure to fall within the first limb, the outgoings must be connected with the operations that gain or produce the assessable income. In relation to the second limb, a nexus must exist between the expenditure and the carrying on of the relevant business. 57. His Honour noted that despite the uniqueness of the situation, namely that the companies engaged in the activities had no interest from which an income- producing asset could arise, the taxpayer’s role in the Chinese venture was perceived by those who controlled its affairs as a commercially sound method of carrying on its exploration business and as part of its ordinary business activities. They were seeking a profit opportunity. In addition, the circumstances that brought the deed of assignment into existence and the provisions of the deed were also held to be relevant matters for the purpose of characterising the true nature of the expenditure for the purposes of the second limb. 58. Lockhart J found, on the basis of the facts in that case, that the expenditure was necessarily incurred in the carrying on of the taxpayer’s business. He stated (at page 4,870): The characterisation of the expenditure, and therefore of the outgoing which it represents, is to be discerned from the business activities of the taxpayer generally and its role as the prospecting arm of the Ampol group in the Chinese project in particular. The understanding between the boards of Ampol and the taxpayer, ... , that a benefit, in the form at least of some payment to the taxpayer in the nature of reward or profit, would accrue to it, requires that the question of deductibility should be approached in a practical fashion. The whole of the relevant expenditure was incurred in the course of carrying on of the taxpayer’s business of petroleum exploration. \[Emphasis added\] 59. Lockhart J was also satisfied that the total expenditure was deductible under the first limb of section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). The trial judge had drawn a distinction between outgoings incurred before the execution of the deed of assignment and those incurred after, on the basis that it was not until the deed was executed that the payment to be made to the taxpayer was determined. Lockhart J disagreed. His Honour stated (at page 4,870): 13 In my opinion the expenditure incurred before the deed was both incidental and relevant to gaining or producing the taxpayer’s assessable income in the form of a fee, using that word in the broad sense of a payment or remuneration for the taxpayer’s role in the exploration enterprise off the Chinese coast. The deduction is not denied because the particular form of payment was not finally determined in a legally binding form until 3 April 1980. It was at all relevant times the intent of Ampol and the taxpayer that a just reward of a business character would be paid to the taxpayer. Only the particular method to be selected to achieve this objective remained to be determined. Viewed from a practical and business point of view the deed of assignment was the method finally selected to express the object of both Ampol and the taxpayer; first, to enable Ampol to derive a fair share of any benefits which might be produced in the future from the oil production enterprise, if one emerged at all, and, second, to ensure recoupment of the taxpayer’s costs if the oil fields were found to be commercially feasible together with a payment geared to a percentage of those costs, and the major share in the benefits of any such enterprise. The total expenditure was thus connected with the gaining of the payment from Ampolex Queensland. \[Emphasis added\] 60. Lockhart J’s decision emphasises that a sufficient nexus must exist between the feasibility expenditure and the relevant business or income-earning activity, and that this will be a question of fact in any particular case. In Ampol the activities were unique in that they provided only a right to bid for participation in the next stage of seismic surveys and exploration. There was no interest from which an income-producing asset could arise. The clear implication from the judgment is that the expenditure might well have been held to be non-deductible, except that in the particular facts of the case the activities were carried out by the taxpayer for the gaining of assessable income (in this case in the form of a fee to be paid to the taxpayer under the deed of assignment). 61. Although concluding that the expenditure was deductible in this particular case, Lockhart J did sound a cautionary note with regard to other fact situations. He stated (at page 4,870): It provides no warrant for a more general proposition that outgoings of companies engaged in petroleum exploration are necessarily deductible under the second limb of subsec. 51(1) if the expenditure is related to that activity. This is a question of fact in each case. Exploration or prospecting activities (e.g. geological, geophysical or geochemical surveys and appraisal digging) are the kind of activities in which a prospecting company engages if petroleum is to be found. It is, as the title of the activity suggests, of an exploratory nature. Petroleum may or may not be found; but unless expenses of this kind are incurred it will not be found. Once a proven field has been established other expenses, for example, development drilling or activities in the course of working or establishing a petroleum field will be incurred and they savour more of a capital nature since the work is done to bring into being a proven capital asset which will be the source of income-producing activity. 62. At first glance this statement seems somewhat contradictory, as one would expect that expenditure incurred in relation to petroleum exploration by a company engaged in that activity would be deductible. However, Lockhart J’s caution is explicable on general principles. 63. It is considered that Lockhart J was merely emphasising that simply because expenses are incurred in relation to an activity does not mean those expenses are necessarily deductible. It is a question of fact in each case. In terms of general principles, it must still be established that a sufficient nexus exists between the expenditure and a business or income-earning activity. When a company is 14 carrying on prospecting activities as a business, then exploration expenses will generally be deductible when they are necessarily incurred in the course of that business. However, it is equally possible that a company could be engaging in prospecting activities that do not constitute an income-earning activity or a business, in which case there will be no relevant nexus and the expenditure will not be deductible. This was the case in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v FCT 98 ATC 4,768 (discussed in paragraphs 75-84). 64. Lockhart J went on to consider whether the expenditure was of a capital nature. That part of his judgment and the judgments of the other two members of the court are considered in paragraphs 144–147. 65. Another decision of the full Federal Court that emphasises the need for a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income- earning activity is Griffin Coal Mining Co Ltd v FCT 90 ATC 4,870. In that case, the majority of the court held that no nexus existed between smelter feasibility expenditure and the taxpayer’s existing business of coal mining and sale. 66. The taxpayer carried on the business of coalmining and supplied coal to the State Energy Commission of Western Australia (“SECWA”). During 1981 to 1983 the taxpayer was involved in various disputes with SECWA and the taxpayer decided to diversify its mining activities to lessen its financial dependence on SECWA. The taxpayer expressed interest in becoming involved in the construction of an aluminium smelter to which it would be prepared to supply coal at little or no profit, or even at a loss, provided it was given an equity interest in the project. However, in May 1984 it was decided that SECWA would supply the smelter’s electricity. As a consequence it was no longer clear that the taxpayer would necessarily supply coal to the new smelter. Nevertheless, the taxpayer continued its involvement in the smelter project. 67. In August 1984 the taxpayer and two other companies formed a consortium and conducted a feasibility study to determine the construction and operating costs, and to assess the environmental consequences, of building an aluminium smelter. The taxpayer also undertook its own feasibility study of the project. In addition, the taxpayer engaged various consultants to advise on matters such as industrial relations, finance, environmental issues and the negotiation of a joint venture agreement. Ultimately the development did not proceed, because the two other consortium participants withdrew in June 1985. 68. The Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer a deduction for the smelter feasibility study costs. 69. The majority of the full Federal Court held that the smelter feasibility costs were not deductible under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). They were incurred by the taxpayer as part of the cost of forming a new source of income. They were not merely of a preliminary nature made under the umbrella of the conduct of the existing business. At least from May 1984 there was no longer any link between the decision to be involved in the smelter venture and the supply of coal by the taxpayer. Participation in the project was 15 seen as a worthwhile activity in its own right and a new separate activity of the company. The feasibility studies were not simply assessments of whether a project could be undertaken; they flowed into the selection of a site, settlement of environmental questions, and negotiation of contracts and firm commitments. The taxpayer had moved well beyond an incident occurring in the course of the business of coal extraction and sale. 70. Thus, the majority held that the smelter feasibility expenditure was not incurred as an ordinary incident of Griffin Coal’s business. No nexus existed between Griffin Coal’s existing business and the smelter feasibility expenditure. The latter was incurred in creating a new business structure, so was not deductible under either limb of section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). 71. Other cases in this area highlight that identifying the nature or type of business or activity under consideration is fundamental to establishing when that business or activity commenced. In addition, they also confirm that a positive decision must be made to enter into that business, as was emphasised in Softwood (discussed in paragraphs 52 and 53). 72. In Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd v FCT 91 ATC 4,438, a decision of the Australian Federal Court, the taxpayer was a company that carried on business in several divisions. In August 1981, the taxpayer contracted with the Queensland Institute of Technology (“QIT”) to fund the establishment of a research and development centre for the production of monoclonal antibodies and related products suitable for commercial development. In return for funding the centre, QIT undertook to produce a range of highly specific monoclonal antibodies for commercial exploitation by the taxpayer. The centre was set up and research on a full-time basis commenced in early 1982. In November 1982 the taxpayer leased separate premises for its monoclonal antibodies division (“Mabco”) to set up development and production facilities. Sales of the first monoclonal products took place in December 1982. The taxpayer claimed deductions for its contributions to the centre and expenditure incurred by Mabco on manufacturing, administration, and research and development for the 1981/82 to 1984/85 income years. 73. Hill J, applying Softwood, rejected the taxpayer’s deductions for expenditure incurred up to November 1982. His Honour stated that critical to the resolution of the case was the characterisation of the business activity that was said to have commenced. The taxpayer claimed that the business carried on by it was to be characterised as one of researching and developing monoclonal antibody products for manufacture and sale. However, the taxpayer conceded that if the business was characterised as one of manufacturing and selling monoclonal antibody products, then that business did not commence until around November 1982. Referring to Softwood, Hill J noted that critical to that decision was the finding that the taxpayer had not yet committed itself to the project or made a final definitive decision to do so. In relation to the case before him his Honour concluded that the element of commitment was absent; the taxpayer was engaging in activities of a provisional kind only. The activity was that of funding a research project and could not be characterised as a business or even as an activity of gaining or producing assessable income. 16 74. With regard to the expenditure incurred after November 1982, the taxpayer claimed that its business included not only the manufacture and marketing of its heart worm product, but also research into, and the development of, other products. The Commissioner claimed that the expenditure was of a capital nature. This aspect of the decision is discussed in paragraphs 141–143. 75. FCT v Brand 95 ATC 4,633 concerned whether the voluntary prepayment of seven years’ licence fees for a prawn farming project was an allowable deduction. The case turned on whether the prepayment was incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or whether it was incurred “too soon”. The Court concluded that the prepayment was an allowable deduction. Tamberlin J made several relevant comments in relation to the element of commitment to the income-producing or business activity. 76. His Honour referred to several decisions which placed an emphasis on the element of commitment, including Goodman Fielder Wattie. His Honour then stated (at page 4,649): The purpose of research expenditure or payment for a feasibility study is firstly to investigate whether a proposed or possible line of business activity is viable and secondly to decide whether to make a commitment to the activity. The third stage is the entry into such a commitment. It does not follow from a favourable research or feasibility study, for example, that any commitment or outgoing will be made with a view to producing assessable income. In that sense such studies may be discrete from the relevant business activity and may be “too soon” before the business activity commences to justify classification as an activity expected to produce assessable income. This stands in marked contrast to the present case. 77. The full Federal Court also considered these issues in Esso. The taxpayer in that case carried on the business of exploring for, producing, and selling oil and gas. Since the 1960s, the taxpayer had explored for oil and gas offshore. From the early 1970s, the taxpayer, under the direction of its ultimate parent company, also explored for coal, synfuels (primarily oil shale) and certain other minerals. On occasion the taxpayer undertook exploration and production activities as a joint venturer. 78. From 1979 to 1984, the taxpayer claimed a deduction under section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) for expenditure in investigating the acquisition of interests in potential joint ventures for exploration. The costs incurred were general costs that were preliminary to any decision to acquire a particular tenement, or interest therein, from which mining production could take place. The Commissioner denied the deductions and the taxpayer appealed to the Federal Court. Sundberg J held that the expenditure was not deductible. His Honour decided that the taxpayer, although it carried on exploration activities in the relevant years, was not in the business of exploring for coal and oil shale because it had not engaged in exploration for reward (not having conducted the exploration for the purpose of selling or earning fees from its exploration information) nor was it committed to commercial production. 79. It was central to the taxpayer’s contentions, before the trial judge and on appeal, that its business included exploration for coal, synfuels and minerals. The 17 taxpayer claimed that the nature, extent and scope of its activities and the quantum and recurrence of expenditure involved in them, including the acquisition of interests in potential mining prospects and ventures, were such that the taxpayer clearly satisfied the test of “carrying on a business”. The taxpayer contended that the fact it had not at the relevant time earned assessable income from its new mining activities, commenced mining production in respect of any particular project, or committed itself to commence mining production in respect of any particular location did not mean it was not carrying on a mining business. 80. The Commissioner submitted that the evidence showed that the taxpayer had committed itself to no more than a strategy of assessing the feasibility of potential mining ventures as a possible source of income from mining or production of those mineral resources. The taxpayer had not made the transition from merely considering whether to conduct a mining business to actually conducting such a business. 81. The full Federal Court stated that the primary question was whether the expenditure was necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Only if this question were answered in the affirmative was it necessary to consider whether the expenditure was of a capital nature. 82. When considering whether expenditure was preparatory to an activity that might at some time in the future constitute the carrying on of a new or expanded business, the Court stated that “establishing the proper characterisation of the particular business said to have been carried on is critical to resolving whether there is a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business”. 83. The court accepted that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the taxpayer was not in the business of exploration, as it “did not engage in exploration for reward”. Having accepted this, the court stated that the critical issue was then whether Sundberg J erred in his approach to the requirement of the element of commitment as a criterion for deductibility under the second limb of section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). It was on the basis of that approach that Sundberg J concluded that the appellant had not made the transition from assessing and seeking opportunities to actually carrying on a mining business. 84. The court approved Sundberg J’s approach and stated that the element of commitment was an important criterion for determining deductibility as it established the requisite nexus between expenditure claimed to be deductible and the business said to be carried on. In the court’s opinion, the criterion affords a practical and principled basis for ascertaining whether the nexus between the expenditure and the derivation of assessable income is too remote or too tenuous. 85. The full Federal Court accepted that the trial judge had not erred in concluding that the taxpayer had not committed itself to commercial production, with the consequence that the element of commitment to the relevant income-producing 18 activity in respect of which the expenditure was claimed to have been incurred was missing. 86. The taxpayer had relied on the decision in Ampol to support its claim for exploration expenditure. The court in Esso stated (at page 4,783): In our view the reliance placed on Ampol by the appellant is misconceived. It was critical to the majority’s findings in favour of the taxpayer in Ampol that the taxpayer was engaged for reward in the exploration business. In other words, it was an exploration company which incurred the relevant expenditure with a view to turning to account for profit or reward the benefits it obtained from its exploration activities. That may be contrasted with the position in the present case. His Honour found that the appellant was not an exploration company and that it did not incur the relevant expenditure with a view to turning to account for profit or reward the benefits it obtained from its exploration activities. Rather, his Honour found ... that the activities were: “... of a preliminary nature, aimed at ascertaining whether it was commercially worthwhile to enter into mining joint ventures.” Summary – Australian cases 87. The Australian cases in this area are consistent with the limited New Zealand cases discussed above. In this regard the Australian decisions deal with a wider range of factual situations and provide a more detailed analysis. The usefulness of examining Australian cases in relation to a claim for a deduction under section DA 1(1) has been established in this country for many years. See, for example, Banks and Buckley & Young. The Australian decisions are concerned with the interpretation of similar wording, and there is nothing in the New Zealand or Australian decisions to indicate that a different approach should be adopted in New Zealand. 88. In the area of feasibility expenditure, the Australian cases also indicate that the question of deductibility under the equivalent of section DA 1(1) depends on the facts of any particular case. There are no special rules in relation to feasibility expenditure and the principles applicable in relation to the general deductibility provision must be applied. 89. There must be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the business or income-earning activity for the expenditure to be deductible. Therefore, the business or income-earning activity must have commenced. When the expenditure relates to a new activity for an existing business, business operations must be found to have commenced in relation to that new activity (Griffin). The cases emphasise that there must have been a commitment made to proceed with a particular activity in order for it to be said that the income- earning activity or business has commenced (Softwood and Goodman Fielder Wattie). It is critical to establish the true character of the business or income- earning activity in order to determine whether that business or income-earning activity has commenced (Ampol, Goodman Fielder Wattie, and Esso). 90. When no commitment has been made to any business or income-earning activity, feasibility expenditure will not be deductible, because the business has not commenced, so there is an insufficient nexus between the expenditure and any relevant business or income-earning activity. 19 91. When the business or income-earning activity has commenced, there must still be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and that business or income- earning activity in order for the expenditure to be deductible. Therefore, any feasibility expenditure must arise as an ordinary incident of the business or income-earning activity. In other words, the feasibility activities must be carried out as part of the ordinary current operations of the particular business or income-earning activity. Cases: Canada 92. The Canadian case Minister of National Revenue v MP Drilling Ltd, referred to in Stevens & Stevens and Case M68, concerned a taxpayer company incorporated in September 1963 to carry on the business of marketing liquefied petroleum gases in the Pacific Rim. The facts showed that the successful marketing of these products involved arranging the supply with the producing oil companies, creating extraction plants, gathering gas and transporting it to seaboard by pipeline, obtaining permits for export, constructing storage facilities, and negotiating firm contracts with overseas buyers. In 1966 it was decided that the plan to market gas was not feasible and the taxpayer company moved into operational drilling. The expenses incurred from 1963 to 1966 were largely for expert analysis and feasibility studies, plus travel costs in visiting potential overseas buyers. The Minister of National Revenue argued that these expenses were not deductible because they were payments on capital account, for the purpose of creating or acquiring a business structure and preparatory to a business. 93. The Federal Court of Appeal rejected the Minister of National Revenue’s arguments. It considered that the business structure per se came into existence in late September 1963, when the company commenced its business operations by continuing the marketing negotiations, supply negotiations and technical studies through its consultants, until June 1964, when it opened its own office and employed its own staff, including a full-time general manager. The permanent structure, the market, and the products all existed, and the efforts of the company were directed to bringing them together with a resultant profit to it. 94. However, it is important to note that in reaching this conclusion the court considered it “not without significance” that the Minister of National Revenue had not attempted to distinguish different types of expense. Although some of the expenditure was clearly incurred in the course of the income-earning process (eg, expenses incurred during the supply and sale contract negotiations), other expenses would not so readily fit within that category. As no particular expenses were drawn to the court’s attention, however, the court concluded that all the expenditure was revenue in nature. 95. The Canadian approach to the question of when a business or an income-earning activity has commenced is similar to that taken in New Zealand and Australia. Indeed, MP Drilling has been cited in several New Zealand decisions. 20 Summary 96. For feasibility expenditure to be deductible under either paragraph of section DA 1(1) a sufficient relationship or nexus must exist between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. In relation to paragraph (a) this requires that the expenditure be incurred in deriving assessable income. In relation to paragraph (b), the expenditure must be incurred in the course of carrying on the particular business. The expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary business operations (Banks and Buckley & Young). Any expenditure incurred before the establishment of a business or an income-earning activity will not fulfil this statutory nexus, because the expenditure will have been incurred too soon (Birmingham and Calkin). Therefore, feasibility expenditure incurred preliminary to or preparatory to the establishment of a business or an income-earning activity will not be deductible. 97. The decision as to whether a business or an income-earning activity is being carried on is always one of fact and degree. Its resolution depends on a consideration of the nature of the activities carried on, and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. A determination of the point at which a taxpayer makes a firm commitment to go into a business or an income-earning activity is critical for establishing the earliest time at which a business may have commenced. Commitment alone, however, is not sufficient. Therefore, there are three elements to the determination that a business has commenced. • A taxpayer’s activities must be sufficiently intense to have the characteristics of the activities of that kind of business. • The necessary profit-making structure must have been established. • The taxpayer must have passed the stage of merely “sounding out” whether to go into the business and have made a definite decision to do so. 98. The correct characterisation of the nature of the relevant business is, therefore, vital to resolving whether a sufficient nexus exists between the expenditure and a taxpayer’s business. Without a determination of the true nature of a business, it is impossible to determine whether the activities are characteristic of that kind of business, and that, therefore, the expenditure was incurred as part of the ordinary business operations (Goodman Fielder Wattie, Ampol, Esso, and Case M68). 99. The profit-making structure must also be in place for a business to have commenced. However, the extent of the profit-making structure required depends on the nature of the particular business. On the one hand, cases such as Birmingham and Softwood indicate that when the business involves manufacturing or production from a particular site, everything done before the establishment of the necessary plant is preparatory to business. On the other hand, cases such as MP Drilling and Stevens & Stevens, which dealt with the marketing of a product, indicate that when the business structure and the product exist it is enough to be negotiating supply contracts, arranging orders, and so on. 21 Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337 comments on this distinction (at page 359): The business structure or entity or organisation may assume any of an almost infinite variety of shapes and it may be difficult to comprehend under one description all the forms in which it may be manifested. In a trade or pursuit where little or no plant is required, it may be represented by no more than the intangible elements constituting what is commonly called goodwill, that is, widespread or general reputation, habitual patronage by clients or customers and an organised method of serving their needs. At the other extreme it may consist of a great aggregate of buildings, machinery and plant all assembled and systematised as the material means by which an organised body of men produce and distribute commodities or perform services. 100. Also critical is the element of commitment. The cases indicate that in determining whether an activity constitutes the carrying on of a business or an income-earning activity or whether it is preliminary to the carrying on or recommencement of a business or an income-earning activity, it is the element of commitment that establishes the requisite nexus between the expenditure claimed to be deductible and the business or income-earning activity said to be carried on for the purpose of gaining or producing income. If expenditure relates to activities undertaken to decide whether to enter into a particular business or income-earning activity, that expenditure will lack the required nexus, so will be non-deductible (Softwood, Goodman Fielder Wattie, Brand, and Esso). 101. When feasibility expenditure is incurred after a business or an income-earning activity has commenced, for that expenditure to be deductible it must have the requisite nexus with the business or income-earning activity, that is, be incurred as an ordinary incident of the business or income-earning activity. This requires, therefore, that the particular activities must be undertaken as part of the income-earning process, that is, be carried out with the intention of obtaining some reward from sale or exploitation (Ampol, Esso, and Case S39). 102. In summary, therefore, the following matters are relevant when determining whether feasibility expenditure is deductible under section DA 1(1). • There must be a sufficient nexus between the feasibility expenditure and the business or income-earning activity. • If the feasibility expenditure is incurred as preliminary or preparatory expenditure before the commencement of a business or an income-earning activity, there will not be a sufficient nexus and that expenditure will not be deductible. • The decision as to whether a business or an income-earning activity has commenced is one of fact and degree. Four factors are relevant. – It is critical to determine the true nature of the business. – A commitment must have been made to enter into that business. 22 – The required profit-making structure for the particular business must be in place. – The ordinary current operations of the business must have begun. • If the business or income-earning activity has commenced then, in order to be deductible, the feasibility expenditure must have the requisite nexus with the business or income-earning activity. This means the feasibility expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary current operations of that business or income-earning activity (ie, the feasibility-related activities must be carried out with the intention of obtaining income from those activities). Example 1 103. Several individuals, who are employed by the marketing division of a nation- wide retail company, are considering establishing their own retail marketing consultancy business. To determine the feasibility of the business, they have purchased market industry information. They have also incurred travel and entertainment costs through travelling around the country and meeting with potential clients to ascertain the level of interest in the provision of consultancy advice. The individuals have also investigated the possibility of leasing office space and have incurred legal fees in that regard. Legal fees have also been incurred in seeking advice on the implications of the employees leaving their present employer. 104. The costs incurred to date are not deductible. The individuals have committed themselves to no more than a strategy of assessing the feasibility of a potential marketing consultancy business as a possible source of income. The individuals have not proceeded to commit themselves to any particular venture. The costs are preliminary and preparatory to the establishment of an income-producing structure. A decision to proceed with the business has not been made, the profit- making structure is not in place, and normal business operations have not commenced. Example 2 105. The directors of an established logging and saw-milling company are considering whether the company should start the production of gardening tools, which it could supply, initially to its existing clients, but in time to a wider group. The board is unsure about the financial viability of such a course, so engages consultants to provide financial projections and information about the likely demand for such products. Several of the directors also travel around the country meeting with clients to discuss the proposed venture. 106. The consultants’ report indicates insufficient regular demand for the gardening tools to warrant the company providing such products in the short term. Given this, the board abandons the idea. 23 107. The consultants’ fees and the directors’ travel costs are not deductible. These costs are preliminary and preparatory to the establishment of a new income- earning activity. They do not relate to the existing logging and saw-milling business and are not part of the current operations of that business. The fact that the company resolved not to proceed with the production of the gardening tools does not affect the character of the expenditure. Example 3 108. Two friends who are working for a large engineering company are considering setting up an engineering business of their own. They incur expenditure in the first six months of 2007 investigating possible ways to operate a business, including obtaining advice from an accountant and a solicitor and sounding out potential clients. In July 2007, they agree they will establish the business and, having secured several clients and set up an office, they resign from their current positions. They begin to actively work on establishing their processes and databases and in September 2007 they commence work for their first clients. 109. The expenditure incurred before July 2007 is not deductible. It was preliminary and preparatory to the establishment of an income-producing activity. A firm decision to proceed with the business had not been made, the profit-making structure was not in place and normal business operations had not commenced. 110. The expenditure incurred from July 2007 is deductible, subject to the capital limitation (which is discussed next). The decision to commit to the business has been made, the profit-making structure is in place, and current operations have begun. Therefore, the business has commenced. This is the case regardless of the fact that work for a particular client does not commence until September 2007. PROHIBITION OF DEDUCTION UNDER SECTION DA 2(1) 111. If, on the facts and circumstances of any particular case, it is determined that feasibility expenditure is deductible under either section DA 1(1)(a) or section DA 1(1)(b), it is then necessary to determine whether the deduction is prohibited by section DA 2(1) as being expenditure of a capital nature. General principles 112. The courts have formulated principles or “tests” for determining whether an expenditure or loss is of a capital nature. The leading statement of these tests is the case of BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209, which followed the earlier judgments of Dixon J in two Australian decisions: Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337 and Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634. 113. In Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT, Dixon J described the distinction between expenditure on capital account and expenditure on revenue account as corresponding (at page 359): 24 with the distinction between the business entity, structure, or organisation set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss. 114. Dixon J identified three matters to be considered (at page 363): (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which the advantage is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure further use or enjoyment. 115. In Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT, Dixon J again summarised the distinction between expenditure on capital account and expenditure on revenue account (at page 647): The contrast between the two forms of expenditure corresponds to the distinction between the acquisition of the means of production and the use of them; between establishing or extending a business organisation and carrying on the business; between the implements employed in work and the regular performance of the work in which they are employed; between an enterprise itself and the sustained effort of those engaged in it. 116. His Honour indicated that determining whether expenditure was capital or revenue (at page 648): depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process. 117. The BP Australia formulation was adopted in New Zealand in cases such as CIR v LD Nathan & Co Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 209, Buckley & Young, CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233, Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206, CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001, and Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. In Wattie, the Privy Council noted that the approach adopted in Hallstroms has been recognised as exemplifying the “governing approach” in New Zealand. 118. The courts have formulated various indicia for determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue. The following factors are relevant in this regard. • The need or occasion which calls for the expenditure. • Whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature. • Whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset. • Whether the expenditure creates an advantage which is of enduring benefit to the business. 25 • Whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit- making process. • Whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital. • The treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting. 119. Many of these factors overlap and some will carry more weight in given circumstances. Therefore, while they are helpful as a starting point, it is necessary to make a final judgement of whether the expenditure is of a capital or revenue nature by analysing the facts as a whole, weighing which factors carry the most weight in light of those facts. 120. It is also important to note that while the courts have formulated these factors to help in determining the capital versus revenue question, all the cases referred to above have recognised that, although past cases can be useful in assisting with the resolution of a new case, there are dangers involved in this approach. When the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure is not clear-cut, the factors should be weighed in the context of the whole set of circumstances in that particular case. Application to feasibility expenditure 121. As noted previously, little New Zealand case law deals expressly with feasibility expenditure. However, a few decisions have touched on the issue. Cases: New Zealand 122. The High Court decision in Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017 is the most relevant in this context. The taxpayer company, Milburn NZ Ltd (“Milburn”) made and sold cement, concrete, and lime, and quarried aggregates for its concrete business. Fraser Shingle Ltd (“Fraser”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Milburn. Milburn implemented its business plan by investigating, acquiring and developing concrete businesses. Securing supplies of aggregate for its concrete plants was recognised as being important. During an expansion period, Milburn investigated 48 different sites for aggregate. The sites were generally existing quarries. At issue was Milburn’s expenditure on sites in Bombay Hills and Alpha Creek near Westport, and Fraser’s expenditure on an aggregate prospect on the Ngaruroro River in Hawke’s Bay. All the expenditure on the three sites was for obtaining the consents or licences necessary to develop the three sites into quarries for aggregate and lime for the taxpayers’ cement and concrete businesses. Milburn capitalised all expenses once the necessary consents were obtained. 123. The taxpayer companies claimed the expenditure was of a revenue nature or, alternatively, if it was capital it was part of the “cost of minerals” and deductible under section 74(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Commissioner considered that the expenditure by Milburn at Bombay Hills was capital in nature because it was substantial and was expenditure on establishing an asset 26 that was a significant and important addition to Milburn’s operating structure. Alpha Creek involved the direct replacement of an existing strategic asset. Fraser’s expenditure was similar in that it was incurred in investigating a resource alternative to an important existing one that was likely to be circumscribed in the future. 124. Wild J held that the expenditure was of a capital nature, regarding it as part of the cost of creating the permanent structure that produced the taxpayers’ taxable income, rather than as part of the cost of earning that income. The expenditure to obtain the consents and licences was a necessary part of developing the three sites into quarries for the production of aggregate and lime for use in the taxpayers’ cement and concrete businesses. His Honour concluded that the consents and licences were enduring rather than transient in nature, and were not recurrent in nature. 125. Wild J based his view on the following factors (at page 17,023): \[a\] The nature of the business of Milburn and Fraser. \[b\] The importance of Bombay and Alpha Creek to Milburn’s business, and the Ngaruroro gravels to Fraser’s business. \[c\] The amount of the expenditure. \[d\] Its sustained nature i.e. the length of time over which the expenditure was incurred. \[e\] The nature of the expenditure: all on obtaining of consent necessary before production could begin. \[f\] \[c\]-\[e\] when contrasted with the amount, duration and nature of expenditure on Milburn’s 48 other prospects. 126. He then reached the following conclusion: These six factors, certainly in combination, indicate to me that the taxpayers, having investigated or evaluated the three sites, had made business decisions to expend money in developing the sites for commercial production. The first step, or one of the first steps, to that end was to apply for the necessary consents. \[Emphasis added\] 127. The comparison drawn by the High Court provides support for the argument that in the capital versus revenue context in relation to an existing business a distinction may be drawn between amounts expended on initial investigations to determine possible prospects and amounts expended once a decision to proceed with any prospect in particular has been made. Once a decision has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of a capital asset, it seems that expenditure is considered to be incurred on the business structure rather than the income-earning process. It is also noteworthy that Wild J compared the three sites in question with the other 48 prospects that were investigated. This suggests it is relevant to consider the frequency with which expenditure of the type under consideration is incurred in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business. In Milburn it appears it was common to undertake investigatory work and to engage external consultants. However, town-planning work was carried out relatively infrequently (suggesting that recurrence of the specific type of expenditure is a factor to be considered in determining whether the expenditure is capital or revenue). 27 128. Wild J firmly rejected the taxpayers’ argument that the classification of the expenditure depended on whether the various consents applied for were obtained or refused. Milburn’s chief executive officer had earlier given evidence for the taxpayers detailing the need for an acceptable resource consent before the taxpayers would be confident of recovering an economic resource. 129. Wild J rejected the taxpayers’ argument (at page 17,023): I am unable to accept the taxpayers’ viewpoint, as advanced in evidence by Mr Williams, because it rather seeks to classify the expenditure dependant on the outcome of the various applications for consent. There is no logical nexus, and categorisation dependant upon outcome has been firmly rejected in New Zealand, Australia and England. 130. Since the outcome of the consent applications did not affect the categorisation of the expenditure, the obtaining of resource consents for only two of the three sites was not relevant. Wild J held that the expenditure on all three sites was capital in nature. The resource consent refusal for one site meant Fraser’s project in that area did not continue. However, the abandonment of the project did not affect the capital nature of the expenditure incurred from the time the earlier business decision was made to proceed with the project. 131. Wild J also discussed the character of the advantage sought, in which lasting qualities, recurrence, and the need or occasion that calls for the expenditure were also considered. His Honour held (at page 17,025) that “the expenditure was substantially to obtain the consents and licences necessary to develop the three sites into quarries for aggregate and lime for the taxpayers’ cement and concrete businesses”. Wild J rejected the taxpayers’ argument (at page 17,025): The other perspective, which I do not think is the correct one, is that the expenditure was nevertheless of a revenue nature, in an effort to find out whether an economic resource existed. 132. In relation to whether the payments were once and for all and intended to create an enduring asset, Wild J again rejected the taxpayers’ argument that expenditure on seeking consents and licences was incurred in an effort to find out whether an economic resource existed. Wild J stated (at page 17,026): The third test is whether the payments were once and for all and intended to create an enduring asset. From their perspective, the taxpayers argued that expenditure on seeking consents and licences needed to be incurred from time to time, and possibly more than once in relation to a particular site. For example, Alpha Creek was an instance where successive mining licence applications had been made. They argued that the expenditure was all part of their trying to ascertain whether there was an economic resource capable of development. I hold firmly against that argument. I consider the correct view is that the resource consent obtained for Bombay did not need to be reapplied for, the water rights obtained did not need to be reapplied for in the short to medium term, and nor did the mining licence for Alpha Creek. Whether viewed as an integral part of the quarries to which they related (the view I prefer), or as assets in their own right, the consents and licences were enduring rather than transient in nature. \[Emphasis added\] 133. In rejecting the taxpayers’ argument, Wild J focused on the enduring nature of the consents and licences for which the taxpayers incurred expenditure. In contrast, the taxpayers’ contention was more broadly focused on the expenditure enabling them to determine, through the granting of an appropriate or an 28 inappropriate resource consent, whether an economic resource capable of development existed. 134. It would seem that Wild J’s rejection of the taxpayers’ argument, that the expenditure was incurred in order to ascertain the existence of an economic resource, was also based on his earlier findings. Wild J listed six factors (set out at paragraph 123) that indicated to him that the taxpayers “had made business decisions to expend money in developing the sites for commercial production. The first step, or one of the first steps, to that end was to apply for the necessary consents”. Since the decision to proceed had been made before applying for the consents, expenditure incurred from that point was capital in nature, and it was irrelevant to that characterisation whether the consents were ultimately granted in a manner that enabled the resources to be developed economically. 135. In Case N55 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,434 the taxpayer was the holding company of a group of manufacturing companies. The manufacturing activities were handled by the subsidiaries. The taxpayer supplied the subsidiaries with accounting, management, and clerical services for which it charged management fees. During the relevant income years, the taxpayer undertook the development of a four-wheel drive vehicle on the basis that had the venture proceeded a subsidiary would manufacture the vehicle. The project was eventually abandoned. The taxpayer sought to deduct the development expenditure. It argued that the expenses were recurrent in nature and not once and for all and were part of its ongoing product development activities. No enduring benefit was brought into existence. The expenditure was not preliminary before commencement of a business because only product diversification was being sought, not a new business. 136. The Commissioner submitted that the expenditure was not consistent with the taxpayer’s business, so was non-deductible under a previous equivalent of section DA 1(1). Barber DJ rejected the Commissioner’s submission, finding that the expenditure was consistent and must be regarded as necessarily incurred in carrying on the taxpayer’s business. 137. Barber DJ then went on to consider the capital–revenue distinction and concluded that the expenditure was capital. The TRA found that the expenditure was of a once and for all nature, incurred with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business. The expenditure was not an ordinary expenditure in the regular conduct of the business and was related to the business structure, rather than the business process. Acknowledging that product development–type expenditure may be ongoing in some businesses, the TRA found that in this case it was related to the capital base for a new manufacturing process. In addition, Barber DJ stated that the expenditure could also be regarded as preparatory to the commencement of ordinary business operations in relation to a separate production line and system, so was capital on that basis. 138. Of note are Barber DJ’s obiter comments in relation to product development expenditure (at page 3,440): 29 In some situations there must be a fine line between deductible production or marketing expenditure and non-deductible capital product development expenditure. For instance, expenditure on altering or upgrading the packaging of an existing product would seem to be a fairly normal expense of manufacturing, distributing, and marketing the product rather than an outlay towards the capital structure for manufacturing, distributing, and marketing the product. I observe that labels such as “product development expenditure” may be misleading and the test is always the character of the particular expenditure. 139. The issue in Case P3 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,017 was whether certain expenditure by a manufacturer of safety helmets qualified for an export market development expenditure tax credit. This came down to whether the expenditure was capital or revenue in nature. The expenditure essentially comprised the salary cost of the taxpayer’s design engineer who modified existing helmet designs and built samples in order to secure overseas orders. The Commissioner argued that the deduction available for export development expenditure did not extend to include research and sample raw material costs. In his view, the deduction did not extend to the cost of developing a product that may be of enduring benefit to the taxpayer. 140. Barber DJ referred to his earlier decision in Case N55 and the passages from that decision indicating that in some situations product development expenditure could be revenue in nature. In Case P3 Barber DJ concluded that the expenditure was a reasonable and normal trading or revenue expenditure. The TRA found that altering helmets was part of the ordinary incidents of the business. It was an ongoing, recurrent business activity for the taxpayer. This situation could be contrasted with the development of a one-off prototype undertaken by the taxpayer in Case N55. 141. The New Zealand authorities in this area, although limited, do indicate that to be expenditure of a revenue nature, the feasibility expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary current operations of the business. In much the same way as the enquiry under section DA 1(1), the expenditure must be incurred as an ordinary incident of the income-earning process in order to avoid the capital prohibition in section DA 2(1). Cases: Australia 142. Several of the Australian authorities discussed above in relation to section DA 1(1) also consider whether the expenditure was capital in nature. 143. In Softwood Pulp and Paper Co Ltd v FCT, (refer to paragraphs 52and 53) Menhennitt J, having reached the view that the expenditure under consideration was preliminary to the commencement of business and therefore non-deductible on that basis, went on to conclude that even if he was wrong in that regard, the expenditure was of a capital nature. His Honour cited with approval the comments of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers (set out in paragraphs 111–112). 144. Menhennitt J then posed the question whether if any of the amounts fell within either of the first two limbs of section 51, they were nevertheless of a capital nature. His Honour concluded that the expenditure went beyond simply investigating the possibility of undertaking a new business activity and extended 30 into the establishing of the profit-making structure, that is, options acquired over land, arrangements made for the supply of water, electricity, timber, etc. In these circumstances, even if the expenditure had satisfied either of the first two limbs of section 51, the expenditure would have been held to be capital. 145. The facts in Softwood can be contrasted with those in FCT v Ampol Exploration Ltd 86 ATC 4,859. In Ampol, the expenditure was held to relate to the company’s ordinary business activities. The expenditure could not lead to the establishment of an asset and was not incurred for the purpose of creating or enlarging the business structure. 146. In Ampol, Lockhart J, in the majority, concluded that the expenditure was deductible under both limbs of the equivalent of section DA 1(1) (discussed in paragraphs 54–64). His Honour then went on to consider the “more difficult question” as to whether the expenditure was in fact of a capital nature. Lockhart J concluded that the payments in question were of a revenue nature, being part of the outgoings of the taxpayer in the course of carrying on its ordinary business activities. It was not expenditure incurred for the purpose of creating or enlarging a business structure or profit-yielding or income-producing asset. 147. In his Honour’s opinion, an examination of the authorities established that there was no presumption that prospecting or exploration costs were prima facie of a capital nature. The authorities confirmed first, the danger of seeking to extract principles of general application in this branch of the law, and second, the correctness of the frequently repeated statement that whether expenditure is capital or not must be a question of fact in each case. 148. Burchett J agreed with Lockhart J that the expenditure was of a revenue nature. His Honour concluded that the relevant business of the taxpayer was the discovery and exploitation of oil, to which the seismic survey expenses were incidental. Their purpose was not to enlarge the framework within which that activity was carried on, rather they formed part of the activity. 149. The important factor in the majority’s decision in Ampol is that the exploration activities, for which the expenditure was incurred, were part of the company’s ordinary current operations. They were not adding to the business structure or undertaken with a view to obtaining an enduring asset. The activities were part of the company’s income-earning process, that is, the process by which the company earned its rewards. On this basis, therefore, the expenditure was of a revenue nature. 150. The decision in Goodman Fielder Wattie highlights that determining the true nature of the relevant business, identified in the discussion on deductibility of expenditure under section DA 1(1), is also critical in the capital versus revenue context. 151. In Goodman Fielder Wattie Hill J had concluded that the expenditure incurred before November 1982 was incurred before the commencement of the business (discussed in paragraphs 72–74). With regard to the expenditure incurred after 31 November 1982, the taxpayer claimed that it was carrying on a business that included not only the manufacture and marketing of its heartworm product, but also research into and the development of other products. The Commissioner claimed that the expenditure was of a capital nature. 152. Hill J considered the decisions in Sun Newspapers, Ampol, and Hallstroms, and stated (at pages 4,449–4,450): The judgment in the Sun Newspapers case makes it clear that it is necessary to consider carefully the nature of the business which is carried on, so as to be able to distinguish between recurrent expenditure, that is to say “expenditure which is made to meet a continuous demand” (per Rowlatt J in Ounsworth v Vickers Ltd \[1915\] 3 KB 267 at 273) and that expenditure which is made once and for all. A pharmaceutical company, the business of which includes continuing research and development as part of the continuous or constant demand for expenditure in its business, does not each time that expenditure is incurred make an outlay of capital or of a capital nature. Its business, when properly analysed, includes its research and development, at least in the ordinary case. No doubt, there are matters of degree involved, and in a particular case the research and development may be concentrated on a product so far removed from the day to day products of the taxpayer, that the expenditure cannot be properly seen as part of its working expenditure. Counsel for the applicant relied heavily upon the decision of the Full Court of this court in FC of T v Ampol Exploration Ltd 86 ATC 4859; (1986) 13 FCR 545. In that case, it was held that the taxpayer, the exploration arm of the Ampol Group, was carrying on a business of exploring for petroleum and the expenditure it incurred in its China venture was held to have been necessarily incurred in the carrying on of that business and as not being of a capital nature. ... By analogy it was said that where a company such as the applicant here is engaged in an activity where research and development forms part of its activity, part of the constant demand upon the enterprise, then expenditure on research and development is on revenue account. Research and development expenditure does differ somewhat from the exploration expenditure involved in the Ampol case. In general terms, one difference that is of significance is that the expenditure in Ampol was not expenditure directed towards the obtaining of rights of an enduring kind. On the peculiar facts of that case, the expenditure was directed merely at obtaining the right to negotiate, that not being a right of a proprietary kind. Research and development may, in a particular case, be directed towards obtaining patentable rights which can be seen as of an enduring kind and may, for that reason, be of a capital nature. It was not suggested here by counsel for the Commissioner that the applicant’s expenditure was directed towards the obtaining of patent rights nor was this even put to any witness. 153. His Honour noted that the cases make it clear that whether property rights are ultimately obtained is not determinative. Acknowledging Dixon J’s statements in Hallstroms as to what is required, his Honour concluded (at page 4,450): There is, in my opinion, much to be said for the view that the whole of the expenditure in issue in the present case, except perhaps so much of it as concerned the salary of Dr Watson, in the time he was involved in the patent dispute, was expenditure on revenue account rather than on capital account. A company engaged in an enterprise involving new technology such as the applicant, where the nature of its activity requires as part of its business ongoing research into product development incurs expenditure which is recurrent, expenditure which is part of the regular cost of its trading operations. That expenditure is, to adopt the words of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers, part of the process by which the organisation (being an organisation where research is part of its business activity) operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlays. 154. Thus, as in Ampol, in Goodman Fielder Wattie the expenditure was held to be recurrent expenditure that was incurred as part of the company’s ordinary 32 business activities of the company. The expenditure was not directed towards obtaining any rights of an enduring kind. 155. Thus the decisions in Australia in relation to the application of the equivalent to section DA 2(1) again emphasise the need to identify the nature of the particular business or income-earning activity and to identify whether the expenditure is incurred as part of the income-earning process of that business or activity or to create or expand the business structure. Similar considerations to those discussed in relation to deductibility under section DA 1(1) above, also apply to any denial of a deduction under section DA 2(1). The decisions in Ampol and Goodman Fielder Wattie highlight that when the expenditure relates to the income-earning process, that is, it is incurred as an ordinary incident of the business, the expenditure is more likely to be of a revenue nature. However, when the expenditure relates to the obtaining of an advantage of an enduring benefit, for example, a capital asset or another accretion to the business or profit-making structure, the expenditure will generally be of a capital nature. Cases: Canada 156. Bowater Power Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1971\] CTC 818, a decision of the Canadian Federal Court (Trial Division), is also often cited as one of the leading cases supporting the deductibility of feasibility expenditure. 157. In Bowater the taxpayer company carried on the business of generating and selling electrical power and energy. During its 1959 and 1960 taxation years, the taxpayer claimed a deduction for expenditure for survey costs and engineering studies relating to developing additional power and the location of physical plant for its power station. It claimed the deduction on the basis that such expenditure was an ordinary operating expense incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from its business. The manager of the taxpayer gave evidence that the company was continually looking into the feasibility of installing thermal power. It was also continually looking at its existing facilities to see how to increase capacity and considering new sources of generation to meet increasing customer demand. 158. The costs claimed related to two specific feasibility studies undertaken for the taxpayer. The first involved a report on the feasibility of building a new power station on a lake adjacent to the company’s existing supplies of water for its current hydro-power stations. The report covered the availability of construction materials at the site, the geography and geology of the area, the hydrology and water flows. The report concluded that it was not economically feasible to undertake the project because of the high cost per horsepower produced. The second report identified how the company could better utilise one of its existing watersheds, particularly as regards its hydro potential. The report concluded that it was economically feasible to proceed with the recommendations and the taxpayer went so far as to arrange finance. However, the project did not proceed. This was because a provincial government project to develop a hydro-powerstation in the area started and the government offered to sell power from that plant to the taxpayer at a cheaper rate than the rate at which the taxpayer could produce power if it improved its own site. 33 159. The Federal Court found for the taxpayer. Noel ACJ referred to BP Australia and Hallstroms and concluded that the matter must be viewed from a practical and business point of view. His Honour considered that having regard to the facts and the circumstances of the work conducted by the taxpayer the expenditures were part of the company’s current operations. His Honour accepted evidence that the business of the taxpayer was developing and marketing electricity and that this required a continuous evaluation and appraisal of both its power resources and its method of operation. Noel ACJ concluded that the expenditures were made to effect an increase in the volume and efficiency of the taxpayer’s business, so were for the purpose of gaining income. 160. Noel ACJ concluded that the costs of the feasibility studies were deductible as part of the current operations of the business. This finding is consistent with the New Zealand requirement of a nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s carrying on of a business. This finding is also consistent with the capital–revenue test from BP Australia, which considers whether payments are expended on a taxpayer’s business structure or are part of the income-earning process. 161. Noel ACJ also recognised that a hydroelectric development is a capital asset once it becomes a business or commercial reality. If a taxpayer is merely considering whether or not to create a capital asset, the expenditure may be revenue in nature. However, once the development of the asset becomes a reality, the expenditure incurred is capital in nature. The stage at which a development becomes a business or commercial reality may be seen as equating to the stage at which a decision or commitment is made to create an asset. Noel ACJ stated (at paragraph 73): While the hydroelectric development, once it becomes a business or commercial realty \[sic\] is a capital asset of the business giving rise to it, whatever reasonable means were taken to find out whether it should be created or not may still result from the current operations of the business as part of the every day concern of its officers in conducting the operations of the company in a business-like way. 162. Although Noel ACJ acknowledged the capital nature of hydroelectric developments that have become a business or commercial reality, he concluded that the expenditure Bowater incurred on the two feasibility studies was deductible. This was based on a judgement as to whether the development had become a business or commercial reality. Consideration of this factor is consistent with the approach taken in New Zealand and Australia of determining whether a decision or commitment has been made to create an asset, and how far along a taxpayer is in the process of developing a capital asset. 163. However, the fact that ultimately the project did not go ahead also appears to have influenced Noel ACJ in his finding that the expenditure was deductible. The success or failure of a project is not a factor that is present in New Zealand or Australian law. Noel ACJ recognised that a capital cost allowance (equivalent to New Zealand depreciation) is not permitted if the project fails or is aborted, and the expenditure is not deductible if it is not incurred in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business. He referred to such expenditure as 34 “nothings” (at paragraph 14), but considered that the expenditure incurred by Bowater was revenue in nature (at paragraph 71): The costs here of the engineering studies conducted to examine the potential of appellant's drainage area or to determine the feasibility of constructing power developments at certain sites in Newfoundland were also incurred in my view or laid out while the business of the appellant was operating and was part of the cost of this business. Had it lead to the building of plants, business profits would have resulted. Should these expenses be less current expenses because instead of being laid out in the process of inducing the buying public to buy the goods or with a view to introducing particular products to the market, they were laid out for the purpose of determining whether a depreciable asset should be constructed from which business gains could be collected and would then have been added to the value of this capital asset which would have been subject to capital cost allowances? I do not think so. The law with regard to the deduction of what might be called border-line expenses or “nothings” has moved considerably ahead in the last few years, as can be seen from the above decisions \[see Algoma Central Railway v MNR \[1967\] CTC 130 , upheld on appeal \[1968\] CTC 161; and Canada Starch Co Ltd v MNR \[1968\] CTC 466\]. 164. Noel ACJ also noted that if the expenditure had led to the building of plants, business profits would have resulted, and it is considered that a capital cost allowance would have been permitted. By considering the effect of categorising the expenditure as capital in nature (for which no allowance would be permitted because the project failed) as well as the effect of not categorising the expenditure as revenue in nature, Noel ACJ appears to be considering the effect of “nothings” or “black hole” expenditure. He subsequently notes the law’s progression with regard to the deduction of expenses that are ordinarily neither depreciable nor deductible. 165. A similar approach was taken in Kruger Pulp & Paper Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1975\] CTC 2,323. 166. A desire to prevent “black hole” non-deductible expenditure was more marked in the Canadian case Gartry v R 94 DTC 1947. In that case the taxpayer agreed to purchase a retired navy boat for use in his proposed fishing business. However, the boat sank before title formally passed to him. In determining whether the expenses were on revenue or capital account (and if they were on capital account, whether a deduction for a terminal loss was permitted), Bowman TCCJ stated: In analyzing this question one cannot ignore the anomalous result that a denial of deductibility on any basis would entail. Either the expenditures resulted in the appellant’s obtaining an asset or they did not. If they did, and if the asset so acquired was depreciable property, it must follow that the provisions of subsection 20(16) were available to the appellant to permit the deduction of a terminal loss when the boat sank. If they did not result in the acquisition of an asset for the enduring benefit of the business they cannot, in light of the decisions in Algoma Central Railway (supra), and in Bowater Power Co. Ltd. v. M.N.R., 71 DTC 5469, be regarded as capital in nature. The Crown’s position would relegate the appellant to the worst of both possible worlds. It says, in effect, to Mr. Gartry “You were spending money on a capital asset, a boat, and if those expenses had matured into full ownership before the boat sank you would have been able to claim a terminal loss. As it happens, the boat sank before title was transferred to you and you obtained nothing. But they are still capital expenditures and so you can deduct nothing.” This position is inconsistent with ordinary fairness, common sense and commercial reality. The disposition which in my view accords most closely to the facts and the authorities as I understand them is that the expenses should be treated as on revenue account or, to the extent 35 that any are on capital account, as the cost of acquiring depreciable property which, when disposed of, are the subject of a claim for a terminal loss under subsection 20(16). Since either conclusion leads to deductibility it is not necessary that I determine specifically into which category they fall. \[Emphasis added\] 167. Therefore, Gartry’s application of the principle that expenditure is revenue in nature if an asset is not obtained is consistent with Bowater. 168. Wacky Wheatley’s TV & Stereo Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1987\] 2 CTC 2,311 involved three corporations in the business of retail marketing electronic equipment. They contemplated expansion into Australia, so several corporate representatives travelled to Australia to assess the market potential. They determined that expansion would not be profitable, but sought to claim the travel costs as deductible expenditure. 169. The Tax Court of Canada agreed with the taxpayer, concluding that the expenses were incurred for the purpose of producing income and they were not on account of capital. The court found that the business structure already existed and the costs were expended to ascertain the feasibility of extending those existing operations. The court stated (at page 2,315): If the Australian opportunity had proved viable and actual plans for entry into the Australian market had been made by the appellants, any expenditures incurred to facilitate the actual expansion would arguably be on capital account. The expenditures in question were not, however, of such a nature. These expenses were anterior to any business decision to enter the Australian market and it is my opinion that they were clearly incurred as part of the current expenses of the appellants’ operations. Clear support for this conclusion is found in the case of Bowater Power Co Ltd v MNR ... In the present case, the evidence shows that expansion into new markets was an on-going concern of the appellants. It is my opinion that the expenditures in question resulted from the current operations of each of the appellants “as part of the every day concern of its officers in conducting the operations of the company in a business-like way”. 170. The principles applied in these cases are consistent with the New Zealand and Australian authorities discussed above. The courts considered whether the expenditure was incurred as part of the profit-making process or on the profit- making structure. It was also acknowledged that the evaluation by a business of a proposed course of action can be done as part of the income-earning process of that business, so expenditure incurred at the evaluation stage may be on revenue account notwithstanding that the proposal being evaluated, if implemented, would give rise to capital expenditure. On the particular facts of Bowater Noel ACJ was satisfied that the business of developing and marketing electricity required continuous evaluation and appraisal, so concluded that the expenditure was part of the current operation and deductible. A similar conclusion was reached in relation to the particular facts of Wacky Wheatley’s. This is consistent with the decisions reached on the facts in Ampol and Goodman Fielder Wattie. 171. However, it is considered that a divergence in approach may be seen in the application of the principles to particular facts in the Canadian decisions. The Canadian courts appear more willing to conclude that if expenditure is not of a 36 capital nature, for example if a commitment to any particular proposed course of action has not been made, then that expenditure will be part of the current operations of the business and thus satisfy the equivalent of the nexus test under the equivalent of section DA 1(1). 172. It is arguable that the approach of the Canadian courts in this regard is more liberal than that taken by the Australian and New Zealand courts. An approach that considers the success or failure of expenditure as relevant in determining the deductibility of the expenditure has consistently been rejected in New Zealand and Australia. A line of authority maintains that when determining whether expenditure is deductible it is irrelevant whether an outlay is successful (eg, Lothian Chemical Co Ltd v Rogers (1926) 11 TC 508 and John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v FCT (1959) 101 CLR 30). These cases establish that once a commitment has been made to purchase or develop a capital asset, subsequent expenditure incurred will be capital in nature irrespective of whether the asset is in fact acquired or developed. This follows from the deductibility or otherwise of a particular item of expenditure being determined when the expense is incurred (Banks at page 61,241), as opposed to at some other time (eg, the end of the income year in which it was incurred). In addition the enduring benefit test focuses on whether the expense was incurred with a view to (as opposed to definitively) bringing into existence an asset or advantage of enduring benefit. This line of authority has been approved and applied in New Zealand. 173. Thus, while the Canadian courts apply the same principles to the determination of the nature of particular expenditure, the fact the Canadian courts consider the success or failure of the expenditure as relevant means the conclusions reached by those courts on particular fact situations may differ from those that would be reached by a New Zealand court. Summary 174. Whether particular feasibility expenditure is capital or revenue in nature must be determined on the facts of any particular case. 175. The cases indicate that four of the capital / revenue indicators are the most relevant to determining whether feasibility-type expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. These are whether the expenditure: • is recurrent or once and for all expenditure; • is on the profit-yielding structure or the income-earning process; • creates an identifiable asset; and • produces an enduring benefit. 176. In relation to whether the expenditure is recurrent or once and for all expenditure, it is critical to identify the particular nature of the taxpayer’s business. When feasibility expenditure of the type in question forms part of the normal business operations (ie, part of the constant demands on the enterprise) 37 the cases indicate that the feasibility expenditure will more likely be treated as being on revenue account and deductible (as in Ampol and Goodman Fielder Wattie). This can also be seen from Milburn where expenditure was regularly incurred on the preliminary stages of investigating potential new sources of aggregate (and was accepted to be revenue) but expenditure on obtaining resource consents occurred relatively infrequently (and was held to be capital). 177. The courts have taken into account how far along in the process the expenditure was incurred (to determine whether it is part of the proft-making structure) and whether a particular asset has been identified. If the expenditure is incurred principally for evaluating one or more proposals it is unlikely the expenditure will relate to the business structure sufficiently to indicate the expenditure is capital in nature. However, when the feasibility expenditure goes beyond simply placing a taxpayer in a position to make an informed decision, it will be necessary to consider whether the expenditure relates to the profit-making structure or profit-making process such as in Softwood. In that case, the expenditure went beyond simply investigating the possibility of undertaking a new business activity and extended into establishing the profit-making structure (eg, options acquired over land and arrangements made for the supply of water, electricity, and timber). In these circumstances whether a decision has been made to commit to a particular proposal is likely to be important. Evidence of such a decision could include records such as board minutes, contracts with third parties, and other documentation showing that a decision had been made. 178. The same principle applies in determining whether the expenditure produces an enduring benefit (the third BP Australia factor). The incurring of expenditure principally for placing a taxpayer in a position to make an informed decision about the acquisition of an asset (or other enduring advantage) will not generally be expenditure incurred in relation to that particular asset or advantage. However, once the decision has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of a particular capital asset, any expenditure incurred beyond that point will relate to the acquisition of that asset and will indicate that the expenditure is more likely to be explicitly related to effecting an enduring advantage of a capital nature. In Milburn the taxpayers decided to proceed with the development of an asset in the case of the three sites under review, in contrast to the other 48 sites investigated by them. Expenditure incurred in relation to those three sites was held to be of a capital nature. 179. Once a decision has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of a structural asset or an enduring advantage, any expenditure incurred after that time will more readily be treated as being related to the underlying capital project (and thereby the profit-making structure of the business), and will not be deductible. For these purposes, the position in New Zealand and Australia is that it is irrelevant whether the expenditure is successful. This position differs from that in Canada, where the outcome of the project is taken into account (see the earlier discussion of Bowater). However, the New Zealand courts do ask when a decision or commitment has been made to create an asset, which may be seen as a similar inquiry to the Canadian test of whether the development has become a business or commercial reality. In addition, commitment in this context does not necessarily mean that a taxpayer will proceed with the 38 acquisition or development regardless of future events, (eg, the availability or otherwise of suitable planning consent), only that the taxpayer has made a firm decision to proceed. Similarly, it is considered that the fact the decision to proceed, or aspects of the process, may be explicitly contingent on any stated events, results or factors beyond the taxpayer’s control will not mean a taxpayer has not made the relevant commitment (such as in Milburn where Fraser failed to obtain planning permission for its proposed aggregate extraction). 180. If a taxpayer chooses not to continue with the acquisition or development of an asset, despite having earlier made a firm decision to proceed, this does not affect any earlier finding that the expenditure incurred is capital in nature. When the creation of an asset fails to eventuate, the expenditure incurred cannot be re- characterised as revenue in nature. As stated by Wild J in Milburn (at page 17,025), “\[t\]he correct approach is to look at the expenditure at the time it was incurred”. The failure to create a capital asset, despite the taxpayer’s earlier commitment, would also mean no depreciation allowance could be deducted. Rather, the expenditure incurred from when the decision to proceed was made to when the course of action was abandoned would constitute “black hole” expenditure. This differs from the Canadian approach of generally treating expenditure as revenue in nature and deductible, if a capital asset fails to eventuate (see the earlier discussion of Bowater). 181. Identifying when a decision to proceed has been reached in any particular situation will always be a question of fact and degree and it is necessary to weigh all the relevant factors to determine whether a commitment has been made to a project. 182. Therefore, it is considered that the following matters will be relevant in determining whether feasibility expenditure will be denied a deduction under section DA 2(1). • The incurring of feasibility expenditure of the type under consideration forms part of the normal business operations (ie, part of the constant demands on the enterprise). In this regard, it is critical to identify the true nature of the business or income-earning process. Cases suggest that in the absence of this factor being satisfied, expenditure will generally not be deductible. • A commitment or decision has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of a capital asset. Any expenditure incurred from that time will generally no longer be feasibility expenditure. That expenditure will be considered to relate to that capital asset, enduring benefit or profit-making structure, so will be treated as capital in nature and a deduction will be prohibited. • The categorisation of the expenditure is not affected by the ultimate success or failure in acquiring or developing a capital asset, or in obtaining an advantage of enduring benefit, or in establishing a profit-making structure. The existence or recognition of contingencies, which may affect the eventual 39 outcome, does not alter the categorisation of expenditure once a commitment or decision has been made to proceed. • The point at which a firm decision to proceed with the acquisition or development of an asset in any particular situation is a question of fact and degree. 183. It is useful to elaborate on the above bullet points. Genuine feasibility study expenditure is incurred when a taxpayer is exploring whether the acquisition or development of a capital asset is practical or possible. To obtain a deduction for such expenditure, the first requirement is that the expenditure must be incurred in the course of the taxpayer’s normal business operations. Milburn and Ampol are examples where expenditure was incurred as part of each taxpayer’s ordinary business operations. If this nexus requirement is not satisfied, the expenditure incurred is not deductible. For example, expenditure incurred in the course of operations that are outside a taxpayer’s normal business operations cannot meet the nexus requirement. 184. Although a deduction is prima facie available when the nexus requirement is satisfied, expenditure of a capital nature is not deductible. This means consideration must be given to whether the expenditure incurred is capital or revenue in nature. As such, in the context of the type of expenditure incurred in this type of case, a timeline begins from when a taxpayer is exploring whether the development or acquisition of an asset is feasible (the expenditure on which is deductible if the nexus requirement is met) to when a taxpayer develops or acquires the asset. The capital asset that may ultimately be acquired or developed will be part of the taxpayer’s profit-making structure and is not part of the income-earning process. Generally, expenditure on the development of such an asset is also capital in nature. It is a question of fact and degree as to when the expenditure incurred alters from relating to the exploration of whether the development or acquisition of an asset is practical or possible, and whether it should be developed or acquired, to when the expenditure relates to the development or acquisition of a sufficiently identified capital asset. At this latter stage, the capital nature of the expenditure means its deductibility is prohibited. Milburn provides an example of such a timeline, where expenditure incurred on the exploration of prospective quarry sites was deductible only up to a particular stage. Once the particular stage was passed, the expenditure incurred was capital in nature and non-deductible. 185. As stated in the second bullet point of paragraph 182, the point at which the expenditure alters from revenue to capital in nature is when a commitment, or decision, has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of a capital asset. At one end of the spectrum, commitment can be viewed narrowly as a binding and almost irrevocable decision to acquire or develop an asset. This level of commitment may be satisfied by the approval given by a taxpayer’s board to the acquisition or development of an asset. At the other end of the spectrum, commitment may be broadly viewed as a provisional and revocable decision that allows a taxpayer to continually reassess whether to continue with a project. 40 186. It is considered that in the current context, commitment does not require a legal or other form of binding decision that is final and irrevocable. In Milburn, the taxpayers made business decisions to develop the quarry sites, and Wild J held that the disputed expenditure was capital in nature. Yet Fraser’s commitment to developing its prospective quarry site could not have been binding, as it effectively revoked its commitment when it failed to obtain a resource consent. 187. Rather, commitment requires a decision to proceed, in contrast to a taxpayer continuing to weigh up whether or not to proceed. A commitment can still be made despite recognising that whether the development or acquisition ultimately goes ahead may be contingent on particular factors. For example, the taxpayers in Milburn had committed to developing the quarry sites, but the obtaining of appropriate resource consents was a known contingency. Other contingencies that may be recognised are the need for technical refinement to occur and the obtaining of the final construction cost. Such matters would not necessarily mean a commitment or decision to proceed with the acquisition or development of a capital asset had not been made, if the facts and/or circumstances otherwise showed that the taxpayer was actively proceeding, rather than continuing to gather information on which to decide whether to proceed. 188. A commitment or decision to proceed can also be made despite the later development of a contingency (or deal breaker) that was not recognised at the time of commitment. For example, the legal requirements for building foundations may change after the commitment was made to construct a building. It is also noted that the point of commitment has been described in the Canadian case of Bowater as the point at which the project or development becomes “a business or commercial reality”. 189. A taxpayer will have made a commitment or a decision to proceed with the acquisition or development of a capital asset, when preliminary work has been completed with indications that the development or acquisition of an asset is technically and financially viable, and the facts indicate that the development or acquisition is proceeding. This will be the case notwithstanding that there may be no explicit documentary evidence that a formal decision to proceed has been made. 190. The following points are also relevant in determining whether a taxpayer has made a commitment or a decision to acquire or develop a capital asset. • Recognition that the project or development may ultimately fail, for example, if resource consent is not obtained, is not relevant in this context if the taxpayer is proceeding to develop the asset identified and is intending to seek such consent. • The relevant asset needs only to be identified with sufficient particularity; the exact details do not need to be known. For example, if a taxpayer makes a commitment or decision to construct an office building, the later finalisation of whether to construct eight or nine storeys does not change the earlier commitment or decision. 41 • If a commitment or decision has been made, it will not matter if a taxpayer has not identified the development’s exact cost or the net profit possible from the development. A commitment or a decision to build an asset is no less a decision to proceed merely because the exact costs cannot be accurately forecast at the time the commitment or decision is made. • The project’s or development’s ultimate success or failure is not a relevant factor to consider in determining whether a taxpayer has made a commitment or a decision to proceed (based on New Zealand and Australian case law, in contrast to Canadian case law). • Giving approval to a development or project in stages will not necessarily prevent there having been a commitment or a decision to proceed with a development that is capital in nature. A staged development may be used for various reasons, including accountability, reporting, or financial or budgetary capping. Once there is no longer a question of whether to proceed (ie, a commitment or a decision to proceed has been made), a taxpayer’s use of a staged development does not alter the commitment or decision that has been made to proceed. 191. Where expenditure on capital account leads to the acquisition of more than one asset, the expenditure should be spread across the assets acquired. The apportionment of the expenditure should be made on a basis that is appropriate in the circumstances. Example 4 192. A company owns and operates a specialised property business throughout New Zealand. The company investigates potential sites all over the country, identifies property developments considered to be economically feasible, and sells this information to potential developers. The investigation of potential sites usually involves an employee visiting the area, requesting information from the local authority about the property, obtaining a valuation and, in some cases, instructing architects to provide preliminary drawings to show how the property might best be developed. When it is perceived that there may be difficulties in obtaining planning consent or meeting resource management requirements in relation to the particular type of development, the company often instructs specialist planning consultants to provide preliminary advice. Information obtained is compiled into a report on the potential site and this report is offered to interested parties for a fee. 193. The costs incurred to date are deductible. They are incurred as part of the company’s normal and recurrent business operations. The costs incurred are an ordinary incident of carrying on the business of providing feasibility reports on potential property developments for reward. In addition, the expenditure is not directed to obtaining an enduring advantage. 42 Example 5 194. A company undertakes continual investigations into potential quarry sites as part of its normal business operations. When one or more sites are identified as feasible, the relevant information is provided to the company’s board of directors. The board considers the information and determines which sites the company will proceed to develop. 195. The expenditure of the company in undertaking its investigations into potential quarry sites is deductible. The expenditure is an ordinary incident of the company’s business and is for the purpose of gaining some reward from any site ultimately developed. The costs have been incurred in weighing up whether to proceed with a particular site and before any decision has been made to proceed with the acquisition or development of any particular site. The costs relate to providing the information the board needs to make an informed decision about whether to develop any particular site. However, once the board has decided to proceed with any particular site, any future costs incurred in relation to that particular site will be capitalised. Example 6 196. A competitor company also regularly seeks out new quarry sites (including sites that it could develop itself and existing quarries that it could purchase). In the 2007 income year, it investigated 20 potential sites for development and undertook geological surveys to determine the best sites for development. Engineering reports were commissioned on the top five sites and the results were presented to the board of directors. The board gave approval to develop two of the sites. 197. Further tests were undertaken and reports were commissioned to determine the most appropriate extraction location and depth at each site. A large earthquake occurred at one of the sites and the company abandoned work on it as it was no longer suitable for extraction. 198. Work continued on the second site, although the company was aware the water table levels might affect the depth at which material could be extracted, including a remote possibility that the levels would be too high to make the site a viable commercial proposition. 199. The expenditure incurred on the 18 sites that were not selected for development is on revenue account. The expenditure is of a type incurred frequently by the company in the course of its business and the company was still weighing up whether to proceed with the development of the sites. 200. Expenditure incurred after the board gave approval to develop the two sites is on capital account. The company had decided to proceed with the development of capital assets. This is the case notwithstanding that one of the sites was never successfully completed (because of the earthquake damage) and notwithstanding that the development of the second site was contingent on water levels not being too high. 43 201. Also in the 2007 income year, the company wished to purchase two existing quarries. It considered 20 quarries from which it hoped to find two to purchase. Ten of the quarries were situated in New Zealand and the remaining 10 were in Australia. Fifteen of the quarry owners were selling the quarries as stand-alone assets, while the remaining five were offering 100% of the shares in a subsidiary company that owned the quarries as their sole asset. 202. The company procured engineering reports on each of the sites to determine which would be suitable for its purposes. On the basis of the engineering reports non-binding bids were placed on three sites and two quarries were ultimately purchased. 203. Expenditure on the engineering reports is deductible. This is the case regardless of whether the quarries were situated inside or outside of New Zealand and whether the quarries were purchased as a stand-alone asset or by way of shares in an asset-owning company.
Interpretation Statement IS 09/01 FINES AND PENALTIES – INCOME TAX DEDUCTIBILITY All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. APPLICATION 1. This statement applies to fines and penalties imposed on a person under a statute or regulation. 2. This statement does not apply to: • fines and penalties imposed under a contract or as the result of a dispute between two commercial parties; • penalties for the late payment of an amount where the underlying amount payable is not payable as the result of a breach of statute or regulation; or • legal fees incurred in defending a fine or penalty. 3. Whether fines and penalties outside the scope of this statement are deductible will depend on the particular circumstances of the taxpayer and the nature of the fine or penalty. Where there is doubt as to the deductibility of such a fine or penalty, it may be necessary to obtain advice from a tax advisor. OVERVIEW 4. In several decided cases, a deduction for fines and penalties has been denied — either for failing the statutory nexus test or on public policy grounds. This statement examines the leading cases on fines and penalties with a view to determining the correct test or tests that apply in a New Zealand context. In many situations it will be clear that the breach of law (and associated fine or penalty) is too remote from the income-earning process. However, the statement concludes that irrespective of whether the statutory nexus is met, fines and penalties are not deductible in New Zealand because of the application of public policy considerations. 5. Fines and penalties are not deductible in New Zealand irrespective of whether the: • infringement for which the fine or penalty is imposed forms part of criminal proceedings; • fine is imposed by the court or another body; • fine is imposed on the taxpayer, its employees, or a third party; • taxpayer intended to break the law; or • fine is imposed in respect of a strict liability offence. 6. The item Deductibility of fines and levies paid by hotel licensees, Tax Information 1 Bulletin Vol 6, No 13 (May 1995) sets out the Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of certain expenditure incurred by hotel licensees. The discussion in the item that relates to the deductibility of fines paid by licensees does not reflect the law as it stands, so, to that extent, the item has been withdrawn effective from 15 October 2009 and taxpayers taking a taxpayer’s tax position after that date should not rely on the May 1995 item. However, where a taxpayer has previously taken a tax position in reliance on the statement, the Commissioner will not be devoting staff time and resources to investigating and reassessing in such cases. CHARACTER OF FINE OR PENALTY 7. This statement reviews the deductibility of payments that are in the nature of fines and penalties. When referring to fines or penalties, this statement is referring to forms of financial punishment imposed for carrying out some kind of prohibited activity and generally payable to the state or a representative of the public. The statement starts by reviewing the character or identifying features of fines and penalties. The relevant tests for deductibility are then applied with these characteristics in mind. The Oxford English Dictionary (11 th ed, 2006) provides the following definitions: Fine: A certain sum of money imposed as the penalty for an offence ... A penalty of any kind ... Penalty: A punishment imposed for breach of law, rule, or contract; a loss or disadvantage of some kind, prescribed by law for an offence, or agreed upon by the parties concerned in the case of breach of contract; esp. the payment of a sum of money imposed in such a case, or the sum of money itself; a fine. STATUTORY TEST OF DEDUCTIBILITY 8. Section DA 1(1) is the general deductibility provision. It provides: A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is – (a) incurred by them in deriving – (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving – (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. 9. In short, under section DA 1(1) an amount is an allowable deduction if a sufficient relationship is established between the expenditure or loss incurred and the derivation of income: CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236, 61,240; Buckley 2 and Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271, 61,274. 10. However, in several decisions the courts have denied a deduction for fines and penalties, even in situations where it would appear that the required relationship has been established. DEDUCTIBILITY OF FINES AND PENALTIES United Kingdom 11. IRC v Alexander von Glehn and Co Ltd (1919) 12 TC 233 is a leading case on fines and penalties. It followed the principles in the earlier English case of Strong v Woodifield (Surveyor of Taxes) 5 TC 215 (which it acknowledged was in a different context) and was also consistent with the decision in IRC v Warnes \[1919\] KB 444. Alexander von Glehn involved a company that carried on an exporting business and was fined £3,000 for exporting goods to Russia without taking appropriate precautions to ensure their ultimate destination was not enemy territory . The company’s claim to deduct that sum was rejected by the English Court of Appeal. In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal considered that, because the fine was imposed on the company for breaking the law, the expense could not be connected with or arising out of the company’s trade. 12. In Mann v Nash (1932) 16 TC 523, 529, Rowlatt J, referred to Alexander von Glehn, and observed that: the decision in the case was that payment of those penalties was nothing to do with the trade or business; it was not an expense for the earning of the profits, but it was an expense in the form of an inconvenience which supervened later when the profits were made, because illegality had been committed in the course of earning them. 13. The early United Kingdom decisions suggest that a deduction is denied on the basis that the required statutory connection or nexus between the fine or penalty and trading is absent. 14. More recently, the House of Lords in McKnight (Her Majesty's Inspector of Taxes) v Sheppard \[1999\] 3 All ER 491 discussed Alexander von Glehn. Lord Hoffmann had no doubt that Alexander von Glehn was correct. However, he observed (at p 485) that “the Court of Appeal was curiously inarticulate about why the fine was not money expended for the purposes of the trade”. His Lordship considered (at p 496) that the reason a fine is not deductible is not found in “the broad general principle of what counts as an allowable deduction”. Lord Hoffmann considered that the reason relates to the particular character of a fine or penalty. On this point, he said (at p 486): \[A fine or penalty’s\] purpose is to punish the taxpayer and a court may easily conclude that the legislative policy would be diluted if the taxpayer were allowed to share the burden of the rest of the community by deduction for the purposes of tax. This, I think, is what Lord Sterndale MR meant when he said that the fine was imposed ‘upon the company personally’. 15. This reasoning as to why a deduction for a fine or penalty is denied is commonly 3 referred to as the “public policy” reasons. Australia 16. The Australian courts have approached this matter in a similar way. Herald & Weekly Times Ltd v FCT (1932) 2 ATD 169 is a case dealing with the deductibility of damages for libel. The High Court held that the damages in that case were deductible. However, in the course of its judgment the High Court referred to the deductibility of fines and penalties. Gavan Duffy CJ and Dixon J said in their joint judgment (at p 172): The penalty is imposed as a punishment on the offender considered as a responsible person owing obedience to the law. Its nature severs it from the expenses of trading. It is inflicted on the offender as a personal deterrent, and it is not incurred by him in his character as a trader. 17. Under this view, a fine or penalty is not incurred by an offender acting in the capacity of a trader because it fails to satisfy the requisite statutory connection as a relevant outgoing incurred in deriving assessable income. 18. Magna Alloys and Research Pty Ltd v FCT 80 ATC 4,542 considered whether the taxpayer was able to deduct legal costs in the defence of criminal proceedings. The court found that the payments were deductible. In the course of their judgment, Deane and Fisher JJ expressed unease as to the reasons given for denying deductibility in earlier cases on the deductibility of fines and penalties. Deane and Fisher JJ preferred to base the denial on public policy considerations. They said (at p 4,563): It is somewhat difficult to understand how it can be maintained, as an unqualified proposition, that the nature of a penalty severs it from the expenses of trading. Recurrent penalties for parking infringements incurred by a delivery man and per diem penalties for unlawfully using premises for business or commercial purposes in contravention of zoning requirements are not, for example, logically severed from the expenses of trading. The same can be said of fines imposed for actually engaging in some unlawful activities, such as illegal bookmaking or soliciting, the purposes of earning assessable income. If, when the matter directly arises for decision in the Australian courts, it is to be held that all fines and penalties are to be denied deductibility under the Act, it would seem preferable that it be on the basis of some perceived overriding consideration of public policy which precludes deductibility. Even in that event however, it would not necessarily follow that, as a matter of overriding principle, a deduction should be refused in respect of a taxpayer’s costs of defending the proceedings in which the penalty was imposed upon him. \[Emphasis added\] 19. In Mayne Nickless Ltd v FCT (1984) 15 ATR 752 (Supreme Court of Victoria), the taxpayer, a transport operator who ran armoured cars, had incurred a multitude of fines and penalties related to a variety of motoring offences. Ormiston J examined all the relevant authorities and concluded that none of the outgoings was deductible. 20. In relation to the fines imposed directly on the company and paid by it, Ormiston 4 J followed earlier High Court decisions and found that the payments were not deductible. Ormiston J also held amounts paid by the company for fines and penalties imposed on employees, independent contractors, or persons other than the taxpayer should be precluded on the grounds of public policy (at p 772): The critical feature of the fines and penalties are that they are imposed for purposes of the law in order to punish breaches thereof and that makes it undesirable that they should be deductible, whether for serious or minor regulatory offences and whether they are imposed directly on the taxpayer or on its employees or third party contractors. In the latter case the policy of the law ought not to differ whether or not the money was originally paid by, or the original liability fell on, persons other than the taxpayer. \[Emphasis added\] 21. In discussing public policy, Ormiston J continued (at p 772): Many aspects of public policy have been and remain controversial largely because the courts have attempted to express and apply policies which did not derive directly from the common law or statute, but were derived from what were said to be accepted social or economic beliefs at the time. These beliefs have not always remained constant, so that difficulties arise in determining whether 'public policy' can change or expand. 22. Madad Pty Ltd v FCT \[1984\] 15 ATR 1,118 was the first time this issue had come directly before the full Federal Court. Madad concerned the deductibility of a penalty imposed on the taxpayer under the Trade Practices Act 1974. The court considered that the penalty was not deductible (at p 1,124): We are of the view that the deductions claimed should not be allowed. We placed this decision on the basis of the acceptance in Snowden and Willson \[99 CLR 431\]... of what was said in the cases we have referred to. The acceptance in the High Court, albeit by way of dicta, of the earlier dicta in England and in Herald and Weekly Times \[ (1932) 2 ATD 169\] ... indicates in our view an approach to the construction of s 51(1) which we should follow. The approach may well have its origins in public policy. In any event, it has been of long standing, and having in mind the application it must have had over many years, we should not disturb it, for reasons similar to those stated by Dixon CJ in Lunney's case \[100 CLR 478\]. Canada 23. The Canadian courts initially denied deductions for fines or penalties on the basis of overriding public policy considerations. For example, in King Grain and Seed Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue (1961) 26 Tax ABC 436, the taxpayer operated a fleet of trucks and sought to deduct a highway fine levied against it for overloading one of its trucks. The Tax Appeal Board disallowed the claim, stating (at p 439): \[It\] would be contrary to accepted principles if the present appellant, King Grain and Seed Company, was allowed to deduct the amount of this fine ... and thus be enabled to share with the public revenue the loss which it was condemned by reason of its own negligence. 24. Over time, however, the Canadian courts have modified their approach. Day & Ross Ltd v The Queen \[1976\] CTC 707 was a trucking case in which the taxpayer 5 had incurred fines in excess of $70,000 over several years for the violation of various highway weight restrictions. The Federal Court held that the fines were deductible. This was followed in the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal in Amway of Canada v The Queen \[1996\] 2 CTC 162. In Amway, the Federal Court of Appeal recognised that: \[t\]here emerges in the jurisprudence and the literature a recognition of two possible criteria for deciding whether amounts expended for the payment of fines or penalties should be deductible as a business expense. The first test is whether it was an expense incurred for the purpose of earning income. ... The second criterion sometimes invoked is that of public policy: that is, even if the expense was incurred to produce income would it be contrary to public policy to allow a taxpayer to reduce his net income, and thus save taxes, by virtue of having been obliged to pay a fine or penalty for some wrongdoing? 25. The court in Amway discussed Alexander von Glehn and continued (at p 171): An observation made by Lord Sterndale, M.R. is of interest given the later developments in Canadian jurisprudence. He stated: Now what is the position here? This business could perfectly well be carried on without any infraction of the law at all. This penalty was imposed because of an infraction of the law and that does not seem to me to be, any more than the expense which had to be paid in the case of Strong v. Woodifield \[(1906) 5 T.C. 215\] appeared to Lord Davey to be, a disbursement or expense which was laid out or expended for the purpose of such trade, manufacture, adventure or concern; nor does it seem to me, though this is rather more questionable, to be a sum paid on account of a loss connected with or arising out of such trade, manufacture, adventure or concern. This concept of avoidability of a penalty, as a test of whether its payment amounts to a business expense, has been developed, I believe correctly, in decisions of the Federal Court Trial Division. 26. The court in Amway continued (at p 172): With respect to the first criterion I believe that one legitimate test of whether fines should be deductible as a business expense is that of avoidability of the offences... In adopting this test of avoidability of the offences leading to fines, and thus the avoidability of this particular type of expense, I do not purport to pronounce a more general rule concerning the deductibility of other types of expense. The question here is not: could the taxpayer have run his business more cheaply? It is: could the taxpayer have reasonably been expected to run his business in consistent conformity to this kind of law? ... Secondly, in my view it is contrary to public policy to allow the deduction of a fine or penalty as a business expense where that fine or penalty is imposed by law for the purpose of punishing and deterring those who through intention or a lack of reasonable care violate the laws. In a case such as the present the penalties are fixed by statute (albeit that the Minister first remitted about one third of the penalty and ultimately settled for less than one third of the total penalty owing under statute). It would frustrate the purposes of the penalties imposed by Parliament if after paying those penalties exigible by law a taxpayer were then able to share the cost of that penalty — and the higher his marginal rate of taxation the more he could share — with other taxpayers of Canada by treating it as a deductible expense and thus reducing his taxable 6 income. Such a result would, I believe, clearly be contrary to public policy. Suggestions that instead a court imposing a penalty can augment it in anticipation of the accused being able to deduct the fine from his taxable income are not applicable to a situation such as this where the penalties are specifically defined by statute. Nor do I believe that sentencing courts should be required to anticipate the value of an income tax deduction to a penalized party. For this reason I think that the deductibility of penalties set by courts exercising their discretion should be subject to the same rules as I have elaborated above in respect of a penalty set by statute. 27. Under this approach, for a fine or penalty to be deductible, the taxpayer needs to satisfy two requirements. First, the fine or penalty must have been incurred for the purpose of producing income, and this condition is satisfied only where the incurring of the fine or penalty is considered to be an unavoidable incident of carrying on the business. In other words, could the taxpayer have been reasonably expected to run a business in consistent conformity to this kind of law? The focus is on whether the taxpayer could reasonably be expected to avoid breaking the law. 28. The second requirement requires an examination of the public policy concerns behind the particular fine or penalty. In the view of the Federal Court of Appeal in Amway (at p 173): it is contrary to public policy to allow the deduction of a fine or penalty as a business expense where that fine or penalty is imposed by law for the purpose of punishing and deterring those who through intention or a lack of reasonable care violate the laws. 29. Canada has since introduced legislation to prohibit the deductibility of fines and penalties. New Zealand 30. Several cases in New Zealand have considered the deductibility of fines and penalties. 31. Robinson v CIR \[1965\] NZLR 246 considered whether fines imposed on the taxpayer by the New Zealand Law Society constituted a “loss exclusively incurred in the production of assessable income”. Tompkins J considered whether the fines were similar to a penalty inflicted by a court for a breach of the law, which would preclude the deduction, or whether the fines were so different in character that they did not come within the prohibition. Tompkins J said (at p 250): In my opinion there is no distinction in principle between a claim to be entitled to deduct from assessable income a fine imposed by the Disciplinary Committee and a fine imposed by a Court. It seems to me that all the passages quoted from the cases of Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Warnes, Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Von Glehn, and Herald and Weekly Times Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation ... apply in principle to such a fine. It is inflicted on the offender as a penal liability; it is a fine imposed on the offender for professional misconduct; it is inflicted on the offender as a personal deterrent and a punishment. ... a payment of damages for professional negligence is a loss which is in truth exclusively incurred as part of the operations reasonably incidental to the 7 production of income because it is a loss arising directly out of and in the course of the practice of the profession; the risk of overlooking a time limit due to pressure of work or other negligent acts is one which must be necessarily incidental to the practice. But the fine imposed for the negligent act is quite different from the payment of damages suffered by a client by reason thereof. It is a personal penalty imposed as a personal deterrent and punishment and not a loss incurred in the legal business. It has no relation to what would be called a trading loss in an ordinary business. Whether it is a capital loss I am not called upon to decide. But I am clear that it is a loss which comes within s 110 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 and is not deductible. ... Here it seems to me that the fines totalling £500 are certainly a loss in the sense that the appellant has had to pay the fine. They are, of course, incurred during the time that the income was being produced. It is noteworthy, however, that the fines were partly imposed because the appellant failed to answer letters from the Law Society relating to the complaint and that can have little to do with the production of income. But is it fairly incidental to the carrying of the appellant's profession that he should be guilty of professional misconduct so as to render him liable to fines? I think not. They are a punishment imposed on him personally rather than a loss suffered in the practice of his profession. \[Emphasis added\] 32. The taxpayer in Case F126 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,174 was sentenced to imprisonment and fined in relation to dealing in illicit drugs. The Taxation Review Authority considered (at p 60,172) that this case did not seem to be “an appropriate one to endeavour to distinguish it from the principles laid down in Robinson's case”. 33. However, the Taxation Review Authority suggested (at p 60,177) that, in certain circumstances, a fine and penalty may be treated as: akin to an operating cost of \[the taxpayer’s\] business, in the nature of fines for parking infringements or loading offences as a business expense \[provided\] a sufficient and an appropriate relationship \[can be found\] between the gaining or producing of assessable income and the expenditure for the fine. 34. Case K62 (1988) 10 NZTC 504 concerned a claim by a self-employed taxpayer for a deduction for the payment of three traffic fines. The Taxation Review Authority agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that the classical position regarding the deductibility of fines and penalties is that no deduction is available for any penalty or fine paid for a breach of law. However, during the course of its determination, the Taxation Review Authority observed that (at p 506): it is conceivable that traffic fines could, in special circumstances, be deductible business expenditure even under New Zealand law. For instance, if a mail courier company is required by an important customer to urgently deliver a package to a downtown city office, it may reasonably be only able to carry out the instructions by double parking and (possibly) incurring a traffic infringement notice. In that situation, the traffic fine might well be deductible under sec 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976. 35. The taxpayer in Case L15 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,113 was involved in an accident while driving home. He was subsequently convicted and fined and disqualified 8 from holding a driver’s licence for 12 months. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for the legal fees incurred in defending the prosecutions, the court fine and costs, and the repair costs of both cars. 36. The Taxation Review Authority referred to Case K62 where it said that a deduction might be available in special circumstances. However, in this case no deduction was allowed because (at p 1,116): the objector had incurred the fine and Court costs because of criminal conduct. That activity was not conducted in the course of any income earning process. That expenditure was of a private character and could not be deductible. Such connection as there may be between the fine (and Court costs) and the income producing activity or process of the objector as a real estate agent is insufficient for tax deductibility. In any event, under my interpretation of New Zealand law, expenses resulting from a breach of the law are generally not deductible. 37. In Nicholas Nathan Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,213, a deduction was disallowed for fines imposed under the Trade and Industry Act 1956 as a result of a company importing goods in excess of its licence. In dealing with the general issue of the deductibility of fines Sinclair J said (at p 6,217): When one analyses the problem in light of the various decided cases, ..., any severance based on illegality is somewhat artificial and it is preferable to rely upon public policy considerations which, in reality, form the basis of the earlier decisions. \[Emphasis added\] 38. His Honour continued (at p 6,218): From an overall appreciation of all the decisions, I am of the view that where a fine or penalty is imposed by the Courts resulting from a breach of the law, no deduction ought to be allowed for to do so would be to prefer business lawbreakers over individuals as the business lawbreaker would obtain the benefit of deductibility of the amount of the fine or penalty whereas the individual would have to bear that particular expense personally. Additionally it would tend to allow, and encourage, lawbreaking and in some instances, to even treat it as a legitimate business option resulting in deductibility. 39. The most recent case to consider the deductibility of fines is Case Z6 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,068. Case Z6 involved the deductibility of fines imposed on a transport company for alleged overloading of its trucks. Barber DJ considered previous case law from New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada and concluded the fines were not deductible. The conclusion was based on there being insufficient nexus and also public policy reasons: \[109\] However, it seems to me that a business should operate within the law. The disputant’s business of carting logs on large trucks and trailers is able to comply with the law, but there is expense involved in weight-of-load compliance and such non- compliance can involve a relatively modest amount of annual fines. It seems to me to be illogical to seek to deduct fines relating to a breach of the law as if they were a business expense, because they relate to activities which do not confirm to the law and so are not within the permitted scope of the business. I consider that a penalty/fine arising from a taxpayer’s illegal activities (i.e. transporting too- 9 heavy a load) cannot have a sufficient nexus with the taxpayer’s income earning process so as to create deductibility for that cost of the fine. ... \[111\] In any case, under the doctrine of precedent I am bound, by the 1989 High Court decision of Nicholas Nathan Ltd and Anor v CIR where Sinclair J held that deductibility of fines should not be allowed on the grounds of public policy. It would be contrary to public policy to allow such fines paid by logging transport companies to be deducted from their revenue earnings. It makes no difference to my reasoning whether the objector company incurred the fines or whether its drivers incurred them but the objector paid them. The public policy approach readily leads to a denial of deductibility for fines; but the nexus approach is not so easy to apply. \[Emphasis added\] 40. Barber DJ also distinguished (for deductibility purposes) illegal businesses from legal businesses that have fines imposed on them for breaches of the law: \[110\] I realise that there are activities which are illegal/criminal, e.g. drug dealing, types of gambling, dealing in stolen goods, and (until recently) prostitution, but which the IRD (in confidence) have treated as businesses and taxed after allowing appropriate deductions (but not for fines). At law, those activities seem to be businesses if there is a sufficient level of activity and the intention of profit. However, the present case is about the deductibility of fines imposed for breach of the law as distinct from assessibility of profits of a business activity which is illegal and allowable deductions when assessing that profit. 41. In the course of his judgment (and after considering relevant earlier case law), Barber DJ concluded that fines were not deductible irrespective of whether the: • infringement for which the fine or penalty is imposed forms part of criminal proceedings; • fine is imposed by the court or another body; • fine is imposed on the taxpayer, its employees, or third party contractors; • the taxpayer intended to break the law; and • fine is imposed for a strict liability offence. SUMMARY OF THE JUDICIAL APPROACHES TO THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF FINES AND PENALTIES 42. From the above cases the following trends and principles can be extracted: a) The courts of New Zealand, Australia, and United Kingdom all deny a deduction for any payment in the nature of a fine or penalty. b) In reaching this conclusion, the two main strands of reasoning are that the payment fails to satisfy the requisite statutory deductibility test and overriding public policy considerations exist. c) In the early cases, the United Kingdom and Australian courts considered that, because a fine or penalty is imposed for breaking the law or to punish an offender, it necessarily followed that the payments made lack sufficient connection with the expenses of trading, so were non-deductible. 10 d) In certain circumstances it is conceivable that the incurring of the fine or penalty has a strong connection with the derivation of income. Dicta in some cases suggest that a deduction may be available if a sufficient and an appropriate relationship can be found between the gaining or producing of assessable income and the expenditure for the fine (see, eg, Case F126 and Case K62). e) More recent Australian, United Kingdom, and New Zealand cases now support the public policy approach (McKnight v Sheppard, Madad, Nicholas Nathan). f) Robinson makes it clear that there can be no distinction in principle between a claim to be entitled to deduct a fine imposed by a disciplinary committee and one imposed by a court. g) Case law also supports the view that fines and penalties paid on behalf of an employee or independent contractor are not deductible to the party paying the fine (Mayne Nickless, Nicholas Nathan, Case Z6). While the cases acknowledge that nexus may be satisfied where a taxpayer (for commercial reasons) voluntarily pays fines imposed on an employee or contractor, it has nonetheless been consistently held that public policy considerations prohibit deductions in such cases. It is also noted that additional income tax implications (such as PAYE) could arise where a taxpayer pays a fine on behalf of a third party. h) The Commissioner’s view is that the prohibition on deductibility also applies to taxpayers paying fines on behalf of other third parties, irrespective of the relationship between the person incurring the fine and the person paying it (such as an advisor paying a fine on behalf of a client). It could be argued that the payment of a fine in such circumstances is more akin to a payment of damages and deductibility should not be denied. However, it is considered that the situation is analogous to payments of fines incurred by employees and contractors and the public policy considerations set out above would be defeated if any person was allowed a deduction. Further, Ormiston J arguably contemplated the extension of the prohibition to other third parties, when he noted “\[in\] the latter case the policy of the law ought not to differ whether or not the money was originally paid by, or the original liability fell on, persons other than the taxpayer”. ROLE OF PUBLIC POLICY 43. Public policy is based on the premise that the law should serve the public interest. It assists judges in the concurrent development of the common law and statutory interpretation. 44. Public policy is never static: it evolves over time. This evolution is due to the constant change in the wide sphere of interest that constitutes the public 11 interest. For example, changes in society’s economic needs, social costs, customs, and moral aspirations can affect the public interest. Although public policy may change in response to signals from any part of society at any time, changes usually occur incrementally. 45. This functional aspect separates public policy from rules of law. Public policy is a collection of principles that judges consider the law has a duty to uphold. This distinction is important because, although a rule of law binds, a principle merely guides. If an Act incorporates a rule, that rule is binding for the purposes of the Act. In contrast, as a principle is not binding, it leaves scope for more flexible application depending on the circumstances of a particular case. However, while there is flexibility in the application of judicial principles, it is expected that judges take heed of the principles in relevant cases. Nature of public policy in the context of fines and penalties 46. The following statements are representative of judicial statements in relation to the public policy reasons why fines and penalties should not be deductible. Ormiston J in Mayne Nickless said (at p773): Fines and penalties are imposed for purposes of the law to punish breaches. This deterrent aspect makes it undesirable for a fine to be deductible. To allow such deductions is seen as frustrating the legislative intent, as the punishment imposed will be seen to be, diminished or lightened. 47. Sinclair J in Nicholas Nathan said (at p 6,218): From an overall appreciation of all the decisions, I am of the view that where a fine or penalty is imposed by the Courts resulting from a breach of the law, no deduction ought to be allowed for to do so would be to prefer business lawbreakers over individuals as the business lawbreaker would obtain the benefit of deductibility of the amount of the fine or penalty whereas the individual would have to bear that particular expense personally. Additionally it would tend to allow, and encourage, lawbreaking and in some instances, to even treat it as a legitimate business option resulting in deductibility. 48. In both Mayne Nickless and Nicholas Nathan, the courts considered that the public interest is not served by providing a corresponding tax saving to taxpayers for fines and penalties imposed on them for breaches of the law. In particular, it is considered that allowing deductibility would diminish the punitive nature of fines and penalties, treat business lawbreakers more favourably than non- business lawbreakers, and encourage lawbreaking as a legitimate business option. Departures, in similar contexts, from the public policy approach 49. Public policy plays an important role in relation to the tax deductibility of fines and penalties. From the perspective of serving the public interest, the general aim of the public policy approach to fines and penalties is understandable. It is interesting to note that the approach to deny deductibility has not been adopted in cases involving illegality or damages. This is because the public policy focus is 12 not on the unlawful conduct but on the fine itself and the reason it was imposed. For example, the public policy approach is not invoked to deny deductibility in three areas: for expenses legally incurred by an illegal business, illegal expenses incurred by legal businesses, and damages for civil wrongs. Expenses legally incurred by an illegal business 50. The Act does not discriminate between legal and illegal activities (Ministry of Finance v Smith \[1927\] AC193 and Case Z6). The connection between the expense and the income-earning activity is relevant, not the legality of the activity. In Nicholas Nathan, the Commissioner submitted that the legal expenses the taxpayer incurred should be disallowed because they were incurred by the taxpayer illegally importing goods rather than for carrying on its business. The court rejected this submission. However, the court considered that as the necessity for “legal advice”, after the illegal acts, was commercially prudent and an exercise of damage control, the legal costs were connected with the income- earning process. Additionally, the court was in no doubt that if the taxpayer had taken legal advice before importing the goods, the cost would have been allowed as a deductible expense. Illegal expenses incurred by legal businesses 51. A taxpayer carrying on a lawful business that incurs illegal expenses may deduct the cost of the illegal expenses, but not the fines levied because of the outlay. For example, no issue arose in Magna Alloys as to the deductibility of the illegal commissions paid to employees of its customers. Damages for civil wrongs 52. Damages are a loss suffered because of an activity prohibited or punishable by the common law but, as held in Herald and Weekly Times, they may be deductible. SUMMARY OF THE NEW ZEALAND APPROACH 53. In the Commissioner’s view, no income tax deduction is available in New Zealand for any fine or penalty to which this statement applies (see paragraphs 1 and 2). Irrespective of whether the statutory nexus is met, fines and penalties are not deductible in New Zealand because of the application of public policy considerations. This is the case irrespective of whether the: • infringement for which the fine or penalty is imposed forms part of criminal proceedings; • fine is imposed by the court or another body; • fine is imposed on the taxpayer, its employees, or a third party; • taxpayer intended to break the law; or • fine is imposed for a strict liability offence. 13

This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on determining whether an item in a residential rental property is a separate item of depreciable property, or is part of the building. It concludes that if an item in a residential rental property is distinct from the building and it meets the definition of “depreciable property”, it may be separately depreciated. If an item is part of the building, it cannot be separately depreciated, but can be depreciated with the building. 2. A residential rental property is comprised of several different items. It is important that the correct approach is applied to determine whether these items are regarded as distinct from or part of the building, because this affects the depreciation rate to be applied and the tax treatment of expenditure on repairs. 3. Sometimes different approaches have been taken in respect of the depreciation treatment of some items within a residential rental property. For example, questions have arisen as to whether items relating to the residential property (eg plumbing and piping, electrical wiring, internal walls, and doors) are to be treated as part of the building or as items separate from the building. The Commissioner considers that it is not correct to break down a residential rental property into such separate items for depreciation purposes. While this statement applies only in respect of residential rental properties, many of the principles are also likely to apply in the context of commercial properties and other assets. 4. The Commissioner concludes that the approach to determine whether a particular item is part of or separate from the building, is to apply the following three-step test: Step 1: Determine whether the item is in some way attached or connected to the building. If the item is completely unattached, then it will not form a part of the building. An item will not be considered attached for these purposes, if its only means of attachment is being plugged or wired into an electrical outlet (such as a freestanding oven), or attached to a water or gas outlet. If the item is attached to the building, go to step 2. Step 2: Determine whether the item is an integral part of the residential rental property such that a residential rental property would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item. If the item is an integral part of the residential rental property, then the item will be a part of the building. If the item is not an integral part of the residential rental property, go to step 3. Step 3: Determine whether the item is built-in or attached or connected to the building in such a way that it is part of the “fabric” of the building. Consider factors such as the nature and degree of attachment, the difficulty involved in the item’s removal, and whether there would be any significant damage to the item or the building if the item were removed. If the item is part of the fabric of the building, then it is part of the building for depreciation purposes. 5. In summary, the legal reasons for applying this approach to determine whether an item should be treated as a separate item or as part of the building are as follows. 6. The history of depreciation supports this approach: 3 • While section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 did not state how to determine whether an asset was a separate item or part of the building, it was implicit that the approach taken under section 108 was to determine whether the item could be broken down into separate items in order to apply the provision. (Under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 depreciation was combined with the repairs and maintenance provisions. Section 108 allowed for deductions in respect of repairs and the maintenance of an “asset”, as well as providing for depreciation allowances in respect of any such “asset” that met the other requirements of the section.) • The case law relating to section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 confirmed that the approach was to determine whether an item was a separate item or part of the building. While these cases dealt with repairs and maintenance rather than depreciation, the linkages between repairs and maintenance and depreciation under section 108, indicated that the same approach would have been applied if a case had arisen in the depreciation context. • Analogous case law from other jurisdictions also supports the approach. While none of the cases definitively explains how to determine the relevant asset for depreciation purposes, factors taken from the case law support the above test. 7. The enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004, and Income Tax Act 2007 were not intended to depart from the approach of determining whether an item was a separate item or part of the building: • Nothing in section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the legislative background to section EG 1 indicated an intention to depart from the need to establish whether an item was a separate item or part of the building in the context of depreciation. • The word “asset” was replaced with the word “property” in section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, but the ordinary meanings of these two words are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably. This change in wording did not reflect an intention to depart from the approach taken under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Also, several sections concerning depreciation continued to use the word “asset”. • While the 1991 Valabh Committee report recommended that the repairs and maintenance and depreciation provisions be separated, it did not suggest that the approach of determining whether an item could be broken into separate items or not should be altered (Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, Tax Accounting Issues (Consultative Committee, Wellington, 1991)). • In addition, nothing in Determination DEP 1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (DEP 1), the relevant depreciation determination, suggests it was intended to depart from the need to determine whether an item was separate to, or part of, the building or that the breaking down of an item into separate items was the preferred approach. 4 • The words used under the current depreciation provisions do not suggest a meaning that is different to that in section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. In particular, there were no relevant intended policy changes included in schedule 22A of the Income Tax Act 2004 or schedule 51 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 8. It is also concluded that the approach taken in the statement is not altered by the operation of section EE 37. Under this section, when a taxpayer makes a capital improvement to an item of depreciable property that improvement is depreciated at the same applicable rate as that applied to the item improved, although it is possible for a taxpayer to choose to treat the improvement as a separate item. Such an election permits a taxpayer to take advantage of any favourable change to the depreciation rate applicable to that item. However, the depreciation treatment of the improvement does not alter the approach outlined in this statement, which determines whether an item is a separate item or part of the building. The depreciation rate of an improvement can be determined only once the item of depreciable property that is subject to the improvement has been properly identified using the approach outlined in this statement. 9. The appendix to this statement contains examples illustrating how the Commissioner considers the test would apply to some specific assets. The examples do not cover every possible item, but they give a practical application of the test to some items. The assets covered are: • plumbing and piping • electrical wiring • internal walls • internal and external doors • garage doors (when the garage is part of the residential rental building) • fitted furniture (wardrobes and cupboards built into the wall) • kitchen cupboards • bathroom fittings and furniture • wardrobes and cupboards not built into the wall • carpets • linoleum • tiles (wall and floor) • curtains • blinds • water heaters and hot-water cylinders. 10. The plumbing and piping, electrical wiring, internal walls, internal and external doors, garage doors (when the garage is part of the residential rental building), fitted furniture (wardrobes and cupboards built into the wall), kitchen cupboards, bathroom fittings and furniture, linoleum, and tiles (wall and floor) are not separate assets, but are part of the building. Wardrobes and cupboards not built into the wall, carpets, curtains, blinds and water heaters and hot-water cylinders can be regarded as separate from the building, so can be depreciated at a different rate. Application 11. On 29 May 2006, IRD released a media statement setting out the Commissioner’s view that residential rental property owners breaking up their properties into smaller components in order to get higher 5 depreciation rates for tax purposes was not allowed under the law. The media statement listed a number of components and stated whether they were considered to be separately depreciable or part of the building. A copy of the media statement can be obtained from the IRD website (http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/media-centre/media- releases/2006/media-release-2006-05-29a.html). 12. The media statement also contained a transitional approach to assist taxpayers who had been claiming too much depreciation to amend their positions going forward. IRD has been applying the position set out in the media statement since it was issued and will continue to do so. 13. This statement does not consider the deductibility of expenditure on repairs and maintenance. However, it is noted that some expenditure upon an item that may have been regarded as a separate asset under the “smallest asset” approach might be deductible as repairs and maintenance under the approach taken in this statement. This is because, whereas expenditure on a separate item of property may have to be treated as capital, if the item is more correctly characterised as a small part of a larger item, the expenditure may qualify as repairs and maintenance. However, this does not mean that all expenditure on objects that are part of the building under the approach taken in this statement will necessarily be deductible as repairs and maintenance. The Commissioner’s view is that the conclusions in this statement do not affect the capital / revenue distinction established by case law. Background 14. Depreciation is an allowance for tax purposes to take account of the fact assets used in deriving income wear out or become obsolete, even though they are maintained and repaired. This reducing value is recognised for tax purposes by allowing a deduction against income for depreciation for the time the assets are used in earning income. 15. To claim a depreciation deduction for an asset the: • property must be depreciable property; • taxpayer must own the property; • property has to be used, or be available to be used, by the taxpayer in deriving income; and • depreciation loss has to be calculated under sections EE 9 to EE 11. 16. Before depreciation can be claimed, the relevant item needs to be identified. This statement sets out the correct approach to use, in the context of a residential rental property, when identifying whether an item is a separate item of depreciable property that can be depreciated separately or whether it forms part of a building and must be depreciated with the building. 6 Legislation: Income Tax Act 2007 17. Section EE 1(1) is as follows: EE 1 What this subpart does Quantifying amounts of depreciation loss and depreciation recovery income (1) This subpart— (a) quantifies the amount of depreciation loss for which a person is allowed a deduction if the provisions of Part D (Deductions) are met; and (b) quantifies the amount of depreciation recovery income that is income under Part C (Income). 18. Section EE 6(1) is as follows: EE 6 What is depreciable property? Description (1) Depreciable property is property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use— (a) in deriving assessable income; or (b) in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Subsections (2) to (4) expand on this subsection. 19. Section EE 7 is as follows: EE 7 What is not depreciable property? The following property is not depreciable property: (a) land, although buildings, fixtures, and the improvements listed in schedule 13 (Depreciable land improvements) are depreciable property if they are described by section EE 6(1): (b) trading stock: (c) livestock to which subpart EB (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock)) applies: (d) financial arrangements: (e) excepted financial arrangements: 7 (f) property that will not decline in value, as far as its owner is concerned, because, when they dispose of it, they have a right to be compensated for any decline in its value: (g) property that its owner chooses, under section EE 8, to treat as not depreciable: (h) property that its owner chooses, under section EE 38, to deal with under that section: (i) property for whose cost a person other than the property’s owner is allowed a deduction: (j) property for whose cost a person is allowed a deduction under a provision of this Act outside this subpart or under a provision of an earlier Act, except for an asset to which section DU 6(4) (Depreciation) applies. 20. Section EE 9(1) and (2) is as follows: EE 9 Description of elements of calculation Depreciation methods (1) Sections EE 12 to EE 24 deal with the methods of calculating an amount of depreciation loss. The methods are— (a) the straight-line method, which is dealt with in sections EE 13 to EE 19; and (b) the diminishing value method, which is also dealt with in sections EE 13 to EE 19; and (c) the pool method, which is dealt with in sections EE 20 to EE 24. Depreciation rates (2) Sections EE 26 to EE 36 deal with the rates of depreciation. The rates are— (a) the economic rate, which is dealt with in section EE 26; and (b) the annual rate, which is dealt with in sections EE 31, EE 33, and EE 34; and (c) a special rate or a provisional rate, both of which are dealt with in sections EE 35 and EE 36. 21. Section EE 37(1) to (5) is as follows: EE 37 Improvements When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person makes an improvement to an item of depreciable property. Income year in which improvement made 8 (2) In the income year in which the person makes the improvement, the provisions of this subpart apply to the improvement, as if it were a separate item of depreciable property, in the period that— (a) starts at the start of the month in which the person first uses the improvement or has it available for use; and (b) ends at the end of the income year. Following income years (3) For income years following the income year in which the person makes the improvement,— (a) a person who uses the diminishing value method or the straight- line method for the item that was improved may choose to apply subsection (4) or (5): (b) a person who uses the pool method for the item that was improved must apply subsections (6) and (7). Improvement treated as separate item (4) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), a person may choose to treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property. Improvement treated as part of item (5) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), a person may choose to treat the improvement as part of the item of depreciable property that was improved. They must do 1 of the following for the first income year, after the income year in which they made the improvement, in which they use the improvement or have it available for use: (a) if they use the diminishing value method for the item, add the improvement’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year: (b) if they use the straight-line method for the item,— (i) add the improvement’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; and (ii) add the improvement’s cost to the item’s cost. 22. Section EE 67 (other definitions) defines “improvement” when used in the Act as follows: improvement means an alteration, extension, or repair of an item of depreciable property that increases its capital value. 23. Determinations are subordinate or delegated legislation, so it is also appropriate to refer to the relevant parts of the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. 9 24. The introduction to DEP 1 is as follows: 1. Application This determination shall apply to every item of depreciable property acquired on or after 1 April 1993. 2. Determination Pursuant to section 108C of the Income Tax Act 1976 I have determined the basic economic depreciation rates for all depreciable property other than fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property to be the rates specified in the schedule to this determination. 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise required, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1976. 25.

It has been argued that all of the items that make up a residential rental property should be depreciated separately. This is effectively a “smallest asset” approach since it involves breaking down the larger item (the residential rental property) into smaller components. Alternatively, it has been argued that this is not the appropriate approach, because frequently there will be cases where it is the combination of these smaller components that is to be treated as the one depreciable item. 28. To establish the correct approach to be applied for determining the appropriate depreciation rates in a residential rental property context, the following matters need to be considered: • The approach required under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. • The approach taken by the New Zealand courts. • The approach taken by the United Kingdom and Australian courts. • The approach applied under the amendments to the depreciation regime in 1993, which were incorporated into the Income Tax Act 1994. 13 • The approach taken under the Income Tax Act 2004. • The approach taken under the Income Tax Act 2007. Section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 29. Section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 stated that: (1) Notwithstanding anything in section 104 of this Act, in calculating the assessable income derived by any person from any source no deduction shall, except as expressly provided in this Act, be made in respect of any of the following sums or matters, namely, the repair of premises, or the repair of plant, machinery, or equipment used in the production of income, beyond the sum usually expended in any year for those purposes: Provided that in cases where— (a) Depreciation of any such asset, not being plant, machinery, or equipment, or a temporary building, is caused by fair wear and tear: (b) Depreciation of any such asset, being plant, machinery, or equipment, or a temporary building, is caused by fair wear and tear or by the fact of the asset becoming obsolete or useless,— And, in either case, the depreciation cannot be made good by repair, the Commissioner may, subject to sections 111, 111A and 117 of this Act, allow such deduction as he thinks just: Provided also that where the Commissioner is satisfied that any repairs or alterations of any such asset do not increase the capital value of the asset, or that the repairs or alterations increase that value by an amount less than the cost of the repairs or alterations, he may allow such deduction as he thinks just: Provided further that the Commissioner shall not allow any deduction under this section in respect of any repair, alteration, or depreciation of any asset where, and to the extent that, that asset is used by a private company (as defined in section 2 of the Companies Act 1955) in the providing, before the 1st day of April 1989, of a benefit (being a benefit that is, or that would, but for the provisions of paragraphs (f) to (n) of the definition of the expression “fringe benefit” in section 336N(1) of this Act, be, a fringe benefit within the meaning of that definition) to any person who, in relation to the private company, is a major shareholder. (2) Without limiting the discretion of the Commissioner under this section, it is hereby declared that he may refuse in whole or in part to allow any deduction under the first proviso to subsection (1) of this section in any case where he is not satisfied that complete and satisfactory accounts have been kept by or on behalf of the taxpayer. \[Emphasis added\] 30. It is important to understand what is meant by “asset”, because this is what the allowable repairs and maintenance deduction or depreciation allowance was based on. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (5th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002) defines “asset” as follows: 14 Asset: 1. In pl. Sufficient estate or effects for an executor to discharge a testator’s debts and legacies. 2. In pl. any property or effects available to meet the debts of a testator, debtor or company, whether sufficient or not; sing. An item of property or an effect so available. 3. fig. A thing or person of use or value. 31. Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis NZ, Wellington, 2005) defines “asset” as follows: asset: ... An asset is available for the payment of the debts of an individual or company, or of a deceased person. 32. Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed, West Group, St. Paul, MN, 2004) defines “asset” as follows: Asset: 1. n item that is owned and has value. 2. pl. The entries on a balance sheet showing the items of property owned, including cash, inventory, equipment, real estate, accounts receivable, and goodwill. 3. pl. All the property of a person (esp. a bankrupt or deceased person) available for paying debts. 33. The word “asset”, therefore, requires the item to be identifiable. 34. Section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 allowed for deductions in respect of repairs and maintenance of an “asset”. It also provided for depreciation allowances in respect of any such asset (being plant, machinery, or equipment or a temporary building) where the depreciation had been caused by fair wear and tear or as a result of the asset becoming obsolete or useless. It further provided for depreciation of any such asset, not being plant, machinery, or equipment or a temporary building, where the depreciation had been caused by fair wear and tear. An allowance was available only when the depreciation could not be made good by repairs. 35. Inevitably, it became necessary when considering depreciation allowances, or deductions in respect of repairs and maintenance of an asset, to establish exactly what the item was that was to be depreciated, so an appropriate allowance or deduction could be established. This is supported by New Zealand case law in a repairs and maintenance context and cases from other jurisdictions in both repairs and maintenance and depreciation contexts. Outline of New Zealand case law Repairs and maintenance cases 36. One of the leading New Zealand cases on repairs and maintenance is Auckland Trotting Club v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 193, which cited the Australian case Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377 with approval. Lindsay concerned whether work done on a slipway could be properly categorised as repairs or renewal. In reaching a conclusion in Lindsay Kitto J stated (at page 384): But where the question is whether expenditure has been for repairs, and for the purpose of deciding that question one asks what is the entirety which it is relevant to consider, one is looking not for a profit-earning structure or entity, as such, but for a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion. \[Emphasis added\] 15 37. Kitto J also noted that it was necessary to consider whether the “asset” or “property” is an “entirety by itself” or whether it is a “subsidiary part of anything else”. 38. The same approach of needing to identify the relevant asset was also followed in later New Zealand cases such as Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 (CA), and Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR \[2000\] 3 NZLR 6 (PC). 39. In the Privy Council case Auckland Gas Co Ltd, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead stated (at pages 10 and 11) that in deciding whether work done on an item constitutes repair or replacement: \[T\]he first step is to identify the object to which the test of repair or replacement is being applied. Frequently this is a straightforward exercise and the answer is obvious. To take a homely instance, replacement of a worn washer on a household tap is normally regarded as a repair of the tap even though one of its parts has been wholly replaced. The tap has been repaired by the replacement of one of its component parts. Similarly with a car: replacement of a spent battery or a corroded exhaust system will normally be regarded as a repair of the car. The car has been put into working condition again. It often happens that, with improvements in technology, a replacement part is better than the original and will last longer or function better. That does not, of itself, change the character of the larger object or, hence, the appropriate description of the work. 40. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in Poverty Bay Electric Power Board noted (at page 445): Where a tax deduction is claimed for expenditure on property of a taxpayer it is necessary, in order to classify it either as repairs or maintenance or an improvement of a capital nature, first to determine what can fairly be said to have been the subject matter of the work. What is the totality or entirety of the physical asset which is the subject matter? There is always a danger of distortion if too large or too small a subject matter is identified. If a subsidiary part of an asset is regarded as the subject matter and that part has been replaced, there might be a tendency to classify what has occurred as a matter of capital. That could lead to an absurd result, for example, treating the replacement of a car tyre or a spark plug as a capital improvement when, if the subject matter is correctly seen as the whole of the motor vehicle, the work is obviously a repair involving a replacement of a mere component, even a vital component and even if an improved or modified version of that component is substituted. \[Emphasis added (in bold)\] 41. These cases all involved similar approaches. Hawkes Bay Power stated the need to identify “the relevant asset”, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board determined the need to identify the subject matter, and Auckland Gas Co Ltd confirmed that “the first step is to identify the object”. These cases confirm that it is necessary to clearly identify “what is the asset?”. Case law, therefore, has developed the “what is the asset?” test. 16 Depreciation cases 42. New Zealand cases on “what is the asset?” have arisen only in a repairs and maintenance context, but the same approach would have been applied in relation to depreciation issues because both repairs and maintenance and depreciation were contained within the same section of the Act. 43. The repairs and maintenance case law continued to apply the “what is the asset?” approach under the 1993 amendments to the Income Tax Act 1976. No cases have been decided under the Income Tax Act 2004 or Income Tax Act 2007, but it is considered that the same approach would be followed. Therefore, before a deduction for expenditure on repairs is allowed, the question of “what is the asset?” has first to be determined. It is also necessary to establish the relevant asset in the depreciation context. Approaches taken in other jurisdictions 44. Care needs to be taken when considering cases from other jurisdictions in this context because of the different legislative provisions. However, Australia and the United Kingdom have also considered that it is necessary to identify the relevant item before applying depreciation and repairs and maintenance provisions (eg, Cooke (Inspector of the Taxes) v Beach Station Caravans Ltd \[1974\] 3 All ER 159, Cole Bros Ltd v Phillips (HMIT) (1982) 55 TC 188, Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia & New Zealand Ltd v FCT (1970) 1 ATR 450, Woodward v FCT (2003) 51 ATR 1115, Case 11/97 97 ATC 173). Conclusion on the approach applied in the context of depreciation 45. In summary, the approach applied under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 was to consider “what is the asset?”. The reasons for this are as follows: • Section 108 was the core depreciation provision under the Income Tax Act 1976. It also dealt with deductions for repairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance and depreciation were linked by the words used in section 108, which provided for a depreciation allowance where “in either case, the depreciation cannot be made good by repair”. Although section 108 did not provide a test to determine what makes up an asset, it is implicit and inevitable that one must ask what is the relevant asset in the circumstances – is it part of the larger item or is it a separate asset? New Zealand case law on repairs and maintenance from this time concentrated on whether an asset was a separate item or part of another item, and it is likely that had a case arisen in the depreciation context, the same approach would have been adopted. • The Commissioner, therefore, concludes that a court would not regard the breaking down of a larger item (the residential rental property) into smaller components as the universally applicable approach, but would instead determine whether the item is part of the building or separate from it. If an item is a separate item, that particular component of the residential rental property may be depreciated 17 separately. If, however, the item is not separate but combined with the residential rental property, it will be depreciated as part of the building. This approach, to determine “what is the asset?”, as opposed to always seeking the “smallest asset”, is referred to in this statement as the “combined asset versus component assets” approach. • Case law concentrated on “what is the asset?” by determining whether an item is connected to or separate from the larger asset, so the “combined asset versus component assets” approach reflects the case law analysis above. • The United Kingdom and Australian courts used the “combined asset versus component assets” approach in the repairs and maintenance context, as well as in the depreciation context. Do the changes to the depreciation legislation in the Income Tax Act 1994 mean the “combined asset versus component assets” approach is no longer applicable? Repairs and maintenance no longer in the same section as depreciation 46. The repairs and maintenance provision was not included in the same section as the core depreciation provisions under the Income Tax Act 1994. This has continued under the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007. A deduction for repairs and maintenance is now obtained under the general deductibility provision, section DA 1 (previously section BD 2(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994). 47. The repairs and maintenance provisions were not included with the depreciation provisions at the recommendation of the Valabh Committee, which considered that repairs and maintenance should be dealt with under the general deductibility provisions (Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital Tax Accounting Issues (Consultative Committee, Wellington, 1991). In effect, the Committee considered that what was deductible under the previous repairs and maintenance provision in section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976, would still be deductible under the general deductibility provisions. 48. The Valabh Committee did not suggest that the repairs and maintenance and depreciation provisions be split up to prevent the “combined asset versus component assets” approach from being used; rather, repairs and maintenance did not need a specific provision and could be easily dealt with under the general deductibility provisions. In separating repairs and maintenance and depreciation provisions, New Zealand followed the position in Australia, where sections 53 and 54 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 dealt with repairs and maintenance and depreciation respectively. Section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 49. The depreciation provision in section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 stated: 18 (1) Subject to this Act, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for an amount on account of depreciation for any depreciable property owned by that taxpayer at any time during that income year. (2) No depreciation deduction shall be allowed in respect of any property for the income year in which the property is sold or otherwise disposed of, except in the case of property that is— (a) A building; or (b) Schedule depreciable property. \[Emphasis added\] 50. The Income Tax Act 1994 used the phrase “depreciable property” rather than “asset”, which was used in section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. “Depreciable property” was defined in section OB 1 as follows: Depreciable property, in relation to any taxpayer,— (a) Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons— (i) In deriving gross income; or (ii) In carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; but (b) Does not include— (i) Trading stock of the taxpayer: (ii) Land (excluding buildings and other fixtures and such improvements as are listed in Schedule 16): (iii) Financial arrangements: (iv) Intangible property other than depreciable intangible property: (v) Property which the taxpayer has elected to treat as low value property under section EG 16: (vi) Property the cost of which is allowed as a deduction under any of sections BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), DJ 6, DJ 11, DL 6, DM 1, DO 3, DO 6, DO 7, DZ 1, DZ 3, EO 5, EZ 5, and EZ 6, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction allowed under any section of this Act such as sections DJ 9, DL 2, DO 4, DO 5, and EO 2, other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18: (vii) Property which will not, in respect of the taxpayer, decline in value as a result of any right of the taxpayer to receive compensation for any decline in value on disposition of that property: (viii) Property the cost of which was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of sections DO 3, DZ 2, DZ 3 and DZ 4 of this Act (or any of sections 127, 127A and 128 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or 19 sections 119, 119D and 119G of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954): (ix) Property that the taxpayer elects under section EG 16A to treat as not depreciable: 51. The definition of the words “depreciable property” initially appear very broad, as it included “any property” that declined in value and was used, or was available for use, in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business. However, the exclusions in paragraph (b) limited the scope of the definition, as did the definition of “excluded depreciable property” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994: Excluded depreciable property means, in respect of any taxpayer, any depreciable property— (a) That was used or was available to be used by the taxpayer for any purpose whatever within New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before 1 April 1993; or (b) For which a binding contract for its purchase or construction was entered into by the taxpayer before 16 December 1991; or (c) That is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying asset; or (d) To the extent that the property is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying improvement; or (e) That is an intangible asset that was used or was available for use by the taxpayer before 1 April 1993;— but does not include any item of property in existence at the end of the 1992-93 income year that was permitted by the Commissioner to be accounted for in that income year using any of the standard value, replacement value, or annual revaluation methods: 52. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (5th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002) gives the following definitions of “property”: Property 1 That which one owns; a thing or things belonging to a person or persons; possessions collectively; spec. real estate, housing. b A house or piece of land owned. c Shares or investments in property. ... 3 The condition or fact of owning or being owned; the (exclusive) right to the possession, use, or disposal of a thing, ownership. 53. Butterworths Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis NZ, Wellington, 2005) gives the following definitions of “property”: property 1. A thing owned, that over which title is exercised, whether tangible or intangible, real or personal. 2. A title to or right of ownership in goods or other property... 54. Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed, West Group, St Paul, MN 2004) gives the following definitions of “property”: Property 1. The right to possess, use, and enjoy a determinate thing (either a tract of land or a chattel); the right of ownership... 2. Any external thing over which the rights of possession, use, and enjoyment are exercised... 20 55. These definitions all indicate that property is a “thing”, but this does not greatly assist in the context of depreciation, as it is still necessary to ask “what is the property in question?”. Is the property made up of several parts or is each of those parts an item of “property” on its own? 56. Section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 did not contain express words providing for a test to determine what is an item of “property”, but (as was the case with the word “asset” under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976), the word “property” itself necessitates a further question - what comprises an item of “property”? 57. The dictionary definitions of “asset” and “property” are similar, although all of the definitions of “asset” use the word “property” as a descriptor, while the definitions of “property” do not use “asset” as a descriptor. This may suggest that “asset” is a subset of property. However, it is concluded that both terms, used in the depreciation context, require a decision about the appropriate “asset” or “item of property” to be considered. 58. “Asset” and “property” have similar meanings, so it is considered that when choosing to use “property” rather than the previous term “asset”, Parliament did not deliberately move away from the approach that had been applicable to the word “asset”. 59. In this regard, it is noteworthy that several sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 continued to use the word “asset” (eg, sections EG 2(2A), DC 1(3), ED 4(4) and (6), EG 15, EG 16, EG 19, and the section OB 1 definition of “excluded depreciable property”). Valabh Committee Report 60. The 1991 Valabh Committee report does not discuss the change in wording in the legislation from “asset” to “depreciable property” (Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, Tax Accounting Issues (Consultative Committee, Wellington, 1991)). This suggests no substantive policy or interpretative change was intended by the change in wording. It appears the 1991 report was written after the decision had been made to change the wording in the legislation from “asset” to “depreciable property”, as the report included the draft legislation, which used the term “depreciable property” in the proposed section 108 and discussed the meaning of “depreciable property” only in terms of extending the definition that had already been proposed. The report stated (at paragraph 8.5.1): The Committee considers the existing statutory definition of depreciable property is deficient to the extent that it: (a) is defined in a manner that gives little indication of the criteria used to determine whether or not an asset should be included in the class of depreciable property; and (b) is too narrowly defined. In particular, it excludes certain types of intangible assets that can be expected systematically to decline in value over their useful lives. 21 DEP 1 as a contemporaneous document 61. The development and drafting of DEP 1 could assist in ascertaining whether the intention in enacting DEP 1 was to depart from the “combined asset versus component assets” approach in respect of depreciation matters. This is because it is a contemporaneous document that may indicate what people involved in advising the Government at the time thought. In this regard, with some minor exceptions, the asset and industry categories in DEP 1 are consistent with the “component assets versus combined asset” approach. Further, considered as a whole, the categories do not support any alternative interpretation. 62. However, DEP 1 is a determination, so is not substantive legislation. The statutory right to claim depreciation is not determined by there being a rate listed in a table and, likewise, the existence of a rate does not identify the item of depreciable property – this is achieved by applying the “combined asset versus component asset” approach. What was intended by the insertion of the “Residential Rental Property Chattels” industry category? 63. The “Residential Rental Property Chattels” industry category, (inserted into the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates by DEP 4 in January 1994), sets out the depreciation rates to be applied to items commonly located in a rental property. 64. Before the creation of the “Residential Rental Property Chattels” industry category, it appears it may have been difficult to identify the appropriate depreciation rate for some chattels commonly supplied with a rental property. At the time of the category’s introduction, several of the items in the “Residential Rental Property Chattels” industry category were also present in the “Building Fit-out (when in books separately from building cost)” asset category. This may suggest that the creation of the “Residential Rental Property Chattels” industry category was considered necessary because the “Building Fit-out (when in books separately from building cost)” asset category applied essentially in the commercial context and did not apply in the residential context. 65. The “Residential Rental Property Chattels” category appears to largely include items that are separate items of depreciable property. The word “chattel” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed, revised, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006) as: chattel n. (in general use) a personal possession. Law an item of property other than freehold land, including tangible goods (chattels personal) and leasehold interest (chattels real). 66. Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis NZ, Wellington, 2005) defines “chattels” as: chattels ... The name given to things which in law are deemed personal property. Chattels are divided into chattels real and chattels personal. Chattels real are interests less than freehold in land which formerly devolved in the same way as personal estate, for example, leaseholds. Chattels personal are movables. 22 67. Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed, West Group, St. Paul, MN, 2004) defines “chattel” as: chattel Moveable or transferable property; personal property; esp., a physical object capable of manual delivery and not the subject matter of real property. 68. Consequently, it would seem that most of the items of depreciable property listed in the “Residential Rental Property Chattels” industry category are items separate from the building. They can be physically removed and relocated, and do something different to the function of the building. 69. However, there are some items in the “Residential Rental Property Chattels” industry category that the Commissioner now considers are not separate items of depreciable property but are instead items that are part of the building. Two such items are “Vinyl flooring” and “Furniture (fitted)”. These are discussed further in the examples in the appendix to this statement. Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 70. The relevant depreciation provision of the Income Tax Act 2004 is section EE 1(2)–(5), which states: When amount of depreciation loss arises (2) A person has an amount of depreciation loss for an item for an income year if— (a) the person owns an item of property, as described in sections EE 2 to EE 5; and (b) the item is depreciable property, as described in sections EE 6 to EE 8; and (c) the item is used, or is available for use, by the person in the income year; and (d) the amount of depreciation loss is calculated for the person, the item, and the income year under sections EE 9 to EE 11. When amount of depreciation recovery income arises (3) A person has an amount of depreciation recovery income for an item for an income year if— (a) the person owns an item of property, as described in sections EE 2 to EE 5; and (b) the item is depreciable property, as described in sections EE 6 to EE 8; and (c) the item is disposed of or an event of a kind described in section EE 40 occurs; and (d) the amount of depreciation recovery income is calculated for the person, the item, and the income year under any of sections EE 22(5), EE 31(4), EE 41(1), EE 42(2), EE 43(3), and EE 44(3). 23 Amounts of loss incurred and income derived (4) To avoid doubt,— (a) an amount of depreciation loss is treated as being incurred in the income year for which it is calculated; and (b) an amount of depreciation recovery income is treated as being derived in the income year for which it is calculated. Partial income-producing use (5) Subpart DE (Motor vehicle expenditure) and section FB 7 (Depreciation: partial income-producing use) contain rules for calculating the amount of deduction available for depreciation loss in circumstances in which an item of property is only partly used or available for use in a way that satisfies the general permission. \[Emphasis added\] 71. Section EE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 uses the term “item of property” and refers to an item that is “depreciable property”. These references are different from those used in the Income Tax Act 1994, where the term “any depreciable property” was used. 72. As the above analysis was on a different Act and wording, consideration needs to be given to whether the “combined asset versus component assets” approach is still the correct approach to apply under the current legislation. 73. The words used in section EE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 do not suggest a meaning that is different from that of section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The use of the word “item” in the Income Tax Act 2004 in the place of the word “property” (which previously replaced “asset”), reinforces that depreciation is concerned with a specific item of property, rather than with property in general or as a generic term. It is arguable that the use of the word “item” does this more strongly than the wording under the previous legislation. 74. It may also be said that a need remains to have some kind of test that determines what is part of a particular item of property and what is a separate item of property under the Income Tax Act 2004. 75. Relevantly, Barber DJ briefly considered the meaning of “item” in Case H8 (1986) 8 NZTC 156. Case H8 involved a taxpayer who purchased a computer and a disk drive (costing $995 each) to assist him with his work. Under the relevant legislation (clause 4 of the fourth schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976) a deduction was allowed for: Expenditure incurred in the purchase, maintenance, or repair of any hand-tool, equipment, or technical aid. The maximum deduction allowable under this clause shall be $250 for any item. 76. At issue was whether the disk drive was a separate “item” from the computer. Barber DJ concluded that the computer and the disk drive were separate “items”. He noted that each piece of equipment was purchased separately under a separate description and serial number and with a separate price. In reaching his conclusion, Barber DJ considered the ability of the computer to operate without the disk drive: 24 The computer has important and useful functions without the disk drive. It does not need the disk drive. However, the disk drive has no function without the computer. Nevertheless, it seems to me to be limiting the meaning of the word “item” in an unrealistic manner to deny that the disk drive is an item in its own right. It seems to me that although the disk drive has no useful function unless hooked up to the computer, it is nevertheless a separate item or article or object in terms of the English language and in terms of cl 4. It is not needed by the computer but it needs the computer. I find it to be a piece of equipment separate from the computer. 77. The view that the words used in section EE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 have the same meaning as in section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is further reinforced by the fact that, with limited exceptions, the 2004 Act was not intended to change the operation of the law under the earlier statute, but was rather intended to clarify the wording used. The small number of intended policy changes are listed in schedule 22A of the Income Tax Act 2004. None of the provisions considered in the 2004 Act relating to depreciation are listed in schedule 22A. 78. On the basis of this analysis, it follows that the “combined asset versus component assets” approach applied under section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is also to be applied under section EE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 79. The same approach was also applied in the Income Tax Act 2007, with intended policy changes being included in schedule 51. No depreciation provisions are included in that schedule. Conclusion on the approach taken under the depreciation legislation 80. It is concluded that the “combined asset versus component assets” approach applied in depreciation situations under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In 1993 the depreciation regime was reviewed, and the repairs and maintenance provision, which used to be combined with the depreciation provisions in section 108, was separated. This change was more a matter of simplification and not an attempt to prevent the “combined asset versus component assets” approach, which was applied in the repairs and maintenance case law, from being applied in the context of depreciation. 81. Section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which effectively replaced section 108 of the Income Tax At 1976, no longer used the word “asset” to define the item that may be depreciated, but instead used the word “property”. The dictionary definitions that give the ordinary meanings of “asset” and “property” are similar, and the two terms can be used virtually interchangeably. Because of the similarities between the ordinary meanings of “asset” and “property”, it is concluded no change was intended in respect of the “combined asset versus component assets” approach. 82. As several sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 continued to use the word “asset” rather than “property”, this supports an absence of any deliberate intention to move away from the “combined asset versus component assets” approach. 25 83. Despite the repairs and maintenance provisions no longer being in the same section as the depreciation provisions (which is where the “combined asset versus component assets” approach was developed in New Zealand case law), the Valabh Committee, which had recommended splitting up these provisions, gave no indication that the use of the “combined asset versus component assets” approach in respect of depreciation was to end. The reasons given for the change were simplification and that repairs and maintenance did not require a special section permitting a deduction. 84. Nothing in DEP 1 indicates that a move away from the “combined asset versus component assets” approach was intended in respect of depreciation. 85. The “combined asset versus component assets” approach remains the approach taken under the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007. This is because the depreciation provisions are not listed in schedule 22A of the 2004 Act or schedule 51 of the 2007 Act as an intended change. Therefore, there was not intended to be any change to the meaning of the words. Further, the use of the word “item” strengthens rather than weakens the “combined asset versus component assets” approach. How is the approach applied to determine the correct depreciation value for items in a residential rental property? 86. In the repairs and maintenance context it is important to establish what the asset is. (This was discussed above in the Court of Appeal decision Poverty Bay Electric Power Board and Privy Council decision Auckland Gas Co Ltd.) This is important because the courts can then assess whether the work done constitutes a repair or a replacement in the context of the asset identified. For depreciation, it is necessary to know whether an item of property is a separate asset or whether it forms part of another asset so the appropriate depreciation rate can be applied. The application of the relevant legal tests will not be affected by how different items are treated in an agreement for sale and purchase. For example, specifying different consideration for parts of a building will not make them separate items of depreciable property. Conversely, specifying a global sum for a number of different items of depreciable property will not make them a single item. Test/factors for determining the relevant item of depreciable property 87. In several cases in the repairs and maintenance context the courts, in the course of determining whether expenditure was on repairs or maintenance, had cause to consider how to determine the relevant asset. It is considered that this is fundamentally the same question that needs to be answered in determining the relevant asset for depreciation purposes. Each of the relevant cases is considered below. 88. In the discussion that follows, several cases use terms the meanings of which are not readily apparent. In order to assist with the analysis of these cases, it is useful to try to use consistent terminology when attempting to identify what the courts are referring to. The following terminology is used when analysing the cases: • “Completeness” refers to considerations of whether an item has everything it needs to function (ie, to carry out its required role). Sometimes cases refer to this as “functionality”. However, the term 26 “completeness” is used to distinguish this concept from other meanings of functionality. • “Functional” refers to whether an item carries out a different or separate function to another item of which it may or may not be a part. • “Physical” describes factors that relate to the physical characteristics of an item. These include the size of the item, whether it is physically separate, or whether and how it is attached to other items. 89. Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377 is an Australian repairs and maintenance case that has been extensively quoted in New Zealand cases. Lindsay concerned substantial expenditure on a slipway. In the course of his judgment, Kitto J sought to determine the relevant asset for the purposes of determining whether the expenditure was repairs and maintenance or capital (at page 384): The only justification that was suggested for treating the whole premises, or the whole No. 1 slip, as the relevant entirety, was that the entirety to be considered is “the income-earning unit”. In order to determine whether an item of expenditure is to be held on general principles to be chargeable to income or capital account, it is of course necessary to distinguish between “the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organization operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay”; and it is true that “the business structure or entity or organization ... may consist in a great aggregate of buildings, machinery and plant all assembled and systematized as the material means by which an organized body of men produce and distribute commodities or perform services”: Sun Newspapers Ltd. and Associated Newspapers Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation \[(1938) 61 CLR 337\]. But where the question is whether expenditure has been for repairs, and for the purpose of deciding that question one asks what is the entirety which it is relevant to consider, one is looking not for a profit-earning structure or entity, as such, but for a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion. \[Emphasis added\] 90. Kitto J went on to conclude (at page 385): ...I am of opinion that the No. 1 slipway ought to be considered, for the purposes of the question I have to decide, as an entirety by itself, and not as a subsidiary part of anything else. It is separately identifiable as a principal, and indeed the principal, item of capital equipment, so that in a discussion as to whether work done in relation to it constitutes a repair or a renewal in the opposed senses abovementioned, the subject matter in relation to which the choice of description is to be made is the slipway itself, and not any larger thing or aggregation of things of which it may be suggested to form part. \[Emphasis added\] 91. It can be seen from this that Kitto J’s test of the relevant asset was “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. In determining whether the No. 1 slipway satisfied this description, Kitto J considered it was relevant that the slipway was: • an “entirety by itself” and not a “subsidiary part of something else”; and • separately identifiable as a principal item of capital equipment. 27 92. The first factor, that the slipway was an “entirety by itself”, suggests the asset was whole or complete in itself rather than being a component part of a larger asset. 93. The second factor is a little less clear. The fact the slipway was “separately identifiable” as a principal item of capital equipment suggests it was important enough to be considered as an asset in its own right and could be distinguished in some way from other items. It is not clear from the judgment, what characteristics led the court to its conclusion. A principal item of capital equipment is presumably an asset that is important or fundamental to the taxpayer’s business (that being the ordinary meaning of “principal”). However, several possible factors could make such an item “separately identifiable”. For example, an item of equipment could be separately identifiable because it is a functioning unit in its own right. Alternatively, it could be separately identifiable because of physical characteristics, such as whether it is attached to other items or whether it has physical characteristics that differ from other items. It may be that all of these are relevant factors to be taken into account. Later cases discuss this factor (or similar factors) in more detail. The possible meanings of this factor, therefore, are discussed in more detail below. 94. Lindsay was appealed to the full High Court (Dixon CJ and McTiernan and Taylor JJ). The full High Court (agreeing with the decision of Kitto J) made the following comments on the relevant entirety for repairs and maintenance purposes: The entirety, it is said, consisted, either, of the whole of the partnership’s premises on which its business was conducted and in connexion with which the slipway was used or, alternatively, of a number of what were called components and which together were said to constitute the slipway. These components are identified as the slip, the cradle employed upon it, the hauling machinery by which the cradle is moved and the dolphins and warping winches by means of which vessels are manoeuvred onto the cradle. This method of approach to the problem was rejected by the learned judge of first instance and we have no doubt that he was right. It would be artificial in the extreme to approach the problem in either of the suggested ways for the slipway was, in itself, a very substantial erection and the real question for decision was whether the work which was done was done in the execution of repairs to it. As we see the problem the answer to this question could not be affected by the fact that there were other buildings or erections on the appellant’s premises or by the fact that, on the premises, there were appurtenances, such as those described, for use in connexion with the slipway. \[Emphasis added\] 95. Thus, the full High Court upheld the approach taken by Kitto J. In addition, the court noted that the slipway was itself a very substantial erection and that there were a number of other buildings or erections on the taxpayer’s premises (which were not part of the slipway). It appears from this that the court was influenced by the fact the slipway was a substantial structure in its own right. The potential relevance of this is discussed in more detail below. 96. The taxpayer in Auckland Trotting Club v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967 claimed expenditure on the demolition of a trotting track and the construction of a replacement track on the same site as repairs or alterations to the “premises” of the club. The court considered the meaning of “repairs or 28 alterations to the premises”. The court adopted the reasoning of Kitto J in Lindsay. Turner J stated (at page 975): But where the question is whether expenditure has been for repairs, and, for the purpose of deciding that question, one asks what is the entirety which it is relevant to consider, one is looking not for a profit-earning structure or entity, as such, but for a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion. ... Thus, if a factory window were blown out and had to be repaired, it would be obviously wrong to argue that as the entirety of the window had been restored it was not a repair to the premises. In such a case the ‘premises’ would be the entire factory, in relation to which the window would be a repair and nothing else. But if, for example, a retort house in a gasworks was destroyed and had to be rebuilt, one would hardly call that a repair to the gasworks. ... These examples illustrate what I think is the truth, that there is no one line of approach to the problem which is exclusively correct. In some cases it will be right to regard the premises as the entire factory, and in others as some part of the factory. Whichever alternative is the right one to adopt will depend upon the facts of the particular case. \[Emphasis added\] 97. Turner J concluded that the “track” was the relevant “premises”, and then went on to consider what made up the track. In particular, his Honour had to determine whether a lighting system was a part of the premises that comprised the track. In the course of determining this, Turner J (at page 976) considered the United Kingdom case J. Lyons & Co. Ltd v Attorney General \[1994\] 1 All ER 477, which considered whether certain lamps were “plant” or part of the premises: In the present case then, the track must be the “premises” in respect of which the Club sets up that the work done is a “repair or alteration”; and what is comprised in the track? It was to this question that Mr Barker addressed his second submission, and again we reject his contention that the lighting system must be regarded as an integral part of the track, and of the “premises” of which it is at least the principal component. The lighting system is in our opinion plant or equipment. In so far as a resolution of the matter is a question of fact, Moller J. has decided it against the Club. In so far as it is a question of law, we find nothing in the evidence which persuades us to hold that the lighting system should be regarded not as plant or equipment, but as a part of the premises. ... In the case before us the facts are completely different and the application of the test suggested by Uthwatt J. must result in a decision to the opposite effect. The presence of the lighting system on this course was dictated by the nature of the particular uses to which the course is put to earn its revenue. The lighting system is not required simply to enable persons to go about their business on the course, in the absence of natural lighting; it is required for the primary function of enabling the paying spectators to view at night the spectacle for which they have paid. Moreover the lamps themselves are obviously highly specialised in construction, purpose, and position, and can well be said to form a part of a separate electric lighting plant on the hereditament. That plant is in fact specially valued in the Club’s balance sheet as a separate item, on which depreciation has been claimed from year to year. For all these reasons we are clear that the lighting plant must be regarded as plant or equipment, and not as forming an integral part of the “premises” designated in this case by the general description of “the 1962 track”. \[Emphasis added\] 98. It can be seen from this that Turner J concludes that the lighting system is plant or equipment, so is not part of the premises. His Honour used 29 United Kingdom case law on plant to help him reach this conclusion. Turner J was (by virtue of the legislation he was interpreting) focused on determining what were the “premises”, so he was interested in distinguishing between “premises” and “plant”. Thus, he found the United Kingdom cases relevant. 99. Because Turner J was focused on distinguishing between premises and plant his judgment is of limited relevance. Although he was seeking to determine what the relevant entirety was for the purpose of testing whether expenditure was on repairs and maintenance, the fact the legislative context required him to determine the entirety in the context of “premises” influenced the factors he considered relevant. In particular, considerations of the function and purpose of the lighting system and its relationship with the taxpayer’s income earning activity arise out of tests used in the United Kingdom to distinguish between premises and items of plant. In this regard, premises are where the taxpayer carries on its business (the setting), whereas plant is something that is actively used in the taxpayer’s business – hence Turner J’s interest in the fact the lighting system was dictated by the nature of the use of the premises. Consequently, it is considered that, to the extent that the judgment is concerned with these plant specific issues, it is not relevant to determining what the relevant asset for depreciation purposes is. It is possible that parts of the judgment may still be useful to the current enquiry to the extent that they consider similar factors to cases that are more on point. For example, the reference to whether the lighting system was an “integral part” of the track is arguably the flipside of the enquiry in Lindsay about whether an item is an entirety by itself (the “completeness” test) – that is, if an item is an integral part of a larger item, then the larger item could be considered incomplete without the smaller item. 100. Richmond J delivered a separate judgment reaching the same conclusion. He acknowledged (at page 979) that “any inquiry as to whether or not there has been a ‘repair’ or an ‘alteration’ must necessarily involve a decision as to the entirety of the asset alleged to have been repaired or altered”. His Honour then went on to reject the submission that the relevant asset was everything that was part of the income earning unit, stating (at page 979): I find myself unable to accept the submission that in the present case the relevant entirety is the whole of the Club’s undertaking. That undertaking is made up of a number of capital assets which are sufficiently distinct from one another from a physical point of view, and from the point of view of their individual importance, to satisfy severally the notion of “premises”. \[Emphasis added\] 101. The above quotation suggests it is relevant to consider whether the items are physically distinct. 102. Richmond J further appears to be suggesting it is relevant to consider whether two capital assets are sufficiently distinct from one another in terms of their individual importance. This appears to be similar to the consideration in Lindsay of whether an item is separately identifiable as a principal item of capital equipment. It is necessary to consider what is meant by “sufficiently distinct” in this context. As the phrase “sufficiently distinct from one another in terms of their individual importance” is being compared with “sufficiently distinct from one another from a physical point 30 of view”, it is considered that the judge must be referring to “sufficiently distinct” for reasons other than physical reasons. These factors are discussed in terms of whether an asset is important enough by itself to satisfy the notion of premises. This tends to suggest that the item in question is sufficient to be complete premises by itself (a completeness type test). 103. Richmond J also went on to consider what other components made up the premises comprising the track (at pages 979-980): Alternatively, Mr Barker submitted that the entirety of the “premises” comprises not only the race track itself but also the running rail and the floodlight standards. I am quite prepared to treat the running rail as an integral part of the track. Its inclusion would not influence the ultimate decision of this case one way or the other. As to the floodlight standards, there is not a great deal of evidence. It does appear that these floodlight standards were originally installed in 1958 at a cost of between £40,000 and £50,000. They were moved to their present positions during the year ended June 1960 at a cost of £5,000. This is virtually all the information available to the Court. I infer that the floodlight standards are of considerable size and are erected at intervals in positions adjacent to the track itself. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the floodlight standards should be regarded as forming a component part of “premises” which also include the track. Their cost and probable size suggest to my mind that as a matter of fact and degree thay should be treated as a distinct and separate capital asset in the nature of plant or equipment. The mere fact that their purpose is to render the track usable as a night trotting track is not in itself sufficient to justify their inclusion along with the track as one entirety, for the same argument could be advanced in relation to various other buildings (such as stables) whose purpose is also ancillary to the use of the track, but which nevertheless are separate and distinct physical entities. Moller J. has held, on the evidence before him, that the physical thing which satisfies the notion of “premises” is the race track itself and “not any larger thing or aggregation of things of which it may be suggested to form part”. \[Emphasis added\] 104. This quotation suggests that cost and size is relevant to determining whether an item is a separate asset. The potential relevance of these factors is considered in more detail later. 105. It is considered that much of Richmond J’s reasoning in determining whether the lights were part of the track is, like Turner J’s, a function of considering the difference between premises and plant. Notwithstanding this, however, his references to items being sufficiently physically distinct, separate and distinct physical entities, and “an integral part” of an asset are potentially relevant to determining what the relevant asset is. These are consistent with points noted in later cases. 106. Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 considered whether expenditure incurred in replacing overhead electricity lines with underground cables was expenditure on “repairs or alterations”. Goddard J noted that the starting point is identifying the “nature of the relevant asset”. In this regard she stated (at page 13,696): The task of identifying the relevant asset is assisted by examining the nature and make-up of Hawkes Bay Power’s electricity reticulation system as a whole and by comparing the fundamental characteristics of overhead wiring systems and underground cable systems. 31 107. Her Honour went on to apply the “entirety” test set out in Lindsay v FCT (at pages 13,700 – 13,701): Relevant asset - was the expenditure in issue on account of capital or revenue? ... It is prudent, however, to consider, whether the urban residential distribution system constitutes an “entirety” for the purposes of deciding that same issue. Using the “entirety” test as the appropriate yardstick by which to measure the system, it is clear that the system fulfils the criterion of a “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion,” just as did the No 1 slipway in the case of Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377 (HCA). ...To summarise, the Lindsay v FCT case provides a test of relevant assets in its use of the words “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”, “not as a subsidiary part of anything else”; and “a principal item of capital equipment.” Applying the Lindsay test, I am satisfied the urban residential distribution system is (i) “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”, (ii) “an entirety by itself and not ... a subsidiary part of anything else” and (iii) a “separately identified ... principal item of capital equipment”, for the following reasons: (i) The “particular notion” is the supply of electricity to domestic consumers in designated (urban) areas. The system “satisfies” this notion via its own network of transformers and distributors (ii) The urban residential distribution system is physically capable of being separately and independently installed underground without recourse to or effect upon the other areas which the distribution system satisfies, that is, the urban industrial and rural areas. Neither does its underground character affect or alter the performance of the subtransmission system. For those reasons it is capable of being considered an “entirety by itself” and not merely a “subsidiary part” of either the distribution system as a whole, with or without the subtransmission system. The fact that the urban residential distribution system could not operate as an independent entity does not affect that conclusion. Adopting the same analysis, Hawkes Bay Power itself could not operate as an independent entity if disconnected from the National Grid but is nevertheless an “entirety by itself.” Nor does the fact that the system is not an entire profit-earning structure affect that conclusion. The system is still capable of being administered separately and independently, in terms of satisfying its particular notion which is the supplying, metering and billing of urban residential consumers who, significantly, comprise the majority (about 88%) of the population of Hawkes Bay Power’s total district. (iii) The urban residential distribution system is “separately identified” by customer type and area, that is, “urban residential”. The “separateness” of its identity is further highlighted by the fact that 85% of its system is now underground, thus distinguishing it in character from the other customer types and areas of supply (urban industrial and rural). Further, the sheer scale of the cost involved in putting the system underground (around $45 million), the comparative cost with overhead lines (at least 3.25 times), the extent of the system which is now underground (920 kilometres), and the fact that urban residential consumers account for approximately 88% of the population of Hawkes Bay Power’s total district, leads to the irrefutable conclusion that the system is “a principal item of capital equipment”. \[Emphasis added\] 32 108. It can be seen from this that Goddard J applied the analysis from Lindsay, determining the relevant asset by finding: • a physical thing that satisfies a particular notion; • not as a subsidiary part of anything else; and • separately identifiable as a principal item of capital equipment. 109. The “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” was the network of transformers and distributors that supplied electricity to domestic consumers in a certain area. This suggests that the enquiry is focused on a physical thing (ie, the electricity network) that carries out a particular function (ie, the supply of electricity). Further, a particular part of the network (the urban residential distribution system) was found to be the relevant asset because it was “physically capable of being separately and independently installed underground without recourse to or effect upon the other areas which the distribution system satisfies”. Thus, it was found to be an entirety by itself and not merely a subsidiary part of a larger distribution system. 110. Goddard J found this to be the case notwithstanding that the urban residential distribution system “could not operate as an independent entity” and was “not an entire profit-earning structure”. It is clear from this that in defining an asset, it is not necessary that everything required to earn a profit from it is included. 111. In terms of the “principal item of capital equipment” enquiry, Goddard J notes that the urban residential distribution system is “separately identified” by customer type and area and that its separateness is further identified by the fact that most of it is underground. This sheds some light on the factors Goddard J considers make a capital asset separately identifiable. In this regard, customer area and type distinguish “urban residential” from “urban industrial” and “rural” customers. Thus, it would appear that physical location is relevant as urban and rural customers are separated by location (especially since the taxpayer stated it did not impose urban or rural boundaries on the system from an operational point of view). Similarly, Goddard J found that the urban residential system was distinguishable from the other customer types by virtue of the fact it was mostly underground. This would also appear to be a physical distinction (especially since, earlier in her judgment, Goddard J states that the underground and overhead systems are identical in nature and function). Therefore, it appears Goddard J was primarily concerned with physical factors when determining whether two items were separately identifiable. 112. In terms of whether a distribution system is a “principal item of capital equipment”, Goddard J notes that the sheer scale of the cost involved in undergrounding the network, the comparative cost with overhead lines, and the extent of the system that had been undergrounded led “to the irrefutable conclusion that the system is “a principal item of capital equipment” (at page 13,701). 113. Goddard J appears to be suggesting that if an item is expensive, then it will be a principal item of capital equipment. Further, she also seems to be suggesting that cost can be relevant in both an absolute and a relative sense (ie, she refers to the “sheer scale of the cost”, which implies absolute, and the “comparative cost”, which implies relative). 114. Goddard J also noted that the question of entirety was “a matter of degree and of the right conclusion to be drawn from the facts” (at page 13,701). 33 Her Honour then went on to consider whether the entire reticulation system could be the relevant asset, in the process rejecting the “functionality” and “profit earning structure” tests: Hawkes Bay Power attempted to argue that its total reticulation system, with or without the subtransmission system, constitutes the relevant asset. On that premise, the replacement of the urban residential distribution system would amount to no more than a repair to or alteration of a subsidiary part of the total system. In support of that argument, Hawkes Bay Power relied on a “functionality” test, based on the integrated nature of electricity reticulation systems and the fact that none of the constituent components of those systems are capable of functioning on their own. Mr Whitfield’s evidence was that the separate components of the network could not be treated as separate assets as, unless the network is connected together, each individual piece is useless by itself. Mr Walker, the General Manager-Distribution, said that, from an operational point of view, Hawkes Bay Power regards its system as a whole and does not impose urban or rural boundaries on it. ... With one exception, neither the “functionality” test nor its kindred “profit earning structure” test appear to have found favour with the courts. That exception is Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,408 \[Goddard J is referring to the High Court decision, which was later appealed to the Court of Appeal and Privy Council\]. In Auckland Gas Co Ltd, Williams J held that expenditure incurred in inserting polyethylene pipe into the steel and east iron pipes which made up the objector’s gas network should be charged to revenue not capital. In reaching that conclusion, he considered whether the relevant asset was commercially or functionally inseparable from the taxpayers profit earning activities, and found: “Just as with any network utilised for the conveyance of liquids or gases, the network should be regarded as an interdependent whole, seeing it not as its individual components but as all those components linked together to provide a comprehensive delivery system.” With respect to Williams J, however, it seems that the tests he applied are contrary to the approach that has been consistently taken by the courts. Both the “functionality” and the “profit earning structure” tests were specifically rejected by the High Court of Australia in FCT v Lindsay, and, by application, in the Auckland Trotting Club case. 115. It would appear from this that Goddard J is suggesting that “functionality” and “profit-earning structure” are not relevant considerations when determining what constitutes the relevant asset. Her conclusion in relation to the “profit-earning structure” test is relatively uncontroversial because the New Zealand courts have largely rejected the test. “Functionality”, however, is more difficult. Her Honour refers to “functionality” in terms of the integrated nature of the electricity system and the inability of part of the system to function on its own. This appears to be a rejection of a “completeness” test. 116. Goddard J notes that (what she refers to as) the “functionality” test was specifically rejected by the High Court of Australia in Lindsay, and, by application, in Auckland Trotting Club. However, Lindsay does not mention “function” or “functionality”. Neither of the two judgments (Kitto J in the High Court decision and the judgment from the appeal to the full High Court) appears to clearly reject a completeness (or a functionality) test. 34 117. The case Goddard J referred to as being the only one that has applied (what she called) the functionality test (the High Court in Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,408)) was appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council after Goddard J gave her judgment. Consequently, it is necessary to consider later decisions to determine the relevance of the completeness test. In this regard, as is seen below, later courts considered that whether an item is complete is a relevant factor to take into account. 118. Goddard J found that a smaller group of customers (to which each conversion job was applied) could also be considered separate assets and entireties themselves. However, as is seen below, this approach was rejected by the Court of Appeal in Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001. 119. Goddard J went on to consider whether the transformers were separate assets or part of the distribution system (at page 13,704): Transformers I have already found that the urban residential distribution system, including the distribution transformers, is the relevant asset for the purposes of this case. It is unarguable that the transformers are capital items and Hawkes Bay Power has always accepted this. Transformers replaced during the course of conversion jobs for which it claimed deductibility, were always separately identified from the cost of those conversion jobs and capitalised by it in all instances. ... The evidence establishes that transformers are an integral part of the distribution system as a whole and an integral part of underground conversion jobs. On this topic Mr Whitfield said: “... the transformers are an integral part or one of the asset components that make up a network and the ability to reticulate.” 120. It can be seen from this that Goddard J found the transformers were a part of the distribution system (the relevant asset in the case) because they were an integral part of the distribution system as a whole. It is further noted that the transformers were necessary for the network to reticulate. This suggests items that are integral to an asset’s ability to fulfil their function are part of the asset. This is arguably a “completeness” type test – that is, if the asset would be incomplete (ie, unable to function) without an item, then that item is a part of the asset. This seems to be at odds with Goddard J’s finding above that a completeness test is irrelevant. 121. Poverty Bay Electric Power Board (1998) 18 NZTC 13,779 considered similar facts to those considered in Hawkes Bay Power. In the High Court (1998) 18 NZTC 13,779 Ellis J found that the relevant asset was the reticulation system in Gisborne city, not the entire network including rural areas. In this regard, he noted the appellant’s long-standing undergrounding policy was applicable to that area. It was also “fiscally recognised \[by the power board\] as an area to be contrasted with rural distribution”(at page 13,792). In passing, Ellis J said it was possible also to look at each of the jobs in question as separate assets (as Goddard J had done in Hawkes Bay Power). 122. On appeal Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 2 NZLR 438), the Court of Appeal discussed the importance of correctly identifying the 35 subject-matter of the expenditure and noted the implications of incorrectly identifying the asset (in the context of repairs and maintenance). The court then went on to discuss the relevant asset in the case at hand. In doing so, the court rejected Ellis J’s finding (and, by implication, Goddard J’s finding in Hawkes Bay Power) that each separate section of line could also be the relevant asset. In reaching its conclusion, the court considered the fact each separate section of line was incapable of separate operation, but rather was part of an integrated system. However, the court also warned against taking this enquiry too far: The present case contains an example of this kind of error in the suggestion that each separate section of line which was converted from overhead to underground might be the relevant subject matter of that work. If that were so, the conclusion would be almost irresistible in each case that the work was an improvement, for the whole of the subject matter would then have been entirely substituted and placed in a different physical location. But that would ignore the fact that the section of line so dealt with was part of an integrated system and quite incapable of separate operation. Even this last observation, however, if taken to its extreme can result in misidentification in the other direction, for the whole of the appellant’s reticulation system is but a small part of the national electricity grid. If the subject matter were taken to be the grid, a substantial capital work by an individual electricity supply authority might be made to appear so relatively minor as to be thought a matter of repair only. We reject the idea that the sections of the Board’s system separately worked upon were “the physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”, to use Kitto J’s phrase in Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377. That leaves as the respective contentions for the appellants and the Commissioner about the entirety which it is appropriate to consider, on the one hand, the Board’s reticulation system throughout Poverty Bay and the East Coast including Gisborne and, on the other hand, the Board’s reticulation system in Gisborne alone. In the view we take it would not seem to make much difference, because of the great importance to the Board of the urban area in terms of numbers of consumers and revenues and the relative concentration therein of its distribution system. We would certainly not be prepared to say that on this factual issue the Judge was wrong to plump for the urban reticulation system. There was evidence from Mr Issa that in engineering terms the Gisborne area was clearly distinguishable. It could be switched (or isolated by electrical means) from the rest of the Poverty Bay network. The Board itself recognised it as a separate area for fiscal purposes. \[Emphasis added\] 123. The Court of Appeal noted the following factors as being relevant to determining which parts of the distribution network made up the relevant asset. The relevant part of the system was: • clearly distinguishable (in engineering terms) and could be isolated (by electrical means) from the rest of the network; and • separately recognised by the taxpayer’s board. 124. In addition, the court found that a smaller part of the network was not the relevant asset because it was only part of an integrated system and was incapable of separate operation. This strongly suggests it is relevant that an asset be able to function by itself (ie, it includes all the parts that are necessary for it to function) and, similarly, that subsidiary parts of an “integrated system” should be considered part of that system rather than assets in their own right. 36 125. It is not clear what is meant by being “distinguishable in engineering terms”. However, in the context of the judgment, the sentence following that comment (stating it could be isolated (by electrical means) from the rest of the network) appears to elaborate on the point. When the two sentences are read together it is considered that the court was noting that the relevant part of the network was distinguishable because it could be isolated from the rest of the network (and presumably retain its ability to function) – that is, it was not reliant on the rest of the network. Therefore, while not entirely free from doubt, it is considered the court was pointing to the fact that part of the network was able to function by itself (ie, a completeness test). This is consistent with earlier remarks the court made. 126. That the power board recognised the relevant part of the network separately may well have provided evidence to support the conclusion reached. However, it is considered that the taxpayer’s treatment of items cannot be determinative of the tax treatment of items. 127. The taxpayer in CIR v Auckland Gas \[1999\] 2 NZLR 418 (CA) had a programme of inserting polyethylene piping into its existing cast iron and steel gas pipes. At issue was the deductibility of the expenditure as repairs. The High Court found in favour of the taxpayer ((1997) 18 NZTC 13408). The Court of Appeal made the following observation in rejecting the approach taken by Williams J: The subject matter of the work The High Court judgment does not contain a direct statement of definition of the subject matter of the work done by AGC in the income years in question: what exactly it is which is said to have been repaired. Williams J appears to have concentrated on the relationship of the work to the taxpayer’s income earning activity. This has been called a profit earning entity test. The Commissioner correctly points out that such a test was rejected in Auckland Trotting Club Inc v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967 in favour of Kitto J’s approach in Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377, 384 of looking for “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion.” In its judgment in Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 (CA) which is being delivered at the same time as the decision in this appeal, this Court approaches the question in what it considers to be the correct way - by inquiry into the totality or entirety of the physical asset in question. 128. Blanchard J, delivering the judgment of the majority (Richardson P, Henry and Tipping JJ) then went on to find that the relevant asset was the whole of Auckland Gas’ network: The Commissioner submitted that the relevant asset is the low pressure distribution system, which he said was the entity on which the work was done and represented approximately 70% of the total distribution system. Although it was conceded by the Commissioner that the low pressure and medium pressure systems were interconnected, he said they had physical and operational differences, the most obvious being the different pressures, necessitating the use of regulators. On this basis, the Commissioner argued, a low pressure system was being replaced by a medium pressure system in accordance with a programme of works. It seems, however, that Williams J must have proceeded on the basis that the asset was the whole of AGC’s network. Certainly he took this view when considering the second proviso. Although he did not apply the right test in reaching that conclusion, if he had done so he would rightly have rejected the Commissioner’s argument. AGC’s system, though operating at different pressures in its different parts, was an integrated network for conveying gas 37 from the natural gas gateway to the consumers. The low pressure system was dependent on the medium pressure mains. It was not able to function separately and, as a result of the work programme, was being converted so as to operate at the same pressure. AGC was upgrading its network as a whole and the low pressure system was a major part of that network. The effect of what was being done is best judged by looking at the Auckland- wide network as a single interconnected and interdependent asset. \[Emphasis added\] 129. It can be seen from this that Blanchard J focuses on the fact that one item (the low pressure system) is dependent on another for its function – that is, it is unable to function separately. This is a “completeness” test – that is, the relevant item includes all the physical things necessary for it to carry out its function and would be incomplete if one of the items necessary for it to function was not included. As well as considering the interdependence between parts of the network, Blanchard J also notes that the network is “interconnected”. This arguably suggests some reference to the physical connection between items may be relevant to determining whether something is a single asset. 130. The Privy Council (\[2000\] 3 NZLR 6 (PC)) upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal. The judgment included the following discussion: The appropriate description of the work done by Auckland Gas \[20\] In the present case work was done to a gas distribution system. The Courts below treated the entirety of the system as the relevant asset. The taxpayer defended this approach, and their Lordships are content to proceed on this footing. But one must be clear about what is meant in this context by Auckland Gas’s distribution system. That expression is not a reference to a means of distributing gas which can be considered as a functional entity separate from its physical components. In the present context Auckland Gas’s distribution system is a reference to an assemblage of linked pipes whose function was to carry gas from one place to another. \[Emphasis added\] 131. It is considered that this also supports the view that the relevant focus is on the physical asset. In this regard, the above reference to “an assemblage of linked pipes” suggests that having a degree of physical connection between component parts is relevant to finding a single asset. Consideration also needs to be given to what the asset’s function is and what items or components are necessary to carry out that function. Factors considered in the repairs and maintenance cases 132. The question being asked in the cases is “what is the entirety that it is relevant to consider?”. The cases appear to agree that it is not about finding a profit-earning structure or entity, but is about a “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. 133. The courts have gone about determining this in a number of different ways and have considered various factors. However, the courts have also repeatedly warned of the danger of applying previous authorities to a different set of circumstances. Notwithstanding this, common factors appear across the cases (albeit that they may have been applied differently, depending on the facts being considered). These factors can 38 be usefully grouped into the categories outlined in paragraph 87 as follows: Physical 134. The physical category is about whether an item is physically distinct or separate or whether there is a degree of physical connection between the items (Auckland Trotting, Auckland Gas (CA and PC)). 135. Some of the cases have suggested that the size and/or cost of an item may be relevant factors to consider (at least in so far as whether an item is sufficiently big or expensive). 136. In terms of the relevance of size, in Lindsay the court noted that the slipway was a “very substantial” erection. The court also noted the existence of other erections and buildings on the taxpayer’s premises. In Auckland Trotting the court noted that the lamps adjacent to the track were large, and considered that this supported the view that they were not a part of the racing track (although this appears to have been relevant to their being a separate piece of plant rather than just a separate asset – the court was also concerned with their function in relation to the track). In both cases, the items under consideration were not attached to the other items of which they potentially formed a part, although it is not clear whether this was a relevant consideration. 137. It is not immediately clear whether or how similar considerations would apply in the context of residential rental properties. It would appear that this factor is suggesting that if an item is physically large enough, then it could be considered a “principal item of capital equipment”, and, thus, not part of a larger asset. It may be that it would apply to an item such as a large shed or glasshouse on a property. However, these are likely to be considered separate assets based on the application of the other factors. Most of the items being considered in this statement are substantially smaller in physical size than the building under consideration. Similarly, when looked at in absolute terms, no item in a residential rental property is likely to be equal to the size of the slipway in Lindsay or the lamps in Auckland Trotting. 138. As is seen below, size does not appear to be a relevant consideration in the depreciation context and, specifically, it was not considered in the cases on residential rental properties in that context. Consequently, it is considered that this factor should be given limited or no weight in any test. 139. Similar considerations arise in terms of the relevance of the cost of the item in question. The court in Auckland Trotting noted that the lamps appeared to be expensive (although it did not appear to have evidence on this point). Similarly, in Hawkes Bay Power the court noted the significant cost of the underground part of the electricity network (both in relative and absolute terms). Particularly, in Hawkes Bay Power, the court may have been influenced by the repairs and maintenance context – as the cost and scale of the undergrounding would most certainly be relevant to whether what was done constituted repairs or replacement. However, as with physical size, this factor does not appear to be a relevant consideration in the depreciation cases (considered below). Further, in the context of a residential rental property, it is difficult from a conceptual point of view, to see how the cost of an item can be relevant to whether it 39 is part of a building or not. This could potentially lead to cases where (for example) cheap kitchen cabinetry is part of the building, but expensive kitchen cabinetry is not. The conclusions would seem to get even more unusual if cost is relative – for example, a new bathroom vanity is part of the building if it is put in an expensive house, but the same bathroom vanity is not a part of the building if it is put in a cheap house (because in relative terms, it would be more expensive). Based on this it is considered that the cost of the item in question is not a relevant factor to look at when determining the appropriate asset for depreciation purposes. Completeness 140. Completeness involves a consideration of whether the item is: • an integral part of the asset (Auckland Trotting, Hawkes Bay Power); • a subsidiary part of something else or can be independently installed without recourse to other items (Lindsay, Hawkes Bay Power); • necessary for the asset to function (Lindsay, Hawkes Bay Power, Auckland Gas (CA)); • capable of separate operation or whether it is part of an integrated system (Poverty Bay, Auckland Gas (CA)); • clearly distinguishable (Poverty Bay). 141. It is considered that all of these factors are directed to a similar enquiry. For example, whether an item is an integral part of an asset, is the same question as whether the item is necessary for the asset to function. Whether the item is a subsidiary part of something else is asking the question another way – that is, if it is a whole standalone asset that can function by itself, it is less likely to be a subsidiary part of something else. However, where an item is an integral part of the asset in question, then it will be a subsidiary part of that asset. Similarly, whether the item is capable of separate operation or whether it is part of an integrated system is making the same enquiry. 142. Consequently, it is considered that all of the above factors can be combined into one enquiry along the lines of: is the item in question part of a larger asset that would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item in question? In this regard, if the item is complete and capable of separate operation on its own this will point towards the smaller item not being a necessary part of a larger item. 143. Although not a repairs and maintenance case, Case H8 (discussed above from paragraph 75) also considers similar factors. In this regard, it is noted that Barber DJ was heavily influenced by the fact that the computer could function without the disk drive (and at the time 80% of such computers were sold without disk drives). However, in that case, he did not consider it relevant that the disk drive was unable to function without being “hooked up” to the computer. This suggests that, while a potentially relevant factor to consider, the ability of a smaller item to function without a larger one is not necessary for the two items to be considered separate. 40 Depreciation and plant cases 144. It is noted that there are no cases on point in the New Zealand depreciation context. However, it is useful to briefly consider some depreciation cases from Australia and the United Kingdom to see how they determine the relevant depreciable asset and whether they shed any further light on how the above factors should be applied (in terms of ordering and weighting). 145. The Australian case of Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand v FCT 70 ATC 4,024 considered whether acoustic metal pan fittings and framework forming ceilings and electrical wiring, conduits and trunking were “plant” or “articles” for depreciation purposes. The ceiling consisted of metal panels with multiple perforations, backed by paper bags containing sound-absorbent material, and each was supported by a metal framework attached by metal rods to the concrete floor above. The panels could be readily removed. Relevantly, Kitto J concluded that neither the ceiling nor the wiring was “plant”, noting that the mode of affixation, although slight, was adequate. Kitto J also noted that the panels were part of the ceiling and their purpose was to make the building a complete building. 146. Case 11/97 97 ATC 173 concerned whether kitchen cupboards and a wardrobe in a residential rental property were depreciable. It considered the meaning of “plant”, and stated that the “functional test” was important in determining whether an item was “plant”. This was said to require that the item under consideration be functional in relation to the income earning activities (at page 177). While the “functional” test was not considered a complete answer, it was noted that, in the context of applying the “functional test, that which is the setting (or venue) for the taxpayer’s activities is not plant. 147. Although Case 11/97 is also in the plant context and, as such, much of it will not be able to be readily translated into the New Zealand context, the case specifically considers what makes up a residential rental property. Further, it considers whether items are an “integral part” of the property as a residential unit, which is the same factor considered in some of the New Zealand cases. Therefore, the case is worthy of consideration. 148. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal made the following observations about the distinction between “plant” and items that are an integral part of a residential property (at page 179): (i) It follows that that which forms the rental property as “setting”, that which contributes to its usefulness as “setting”, gives it efficacy as “setting”, will also not be treated as “plant”. Thus it has been held that those items which are an “integral part” of the property as a residential unit, or in other words, which form “part of the fabric” of such property are not “plant”. ... (j) The critical question is, then, as to the circumstances in which an item will be treated as “part of the fabric” of a building, such that it will be regarded as a “part of the setting”. It is clear that the item must in some way be attached or connected to the building. By the same token, the Tribunal does not consider that every attached item, simply by virtue of attachment, will be regarded as integral with the premises. And nor can it be shortly concluded that once a “fixture”, in the technical legal sense, an item is ipso facto part of the 41 fabric of a building. \[Emphasis added\] 149. The above quotation notes that an item must be in some way attached or connected to the building before it will be considered part of the building. Similarly, it is clear that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is of the view that, while attachment is relevant to the enquiry (and a necessary attribute), it is not sufficient to answer the question. The tribunal went on to consider other case law on this issue and reached some further conclusions (at page 180): It can be seen that two distinct elements emerge from this line of reasoning. The first looks at the role of the relevant items in the context of a property utilised for residential lease. It examines whether the items are an essential aspect of that which makes up the residence as a lettable entity. If, in other words, the items are part of the complete entity which must be provided by a landlord, at the very minimum, to a tenant; almost as, one might say, a de facto precondition of the residential leasehold agreement, the item will be part of the “setting”. This is the test referred to by the Tribunal for the purposes of these Reasons as the “completeness test”. The second element looks to the method of installation, that is, the nature and extent of the item’s attachment to the building in a purely physical sense; this then is the test referred to by the Tribunal for the purposes of these Reasons as the “affixation test”. \[Emphasis added\] 150. It can be seen from this that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal favoured dual tests of “completeness” and “affixation”. “Affixation” relates to how the items are connected in a physical sense. This is a similar enquiry to that made in Auckland Trotting and Auckland Gas and is a “physical” test. 151. Similarly, the “completeness test” is about whether certain items are necessary for a rental property to be a complete entity. This is similar to some of the factors considered in the New Zealand cases, such as whether an item is an integral part of the asset, whether the item is necessary for the asset to function, and whether the item is part of an integrated system. 152. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal reached the view that, of the two tests, “completeness” was the dominant one, with “affixation” being of lesser significance. J Block (Senior Member) summarised the relationship between the two tests (at page 183): (t) Looking at these cases overall, therefore, the test for determining that which is part of the fabric of a residential dwelling can be distilled as follows: an item will be regarded as an integral part of the structure of the unit, as part of its “fabric”, if it is an essential aspect of that which makes up the residence as a lettable entity; or put in other words, if it is a basic requirement of a leased residential dwelling without which the dwelling cannot be used for such a purpose. Considerations of attachment; namely the mode, manner and degree of affixation; are relevant, but only insofar as they contribute to an understanding of the more probative question as to the item’s role in the premises as a complete lettable entity. \[Emphasis added\] 42 153. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal also went on to observe that what is required for a complete entity may change over time and may differ between different types of dwelling. 154. The two specific items considered in Case 11/97 were kitchen cupboards and a wardrobe. J Block (Senior Member) found that a flat was not a lettable entity without the attachments necessary for a proper kitchen, so the kitchen cupboards were part of the building. 155. In contrast, it was found that a wardrobe was not a basic requirement of the residence as a lettable entity. In addition, it was not “built in” and could be dismantled quickly and easily by the removal of a few screws, leaving no damage to the structure of the wardrobe or to the unit. Consequently the wardrobe was not part of the building. 156. Woodward v FCT 2003 ATC 2001 considered whether a number of items were depreciable items of plant in the context of a group of apartments that were let for residential rental. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal followed the judgment of J Block (senior member) in Case 11/97. Of interest is the tribunal’s consideration of a built-in wardrobe. Woodward reached the opposite view to that found in Case 11/97, and concluded that the wardrobe was part of the building. This was primarily because the wardrobe in question was found to be part of the walls of the property, and because dismounting it would create a space for built-in wardrobe cupboards without doors or shelves. 157. Cases from the United Kingdom on the meaning of plant have the same fundamental difficulty as Australian plant cases, in that they are asking a slightly different question to the one this statement is trying to answer. Further, the United Kingdom cases considered do not specifically relate to residential rental properties, so are arguably of even less assistance. Notwithstanding this, it is useful to briefly consider Wimpy International Ltd v Warland (1987) BTC 591 (which has been applied in subsequent cases in the United Kingdom) to determine whether it has anything useful to offer. 158. The court in Wimpy was deciding whether the taxpayers were entitled to a capital allowance for expenditure on plant. In the United Kingdom, “plant” (apparatus used for carrying on a business) is distinguished from “premises” (the place in which the business is conducted). The disputed expenditure in Wimpy was on the refurbishment of premises and included expenditure on items such as shop fronts, tiles, suspended ceilings, mirrors, stairs, and light fittings. 159. The court focused on whether the items in question were used to create an “ambience” for the restaurants (in which case they could potentially be items of plant), or whether they were a part of the premises. In the Chancery Division, Hoffmann J gave the following statement of the test to be applied in determining whether the expenditure was on “premises” or “plant”(at page 615): How does one apply the premises test to items which were not incorporated as part of the original building but have been added by way of subsequent improvement? Lord Lowry, as we have seen, said that the question was whether something had ‘become part of the premises’, and Templeman J. spoke of ‘integral parts of the building’. The question is not, I think, the same as whether it has become part of the realty for the purposes of the law of real property or a fixture for the purposes of the law of landlord and tenant. In 43 Yarmouth v. France, Lindley L.J. contemplated that fixed chattels might be plant. ... Adopting the words of Lord Lowry, the question seems to me to be whether it would be more appropriate to describe the item as having become part of the premises than as having retained a separate identity. This is a question of fact and degree, to which some of the relevant considerations will be: whether the item appears visually to retain a separate identity, the degree of permanence with which it has been attached, the incompleteness of the structure without it and the extent to which it was intended to be permanent or whether it was likely to be replaced within a relatively short period. Mr. Aaronson submitted in replay that, if contrary to his submission, this was the proper test, those considerations constituted a series of separate hurdles which had to be overcome before an item could be regarded as a part of the premises. It had to have been attached with the intention of being a permanent fixture, it must have been actually and irremovably fixed and it must not be a mere ornament or embellishment. I do not agree. In my judgment these matters are factors to be taken into account in answering the question posed by Lord Lowry. \[Emphasis added (in bold)\] 160. It can be seen from the quotation above that the court was specifically considering items that had been added to the original building by way of subsequent improvements. Hoffmann J considered that the factors relevant to determining whether these items had become part of the building were: • whether the item appears visually to retain a separate identity; • the degree of permanence with which the item has been attached; • the incompleteness of the structure without the item; and • the extent to which the item was intended to be permanent or whether the item was likely to be replaced within a relatively short period. 161. The degree of attachment and the incompleteness factors are similar to those considered in other cases. Whether the item appears visually to retain a separate identity is arguably also the same type of factor the New Zealand cases were taking into account when they looked at whether an item was physically distinct (although Hoffmann J does not offer any further explanation as to what he intended this factor to mean). 162. On the other hand, the extent to which the item was intended to be permanent appears to be specifically relevant to determining whether an item is décor or whether it has become part of the premises (ie, replacing an item regularly may suggest its function is more decorative than a substantive part of the building). Consequently, it is considered that this factor is not relevant to determining the appropriate asset for depreciation purposes. Summary 163. It can be seen from the above discussion that none of the cases considered gives a definitive answer to how to determine the relevant asset for depreciation purposes (specifically in the residential rental property context). None of the cases is directly on point, and each case considers different factors depending on the circumstances. 44 Notwithstanding this, however, it is necessary to come up with a test that can be applied to determine whether an item is part of a building for the purposes of calculating depreciation on residential rental properties. 164. The following paragraphs draw from the factors discussed in the cases and combine them into a practical test. Although the particular test adopted below is not drawn from (and is not found in) any specific case, it is considered that it is consistent with the factors discussed in the cases and reflects a workable position that the Commissioner and taxpayers can apply. 165. The depreciation cases (to the extent that they are relevant) are largely consistent with the repairs and maintenance cases. Case 11/97 is the most useful of the cases considered as it specifically looks at the factors in a residential rental property context. It also gives some order and weighting to the factors, which is largely absent from the repairs and maintenance cases (although the greater references to completeness considerations suggest they are more important than the physical attachment factor). 166. Because the tests taken from the repairs and maintenance cases are substantially the same as the two tests outlined in Case 11/97 and that Case 11/97 specifically considers a residential rental property, the weightings this case gives to the factors should be taken into consideration (especially as they are not inconsistent with anything in the New Zealand cases). Taking into account all of the cases considered above, the Commissioner will apply the following approach to determine whether an item is a separate asset, or a part of a larger asset: Step 1: Determine whether the item is in some way attached or connected to the building. If the item is completely unattached, then it will not form a part of the building. An item will not be considered attached for these purposes, if its only means of attachment is being plugged or wired into an electrical outlet (such as a freestanding oven), or attached to a water or gas outlet. If the item is attached to the building, go to step 2. Step 2: Determine whether the item is an integral part of the residential rental property such that a residential rental property would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item. If the item is an integral part of the residential rental property, then the item will be a part of the building. If the item is not an integral part of the residential rental property, go to step 3. Step 3: Determine whether the item is built-in or attached or connected to the building in such a way that it is part of the “fabric” of the building. Consider factors such as the nature and degree of attachment, the difficulty involved in the item’s removal, and whether there would be any significant damage to the item or the building if the item were removed. If the item is part of the fabric of the building, then it is part of the building for depreciation purposes. Capital improvements from the 2005/06 tax year: depreciation treatment 167. Section EE 37 applies when a person makes an improvement to an item of depreciable property. This section applies to improvements made in the 2005/06 tax year and following tax years. 168. An “improvement” is defined in section EE 67 as an “alteration, extension, or repair of an item of depreciable property that increases its capital value”. The Act does not define the words “alteration”, “extension” and 45 “repair”, but their meanings are limited to those alterations, extensions and repairs that increase the capital value of the item of depreciable property identified. The ordinary meaning of an alteration, an extension, or a repair will provide guidance in determining whether the work results in an improvement. This demonstrates that an improvement can result from a wide variety of work of a capital nature, but does not include work that results in the creation of a new item of depreciable property. 169. In applying section EE 37 there must first be an existing item of depreciable property. Then it must be determined whether the work carried out has resulted in an improvement or in a new item of depreciable property. The “combined asset versus component assets” approach set out in this statement will be useful in making this determination for residential rental properties. When the work has resulted in an improvement, the improvement forms part of, and has the same characteristics as, the existing item. 170. Having determined that there is an improvement under the section EE 67 definition, section EE 37 sets out how to calculate the depreciation loss deduction for the improvement. To calculate the part-year depreciation loss for the income year in which the improvement is made, the improvement is treated as if it were a separate item of depreciable property. Even though the improvement is treated as if it were a separate item, the same depreciation treatment as the item it improved is applied, subject to any change in the rate. 171. In the following income years, a person using the diminishing value depreciation method or straight-line depreciation method may choose to continue to treat the improvement as if it were a separate item of depreciable property or as part of the item of depreciable property that was improved. 172. Taxpayers may take into consideration changes to the depreciation rate when deciding whether to continue to treat the improvement as if it were a separate item or incorporate the cost of the improvement into the existing item’s adjusted tax value in the income years following the year the improvement was made so as to take advantage of any favourable change to the depreciation rate applicable to that item. 173. By way of example, where a building was acquired before 19 May 2005, and an improvement to the building was carried out after the changes introduced by the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, it will generally be more beneficial for the taxpayer to treat the improvement as part of the building and continue to depreciate at the pre 2005 rates. Conversely, for an item of depreciable property acquired before 1 April 2005 that is not a building, it will generally be more beneficial for the taxpayer for an improvement made after the changes introduced by the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 to be treated as if it were a separate item of depreciable property so as to be eligible for the higher depreciation rates. 174. The Commissioner considers that section EE 37 does not allow a taxpayer to break down items that form part of the residential rental property after carrying out an improvement. The section does not disturb the “combined asset versus components asset” approach because it does not establish an alternative test for identifying separate items of depreciable property. 46 Section EE 37 does not allow for an improvement to be depreciated as a different item of depreciable property to that of the item improved. 175. The Commissioner’s conclusion on the application of section EE 37 is further supported by the section’s history. Section EE 37 is a codification of a practice published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 9 (May 1993) as part of the introduction of the statutory depreciation regime, including the introduction of loading to depreciation rates. The Tax Information Bulletin item stated that improvement expenditure could be added to the cost of the depreciable property and depreciated as part of that property or it could be separately capitalised and treated as a separate asset. This practice ensured taxpayers were not disadvantaged by carrying out improvements to items of depreciable property acquired before the depreciation regime’s introduction. Section EE 37 codifies this practice. 176. In summary, an improvement under section EE 37 does not change the nature of the item improved. Applying section EE 37 does not create a new item of depreciable property. The definition of improvement in section EE 67 means an improvement forms an integral part of the item it improved and is treated as if it were a separate item of depreciable property only for the purposes of calculating a part-year depreciation loss amount. It also allows the taxpayer the benefit of any change to the depreciation rate applying to that kind of item. Therefore, the item improved is the same item of depreciable property identified using the approach outlined in this statement. 177. Section EE 37 provides the statutory mechanism by which to calculate the part-year depreciation loss amount for the improvement during the year the improvement was made and for the period in which the improvement is used or available for use. The section ensures the depreciation loss for the improvement is calculated accurately and on a consistent basis with the existing item. It also removes any possible disadvantage resulting from any changes to depreciation rates faced by taxpayers when carrying out capital improvements to existing items of depreciable property. Conclusions 178. The Commissioner will apply the following approach to determine whether an item is part of a residential rental property or a separate item of property. Step 1: Determine whether the item is in some way attached or connected to the building. If the item is completely unattached, then it will not form a part of the building. An item will not be considered attached for these purposes, if its only means of attachment is being plugged or wired into an electrical outlet (such as a freestanding oven), or attached to a water or gas outlet. If the item is attached to the building, go to step 2. Step 2: Determine whether the item is an integral part of the residential rental property such that a residential rental property would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item. If the item is an integral part of the residential rental property, then the item will be a part of the building. If the item is not an integral part of the residential rental property, go to step 3. Step 3: Determine whether the item is built-in or attached or connected to the building in such a way that it is part of the “fabric” of the building. Consider factors such as the nature and degree of attachment, the difficulty involved in the item’s removal, and whether there would be any significant damage to the item or 47 the building if the item were removed. If the item is part of the fabric of the building, then it is part of the building for depreciation purposes. Submissions Received 179. Submissions received on the exposure draft raised several issues, which are briefly commented on below to the extent that they have not otherwise been dealt with in the statement. 180. Some submissions queried whether the fact that different parts of a building have different economic lives should mean that those parts should be treated as separate items of depreciable property. It is noted that many assets that are made up of a number of components will have parts that wear out more quickly than others. This does not mean that those parts are necessarily separate assets. It is the Commissioner’s view that the depreciation rate set takes into account that different parts of an asset have different economic lives. Consequently the fact that different parts of a building have shorter economic lives does not mean that they are separately depreciable. The question is “what is the item of depreciable property?”. 181. Some submissions queried why the discussion on the meaning of the “building fit-out (when in books separately from building cost)” assets category was removed from the previous draft. It is the Commissioner’s view that the discussion on how the words “building fit-out (when in books separately from building cost)” went beyond the scope of the statement, which is about how to determine what the appropriate asset for depreciation purposes is. It is not about determining whether such an asset would come within the building fit-out category (by analysing factors such as whether the fit-out was done subsequent to acquisition, or how the consideration was allocated between different items). It is the Commissioner’s view that including this analysis potentially obscured the issue considered by the Statement (ie whether an item is separately depreciable property) and may confuse taxpayers. In addition, it is considered that the analysis was not necessary to support the conclusions reached in the Statement. 182. Some submissions queried why hot water cylinders were considered part of the building when they were generally only attached to a power source and a water source. As a result of the submissions received, the Commissioner has reconsidered his position in respect of hot water cylinders and water heaters and has reached the view that they can be separately depreciated. 48 Appendix: Examples Example 1: Plumbing and piping 183. Plumbing and piping within a residential rental building are not separate assets but are a part of the building in which they are installed. They meet the preliminary threshold test (step 1 of the three-step test) because they are attached to the building (being contained within, and held in place by, the walls and roof of a building, as well as being secured to the walls and roof). 184. Under step 2 of the three-step test, a residential rental building would be considered incomplete without plumbing. Running water and sewerage systems are ordinary features of residential rental buildings in New Zealand and it is extremely unlikely a building would be let without plumbing. Example 2: Electrical wiring 185. Electrical wiring is part of a residential rental building, so should not be treated as a separate asset. Electrical wiring is attached to the building because it is threaded through holes drilled into beams inside the walls and held in place within the roof of the building. 186. Without electrical wiring to provide electricity, a residential rental building would not be considered complete. It is another basic feature that is expected in residential rental buildings in New Zealand, without which it would be unlikely that such a building could be let. Consequently, electrical wiring satisfies step 2 of the three-step test, so is a part of the building in which it is installed. This is consistent with Woodward v FCT (2003) 51 ATR 1115 where it was held that electrical distribution gear (wiring, cabling and switchboards) was part of the rental apartment and not a separate asset. Example 3: Internal walls 187. The internal walls of a building are part of the building and should not be treated as a separate asset. They are attached to the ceiling and floor and to other internal walls of the building and form part of its structure. 188. Internal walls are an ordinary and expected feature of a residential rental building. Such a building would be considered incomplete without internal walls to divide the building into rooms. Consequently, internal walls are part of the building to which they are attached and should not be treated as separate assets. Example 4: Doors (Internal and external doors) 189. Doors are a part of the building to which they are attached. Although the level of attachment is not strong (doors generally being affixed to walls by hinges that are screwed into the side of the door and the door frame), it is sufficient to meet the threshold test in step 1 of the three-step test. 49 190. The outcome under step 2 of the three-step test is not as clear. It is noted that not every access way in a wall requires a door in order to be complete. However, a building could not be said to be complete without at least an external door to prevent people from entering the residential rental building without permission. It is further considered that a residential rental building would also not be complete without some internal doors to allow privacy in certain areas of the building, such as bathrooms and toilets. Therefore, a residential rental property would be considered incomplete if it had no doors. As all doors in a residential rental property should generally be treated in the same manner (as they are materially similar), on balance, it is concluded that doors are a part of the building, so should not be treated as separate assets. Example 5: Garage doors (when the garage is part of the residential rental building) 191. When a garage is part of a residential rental building, the garage door forms part of that building, so should not be treated as a separate asset. A garage door is attached to the building, usually by some kind of runners or hinges that are attached to the door frame (step 1 of the three-step test). 192. While, it is arguably possible to have a garage without a door, where a garage has been built to have a door, it would be considered incomplete without that door, which is designed to prevent people who should not have access from entering the building (step 2 of the three-step test). Example 6: Fitted furniture (wardrobes and cupboards built into the wall) 193. Fitted furniture (ie, furniture, such as wardrobes and cupboards, that are built into a wall) is part of the building and not a separate asset. Fitted furniture meets the threshold test (step 1 of the three-step test) because it is attached to the walls of the building (by virtue of being built in). 194. A residential rental property would not generally be considered incomplete without fitted furniture such as wardrobes and cupboards and residential rental properties are routinely let without wardrobes (step 2 of the three- step test). Therefore, it is necessary to consider step 3. 195. Under step 3 of the test, fitted furniture is built into the wall and, so is attached to the ceiling and the floor of a building, as well as forming part of the wall. Therefore, the level of attachment is significant. If wardrobes and cupboards that are built into the wall were removed from a residential rental building, significant damage would likely be caused to the surrounding walls and ceiling of the building, as well as to the wardrobe or cupboard itself. Based on this, it is considered that the degree of attachment of such fitted furniture is such that it forms a part of the fabric of the building, so is part of the building rather than a separate asset. Example 7: Kitchen cupboards 196. Kitchen cupboards are part of a residential rental building, so should not be treated as separate assets. Kitchen cupboards are attached to the wall and/or floor of the residential rental building. Some cupboards are more 50 strongly attached than others – for example, many modern kitchen cupboards are attached to the wall with little more than a few screws. However, this level of attachment is sufficient to meet the threshold test in step 1. 197. Under step 2, a residential rental property would generally be considered incomplete without kitchen cupboards, because a kitchen (with cupboards) is essential for tenants to be able to carry out their daily activities. As step 2 is satisfied, it is considered that kitchen cupboards are a part of the building to which they are attached. This is consistent with Case 11/97. Example 8: Bathroom fittings and furniture 198. Bathroom fittings (toilets, baths, showers, and basin and vanity units) are part of a residential rental building, so should not be treated as separate assets. Such fittings easily meet the threshold attachment requirement (step 1). Further, a residential rental building would generally be considered incomplete without a toilet, a bath or a shower, and a basin and vanity unit. If a residential rental property has a bath and a separate shower, it could be argued that it would still be complete without one or the other. However, under step 3, it is considered that both baths and showers would be attached to such a degree that they are a part of the building (because they are plumbed in and generally also affixed by other means). It is, however, possible that a rental property could have a freestanding bath that could be easily removed from the bathroom without damage. In such a case, if the property also had a separate shower, then it could be argued that the bath was a separate asset. 199. On the other hand, much like wardrobes, bathroom cupboards are not considered necessary for a residential rental property to be complete. There are many rental properties without separate bathroom cupboards. Consequently, whether such cupboards are a part of the building will be determined by applying step 3 and considering whether they are “built in” or attached to such a degree that they are really a part of the fabric of the building. In this regard, a cupboard that is, for example, attached to the wall by a few screws and can be easily removed without significant damage to the wall or the cupboard, is considered a separate asset. Example 9: Wardrobes and cupboards not built into the wall 200. Wardrobes and cupboards that are not built into the wall are separate assets. Freestanding wardrobes and cupboards may not be attached to the building at all. In such a case, it is unnecessary to go on to consider steps 2 and 3. 201. Freestanding wardrobes and cupboards may be attached to a wall or the ceiling to prevent them from tipping over. In these cases, the threshold attachment requirement is satisfied and it is necessary to consider step 2 of the test. Under step 2, a residential rental property would not be considered incomplete without free standing wardrobes and cupboards. Therefore, it is necessary to consider step 3. 202. Unlike with built in cupboards and wardrobes, freestanding cupboards and wardrobes do not have a sufficient degree of attachment to make them part of the fabric of the building. Generally, they can be relatively easily 51 detached with little or no damage to the wall or the wardrobe or cupboard. Similarly, such items are easily relocated within a residential rental building or even to another building. Consequently, free standing cupboards and wardrobes will be separate assets. This is consistent with Case 11/97. Example 10: Carpet 203. Carpet is a separate asset and can be separately depreciated. Carpet satisfies the threshold attachment requirement (in step 1 of the three-step test) because it is generally attached at the edges to keep it in place. 204. Under step 2, a residential rental building would not be considered incomplete without carpet because many residential rental buildings have, for instance, wooden floors rather than carpets. 205. Under step 3, carpet is not attached to such a degree that it could be said to form a part of the fabric of the building. Rather, carpet is generally only attached at its edges and can be relatively easily removed without damage to the floor or the carpet. Example 11: Linoleum 206. Linoleum is part of the building in which it is installed and should not be treated as a separate asset. Linoleum is attached to the floor by an adhesive, so satisfies the necessary threshold attachment (in step 1 of the three-step test). 207. A residential rental building can be let without linoleum (eg, with bare floorboards), so a building can be considered complete without linoleum. 208. Under step 3, linoleum is considered to be attached to such a degree that it forms part of the fabric of the building. Unlike carpet, linoleum is strongly affixed to the building. Adhesive is spread over the floor and the linoleum is placed on top. Because of the way linoleum is attached to a residential rental building, it is very difficult for it to be removed without damage to the linoleum and, albeit to a lesser extent, the floor. Although it is possible for linoleum to be removed from the floor of a residential rental building, it is unlikely that it could be removed in one piece, so it is almost impossible for it to be reused in another room or building. Example 12: Tiles (wall and floor) 209. Tiles can be placed on the wall and floor of a residential rental building. Irrespective of where they are placed, tiles are a part of the residential rental building to which they are attached, so should not be treated as separate assets. 210. Tiles are attached to the floor or walls with an adhesive, so satisfy the necessary threshold attachment (in step 1 of the three-step test). 211. Tiles are not required for a residential rental building to be considered complete. A residential rental building can be let without wall or floor tiles. Therefore, the step 2 of the test is not satisfied and it is necessary to consider step 3. 52 212. Under step 3 of the test, tiles are part of a residential rental building because they are attached to such a degree that they are a part of the fabric of the building. Tiles are generally strongly attached to the floor or walls by an adhesive. Because of the adhesive’s strength, it is generally difficult to remove tiles without breaking them or damaging the underlying surface. Because of the damage that would likely be caused to the tiles on their removal, they would not be able to be relocated within the building or to another building. Example 13: Curtains 213. Curtains are not a part of the building in which they are installed and can be treated as separate assets for depreciation purposes. 214. Curtains satisfy the required threshold attachment (in step 1 of the three- step test) because they are attached to the building. However, a residential rental property would be considered complete without curtains and could be let. In this regard, it would not be unusual to find a residential rental property without window coverings. Kitchen and bathroom windows are commonly found without window coverings. Similarly, where a lounge or bedroom, for example, has particular views, an owner may decide to leave the windows uncovered. 215. Under step 3, curtains are not considered to be attached to such a degree that they form a part of the fabric of the building. They have a limited extent of affixation as they are generally attached with small clips to curtain rails, so are easily removed without damage to either the curtains or the building. Curtains are also easily relocated to another room within a building or another building. Example 14: Blinds 216. Blinds are not a part of the building and can be treated as separate assets. Blinds are attached sufficiently to satisfy the required threshold attachment (in step 1 of the three-step test). However, they are not necessary for a residential rental property to be considered complete. Further, they are not attached to such a degree that they form a part of the fabric of the building as they are merely screwed to the top of window frames and can be easily removed without damage to either the blind or the building. Example 15: Water heaters and hot-water cylinders 217. Water heaters and hot water cylinders (both gas and electric) are not generally a part of the building and can be treated as separate assets. 218. Water heaters and hot water cylinders will not satisfy the required threshold attachment (in step 1 of the three-step test). Generally hot water cylinders and water heaters are attached to a power supply (electricity or gas) and to a water supply. In these circumstances, step 1 of the three-step test will not be satisfied and hot water cylinders and water heaters will be treated as separately depreciable items. 53 Example 16: Heating / Air conditioning systems 219. Whether or not heating and air conditioning systems are part of the building will depend on exactly how they are attached to the building. 220. The majority of heating and air conditioning systems (other than those that are merely plugged into an electricity supply) will satisfy the threshold test (step 1 of the three-step test). 221. A residential rental property would not generally be considered incomplete without a heating or air conditioning system and residential rental properties are routinely let without such systems (step 2 of the three-step test). Therefore, it is necessary to consider step 3. 222. Under step 3 of the test, home ventilation systems that are built into the structure of the building will be a part of the building as the degree of attachment is such that the systems form a part of the fabric of the building. Whether other heating systems, such as heat pumps, are a part of the building will depend on the degree to which they are attached. Where the degree of attachment is not significant and the unit can be removed with minimal damage to the building and the unit, then such a system will not be part of the building and will be separately depreciable. Conversely, where such a system is built-in to a significant degree and cannot be removed without considerable damage, then it will generally be a part of the building and not separately depreciable.
Interpretation Statement IS 10/02 MEANING OF “BUILDING” IN THE DEPRECIATION PROVISIONS Note (not part of the Interpretation Statement): This Interpretation Statement sets out the meaning of the term “building” in the context of the depreciation provisions. Previously some items of depreciable property that are considered to be buildings under this Interpretation Statement may not have been treated as buildings for depreciation purposes. The Minister of Revenue announced on 30 July 2009 a proposal to “grand-parent” the existing treatment of these items – Depreciation: Govt to mitigate 'building' interpretation. At the end of this Interpretation Statement there is a table listing these items with accompanying examples. Also, as a result of this statement some asset classes in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates will be reviewed including the asset classes for carparks (building and pads); buildings (portable) and site huts. Any changes to these asset classes will involve the issuing of new depreciation determinations. Any new depreciation determinations for economic rates will be issued in draft form for consultation. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. The legislation referred to in this Interpretation Statement is set out in the Appendix. This Interpretation Statement applies on and after 30 July 2009. Summary 1. This Interpretation Statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the meaning of the term “building” for the purposes of the depreciation provisions contained in the Income Tax Act 2007. The term “building” is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. Therefore, the purpose of this Interpretation Statement is to provide a definition, which when applied to an item of depreciable property, will determine whether that item is a building. This is important because the depreciation provisions require taxpayers to know whether an item of depreciable property is a building in order to determine the depreciation treatment of that item. 2. For depreciation purposes, buildings are treated differently from other items of depreciable property. If an item of depreciable property is a building:  a different depreciation rate may apply;  the 20% loading that applies to certain depreciation rates does not apply; and  a deduction for a loss on items no longer used, or a deduction for a loss on disposal, cannot be claimed except in limited circumstances. 3. The term “building” can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. For example, a possible wide meaning of the 1 term “building” includes structures that are “built”, such as fences. A possible narrower meaning might exclude certain types of buildings for particular reasons, such as buildings that provide a specialised setting or have a specialised function or purpose or are integrated with plant. The Commissioner’s view is that in the context of the tax depreciation provisions, a building is an item within the ordinary or conventional meaning of the term “building”. Case law indicates that a building within the ordinary or conventional meaning of that term generally has the following characteristics:  A building is a structure of considerable size.  A building is permanent in the sense that it is intended to last a considerable time.  A building is permanent in the sense that it is designed to be located permanently on the site where it stands. A building is fixed to the land on which it stands. However, a building need not be legally part of the land on which it stands.  A building is enclosed by walls and a roof.  A building can function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. 4. Given that the design of, and materials used in, buildings are likely to change over time (without altering the basic concept of an ordinary or conventional building), it is not possible to be definitive as to the design or type of materials that are characteristic of such a building. However, the design of a building and the materials used to construct a building need to be of a kind that are intended to last for a considerable period. 5. The appearance and function of the structure are relevant in determining whether a structure is a building for depreciation purposes (that is, whether the structure looks like the conventional idea of a building and is designed for the uses to which conventional buildings are ordinarily put). It is appropriate to ask whether a reasonable person would regard the structure as a building. 6. The Commissioner’s view is that the term “building” for the purposes of the depreciation provisions is the ordinary or conventional meaning without modification to exclude certain types of buildings. This interpretation is supported by the definition provided for “temporary building” in section YA 1 and the provision that allows a loss on the destruction of a temporary building (section DB 20). This interpretation is also supported by the legislative development of the depreciation provisions in relation to buildings. 7. At the end of this Interpretation Statement there is analysis on how the Commissioner considers the building characteristics apply to particular items of depreciable property listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. While the analysis does not cover all items within the Buildings and Structures asset category, it is intended to demonstrate the practical application of the building characteristics identified in this statement. Particular reference is made to items that, as a result of the 2 view set out in this Interpretation Statement, the Commissioner will now treat as buildings for depreciation purposes. Background 8. To ascertain the meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions, it is useful first to understand how the term is used in the depreciation provisions. The term “building” has been in the current depreciation regime since the introduction of the regime in 1993. However, the term was also used in the asset disposal provisions prior to the current regime. To understand the current context in which the term “building” is used, it is useful to consider earlier provisions. Pre-1993 treatment for buildings – depreciation and disposal 9. Prior to the current depreciation regime that was introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1993, buildings were in certain circumstances treated differently from other depreciable assets in the Income Tax Act 1976. 10. The rules dealing with the disposal of depreciated assets required consideration of whether an item of property was a building for various provisions. For example, the provision that specifically excluded depreciable buildings from allowable deductions on loss on disposal, was introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1988 as section 117(1A) of the Income Tax Act 1976. In addition to this, the depreciation deduction provision required consideration as to whether an item of property was plant, machinery, or equipment, a temporary building, or premises. Of these terms only the term “temporary building” was defined in the Income Tax Act 1976. 11. Temporary buildings were defined to cover certain types of buildings including buildings that were built to house plant or machinery and needed to be demolished to remove that plant or machinery. Temporary buildings were expressly treated differently from other buildings in various provisions. 12. Section 108(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 was the depreciation allowance provision. At the Commissioner’s discretion, section 108(1) provided for the depreciation of plant, machinery, or equipment, or a temporary building if the depreciation was caused by fair wear and tear or by the item becoming obsolete or useless. Also, at the Commissioner’s discretion section 108(1) provided for the depreciation of assets “not being plant, machinery or equipment, or a temporary building” (i.e. premises) if the depreciation was caused only by fair wear and tear. In this way, section 108(1) required taxpayers to determine whether their assets (including buildings) were plant or premises. Also, section 106(1)(l) of the Income Tax Act 1976 provided that no deduction was allowed for any loss incurred on the demolition, destruction, or disposal of any premises other than a temporary building. 13. Under section 108(1), typically buildings were given cost price (i.e. straight line) depreciation rates by the Commissioner. The Commissioner published these depreciation rates in the IR260 booklet. 14. The interim depreciation regime that was introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1992 provided for a 25% loading on existing 3 depreciation rates for certain assets acquired after 16 December 1991 and on or before 31 March 1994. The loading specifically did not apply to buildings. This provision was originally introduced as section 108A of the Income Tax Act 1976. The interim provision was introduced as a short- term measure before the implementation of the changes that led to the current depreciation regime. 15. Therefore, the earlier provisions prior to the current depreciation regime required consideration of a number of terms: “building”, “premises”, “temporary building”, and “plant, machinery or equipment”. These terms had been referred to in the Income Tax Act 1976 since it was enacted and were also referred to in the relevant equivalent sections of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. In this way the earlier provisions operated within a different scheme to the current regime. Current depreciation regime 16. Unlike the previous depreciation rules, the current depreciation provisions specifically require consideration as to whether an item of depreciable property is a building rather than whether it is premises, plant, machinery or equipment, or a temporary building. (However, it is still necessary to consider whether a building is a temporary building for particular provisions outside the depreciation provisions.) 17. A deduction is allowed for the depreciation loss on an item owned by a person that is “depreciable property” and that is used or available for use by the person to the extent that the loss was incurred in deriving assessable income: sections DA 1 and EE 1(2). “Depreciable property” is property that might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for that purpose: section EE 6(1). Section EE 7(a) provides that although land cannot be “depreciable property”, buildings, fixtures, and the land improvements listed in schedule 13 can be if they satisfy section EE 6(1). Method of depreciation 18. Generally, three alternative methods are permitted for calculating the amount of a depreciation loss: the straight-line method, the diminishing value method and the pool method: sections EE 9(1) and EE 12 to EE 24. As buildings are not “poolable property”, the pool method cannot be used for buildings: sections EE 12(2) and EE 66(2). An item’s economic useful life (“EUL”) is a component of both the straight-line method and the diminishing value method. An item’s EUL is the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or useful in a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income taking into account passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion and obsolescence and assuming the item is subject to normal and reasonable maintenance: section EE 63. Setting rates 19. Section EE 9(2) directs that the economic rate is dealt with in section EE 26, the annual rate is dealt with in sections EE 31, EE 33, and EE 34, and special and provisional rates are dealt with in sections EE 35 and EE 36. 4 20. Section EE 26 sets out the relevant provisions for determining economic rates and sets out the ordering of how the various provisions apply. As will be shown, determining whether an item is a building or not is critical to working out what rate-setting provision applies. 21. Section EE 26(1)(a) provides that rates are set under section EE 27 for items that are not buildings, fixed life intangible property, excluded depreciable property, or property for which an economic rate is set under section EE 29 or EE 30, and are acquired on or after 1 April 2005. (Section EE 29 is applicable only for certain aircraft and motor vehicles.) Therefore, section EE 26(1)(a) directs that if the item is a building then section EE 27 is not applicable. 22. Section EE 26(1)(b) provides that rates are set under section EE 28 for items that are buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 and do not have a rate set under section EZ 23. (As well as setting rates for buildings acquired before 19 May 2005, section EZ 23 also sets rates for buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 as relationship property or from a company in the same wholly-owned group of companies, from a person who applied to the item an economic rate set under section EZ 23 or a corresponding section.) Therefore, if the item is a building acquired on or after 19 May 2005 then section EE 26(1)(b) directs that section EE 28 is the rate setting provision for that item (unless it is relationship property described above). 23. Section EE 26(1)(c) provides that rates are set under section EE 29 for certain aircraft and motor vehicles. 24. Section EE 26(1)(d) provides that rates are set under section EE 30 for items that have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost (ie, a “high residual value”) and would otherwise have a rate set under section EE 27 or EE 28. Therefore, section EE 26(1)(d) directs that rates are generally set under section EE 30 for items with high residual value that are not buildings acquired on or after 1 April 2005, and buildings with high residual value acquired on or after 19 May 2005. 25. Section EE 26(1)(e) provides that rates are set under section EZ 23 for items that are not buildings (or fixed life intangible property, or excluded depreciable property) acquired before 1 April 2005, and buildings acquired before 19 May 2005. 26. Therefore, in deciding what is the relevant provision for determining a rate for a particular item, section EE 26 requires determination of whether the item is a building. If it was acquired on or after 19 May 2005 then the relevant provision is generally section EE 28 if it is a building that does not have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost, or section EE 30 if it is a high residual value building. If the building was acquired before 19 May 2005 then the relevant provision is section EZ 23. Section EZ 23 does not apply to buildings that are excluded depreciable property (ie, buildings that were depreciable property before 1 April 1993 and are being depreciated using the pre-1993 rates). 5 27. The following table summarises what items the above provisions apply to: Provision Items that the provision applies to: section EE 27 Applies to items that are acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and are not:  buildings,  fixed life intangible property,  excluded depreciable property,\*  items that have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost, or  certain aircraft and motor vehicles. section EE 28 Applies to buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 section EE 29 Applies to certain aircraft and motor vehicles section EZ 23 Applies to:  plant and equipment acquired before 1 April 2005; and  buildings acquired before 19 May 2005 or buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 as relationship property or by a company in the same group that are not excluded depreciable property. section EE 30 Applies to:  plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 that have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost; and  buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 that have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost. \* Excluded depreciable property is defined in section EE 64 as depreciable property that was being used before 1 April 1993 and is depreciated using the pre-1993 rates. 28. In addition to the above provisions, section EE 31 provides a 20% loading to be applied to depreciation rates on New Zealand new items acquired in the person’s 1995/96 or later income year, excluding buildings, used imported cars, and international aircraft. This is similar to the 25% loading that applied to certain assets during the interim depreciation regime mentioned above. Loss on disposal and loss on items no longer used 29. A loss on items no longer used and a loss on disposal cannot be claimed in respect of buildings except in certain limited circumstances: sections EE 39 and EE 48(3). 30. However, section DB 20 allows a deduction for a loss incurred through the destruction of a temporary building. A “temporary building” is defined in section YA 1 as a building that: 6  is erected under a permit issued by a local authority or a public authority, and must be demolished or removed if the local authority or the public authority requires its demolition or removal; or  is erected at a construction site, and is to be demolished or removed on or before the completion of the construction; or  was erected, and is used, to house specific plant or machinery, and will have to be demolished to remove or replace the plant or machinery. Summary of current depreciation regime – treatment of buildings 31. Therefore under the current regime, it is necessary to determine whether the item of depreciable property is a building for the following reasons:  a different depreciation rate, as provided for in section EE 26, may apply; and  the 20% loading that applies to depreciation rates provided for in section EE 31 does not apply; and  a deduction for a loss on items no longer used, or a deduction for a loss on disposal cannot be claimed except in limited circumstances under sections EE 39 and EE 48(3). Analysis 32. Although the depreciation provisions require consideration as to whether an item of depreciable property is a building, there is no definition of the term “building” in the Income Tax Act 2007. 33. Section 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 states: (1) The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. (2) The matters that may be considered in ascertaining the meaning of an enactment include the indications provided in the enactment. (3) Examples of those indications are preambles, the analysis, a table of contents, headings to Parts and sections, marginal notes, diagrams, graphics, examples and explanatory material, and the organisation and format of the enactment. 34. In Commerce Commissioner v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767, the Supreme Court most recently set out the approach to be applied in order to interpret legislation applying the requirements of section 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999. 35. The Supreme Court in Fonterra held (at para 22) that: It is necessary to bear in mind that s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes text and purpose the key drivers of statutory interpretation. The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. Even if the meaning of the text may appear plain in isolation of purpose, that meaning should always be cross checked against purpose in order to observe the dual requirements of s 5. In determining purpose the court must obviously have regard to both the immediate and the general legislative context. Of relevance too may be the social, commercial or other objective of the enactment. 7 36. The Supreme Court’s approach is consistent with the earlier Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439. In this decision McKay J stated (at page 444), in the context of interpreting tax legislation, that the object of statutory interpretation is to “ascertain the true meaning”. This “true meaning”: ... must be consonant with the words used, having regard to their context in the Act as a whole, and to the purpose of the legislation to the extent that this is discernible. The approach adopted by the court in Fonterra was to consider the text first before examining the relevant purpose. 37. As noted, the term “building” is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. In approaching the meaning of the text, the ordinary meaning of the term can be considered before going on to consider the meaning of the term as it is used in the context of the depreciation provisions. Meaning of “building” 38. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11 th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006) defines “building” as: 1 a structure with a roof and walls. 2 the process or trade of building houses and other structures. 39. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary (6 th ed, Oxford University Press, 2007) defines “building” as: 1 A thing which is built, a structure, an edifice, a permanent, fixed thing built for occupation, as a house, school, factory, stable, church, etc. 2 The action of BUILD verb 40. These definitions indicate that a building is a permanent fixed structure providing shelter, such as a house, school, factory, or stable. This interpretation of “building” has been referred to in case law as the conventional meaning of “building”: R v Marks ex Australian Building Construction Employees’ and Builders Labourers’ Federation (1981) 147 CLR 471. However, the dictionary definitions also support a wider interpretation of “building”; that is, a building could simply be a permanent fixed structure or thing that is built. Conventional meaning of “building” 41. Several factors have been regarded as being characteristic of a building within the conventional meaning of the term. 42. Stevens v Gourley (1859) 7 CBNS 99 indicates that a building within the conventional meaning is a structure of considerable size that is permanent (in the sense of durability). Byles J (at p 112) summarised that the term “building” “is usually understood \[to be\] a structure of considerable size, and intended to be permanent, or at least to endure for a considerable time”. Because of changes over time in the types of materials that are used to construct buildings, it is not possible to be definitive about the design or the type of materials that are characteristic of a building; a building will be constructed using the building materials of the day: Clarke 8 v Wilkie (1977) 17 SASR 134. However, given the requirement of permanence, a building would usually be constructed of durable materials intended to last for a significant period. 43. A building is also permanent in the sense that it is generally designed to be located permanently on the site where it stands. However, Stevens v Gourley indicates that a structure need not be attached to the ground on which it stands in order to be a building. In Stevens v Gourley a shop that was fixed to the ground by its own weight and was not easily removed to another site was considered to be a building. A structure that can easily be moved from place to place will not be a building within the conventional meaning. In Melfort Danceland v Star City (Rural Municipality) \[1977\] 3 WWR 737 the court noted that courts had consistently held that a moveable home is not a building. 44. A building in the conventional sense is enclosed by walls and a roof that is designed to provide shelter: Moir v Williams \[1892\] 1 QB 264; Hilderbrandt v Stephen \[1964\] NSWR 740; Australian Building Construction Employees’ & Builders Labourers’ Federation v Dillingham Australia Ltd (1982) 58 FLR 170. In Moir v Williams Lord Esher MR commented (at p 270) “what is ordinarily called a building ... is an enclosure of brick or stonework covered in by a roof”. In Hilderbrandt v Stephen Jacobs J discussed the meaning of “building” and stated (at p 742) with reference to Moir v Williams “in its ordinary meaning, it at least involves the concept of a structure with a roof and a support for that roof”. 45. A further characteristic of a building is that it can function independently of any other structure. In Barat v Minister of National Revenue \[1991\] 2, CTC 2,360 the court held that a parking garage was a building given the size and permanence of it and the fact it was self-contained and functioned independently of any other structure. However, a building need not be a physically separate structure: Spencer v Soljan (1984) 10 NZTPA 289. 46. In Spencer v Soljan McMullin J commented (at p 292) that: \[s\]ome semi-detached structures such as terraced houses comprising individual dwellings may each be buildings for the purpose of \[section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1977\] despite their contiguity with and physical attachment to one another. 47. Also, a structure need not legally be part of the land on which it stands in order to be a building: R v Swansea City Council ex p Elitestone Ltd (1993) 66 P & CR 422. Reasonable person test 48. In deciding whether a structure is a building within the conventional meaning it is appropriate to ask whether a reasonable person would regard the structure as a building based on its appearance. In Re St Peter the Great, Chichester \[1961\] 1 WLR 907, Buckle J accepted (at p 912) that there were three tests to determine what constituted a building. (1) Would the ordinary man think this was a building? (2) Has the relevant structure four walls and a roof? (3) Can one say that the structure is built? 9 49. Applying these tests, Buckle J concluded that an electricity substation was not a building under legislation that prohibited the erection of any buildings on any disused burial ground except for the purpose of enlarging a place of worship. The substation consisted of a low voltage feeder pillar that was a rectangular metal cupboard with doors just over 4 feet high housing cables and fuses, a transformer just over 6 feet high, and high voltage switchgear comprising eight switches in metal boxes. Buckle J found that the substation met none of the above three tests. 50. In Harris v De Pinna (1886) LR 33 Ch D 238 a “reasonable person” test was also applied. In Harris the issue was whether a structure used for storing and seasoning timber was a building. The structure consisted of upright baulks of timber fixed on stone bases built on brick piers, with cross-beams and diagonal iron braces, divided into floors or stagings with open unglazed ends between the uprights. Chitty J said (at p 249): The proposition I am about to put again is not a decisive one, but I will put it. Would an ordinary man, with a reasonable knowledge of the English language, passing this structure speak of it as a building? I agree that, it is only putting it in a somewhat different form. The question in substance is one of fact and viewing it as a whole and having regard particularly to the model, and by no means disregarding the photographs which I have seen, I have come to the conclusion that this is a structure, but not a building within sect. 3 of the Prescription Act. 51. In Metals & Alloys Co v Ontario Regional Assessment Commissioner (1985) 36 RPR 163 a similar approach to Harris was taken. The court commented (at para 50): “Building”, however, is an ordinary English word, and in this statute should be given the meaning an ordinary person would attribute to it. What we have in this case looks like a building. It is almost identical to its neighbouring structure, which is admittedly a building. It is built like a building. It is used like a building. ... The only reasonable conclusion, in my view, is that it is a building. 52. Therefore, in determining whether a structure is a building, it is appropriate to consider the appearance and function of the structure and to ask whether a reasonable person would regard the structure as a building. This approach is more appropriate than relying on the simple test stated in early cases where it was considered that a structure must have walls and a roof in order to be a building. For example, if the approach in the early cases were applied, the parking building in Barat v Minister of National Revenue might not be regarded as a building (because the top floor did not have a roof and the building had only half-walls). However, a parking building would be a building within the ordinary or conventional understanding of that term. Alternative meanings of “building” 53. The ordinary or conventional meaning of the term “building” includes buildings with the above mentioned characteristics and would be considered buildings by a reasonable person. In some contexts the term “building” could have an alternative meaning. For example, possible alternative meanings could be:  a wider meaning that includes structures that are ‘built’; or  a narrower meaning that excludes certain types of specialised buildings. 10 Wider meaning of “building” 54. Buildings and structures are things of substantial size and have a degree of permanence, but not all structures are necessarily buildings: Cardiff Ruling Authority v Guest Keen Baldwins Iron & Steel Co Ltd \[1969\] 1 All ER 27. However, structures (which would not be buildings under the conventional meaning) such as fences, grain silos, tunnels, driveways, tanks, and bleachers have been held to be buildings in some contexts. A New Zealand case where a wider meaning of “building” was adopted was Chief Executive of the New Zealand Customs Service v Rakaia Engineering & Contracting Ltd \[2002\] 3 NZLR 24. In this case the Court of Appeal considered that grain storage bins were buildings under the customs tariff. 55. Other cases in which the wider interpretation of “building” has been adopted include Buckleigh v Brown \[1968\] NZLR 647 (a fence), Wood v Cooper \[1894\] 1 Ch 376 (a trellis screen), Schweder v Worthing \[1912\] 1 Ch 83 (a tunnel), Clarke v Wilkie (1977) 17 SASR 134 (a concrete driveway), and Imperial Oil Ltd v Sherwood (Rural Municipality) \[1922\] 2 WWR 1,156 (tanks and bleachers). The structures that were held to be buildings in these cases have some but not all of the characteristics of buildings within the conventional meaning outlined above. Narrower meaning of “building” 56. In some situations the term “building” may be intended to exclude buildings that are specialised in the sense of the setting they provide or their function or integration with plant or equipment. That is, the ordinary or conventional meaning of “building” is modified to exclude such buildings. This may arise where interpretatively there is an alternative to defining the item as a “building”, such as defining the item as “plant”. 57. Case law indicates that a building will be considered plant where the building is more than the setting in which business activities take place and plays an essential role in the business process. The building must perform an essential function in the business process before it takes on the characteristics of plant: Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v FC of T (1968) 41 ALJR 377; Wangaratta Woollen Mills Ltd v FC of T 69 ATC 4,095. 58. In addition to this, cases decided under the pre-1993 depreciation provisions such as Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC; Case G11 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,035; and Lake Pine MDF Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 16 may also indicate that certain buildings should be treated as plant. However, as mentioned earlier, these cases were considered under a different depreciation regime where the Courts were deciding between whether an item was “premises” or “plant”. Therefore, the question before the Court was not whether the item was a building or not. Importance of context 59. The appropr iate interpretation of “building” depends on the context in which the word is used. In Spencer v Soljan, McMullin J, who delivered the decision of the Court of Appeal, commented (at pp 291 –292), “\[w\]hat is a building for the purposes of one statute may not be a building for the purposes of another”. Similar statements were made in Foster v Fraser \[1893\] 3 Ch 158, Paddington Corporation v AG \[1906\] AC 1, Cobb & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1959) 101 CLR 333, and Hilderbrandt v Stephen; Dew Engineering & Development Ltd v R \[1996\] 3 CTC 2,904. 11 60. A wider meaning of “building” has often been adopted in cases involving legislation or restrictive covenants the object of which is to protect the rights of owners of adjacent properties, but this is subject to the wording of the legislation or particular contract in question. Arguably, it might be suggested that a narrower concept of “building” has been adopted in cases involving legislation that required determining whether an item was part of the premises or something else such as plant. Hence, in determining whether either a wider or narrower meaning of “building” should be adopted in a particular context, it is necessary to consider the purpose of the legislation or contract in question. Purpose of the depreciation provisions 61. The depreciation provisions provide that buildings are treated differently from other items of depreciable property. To determine what meaning the term “building” is intended to have it is necessary to look at the legislative context. This involves considering the purpose of the depreciation provisions including their development and their connection with the provisions dealing with temporary buildings. In particular, it is appropriate to consider the purpose behind treating buildings differently from other items of depreciable property. 62. The rationale for allowing a deduction for depreciation is that capital assets used in the production of income decrease in value over time and, in line with accounting practice, for tax purposes the cost of such capital assets is set off against income over the life of the assets: Clifford v IR Commrs (1966) 10 AITR 229; Para Handkerchief and Textiles (1964) Ltd v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,125; Paterson v CIR (2005) NZTC 19,096; ‘New legislation - Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006’, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006). The appropriate tax depreciation rate for a capital asset (which is relevant to the calculation of the amount of deduction in respect of depreciation in each year) depends on how long the useful life of the asset is. Therefore, economic depreciation rates are set based on the EUL of items of depreciable property. The Commissioner determines EULs for items of depreciable property through the depreciation rate determinations the Commissioner issues. In this way, buildings that are expected to have a shorter useful life than buildings generally may be provided with a depreciation rate based on a shorter estimated useful life. 63. While at no stage was the term “building” defined for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, there were indications that a building within the ordinary or conventional meaning was the preferred interpretation. These indications are:  preserving the prohibition on not allowing losses on the sale or disposal of a building;  the list of buildings that the 25% interim loading did not apply to;  the policy rationale for the changes to the depreciation method for setting depreciation rates for buildings; and  the deduction available under section DB 20 for temporary buildings. 12 64. First, the officials' report on the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 (2 May 2005) discussed submissions on the bill arguing that losses on disposal of buildings should be deductible. The report acknowledged that there was a case to consider for allowing a general deduction for losses from the sale or disposal of buildings. However, the following two important points were stated in the officials' report, and the submissions were declined.  Although buildings may usually be expected to depreciate over time, rates of depreciation are typically low. The market value of buildings is subject to fluctuations and, as a consequence, the value of buildings can be variable. If gains are not taxed when buildings appreciate, there is an argument for not allowing deductions for losses on sale, in order to prevent over-investment in buildings. Although similar issues can arise for other assets, this is likely to be a particularly important problem for buildings because of their low depreciation rates and the volatility of estimates of the value of buildings.  There is also a concern that the value of land improvements (including buildings) is normally calculated as the difference between the overall value of a property and the unimproved value of the land. There are tax integrity issues when values are apportioned (between the land and improvements) for tax reasons, rather than their actual value. This issue has the potential to create a significant tax avoidance problem and is exacerbated by the fact that buildings move in and out of the tax base. 65. Secondly, when the interim 25% loading was introduced in 1992 it did not apply to buildings. Most of the types of items that did not qualify for the 25% loading, as set out in the schedule of pre-1993 depreciation rates published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 9 (April 1993), were buildings within the conventional meaning of that term or were items that formed part of a building within the conventional meaning. The later enacted 20% loading also did not apply to buildings and there was nothing brought into the legislation to clarify that another meaning applied. 66. Thirdly, the officials’ issues paper Repairs and maintenance to the tax depreciation rates (Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue Department, Wellington, 2004), which led to the depreciation changes enacted in 2006, states that:  the starting point for review of the depreciation rates was that depreciation rates should reflect the actual fall in the market value of assets in order to ensure that, as far as possible, investment decisions are not influenced by tax considerations (at paras 1.12 – 1.14);  for depreciating assets, the depreciation loading increases the present value of depreciation deductions, which reduces the cost of investment and the cost of capital which in turn increases investment (at para 4.11);  minor levels of inflation can produce a bias favouring longer-lived relative to shorter-lived assets (at para 5.1);  the existing depreciation provisions provide a tax bias in favour of longer-lived assets (at para 4.25); that is, depreciation rates for shorter-lived assets are low in comparison to the rate applicable to longer-lived assets. 67. The policy rationale for distinguishing buildings from other items of depreciable property in these rate-setting provisions is that some evidence 13 suggests that the rate of economic depreciation for buildings differs to the rate for equipment. The United States distinguishes in its statistics on economic depreciation between equipment and structures (which includes buildings). There is some evidence that for a given useful life, the diminishing value depreciation rate for a building will be less than the rate for an item of equipment with the same estimate of useful life (chapter 4 of the above mentioned officials’ issues paper). 68. Another reason for treating buildings differently is that with even moderate rates of inflation, calculating depreciation deductions using historical costs creates a bias between short-lived and long-lived assets. Allowing depreciation loading on shorter lived assets and not on longer lived assets such as buildings was the preferred solution to address this bias. While other classes of asset may also be long-lived and may receive the loading, buildings represent a significant proportion of such assets (chapter 3 of the above-mentioned officials’ issues paper). 69. However, the above-mentioned officials’ issues paper recognised (at para 5.23) that a “structure” may not be a building and that it may have an economic life more equivalent to plant and equipment. The item on the amendments in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) says: “Building” is not a defined term in the Income Tax Act 2004. Guidance on whether a structure is considered a building is given in Inland Revenue’s depreciation guides. The Commissioner is undertaking a project to more clearly define a building. \[Emphasis added.\] 70. As mentioned, whether the term “building” is considered to mean a building within the conventional meaning of the term or to have some other meaning is dependent on the context in which the term is used. The extrinsic material that has surrounded the depreciation provisions in 1988- 1993 and in 2006 shows that buildings within the depreciation provisions are considered to be ones that are generally long-lived and have a characteristic of permanence. Thus, the Commissioner’s view is that the interpretation to be given to “building” in the depreciation provisions is one that aligns with the ordinary or conventional meaning of “building” as set out in case law outlined above. 71. Lastly, the existence of a statutory definition for temporary buildings and the deduction available on disposal under section DB 20 for temporary buildings tends to also support an ordinary or conventional meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions. This follows from the fact that it is only this limited class of building (ones defined as being temporary in nature) that attract a deduction for a loss on disposal. The wider class – all ordinary or conventional buildings – are generally denied any loss under sections EE 39 and EE 48(3). It can be argued that section DB 20 (and its predecessors) would serve no purpose if a narrower interpretation of “building” was adopted. In particular, one category of temporary building are buildings that have been erected, and used, to house specific plant or machinery, and will have to be demolished to remove or replace the plant or machinery. This suggests that these types of building would otherwise fall within the wider class but are permitted special treatment under section DB 20. There would be no reason for section DB 20 if these items (and the other categories of temporary buildings) would in any case be entitled to a loss on disposal under the ordinary loss on disposal rules. This indicates that the three types of buildings covered by the temporary building definition are subject to the treatment that other buildings are 14 given under the depreciation provisions. However, if a temporary building is destroyed, there may be an opportunity to claim a loss on the destruction of the building under section DB 20, which otherwise would not be available. Relevance of section EE 30 and section EZ 23 72. In the current depreciation regime there are two provisions that refer to plant: section EE 30 and section EZ 23. This raises the question as to whether these two sections are relevant to the interpretation of the meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions. As seen above, section EE 30 relates to the setting of depreciation rates for items that have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost that are either plant or equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 or buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. Section EZ 23 relates to the setting of depreciation rates for any items that are either plant or equipment acquired before 1 April 2005 or buildings acquired before 19 May 2005 (unless these items are “excluded depreciable property”). However, a building that may also be considered plant will have a rate set according to it being a building rather than plant. This is because section EE 26 sets out the appropriate rate setting provisions and directs how a rate will be set for a building, regardless of whether it might also be described as plant. 73. Section EE 26 sets out how section EE 30 fits with the other rate setting provisions. For determining the applicable rate setting provision, section EE 26(1)(d) provides that section EE 30 applies for items that have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost where section EE 27 or section EE 28 would otherwise have applied. Section EE 27 applies to items (excluding buildings) acquired on or after 1 April 2005. Section EE 28 applies to buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. Therefore, section EE 30 does not apply to buildings that have an estimated residual market greater than 13.5% of cost acquired before 19 May 2005. Instead, section EE 26(1)(e) provides that such buildings have a rate set under section EZ 23. In this way it is not necessary to determine whether an item is a building or plant. The only question is whether an item is a building, or not a building. Section EE 26 then directs which provisions will apply. Conclusion 74. For the purposes of the depreciation provisions the Commissioner’s view is that the term “building” has an ordinary or conventional meaning. Further, it is the Commissioner’s view that the ordinary or conventional meaning of “building” is not modified for the purposes of the depreciation provisions either in terms of being broader to include many built structures, nor to exclude buildings that provide a specialised setting or have a specialised function or purpose or are integrated with plant. In the case of the latter group, for some such buildings (those that are “temporary buildings”) section DB 20 provides concessionary treatment by allowing deductions for losses incurred on the destruction of the building. This concessionary treatment would also be available for some buildings that have shorter economic useful lives than buildings in general or are situated at construction sites. 15 Examples 75. The following is an analysis of examples of items of depreciable property that are listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. These items are considered in relation to the characteristics common to buildings identified in this Interpretation Statement. 76. The items listed in Table 1 are considered to be buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions and have been treated as buildings in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. Table 1: Items considered to be buildings Buildings and Structures asset category: Buildings (not specified) Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels Buildings with reinforced concrete framing Buildings with steel or steel and timber framing Buildings with timber framing Fowl houses Grandstands Hot houses Pig houses Shade houses Tanneries Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture industry category: Dairy sheds and yard 77. The items listed in Table 2 are analysed in more detail below in terms of the characteristics common to buildings identified in this Interpretation Statement, in order to clarify whether they should be considered buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. Table 2: Items reviewed to determine whether they are buildings Asset class Industry or asset category Is the loading currently applied in IR265?\* Does the analysis conclude that the items in the asset class are typically buildings? Should the loading be applied to the typical item? Carparks (buildings and pads)\*\* Buildings and Structures asset category Yes Yes \*\* (carpark buildings) No\*\* Powder dryer buildings Dairy Plant industry category Yes Yes No Chemical works Buildings and Structures asset category Yes Yes No Fertiliser works Buildings and Structures asset category Yes Yes No Barns Buildings and Structures asset category Yes Yes No Barns (drying) Cigarette Manufacturing industry category Yes Yes No Buildings (portable)\*\*\* Buildings and Structures asset category No Yes\*\*\* No\*\*\* Site huts\*\*\* Contractors, Builders and Quarrying Yes Yes\*\*\* No\*\*\* \* Inland Revenue’s General Depreciation Rates (IR 265) 16 \*\* The existing asset class for “carparks (buildings and pads)” will be split into two asset classes: one for carpark buildings and one for carpark pads that are separate from the carpark building as carpark pads are not considered buildings. \*\*\* The existing asset classes for “buildings (portable)” and “site huts” are to be reviewed to establish whether new asset classes should be created for those items that are not buildings. 78. Some of the asset classes in Table 2 are very broad and include several different items. In these cases, the typical items of depreciable property within the particular asset class are considered. Other asset classes are more specific, and the specific item that the asset class represents is considered. It is acknowledged that the items within a particular asset class vary. Therefore, whether an item of depreciable property is a building will depend on whether the building characteristics apply to the individual item being considered. However, the typical items within each asset class listed in Table 2 are generally considered buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions (except for separate carpark pads and certain portable buildings and site huts). It is noted that section 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides taxpayers with the opportunity to apply for a provisional rate if there is no applicable economic rate that applies for their item of depreciable property. 79. Asset classes for other structures such as silos and bunkers and items that are land improvements under schedule 13 such as bridges and tunnels are not considered to be buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. However, there may be buildings associated with some of the land improvements listed in schedule 13. In these cases those buildings would be treated separately as a building for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. 80. Also, structures such as marquees that can be dismantled, relocated and rebuilt easily are not considered buildings because they do not have the characteristics of an ordinary or conventional building because of their lack of permanence. This concept of lack of permanence is discussed below under the discussion of the asset class “buildings (portable)”. Carparks (building and pads) Description of item 81. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006) contains the following definition of “car park”: n. Brit. an area or building where cars or other vehicles may be left temporarily 82. This definition indicates that the ordinary meaning of a carpark is an area reserved for parking a vehicle and that area may be situated within a building. 83. The “carparks (buildings and pads)” asset class in the Buildings and Structures asset category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates includes carparking structures for vehicle parking purposes, which may be multi-level structures. These carparking structures are often referred to as “carpark buildings” or “carparking buildings”. Each level contains allotted vehicle parking spaces and is accessed by a ramp. 17 84. Typically, carparking buildings are built on solid foundations and made from reinforced concrete. Each level consists of columns and beams that provide structural support. Carparking buildings are generally not fully enclosed, with lowered walls or barriers around each side of each level and often no roof over the top level. 85. A carparking pad that is a flattened area of hard surface (for example, a concrete, sealed, or paved surface with markings for vehicle parks) on which vehicles can park, and that is not part of a carparking building described above, is likely to be a hardstanding for tax depreciation purposes. Hardstandings are depreciable land improvements as they are listed in schedule 13. Application of “building” characteristics 86. Despite carparking buildings not often being fully enclosed by walls and a roof, the application of the other characteristics of a building (identified in the statement) to carparking buildings suggests that carparking buildings are buildings within the ordinary or conventional meaning of the term. Appearance and function test 87. Carparking buildings have the general appearance of conventional buildings despite not being fully enclosed. Also, the function of carparking buildings is to provide parking spaces for vehicles in a multi-level layout that provides shelter for the vehicles (for example from traffic and weather). Therefore, it is considered a reasonable person would regard a carparking building as a building. 88. It is considered that a carparking pad that is not part of a carparking building does not have the appearance of a conventional building. Case law 89. In the Canadian case Barat v Minister of National Revenue \[1991\] 2 CTC 2,360, Hamlyn TCJ had to decide whether a parking garage was a building for the purposes of a provision disallowing a deduction from the taxpayer’s income of the construction, renovation, or alteration costs relating to buildings. Although Barat v Minister of National Revenue refers to a parking garage, the item being considered is the same type of structure as the carparking structures described above. Hamlyn TCJ concluded that the parking garage was a building given the size and permanence of it and the fact it was self-contained and functioned independently of any other structure. Conclusion 90. The application of the characteristics of a building, and the appearance and function test support the conclusion that a carparking building is a building. A review of the case law also supports the conclusion that these structures are buildings. Therefore, it can be said within the “carparks (buildings and structures)” asset class, a carparking building is a building for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, which means the methods for setting economic depreciation rates for buildings apply to carparking buildings, and the 20% loading in section EE 31 does not apply to the economic rate for carparking buildings. 18 91. A carpark pad that is a flattened area of hard surface on which vehicles can park and is not part of a carparking building, is not a building, and instead is likely to be a hardstanding, which is listed in schedule 13 as a depreciable land improvement. Therefore, the 20% loading in section EE 31 applies to the economic rate for carpark pads as described above within the “carpark (buildings and pads)” asset class. 92. These conclusions mean that the existing asset class for “carparks (buildings and pads)” in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates should be split into two different asset classes: “carpark buildings” and “carpark pads”. A new depreciation determination is required to bring these changes into effect. Powder dryer buildings Description of item 93. The “powder dryer buildings” asset class is listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates within the “Dairy Plant” industry category. A powder dryer building is a structure that houses a milk powder dryer along with other drying equipment that is used for producing powdered dairy products such as milk and whey powder. 94. Powder dryer buildings are structures of significant size to contain the large drying equipment required for producing milk powder. Powder dryer buildings are generally constructed with concrete wall panels and steel plate roofs and often have specialised air temperature control systems incorporated into the building structure. 95. The Dairy Plant industry category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates contains asset classes for the other items of plant and equipment used in the process of producing milk powder. This includes dryers, evaporators, and packing machines. Application of “building” characteristics 96. The application of the characteristics of a building (identified in the statement) to powder dryer buildings, suggests that powder dryer buildings are buildings within the ordinary or conventional meaning of the term. Appearance and function test 97. Powder dryer buildings have the general appearance of conventional buildings. Also, the function of a powder dryer building is to house the dryer that is used for producing powder and provide an environment which enables the dryer to operate. Therefore, it is considered that a reasonable person would regard powder dryer buildings as buildings. Conclusion 98. The application of the characteristics of a building and the appearance and function test support the conclusion that a powder dryer building is a building. Therefore, the methods for setting economic depreciation rates for buildings apply, and the 20% loading in section EE 31 does not apply to the economic rate. 19 Chemical works Description of item 99. In the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006) the following definition is provided for “works” within the definition of “work”: 5 (works) \[treated as sing.\] chiefly Brit. a place where industrial or manufacturing processes are carried out. 100. This definition indicates that the ordinary meaning of chemical works is a place where chemicals are processed. 101. The “chemical works” asset class is listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates in the Buildings and Structures asset category. However, the Chemical Plant industry category lists the asset classes that relate to the plant and equipment used to process chemicals. Therefore, it is considered that the “chemical works” asset class does not relate to the chemical-processing plant and equipment, and instead relates only to the structures that house the plant and equipment. 102. Items of property classed as “chemical works” are typically large and house some part of the chemical processing plant or equipment. These structures are constructed out of long-lasting materials, such as wood, concrete, or corrugated iron, and have walls and a roof. Application of “building” characteristics 103. The application of the characteristics of a building (identified in the statement) to chemical works suggests that chemical works are buildings within the conventional meaning of the term. Appearance and function test 104. Chemical works have the general appearance of conventional buildings. Also, the purpose of a chemical works is to house the plant and machinery involved in chemical processing. Therefore, it is considered a reasonable person would regard chemical works as buildings. Conclusion 105. The “chemical works” asset class does not apply to plant and equipment used for chemical processing. The “chemical works” asset class applies to structures that house chemical-processing plant and equipment. These structures are typically large, have walls and a roof, and have the general appearance of a building. 106. The application of the characteristics of a building and the appearance and function test support the conclusion that chemical works are buildings. Therefore, it can be said that chemical works are buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, which means the methods for setting economic depreciation rates for buildings apply, and the 20% loading in section EE 31 does not apply to the economic rate for chemical works as described above within the “chemical works” asset class. 20 107. Due to the similarity in appearance, construction, and function, the same conclusion applies to the “fertiliser works” and “tanneries” asset classes, which are listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates in the Buildings and Structures asset category. These asset classes relate to the structures that house processing plant and equipment. The asset classes for plant and equipment that may be housed in a fertiliser works are contained within the Chemical Plant industry category. The asset classes for plant and equipment that may be housed in a tannery structure are contained in the Tanning and Fellmongering industry category. Barns Description of item 108. The “barns” asset class is listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates in the Buildings and Structures asset category. 109. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006) contains the following definition of “barn”: n. 1 A large farm building used for storage or for housing livestock. 2 N. Amer. A large shed for storing road or railway vehicles. 110. Barns are typically large structures. They provide dry shelter on farms for things such as livestock, grain, hay, farm vehicles, and equipment. They are constructed out of long-lasting materials, such as wood, corrugated iron, steel, or concrete and have walls and a roof. Application of “building” characteristics 111. The application of the characteristics of a building (identified in the statement) to barns suggests that barns are buildings within the ordinary or conventional meaning of the term. Appearance and function test 112. Barns have the general appearance of conventional buildings. Also, the function of a barn is typically to store and protect from the elements livestock, grain, and so on. Therefore, it is considered that a reasonable person would regard a barn as being a building. Conclusion 113. The application of the characteristics of a building, and the appearance and function test support the conclusion that barns are buildings. Therefore, it can be said that barns are buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, which means the methods for setting economic depreciation rates for buildings apply, and the 20% loading in section EE 31 does not apply to the economic rate. 114. Due to the similarity in appearance, construction, and function, the same conclusion applies to the “barns (drying)” asset class listed in the Cigarette Manufacturing industry category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. 21 Buildings (portable) Description of item 115. The “buildings (portable)” asset class is listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates in the Buildings and Structures asset category. The kind of property that the “buildings (portable)” asset class relates to are structures that provide shelter and that are designed and built to be moveable rather than located in one place. Therefore, such structures are not attached to the ground by permanent foundations and are generally smaller than buildings designed to be located in one location. The extent of mobility varies amongst portable buildings and depends largely on the size of the particular structure. Application of “building” characteristics 116. Many portable buildings would be of a size comparable to many small permanent buildings. Therefore, the conventional building characteristic of significant size is seen to be met in many cases for portable buildings. In Stevens v Gourley (1859) 7 CBNS 99 the shop, which was of “considerable dimensions” but not attached to the earth, was found to be a building. 117. The characteristics dealing with permanence may or may not be met depending on the portability of a particular portable building. Permanence in the sense that a building is designed to be located permanently on the site where it stands is related to its size. For example, the shop in Stevens v Gourley was not attached to the ground but was large enough to be considered a building. Therefore, if a portable building cannot be easily moved because of its size and weight (that is, movable only by machinery such as a crane) then the conventional building characteristic of permanence of location is met. Many portable buildings would fit into this category. This is in contrast to the types of things Byles J in Stevens v Gourley listed (at page 113) that would not be considered a building because of their portability. These were a bird cage, a wig box, a dog kennel, and a hen coop. Therefore, unlike the shop in Stevens v Gourley, which was fixed to the ground by its own weight, a structure that is easily moved from place to place will not be a building within the ordinary or conventional meaning of that term. 118. In Melfort Danceland a mobile home was found not to be a building. The mobile home in this case appears to be one that was on wheels. Therefore, a structure that is permanently attached to wheels and is of a size comparable to a caravan or mobile home would lack the characteristic of permanence of location because it is easily moved. 119. Permanence in the sense that a building is intended to last a considerable time was a factor considered alongside the permanence of location factor (i.e. the degree of portability) in Stevens v Gourley. Byles J in Stevens v Gourley considered that a building is of considerable size, and intended to be permanent or at least to endure for a considerable time. Byles J then lists items that are considered to be buildings, and those that are not because of their ease of portability (eg, a bird cage, a wig box, etc), which indicates that the more portable (or lightweight) an item the less durable it is. 120. The other two characteristics of conventional buildings, being having walls and a roof, and being able to function independently of any other 22 structure, are likely to be met for most portable buildings. Many portable buildings are separate and individual structures that have the appearance of a small building (i.e. have walls, a roof and a door) and so function to provide shelter. 121. The application of the characteristics of a building (identified in the statement) to portable buildings, suggests that those portable buildings that are sufficiently permanent and of a sufficient size and appearance are buildings within the ordinary or conventional meaning of the term. 122. In Dew Engineering & Development Ltd v R \[1996\] 3 CTC 2,904 “modules” connected to one another by bolts to form a laboratory designed to be portable were held not to be a building for the purposes of an exclusion to allowable tax deductions for research and development expenditure. The laboratory was made up of five modules (each of which was made of steel and contained a floor, roof and walls and were described as being almost identical to the components of walkways at Ottawa International Airport) and could be easily and quickly dismantled and relocated. Amongst the reasons for not treating the laboratory as a building was that it lacked permanence in that it was not fixed to the ground, it was easily disassembled and reconstructed, and it was not intended to remain in a particular location. Also, its energy needs were met by connection to the facilities of the structure to which it was appended. (Although these reasons appear to contradict the above points in relation to determining whether a portable building is a conventional building, the context of promoting research and development seem to have influenced the decision that the laboratory was not a building for the purposes of the particular provision. Therefore, it is considered that the case must be viewed with some caution in terms of its applicability in the depreciation context.) 123. To ascertain whether a portable building is sufficiently permanent and of a sufficient size and appearance to come within the meaning of “building” for the purposes of the depreciation provisions the following should be considered:  whether it is of a size comparable to many permanent buildings (i.e. requires heavy duty lifting such as a crane to move it);  the durability of the materials it is made from (i.e. not too lightweight);  whether it looks like a building (i.e. has walls and a door and possibly windows, but does not look like a container or some other item or structure);  whether it is fixed to the ground (i.e. not easily moved, at least fixed by its own weight, intended to remain in a particular location, and does not have wheels);  whether it is designed to be dismantled, relocated and rebuilt easily (i.e. individual components that are required to be integrated to make the whole structure and are easily moved may not form a building). Appearance and function test 23 124. Some portable buildings may not actually fall within the ordinary or conventional meaning of “building” because no reasonable person would consider them to be buildings in the conventional sense. For example, some containers may be used to provide shelter for people or goods, but would not be described as buildings. Therefore, such items are not considered buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. 125. However, containers that have been converted into portable buildings may fall within the conventional meaning of “building” depending on the extent of conversion and their size. For example, something that looks like it could have been derived from a large container but has windows and a door would more likely have the appearance of a conventional building. 126. Also, some portable structures that provide shelter would not be considered conventional buildings by a reasonable person because they are too small and easily moved. For example, most dog houses and many garden sheds would be too small to be considered conventional buildings. Conclusion 127. The “buildings (portable)” asset class relates to structures that are designed and built to be moveable rather than located in one place. Such items will not be fixed permanently in one location. 128. The application of the characteristics of a building, and the appearance and function test support the conclusion that those portable structures that come within the “buildings (portable)” asset class that are sufficiently permanent and of a sufficient size and appearance will be buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. Therefore, the methods for setting depreciation rates for buildings apply to those items, and the 20% loading in section EE 31 does not apply to the depreciation rate. 129. Those portable structures that may come within the “buildings (portable)” asset class but are too small or otherwise do not have the appearance of a conventional building are not considered buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. This conclusion means that the existing asset class for “buildings (portable)” in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates needs to be reviewed to clarify the distinction between these various portable buildings. This may involve creating other asset classes for portable structures that are not considered to be conventional buildings. New depreciation determinations will be required to bring these changes into effect. Site huts Description of item 130. The “site huts” asset class is listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates in the Contractors, Builders and Quarrying industry category. The kinds of items that the “site huts” asset class relates to are structures that provide shelter for site workers. Therefore, such structures are designed and built to be moveable from site to site. As such, the “site huts” asset class contains structures that are similar, and in some cases the same as, those structures within the “buildings (portable)” asset class. Such structures are not attached to the ground by permanent foundations and are generally smaller than buildings designed to be located in one location. The extent of mobility varies amongst site huts but in most 24 cases site huts will be of a size that cannot be easily moved without machinery such as a crane. Application of “building” characteristics 131. As with many portable buildings, many site huts would be of a size comparable to small permanent buildings. Therefore, the conventional building characteristic of significant size is seen to be met in those cases. 132. Most site huts cannot be easily moved because of their size and weight (that is, movable only by machinery such as a crane). The material used in the construction of a site hut, like other portable buildings, would normally be lightweight for ease of transport but normally sufficiently durable for use over multiple relocations. Therefore, the conventional building characteristics of permanence of location and permanence in the sense of intending to last a considerable time are met. 133. The other two characteristics of conventional buildings having – walls and a roof, and being able to function independently of any other structure – are also likely to be met for most site huts. Most site huts are separate and individual structures that have the appearance of a small building (i.e. walls and a roof with at least a door) and so function to provide shelter. 134. The application of the characteristics of a building (identified in the statement) to site huts, suggests that those site huts that are sufficiently permanent and of a sufficient size and appearance will be buildings within the ordinary or conventional meaning of the term. 135. To ascertain whether a site hut is sufficiently permanent and of a sufficient size and appearance to come within the meaning of “building” for the purposes of the depreciation provisions the same indications as identified above for portable buildings should be considered. Appearance and function test 136. As with some portable buildings, there may be some site huts that do not fall within the conventional meaning of “building” because no reasonable person would consider them to be buildings in that sense. The same example used above for portable buildings, being containers that provide shelter, is also relevant here. 137. Most site huts would not be considered too small to be conventional buildings by a reasonable person. Conclusion 138. The “site huts” asset class relates to structures that are designed and built to be relocated to various sites and so have not been fixed permanently in one location. 139. The application of the characteristics of a building, and the appearance and function test support the conclusion that most site huts are sufficiently permanent and of a sufficient size and appearance to be buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. Therefore, the methods for setting depreciation rates for buildings apply to most site huts, and the 20% loading in section EE 31 does not apply to the depreciation rate. A site hut that is considered a building will come within the definition of 25 “temporary building” if it was erected at a construction site and will have to be demolished or removed on or before completion of the construction. In such a case section DB 20 allows a deduction for losses incurred through its destruction. 140. Those site huts that may come within the “site huts” asset class that are too small or otherwise do not have the appearance of a conventional building are not considered buildings for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. This conclusion means that the existing asset class for “site huts” in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates needs to be reviewed to clarify that this asset class applies to “site huts” that are considered buildings and to determine whether other asset classes should be created for site huts that are not buildings. New depreciation determinations will be required to bring these changes into effect. 26 Appendix – Legislation Depreciation provisions 141. Section EE 6 sets out the definition of depreciable property: EE 6 What is depreciable property? Description (1) Depreciable property is property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use— (a) in deriving assessable income; or (b) in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Subsections (2) to (4) expand on this subsection. Property: tangible (2) An item of tangible property is depreciable property if— (a) it is described by subsection (1); and (b) it is not described by section EE 7. Property: intangible (3) An item of intangible property is depreciable property if— (a) it is within the definition of depreciable intangible property; and (b) it is described by subsection (1); and (c) it is not described by section EE 7. Property: geothermal wells (4) For the purposes of this subpart, a person who owns a geothermal well is, for the geothermal energy proving period, treated as acquiring the well as property that declines in value and is to be available for use in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. 142. Section EE 7 sets out what is not depreciable property: EE 7 What is not depreciable property? The following property is not depreciable property: (a) land, although buildings, fixtures, and the improvements listed in schedule 13 (Depreciable land improvements) are depreciable property if they are described by section EE 6(1): (b) trading stock: (c) livestock to which subpart EB (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer's livestock)) applies: (d) financial arrangements: (e) excepted financial arrangements: 27 (f) property that will not decline in value, as far as its owner is concerned, because, when they dispose of it, they have a right to be compensated for any decline in its value: (g) property that its owner chooses, under section EE 8, to treat as not depreciable: (h) property that its owner chooses, under section EE 38, to deal with under that section: (i) property for whose cost a person other than the property's owner is allowed a deduction: (j) property for whose cost a person is allowed a deduction under a provision of this Act outside this subpart or under a provision of an earlier Act, except for an asset to which section DU 6(4) (Depreciation) applies. 143. Section EE 26 sets out the relevant provisions for setting economic depreciation rates: EE 26 Setting of economic depreciation rate Relevant provisions (1) The economic depreciation rate that applies to a kind of item of depreciable property is set under— (a) section EE 27, for items that— (i) are not buildings, fixed life intangible property, excluded depreciable property, or property for which an economic rate set under section EE 29 or EE 30; and (ii) are acquired on or after 1 April 2005: (b) section EE 28, for items that are buildings and— (i) are acquired on or after 19 May 2005; and (ii) do not have an economic depreciation rate set under section EZ 23 (Economic rate for plant or equipment acquired before 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired before 19 May 2005): (c) section EE 29, for certain aircraft and motor vehicles acquired on or after 1 April 2005: (d) section EE 30, for items that— (i) have an estimated residual market value greater than 13.5% of cost: (ii) would, in the absence of section EE 30, have an economic depreciation rate set under section EE 27 or EE 28: (e) section EZ 23 for items that— (i) are not buildings, fixed life intangible property, or excluded depreciable property and are acquired before 1 April 2005: (ii) are buildings acquired before 19 May 2005: (iii) are buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, as relationship property or from a company in the same wholly-owned group of companies, from a person who applied to the item an economic depreciation rate set under section EZ 23 or a corresponding provision. 28 No rate for fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property (2) An economic depreciation rate must not be set for a kind of item of depreciable property that is fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property. Overriding effect of election under section EE 32 (3) Subsection (1)(a), (c), and (d) are overridden by section EE 32. 144. Section EE 28 sets out the method for setting an economic depreciation rate generally for buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. EE 28 Economic rate for buildings What this section is about (1) This section is about setting the economic depreciation rate that applies to a kind of item of depreciable property that is a building and for which an economic rate is not set under section EE 30 or EZ 23 (Economic rate for plant or equipment acquired before 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired before 19 May 2005). Rate set by Commissioner (2) The Commissioner sets the rate from time to time by – (a) following the procedure set out in this section; and (b) issuing a determination under section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Procedure for setting economic rate (3) To set the straight-line rate for a kind of item of depreciable property, the Commissioner – (a) gets a figure by applying the formula in subsection (4) to items of that kind; and (b) rounds the figure up or down to the nearest rate specified in schedule 11, column 4 (New banded rates of depreciation); and (c) sets the same rate for some or all of the kinds of buildings that are similar to one another, if the Commissioner thinks it is appropriate to do so having regard to – (i) the rate calculated for each kind; and (ii) the reduction in compliance costs that is likely to be achieved. Formula (4) The formula is - 1 estimated useful life. Definition of item in formula (5) In the formula, estimated useful life is the estimated useful life of the item expressed in years. Contracts existing at 19 May 2005 (6) Despite subsection (1), a person who before 19 May 2005 enters into a binding contract for the purchase or construction of a building must apply 29 to the building the economic rate for the kind of the building determined under section EZ 23. 145. Section EE 30 sets out the method for setting an economic depreciation rate for items that have an estimated residual market value of more than 13.5% of cost: EE 30 Economic rate for plant, equipment, or building, with high residual value What this section is about (1) This section is about setting the economic depreciation rate that applies to items of a kind of depreciable property if— (a) the kind of depreciable property is not fixed life intangible property, or excluded depreciable property, for which an economic rate cannot be set; and (b) the estimated residual market value for the item is more than 13.5% of cost; and (c) the items are— (i) plant or equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005: (ii) buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. Rate set by Commissioner (2) The Commissioner sets the rate from time to time by— (a) following the procedure set out in this section; and (b) issuing a determination under section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Procedure for setting economic rate (3) To set the diminishing value rate for a kind of item of depreciable property, the Commissioner— (a) obtains a figure by applying the formula in subsection (4) to items of that kind; and (b) rounds the figure up or down to the nearest rate specified in schedule 12, column 1 (Old banded rates of depreciation); and (c) sets the same rate for some or all of the kinds of items of depreciable property that are similar to one another, if the Commissioner thinks it is appropriate to do so having regard to— (i) the rate calculated for each kind; and (ii) the reduction in compliance costs that is likely to be achieved. Formula (4) The formula is— residual value cost e stimated useful life 1 1  Defi nition of items in formula 30 (5) In the formula,— (a) residual value is the greater of— (i) estimated residual market value, which is defined in section EE 67: (ii) 13.5% of cost: (b) cost is the cost of items of the kind to which the formula is applied: (c) estimated useful life is defined in section EE 63. 146. Section EE 31 sets out when the 20% loading applies: EE 31 Annual rate for item acquired in person’s 1995-96 or later income year What this section is about (1) This section is about the annual rate that applies to an item of depreciable property that a person acquires, other than under section FL 2(2) (Treatment of emigrating companies and their shareholders), in their 1995– 96 income year or a later income year (not including fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property, for which rates are set in sections EE 33 and EZ 15 (Annual rate for excluded depreciable property: 1992–93 tax year)). Rate (2) The rate is 1 of the following: (a) the item’s economic rate, special rate, or provisional rate, for an item not described in either paragraph (b) or (c): (b) the item’s economic rate, special rate, or provisional rate, multiplied by 1.2, for an item that – (i) has not been used or held for use in New Zealand as an item of depreciable property before the date on which the person acquires it; and (ii) is not a building; and (iii) is not a used imported car; and (iv) is not an international aircraft: (c) a diminishing value rate of 15% or a straight-line rate of 10%, for an international aircraft. 147. Section EE 39 sets out depreciation loss that can be claimed on items no longer used: EE 39 Items no longer used When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person in an income year has an item of depreciable property that— (a) is no longer used or, because the geothermal energy proving period has ended, becomes unavailable for use under section EE 6(4); and 31 (b) is not a building, unless the item meets the requirements of subsection (2); and (c) has not been depreciated using the pool method. Buildings (2) This section applies to a building that meets the requirements of subsection (1)(a) and (c) if— (a) the building has been irreparably damaged and rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income; and (b) the damage occurs— (i) in the 2005–06 income year or a later income year: (ii) as a result of the extreme climatic conditions that occurred during the month of February 2004 in New Zealand: (iii) as a result of the storm event that occurred during the month of July 2004 in the Bay of Plenty area; and (c) the damage is caused other than as a result of the action or failure to act of the person, an agent of the person, or an associated person. Amount of depreciation loss under this section (3) The person has an amount of depreciation loss under this section and under no other provision of this subpart. Circumstances (4) The person has an amount of depreciation loss if— (a) they no longer use the item in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; and (b) neither they nor a person associated with them intends to use the item in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; and (c) the costs of disposing of the item would be more than any consideration they could derive from disposing of it. Amount (5) The amount of depreciation loss is the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year. Adjusted tax value at end of year (6) The item’s adjusted tax value at the end of the income year is zero. 148. Section EE 48 sets out the depreciation treatment of items disposed of: EE 48 Effect of disposal or event Amount of depreciation recovery income (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, if the consideration is more than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, the lesser of the following amounts is the amount of depreciation recovery income derived by the person for the income year in which the disposal or the event occurs: 32 (a) the amount by which the consideration is more than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs; and (b) the total of the amounts of depreciation loss for which the person has been allowed deductions for the item including, for an item to which section CZ 11 (Recovery of deductions for software acquired before 1 April 1993) applies, any deduction allowed for its acquisition. Amount of depreciation loss (2) For the purposes of section EE 44, if the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, the person has an amount of depreciation loss, for the income year in which the disposal or the event occurs, that is the amount by which the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on that date. When this section does not apply (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the item is a building unless— (a) the building has been irreparably damaged and rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income; and (b) the damage occurs— (i) in the 2005–06 income year or a later income year: (ii) as a result of the extreme climatic conditions that occurred during the month of February 2004 in New Zealand: (iii) as a result of the storm event that occurred during the month of July 2004 in the Bay of Plenty area; and (c) the damage is caused other than as a result of the action or failure to act of the person, an agent of the person, or an associated person. 149. Section EZ 23 sets out the method for setting an economic depreciation rate for items that are plant or equipment acquired before 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired before 19 May 2005: EZ 23 Economic rate for plant or equipment acquired before 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired before 19 May 2005 What this section is about (1) This section is about setting the economic depreciation rate that applies to items of a kind of depreciable property if – (a) the kind of depreciable property is not fixed life intangible property, or excluded depreciable property, for which an economic rate cannot be set; and (b) the items are – (i) plant or equipment acquired before 1 April 2005: (ii) buildings acquired before 19 May 2005: (iii) buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, as relationship property or from a company in the same wholly-owned group of companies, from a person who applied to the item an economic depreciation rate set under this section or a corresponding provision. Rate set by Commissioner 33 (2) The Commissioner sets the rate from time to time by – (a) following the procedure set out in this section; and (b) issuing a determination under section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Procedure for setting economic rate (3) To set the diminishing value rate for a kind of item of depreciable property, the Commissioner – (a) gets a figure by applying the formula in subsection (4) to items of that kind; and (b) rounds the figure up or down to the nearest rate specified in schedule 12, column 1 (Old banded rates of depreciation); and (c) sets the same rate for some or all of the kinds of items of depreciable property that are similar to one another, if the Commissioner thinks it is appropriate to do so having regard to – (i) the rate calculated for each kind; and (ii) the reduction in compliance costs that is likely to be achieved. Formula (4) The formula is - resi dual value cost e stimated useful life 1 1  Defi nition of items in formula (5) In the formula, - (a) residual value is the greater of – (i) estimated residual market value, which is defined in section EE 67 (Other definitions): (ii) 13.5% of cost: (b) cost is the cost of items of the kind to which the formula is applied: (c) estimated useful life is defined in section EE 63 (Meaning of estimated useful life). 150. Section EE 63 sets out the definition of “estimated useful life”: EE 63 Meaning of estimated useful life Meaning for item of depreciable property, except for copyright in sound recording (1) Estimated useful life, for an item of depreciable property, other than a copyright in a sound recording, means the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, taking into account— 34 35 (a) the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence; and (b) an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. Meaning for copyright in sound recording (2) Estimated useful life, for a copyright in a sound recording, means the period from the time at which the copyright might reasonably be expected to be first useful in deriving assessable income until the end of the income year in which it might reasonably be expected that 90% of all the income that will be derived from it has been derived. Temporary buildings provisions 151. Section DB 20 allows a deduction for loss incurred through the destruction of a temporary building: DB 20 Destruction of temporary building Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for a loss that they incur through the destruction of a temporary building. Link with subpart DA (2) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation. The other general limitations still apply. 152. Section YA 1 sets out the definition of “temporary building”: temporary building means – (a) a building that – (i) is erected under a permit issued by a local authority or a public authority; and (ii) must be demolished or removed if the local authority or the public authority requires its demolition or removal; or (b) a building that – (i) is erected at a construction site; and (ii) is to be demolished or removed on or before the completion of the construction; or (c) a building that – (i) was erected, and is used, to house specific plant or machinery; and (ii) will have to be demolished to remove or replace the plant or machinery
1 Interpretation Statement IS 10/03 GST: TIME OF SUPPLY – PAYMENTS OF DEPOSITS, INCLUDING TO A STAKEHOLDER This interpretation statement considers certain aspects of the time of supply rule in section 9(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, particularly in regard to situations involving the payment of a deposit. The conclusions reached are summarised below. The Commissioner previously published a policy statement “GST: general time of supply rules – receipt of deposits” in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 6, No. 7, (December 1994). As from 27 May 2010 this interpretation statement withdraws and replaces that earlier statement. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. Section 9(1) provides that a supply is deemed to take place at the earlier of: • the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient in respect of that supply; or • the time any payment is received by the supplier in respect of that supply. Note that this statement deals only with the time of supply where payment is received and does not consider the issue of an invoice. In any particular situation, the issue of an invoice could cause the time of supply to be triggered. 2. Before section 9(1) will apply, it is necessary to establish there is a transaction giving rise to a supply that is chargeable with GST. Section 9(1) is a timing-only provision, and it will only apply to fix the time of supply if there is a transaction giving rise to a supply. In determining whether a transaction giving rise to a supply exists, the legal arrangements entered into between the parties must be considered. Where there is a binding contract, such a transaction is assumed. Where there is no contract, the existence of a transaction giving rise to a supply will be established where there are reciprocal obligations between the parties. 3. A deposit constitutes “any payment”. Where a supplier receives a deposit under a contract, the time of supply will be triggered under section 9(1). This applies equally to conditional or unconditional contracts. 4. Where a deposit is paid to a person as stakeholder, there will have been no receipt by the supplier and the time of supply will not be triggered. A supplier may be a stakeholder. 2 5. A stakeholder relationship requires agreement by all parties. A person cannot declare himself or herself a stakeholder unilaterally. A stakeholder holds the deposit on behalf of both parties and owes a contractual or quasi-contractual obligation to both parties. The intention of the parties, determined from all the circumstances, will establish in which capacity a person receives a deposit. 6. Where there is no binding contract, it must be shown that the payment is for the supply of goods or services, whether the physical supply takes place now or in the future. Where this is the case, the receipt of the payment by the supplier will trigger the time of supply. Background 7. In the Commissioner’s previously published statement, referred to above, the Commissioner considered that the supplier of goods and services could not act as a stakeholder. A stakeholder had to be an independent third party. 8. Since the publication of that statement, the High Court released its decision in CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446. That decision provides authority for a supplier to be a stakeholder. 9. The Commissioner has decided to review the application of the time of supply rules in section 9(1) to the receipt of deposits and to provide some guidance on the requirements for a person to be acting as stakeholder. Legislation: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 10. “Consideration” is defined in section 2(1) as: Consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non- profit body: 11. Section 5(1) provides: For the purposes of this Act, the term “supply” includes all forms of supply. 12. Section 6(1)(a) provides: For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: 13. Section 8(1) provides: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the 3 rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 14. Section 9(1) provides: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. Analysis Section 9(1) 15. The general rule for determining the time of supply is set out in section 9(1), which provides: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. 16. Therefore, under section 9(1) a supply is deemed to take place at the earlier of: • the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient in respect of that supply; or • the time any payment is received by the supplier in respect of that supply. 17. Before section 9(1) will apply, it is necessary to establish there is a transaction giving rise to a supply that is chargeable with GST. In determining whether such a transaction exists, the legal arrangements entered into between the parties must be considered. See CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA), (1990) 12 NZTC 7,228 (PC); Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325; Pine v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,570; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075; CIR v Capital Enterprises Ltd (2002) 20 NZTC 17,511. 18. Section 9(1) is a timing-only provision and will only apply to fix a time of supply if there is a transaction giving rise to a supply. If there is no supply (whether it is performed now or in the future), then section 9(1) cannot operate. 19. Durie J, in CIR v Capital Enterprises Ltd, said (at p 17,519): \[49\] Section 9 does no more than fix a time of supply for the purposes of the Act, as the section says. The purpose of the Act is to tax the supply of goods and services in the course of trade. In furtherance of that purpose s 9 appears to be no more than a mechanical provision to assist the imposition and collection of that tax by determining such matters as when tax becomes payable or deductible (see Richardson P in Pine v C of IR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,570 (CA) at p 13,573). 4 20. This statement considers the application of section 9(1) to the payment of deposits. For the purposes of the following discussion, it is assumed that an invoice has not been issued prior to the receipt of any payment. 21. The application of section 9(1) is discussed below in relation to the payment of a deposit in the following different circumstances: • A payment made under an unconditional contract • A payment made under a conditional contract • A payment made when no contract exists A payment made under an unconditional contract 22. The discussion in this part of the statement deals with the most common scenario; that is, deposits paid under contracts where agreement has been reached between the parties on all terms and only performance of the contract remains to be concluded. In other words, there are no conditions or other matters that could affect a contract’s execution. Note that the position of payments made under agreements subject to conditions (that is, conditional contracts), is dealt with later in this statement. 23. The Commissioner’s view is that where a deposit is paid under an unconditional contract the position is straightforward. There is a supply and the deposit is paid in respect of that supply. Section 9(1) will deem the time of supply to be when the deposit is received by the supplier. This will be so even if the goods or services have not been physically supplied or performed at that time. This view is supported by the cases discussed below. 24. In Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391, the issue was whether a subdivider of land had to pay GST on the full sale price of sections of land at the time of selling them at auction or at the later time when the subdivider could provide title to the purchaser and complete settlement. Barber DJ concluded that GST on the full sale price had to be paid on the day of the auction and signing of the contract and payment of the deposit. Section 9(1) deemed the supply to have taken place on that day. There was a binding contract from the outset and only performance of the contract, or final implementation, was delayed until title was available. 25. In Case N24 (1993) 13 NZTC 3,196, the taxpayer had entered into an agreement to sell a property. The agreement became unconditional on 18 August 1987 and the deposit was paid in two instalments on 19 August and 5 November 1987. The taxpayer did not return GST on the sale, claiming that because of the share market crash and the failure of the purchaser to obtain public subscriptions it was unlikely the purchaser would be able to complete the purchase. The purchaser did fail to complete on settlement date (28 February 1988) and the contract was cancelled on 22 August 1988. The taxpayer retained the deposit as damages for breach of contract. 5 26. Barber DJ confirmed his reasoning in Case L67 and, although the question before him was only whether the taxpayer should have returned GST on the amount of the deposit, he noted that the taxpayer should have returned GST on the full value of the supply that took place on 19 August 1987 when the first deposit was paid. The taxpayer was deemed by section 9(1) to have made the supply on that date. The fact that the contract was later cancelled and the supply of the property did not take place, did not avoid the GST liability on the deemed supply of 19 August 1987. 27. In Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685, tuition fees were paid to the supplier under a contract. The supplier was entitled to a small portion of the fees immediately and the balance had to be held in trust until after the student had attended a course for more than seven days. Hansen J applied Case L67 and Case N24 and held that the receipt of the first amount by the supplier triggered the time of supply for the full value of the supply. The supplier had received a payment in respect of the supply of the services and section 9(1) applied. Another view 28. Another view is that the payment of a deposit under an agreement will not comprise “payment” that triggers the time of supply until completion and payment of the full amount under the agreement. This view focuses on the purpose of a deposit and claims that until completion a deposit is simply a surety. 29. General case law establishes that a deposit serves two purposes. A deposit is part payment of the purchase price and it is a guarantee that the purchaser means business: Howe v Smith (1884) 27 ChD 89; Soper v Arnold (1889) 14 App Cas 429 \[note that if difficulties are experienced in accessing copies of these two cases, copies are available from the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel on request\]; Martin v Finch \[1923\] NZLR 570. The view is that a deposit’s primary purpose is as a guarantee or surety on the purchaser’s behalf and that it does not become part payment of the purchase price until the agreement has been completed. 30. However, the Commissioner considers the better view is that a deposit does constitute “any payment” within the words of section 9(1). Although the New Zealand judiciary has not addressed this issue directly, there is significant authority confirming that a deposit constitutes “any payment”: for example, Case L67; Case N24; Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR; Barratt v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,372, 12,377; CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446, 13,458; Rob Mitchell Builder Ltd (in liq) v National Bank of New Zealand Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,397, para 4. 31. Some commentators claim that support for the alternative view can be found in the High Court of Australia decision in FCT v Reliance Carpet Co Pty Ltd \[2008\] HCA 22. However, the Australian decision has little persuasive value in this context because of the significant differences in 6 the relevant legislation. The High Court of Australia noted the distinction itself when it commented that no assistance was to be derived by that court from a consideration of the treatment of deposits in the New Zealand taxation system. 32. On the other hand, the United Kingdom VAT cases provide strong support for the view that a deposit is part payment of the purchase price in this context and constitutes a payment received in respect of the supply. See, for example, MH Caine (1987) 3 BVC 1,325; Bethway & Moss Ltd (1988) 3 BVC 718; Regalstar Enterprises (1988) 3 BVC 866; Bruce Banks Sails Ltd (1990) 5 BVC 1,357; Bristol Bathroom Co Ltd v C&E Commrs \[1991\] 3 C.M.L.R. 947; C&E Commissioners v Moonrakers Guest House Ltd \[1992\] BTC 5,077; Simplelink Ltd t/a Homecare Exteriors \[1995\] BVC 1,372; Kirtley t/a Encore International \[1995\] BVC 1,520; Hollybourne Hotels Ltd \[2002\] BVC 4,030. The United Kingdom Revenue has also adopted this approach: See HM Revenue & Customs notice, VATTOS5120 – Actual tax points: Payments: Deposits and pre-payments. 33. The Commissioner considers the better view is that the receipt of a deposit by the supplier under an unconditional agreement is the receipt of “any payment” and will trigger the time of supply under section 9(1). Deposit – payment for different supply 34. As stated above, the legal arrangements between the parties must be analysed in order to identify the supply. There may be situations where, on a careful consideration of the facts, it is determined there is more than one supply taking place, that is, there is a supply that occurs before the main supply (“a preliminary supply”). This might occur, for example, in the case of a wedding function where a preliminary supply relating to the securing of a particular date takes place before the main supply of the actual function. However, it is considered that this situation would be unusual. In Kirtley t/a Encore International it was held that deposits paid to book a function were in the nature of part payments of the full amount due under the contract and triggered the tax point (time of supply). A similar decision was reached in Hollybourne Hotels Ltd in relation to deposits received by hotels for wedding receptions and functions. 35. It is clear from decisions such as Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR, Case L67 and Case N24 that a supply cannot simply be divided into several parts. The question of whether a payment is made for a preliminary supply, separate from the main supply, will always depend on the facts in each particular case and a determination of the true legal arrangements entered into by the parties. A payment made under a conditional contract 36. This part of the statement deals with the receipt of a deposit by a supplier under a conditional contract. 7 Meaning of “conditional contract” 37. A useful summary of the current state of New Zealand law in relation to conditional contracts is in Laws NZ, Contract para 154: New Zealand Courts have developed a body of law concerning conditional contracts in which the term “condition” refers to a contingent condition; this is a provision in an agreement that contemplates that the legal effect of, or the parties’ obligations under, the agreement will be altered in some way on the occurrence or non-occurrence of the contemplated contingency. In many older cases conditions were simply classified as “conditions precedent” or “conditions subsequent”, a practice which led to real confusion in case law. The term “condition subsequent” is still commonly used without such a reference point and generally refers to a contingency which is to occur, or not, at some point after a binding contract has been entered and on which the continuation of contractual obligations depend; this means that a failure to fulfil the condition will bring the contract to an end at that point or will give to one or both parties the option to bring the contract to an end. The term “condition precedent” was particularly productive of confusion since a condition might be a contingency required to occur before an agreement came to have contractual force or alternatively a contingency which was to occur after the contract was entered into but before some aspect of performance was required. There has been judicial criticism of the use of the terms “condition subsequent” and “condition precedent” unless the discussion of the condition in question makes it clear what precisely it is that the condition is precedent to or subsequent to. It is therefore now more common for the Courts to concern themselves with the effect of the particular condition before them on the particular contract; however, it is possible to formulate general rules which indicate the likely effect of such common conditions as making agreements subject to contract or subject to finance or subject to solicitor’s approval. 38. Criticism of the terms “condition precedent” and “condition subsequent” occurred in the judgment of Cooke J (as he then was) in the Court of Appeal decision in Hunt v Wilson \[1978\] 2 NZLR 261 at p 267. His Honour then reiterated this sentiment in Robertson Enterprises Ltd v Cope \[1989\] 3 NZLR 391 at p 393. 39. These authorities suggest that the more appropriate method of analysis is to focus on the nature of the condition to determine whether the condition prevents the formation of a binding contract or whether the condition suspends some right or obligation until the condition is satisfied. 40. A conditional offer or conditional acceptance would not result in a binding contract: Reporoa Stores Ltd v Treloar \[1958\] NZLR 177; Buhrer v Tweedie \[1973\] 1 NZLR 517; Frampton v McCully \[1976\] 1 NZLR 270. Agreements that are “subject to contract” or “subject to the drawing up of a formal contract” are not binding contracts if it can be inferred that the parties did not intend to be bound until the formal agreement had been signed: Carruthers v Whitaker \[1975\] 2 NZLR 667. There is a difference between that kind of condition and a condition that suspends some right or obligation under an already binding contract until the condition is satisfied. If a condition of the latter kind is not satisfied, the contract is or may be terminated, but in the meantime there is a binding 8 agreement: Provost Developments Ltd v Collingwood Towers Ltd \[1980\] 2 NZLR 205; Connor v Pukerau Store Ltd \[1981\] NZLR 384. 41. The key distinction is between conditions that must be satisfied before there will be a binding contract and conditions that suspend some right or obligation under an already existing binding contract until the condition is satisfied. For the purposes of this statement, any reference to a conditional agreement is to an agreement subject to the latter type of condition. In other words, a conditional agreement is an existing binding agreement that is subject to conditions. Receipt of payment by supplier under conditional contract 42. In most circumstances, the position under a conditional contract is the same as under an unconditional contract. As a binding contract exists, there is a supply and any payment made is in respect of that supply. A deposit received by the supplier will trigger the time of supply under section 9(1). 43. Very few New Zealand cases have dealt with the issue of the time of supply in relation to the payment of a deposit under a conditional contract. Those that do provide some support for the conclusion that receipt of a deposit by a supplier under a conditional contract will trigger the time of supply. However, the decisions all deal with payment of the deposit to a stakeholder, rather than to the supplier directly. This reflects the fact that, in practice, it would not be common for a purchaser to pay a deposit directly to a supplier when a contract is still conditional. Receipt of payment by a stakeholder 44. In many cases a deposit will be paid to a person to hold it as stakeholder until an agreement becomes unconditional. This situation is most common in relation to the supply of land. Where a deposit is paid to a stakeholder, the supplier will not have received any payment and the time of supply will not have been triggered. 45. The only New Zealand case to consider the issue of a stakeholder in a GST context in any depth is CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446. The case involved a husband and wife farming partnership, registered for GST, which sold some land. The Commissioner assessed the partnership for GST on the sale. The TRA found for the taxpayers, holding that as the land was owned by the husband, who was not registered for GST, no GST was payable on the sale. In case it was later held that the partnership had made the supply, the TRA also found that the time of supply was the date the deposit was paid by the purchaser to the vendor’s agent. 46. On appeal, the High Court agreed with the TRA that no GST was payable on the sale of the property because the partnership did not own the land. However, Salmon J also went on to consider the TRA’s finding in relation to the time of supply. 9 47. Salmon J held that a deposit is not received by a supplier as long as any person holds it as stakeholder, whether that person is the supplier or an independent third party. A deposit will not be received unless the supplier, or the supplier’s agent, receives it for his or her own benefit, or, in the case of a deposit paid to an agent, for the principal’s benefit. His Honour concluded that the obligation to hold the deposit as stakeholder means the deposit is not received for the supplier’s benefit, even if the stakeholder is the supplier. As a payment must be received by the supplier in order for the time of supply to be triggered, receipt by a stakeholder will not trigger the time of supply. The circumstances of each case will determine in which capacity a person holds funds. 48. In Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (at p 17,699) Hansen J agreed with the analysis and conclusion in CIR v Dormer that there could be no receipt of a payment by the supplier for the purposes of section 9 when the recipient of the payment was obliged to hold the funds as stakeholder. His Honour stated that a deposit is not received until the supplier or his agent receives it for his own benefit. 49. The position of a stakeholder in a GST context was also mentioned briefly in CIR v Bhanabhai (2005) 22 NZTC 19,533 at p 19,357. In a discussion on the requirements of a vendor to account for GST as soon as a purchaser has made the first payment, Laurenson J noted that the one exception was if the deposit was held by a stakeholder. In Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Ltd v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 at p 18,621, Rodney Hansen J also noted that payment included payment of a deposit unless held by the recipient as stakeholder. 50. Thus, the decision in Dormer established that the receipt of a payment by a stakeholder means the supplier has not received payment within the provisions of section 9(1). This is the case whether the stakeholder is the supplier or an independent third party. In order for a supplier to “receive” payment within the terms of section 9(1), the supplier must have received the payment for his or her own benefit. An obligation to hold as stakeholder means a supplier has not received payment for his or her own benefit and this will prevent receipt. 51. In some cases a deposit paid may be stated to be non-refundable. If the facts show that the supplier is entitled to the deposit from the moment of payment, then the supplier will have received payment and the time of supply will have been triggered. However, if the deposit is paid to a stakeholder and the facts show that the deposit cannot be applied to the supplier’s benefit until the happening of a specific event, such as on the cancellation of the contract, then the stakeholder rules will apply. The time of supply will not be triggered until that particular event occurs and the stakeholder obligations are therefore at an end. At that time the supplier will have received the payment for his or her own benefit and time of supply will have occurred. 10 52. Stakeholder obligations most commonly end at the time the contract becomes unconditional. However, the specific event which ends a stakeholding relationship is determined by the terms of the particular stakeholding agreement. For example, in circumstances where the solvency of a supplier is in question, the purchaser may negotiate to ensure the stakeholding relationship continues beyond the unconditional date to the date of settlement. Where the stakeholding obligations continue and the supplier has not received any payment for his or her own benefit (and providing an invoice has not been issued), the time of supply will not have occurred and the supplier will not have to account for GST. Note that a purchaser in this situation would also be unable to claim an input tax credit until the time of supply was triggered. 53. In some cases a third party stakeholder may also be the agent of the supplier, for example, a real estate agent or solicitor. If the third party receives the payment in its capacity as stakeholder, then it will not have received the money in its capacity as the supplier’s agent and the supplier will not have received payment. The only exception to this will be if the third party stakeholder pays or applies the payment to the supplier or for the supplier’s benefit during the period of the stakeholding in error. This may occur, for example, where the stakeholder mistakenly believes the relevant event has taken place (such as the contract becoming unconditional) or the stakeholder accedes to a unilateral request by the supplier. As the supplier is not acting in any stakeholder capacity, the supplier will have received payment for the purposes of section 9(1). 54. As discussed below, a stakeholder relationship requires agreement between all the parties. If a third party stakeholder mistakenly makes payment to the supplier, the supplier cannot unilaterally impose stakeholder obligations on himself or herself. Therefore, nothing prevents the supplier from having received the payment. This is consistent with the fact that if a stakeholder pays the deposit to the supplier in breach of its stakeholding obligations, the recourse for the purchaser is with the stakeholder: see, for example, Hastingwood Property Ltd v Saunders Bearman Anselm \[1991\] Ch 114. 55. The next part of this statement considers what is required to show that a person is holding a payment as stakeholder. Requirements of a stakeholder 56. The cases show the essential requirement for a stakeholder relationship is the existence of an agreement between the parties. A person cannot establish himself or herself as a stakeholder unilaterally. 57. A stakeholder’s obligations are determined by agreement between the parties and the stakeholder. Under that agreement, a stakeholder is required to hold the funds until a defined event takes place. That event establishes who is entitled to the money. The parties have no proprietary interest in the funds until that event takes place. 11 58. A person who holds money as a stakeholder does not act as agent for either party. A stakeholder, in their capacity as stakeholder, holds the funds for both parties and owes a contractual or quasi-contractual obligation to both parties. This is the case even if the person acting in the capacity of stakeholder is also acting in the capacity of agent for one or other of the parties. 59. The cases establish that, in ordinary circumstances, a stakeholder (unless he or she is a real estate agent or solicitor) is entitled to retain any interest earned on the funds while they are in his or her possession. Equally, a stakeholder is liable for any loss suffered. Note that in practice, however, the entitlement to interest may be dealt with as a term of the stakeholding agreement between the parties and who is entitled to the interest on the deposit may therefore vary. For example, entitlement to the interest may be determined in favour of the supplier if settlement proceeds and in favour of the purchaser if it does not, or it may be applied to the purchase price on behalf of the purchaser. In general this will not occur until settlement. Note that if the supplier as stakeholder is entitled to the interest and the interest is applied to the purchase price, the interest will constitute a payment received by the supplier in respect of the supply and the time of supply will be triggered. 60. The consent of both parties is necessary to vary a stakeholder’s obligations. 61. The intention of the parties, determined from all the circumstances, will establish in which capacity a person receives the money. 62. The existence of a separate bank account in which the funds are placed (although not a legal requirement) combined with clear written confirmation of the stakeholder relationship will generally support the contention that a person is a stakeholder. 63. See, for example, Potters (a firm) v Loppert \[1973\] 1 All ER 658; Neate v Manchester Home Centre Ltd 22 April 1989, Tipping J, HC Christchurch CP343/89; Vahora v Tse (1999) 4 NZ ConvC 192,923; Rockeagle Ltd v Alsop Wilkinson (a firm) \[1991\] 4 All ER 659; Treitel, The Law of Contract, 11 th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2003, at p 526; Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency, 17 th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2001, at para 9-026; and McMorland, Sale of Land, 2 nd ed, Cathcart Trust, Auckland, 2000, para 7.05. A payment made when no contract exists 64. The discussion in this part of the statement considers the situation where a payment has been made but there is no binding contract. 65. As stated earlier in this statement, the legal arrangements between the parties must be considered in determining whether a supply exists. Where a binding contract exists and a payment is made pursuant to that contract, there is an automatic assumption that a supply exists. 12 However, a supply need not necessarily be made under a contract. The crucial question is not whether there is a contract, but whether there is a supply. 66. In the absence of a binding contract there is no automatic assumption of a transaction giving rise to a supply. It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether there has in fact been a supply that is chargeable with GST. Has the payment received been made for a supply? Consideration 67. Where a payment is made, it is necessary to establish a link between the payment and a supply, that is, that the payment constitutes “consideration” for a supply. To satisfy the definition of “consideration”, the payment must be made in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of that supply. The mere receipt of payment will not necessarily indicate the existence of a taxable supply. Not all payments received by a registered person in the course of their taxable activity will be for supplies. If there is no supply, the payment cannot be consideration. See, for example, Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075; CIR v NZ Refining Co (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187. 68. While it is necessary for there to have been a supply of something, the supply need not be made to the person who makes the payment: Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 at p 10,036. 69. There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply, but a strict contractual analysis does not need to be undertaken in order to link a payment to a supply. See NZ Refining Co Ltd at p 13,193; Turakina at p 10,036. 70. The GST definition of consideration has been interpreted in the High Court as wider than the common law meaning: The Trustee, Executors and Agency Co NZ Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076, at p 13,085. However, it has also been made clear that while the statutory definition of consideration in the GST Act is wider than the contract law meaning, the definition does not remove the contract law requirement for an element of reciprocity to be present within a transaction in order for the payment to be “consideration” for a supply: Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 at p 13,150. 71. The focus of the GST legislation, therefore, is on establishing a nexus between the supply and payment. As Blanchard J said in NZ Refining Co Ltd (at p 13,193), “to constitute consideration for a supply the payment must be for that supply” (emphasis added). Reciprocal obligations 72. The cases emphasise the necessity for reciprocal obligations between the parties. If a supply cannot be connected to the payment by reciprocal obligations, it cannot be said the payment is consideration for the supply. 13 There must be reciprocal obligations between the parties to make payment and to make a supply of goods or services for the payment. A payment made merely in the hope that a supply would be made is not sufficient to constitute consideration. See NZ Refining Co Ltd; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust; CIR v Suzuki (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819. 73. The Commissioner considers that the requirement for reciprocal obligations will generally be satisfied if it can be shown that payment has been made by one party for the supply of goods or services by another party, whether performance of the supply takes place concurrently or in the future. Where this is the case, there will be a transaction giving rise to a supply and the receipt of the payment by the supplier will trigger the time of supply in relation to that supply. 74. An example of a payment made where there were no reciprocal obligations can be seen in the UK VAT decision in Nigel Mansell Sports Co Ltd \[1991\] BVC 718. In that case the taxpayer held a franchise for Ferrari motorcars. There was a long waiting list for such cars. The taxpayer had taken “deposits” from potential customers who wished to purchase a Ferrari. At the time when the “deposit” was paid, the customer would specify the model, type, colour, etc of the Ferrari that the customer wished to purchase. When a car that corresponded to the customer’s requirements became available, the customer might be sent an order form and would then be asked to pay a deposit of 10 percent of the purchase price. That deposit was taken to include the initial sum “deposited”. The issue was whether the time of supply arose when the initial payment was made. The tribunal considered that section 5(1) of the Value Added Tax Act 1983 (UK) (the equivalent of section 9(1)) did not have the effect that the tax point (the time of supply) was when the initial payment was made. At that point there was only an agreement to make an agreement, which did not give rise to a supply. The initial payment by the potential customer did not give rise to any rights. Therefore, the tribunal considered that the initial payment did not constitute a payment in respect of any supply. 75. In the unusual circumstances of that case, therefore, it was held that the payment by the potential customer was not for a supply. The payment did not provide the customer with anything. The facts did not evidence any firm commitment on the part of either party to the arrangement – the company was not obliged to offer the potential customer a vehicle, and the customer was under no obligation to purchase a vehicle should one be offered. This was not merely a case of a payment in respect of a supply that might not happen in the future because of particular circumstances (as would be the more common position), but rather it was not a payment in respect of a supply at all. 76. The Commissioner considers this would not be a common situation and, indeed, the United Kingdom HM Revenue & Customs has recognised that 14 Nigel Mansell turns on its rather unusual circumstances and in most cases should be distinguishable on its facts: see HM Revenue & Customs notice VATTOS5130 – Actual tax points: payments: Exceptions to normal treatment of deposits and pre-payments. 77. The issue of whether a payment is made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” a supply is one that must be determined on the facts of each case. There must be a supply made or to be made in order for a payment to constitute consideration. Examples Example 1 78. Romeo, a GST-registered person, manufactures iron railings for balconies. On 12 June he enters into an agreement with Juliet to supply an Elizabethan style railing for her balcony. Juliet pays a deposit of 20 percent on the same day. Delivery of the railing is not to take place until 12 August. Payment of the balance of the purchase price is to be made on delivery. Romeo has a 30 June balance date, a two-month taxable period, and accounts on an invoice basis. 79. The time of supply will be triggered on 12 June when Romeo receives payment of the deposit. Therefore, for the purposes of accounting for GST, the supply takes place in the taxable period ending 30 June. Romeo will have to account for the output tax on the full value of the supply by 28 July, even though he will not receive the balance of the purchase price until delivery of the railing. 80. Note that if Romeo accounted on a payments basis, he would only have to account for output tax on the deposit received, not on the full value of the supply, by 28 July. Assuming the balance of the price was paid by Juliet on delivery on 12 August, he would then have to account for the output tax on that amount by 28 September, in relation to the taxable period ended 31 August. Example 2 81. Othello, a property developer, enters into a conditional agreement to sell a property to Iago. Iago pays a deposit to Desdemona Real Estate Ltd on 25 May 2009. Under the terms of the REINZ–ADLS agreement, the deposit is held by Desdemona Real Estate Ltd as stakeholder and the stakeholding ceases when the agreement becomes unconditional or is cancelled or avoided. The agreement becomes unconditional on 29 May 2009. Pursuant to section 123 of the Real Estate Agents Act 2008, Desdemona Real Estate Ltd is required to hold the deposit for 10 working days from the date of receipt and as a result it does not pay the deposit to Othello until 8 June. Othello has a standard balance date, a two- month taxable period, and accounts on an invoice basis. 15 82. The time of supply will be triggered on 29 May 2009 when the agreement becomes unconditional. From that point, Desdemona Real Estate Ltd will be holding the deposit not as stakeholder, but as agent for Othello. In these circumstances, Othello will have received payment for the purposes of section 9(1) and the time of supply will be triggered. Othello will have to account for the output tax on the full value of the supply for the period ending 31 May 2009. Example 3 83. Hamlet Ltd operates an exclusive hotel, Denmark House. It receives a booking request from Ophelia in April to book three nights’ accommodation over Labour Weekend. Hamlet Ltd requires Ophelia to pay one night’s accommodation charge as a deposit. If Ophelia cancels more than 48 hours before her booking, she will receive a full refund. If she cancels after that time, she will forfeit her deposit. 84. The time of supply will be triggered on receipt of the deposit by Hamlet Ltd. There is a transaction giving rise to a supply and therefore the receipt of any payment (the deposit) in respect of that supply (the accommodation) will trigger the time of supply under section 9(1). That the deposit may be refundable is irrelevant to the question of whether the time of supply has been triggered. It is also irrelevant that the supply has not actually taken place at the time of the receipt of the deposit. Example 4 85. Assume the same facts as in Example 3 above, but Hamlet Ltd immediately places the deposit received from Ophelia into a separate account with a third party and claims that the third party is holding the money as stakeholder until the non-refundable period of 48 hours before the start of Ophelia’s booking has been reached. 86. The time of supply will still be triggered on receipt of the deposit by Hamlet Ltd. Having received a deposit, a supplier cannot unilaterally decide that the deposit will be held by a third party as a stakeholder. There must be a contractual basis for the stakeholder relationship, i.e. all parties must agree to the stakeholder relationship. 87. Note that if it was agreed by all parties that Ophelia would pay the deposit directly to the third party to hold as stakeholder, then the time of supply would not be triggered. This situation would be similar to that in Example 2 of a deposit paid to a real estate agent to hold as stakeholder. Example 5 88. Benedict and Beatrice are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary in three months’ time with a function at Dogberry House. An agreement is signed setting out the number of guests, menu, alcohol, and entertainment and specifying the cost to be $5,000. It is acknowledged that details must be finalised no later than one week before the date of 16 the function. Dogberry House requires the couple to make a payment of $500 to confirm the booking. Dogberry accounts for GST on an invoice basis. 89. The amount paid will constitute a deposit in relation to the supply of the function. Therefore, receipt of the $500 from Benedict and Beatrice will trigger the time of supply for Dogberry House and it will have to account for output tax on the $5,000, even though the actual supply will not be made for three months. In the event that changes are later made to any of the details which then necessitate an adjustment to the cost of the function, Dogberry House may make an adjustment to the amount of its previously returned output tax under section 25. Example 6 90. Portia is getting married in 18 months’ time. She thinks she would like to hold her wedding function at Shylock Castle. She meets with the functions manager to consider the services the castle can provide, and it is agreed that the wedding will be held at the castle on the date she requests. No arrangements are made as to the nature of the wedding function at this time, with the castle simply agreeing to hold the date for Portia. Portia must confirm the arrangements for her wedding within six months of the chosen date in order to secure the date beyond that time. Portia pays $500 to Shylock Castle to hold the date she wants. The cost of the wedding will be reduced by this amount if the wedding function goes ahead. The amount paid is refundable at any time up to six months before the wedding. 91. In this situation, it is considered that Shylock Castle has received a payment in respect of a supply of services, being a chose in action, namely Portia’s right to hold her wedding at the castle on the date booked. This is a separate supply from that of the function itself. Shylock Castle will have to account for output tax on the $500 only at this time. 92. This can be contrasted with the situation in the Nigel Mansell case discussed in the body of this statement. In the unusual circumstances of that case, the finding of fact was that the payment did not secure anything for the customer. In contrast, Portia has secured the date for her function.

This interpretation statement replaces “Non-Resident Contractor’s Withholding Tax – Who is Affected by the Withholding Tax Rules”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 14 (June 1995). This interpretation statement covers aspects of schedular payments to non-resident contractors that were covered in the Tax Information Bulletin item, in the context of the new legislative provisions. 2. The following aspects, which were covered in the Tax Information Bulletin item are discussed in this interpretation statement: 1 • the imposition of tax on schedular payments to non-resident contractors, in particular the relevant rate that is provided in Schedule 4, special tax rate certificates, and exemption certificates; • the payment of tax to the Commissioner, in particular the amount of tax; • who is liable for paying the tax; • the non-resident contractor’s tax obligations as a payer of PAYE income payments to subcontractors or employees; and • specific exemptions for non-resident contractors and non-resident employees from New Zealand tax, including relief under double tax agreements. 3. Information on applications and enquiries are at the end of this interpretation statement, followed by examples illustrating how the non- resident contractor provisions operate. There is also a flow chart diagram setting out steps to be followed. Background 4. Before the introduction of the ITA 2007, the term “non-resident contractor’s withholding tax” referred to the tax that generally must be withheld from payments to non-resident contractors and paid to the Commissioner. 5. Before the ITA 2007 the legislation relating to withholding payments was contained in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”) and the Income Tax Act 2004. This legislation has been repealed by the ITA 2007 effective with respect to income derived in the 2008/09 and later income years. The legislation relating to tax to be withheld and paid on payments to non-resident contractors is now contained in the ITA 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). The term “withholding payments” has been replaced by “schedular payments” in the ITA 2007 and the TAA. The term “schedular payments” refers generally to payments, other than salary or wages, of a kind set out in the classes listed in Schedule 4. All of the payments listed in Schedule 4 relate to payments under a contract for services, as opposed to payments under a contract of service. A contract of service means that the parties are in an employee/employer relationship whereas under a contract for services the parties are independently contracted. For further discussion of the differences between a contract of service and a contract for services see the Supreme Court judgment in Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2005\] 3 NZLR 721. 6. Generally, the payer of a schedular payment to a non-resident contractor is required to apply the PAYE rules to the payment. Under the PAYE rules, the payer of a schedular payment to a non-resident contractor must withhold an amount of tax calculated on the gross amount of the payment generally at the relevant rate set out in Schedule 4. The relevant rate is generally 15 percent for schedular payments to non-resident contractors (except if it is a payment to which the source is specifically provided for in another part of Schedule 4 that is taxed at a different rate). The non- resident contractor may get relief from the amount of tax withheld by 2 obtaining a certificate of exemption or a special tax rate certificate from the Commissioner. 7. Schedule 4 provides a 20 percent rate of tax on payments to non-resident entertainers for providing schedular entertainment activities. For more information on non-resident entertainers, see Inland Revenue’s Employers Guide (IR335). 8. Non-resident contractors may be natural or non-natural persons, including companies. Payments to non-resident contractors that are companies can be schedular payments, unlike payments to most resident contractors that are companies (except for agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural companies). Tax on schedular payments to non-resident contractors 9. The payer of a schedular payment to a non-resident contractor must generally withhold tax from the payment at either the relevant rate provided in Schedule 4, or a special tax rate the Commissioner has specified in a special tax rate certificate. Tax is not required to be withheld from a contract payment to a non-resident contractor if the non- resident contractor holds an exemption certificate in respect of the payment. Relevant rate in Schedule 4 10. The relevant rate for schedular payments to non-resident contractors is generally the rate of 15 percent that is provided for contract payments to non-resident contractors in Part A of Schedule 4. However, if the schedular payment is a kind of payment to which the source is specifically provided for in another part of Schedule 4 (eg, clause 1 of Part F of Schedule 4, which provides a 25 percent rate of tax to apply specifically to payments for media contributions carried out by freelance contributors), then the relevant rate is the rate provided for that specific source of payment. 11. The reason the other schedular payment categories (formerly the withholding payment categories) are to be considered and applied before the non-resident contractor category is because the other categories have always been generally applicable to non-residents. From the time that the categories were introduced in 1957, there has been no general exclusion of payments to non-residents. The non-resident contractor category, which was first introduced in 1981, was an extension to the withholding payment categories. The non-resident contractor category was intended first, from 1981, to cover non-resident contractors performing work associated with “contract projects” that were not already covered by the withholding payment categories. “Contract projects” were projects involving construction, installation, assembly, exploration, exploitation or other similar activities. Then, from 1990, the non-resident contractor category was extended to cover all other non-resident contractors not already covered by the other withholding payment categories. 12. It is acknowledged that it is not entirely clear in the legislation that the other schedular payment categories are to be considered and applied before the non-resident contractor category. This is particularly so with 3 the ITA 2007, where the non-resident contractor category comes first in Schedule 4 rather than last as was the case in the Schedule to the Regulations. 13. However, application of the non-resident entertainer class of payment provides another indication that this is the correct interpretation. Clause 4 of Part F of Schedule 4 provides a rate of 20 percent for payments to non- resident entertainers that provide or perform schedular entertainment activities. The definition of “non-resident contractor” is broad enough to include those who are also defined as a “non-resident entertainer”, and the definitions of “contract payment” and “contract activity or service” are broad enough to cover payments for “schedular entertainment activities”. Therefore, the specific non-resident entertainer class of payment would be redundant if the correct interpretation were that the non-resident contractor rate applies to all contract payments that relate to a non- resident contractor’s contract activity or service. Therefore, the preferred interpretation is that the non-resident contractor rate is to be applied only when there is no other rate that could apply. Special tax rate certificates 14. Section 24N of the TAA provides the Commissioner with the discretion to issue a special tax rate certificate, to a person entitled to receive a schedular payment, which specifies the amount of tax on the payment or the rate of tax applying to the payment. However, section 24N(2) of the TAA provides that special tax rate certificates cannot be issued in respect of schedular payments to non-resident entertainers. Also, it is not the Commissioner’s practice to issue a special tax rate certificate that applies retrospectively. 15. A non-resident contractor may apply to the Commissioner for a special tax rate certificate. The Commissioner may issue a certificate with a rate higher or lower than the rate provided in Schedule 4 for the schedular payment. A non-resident contractor may request a special tax rate to be aligned with the non-resident contractor’s New Zealand marginal tax rate, which is determined by the non-resident contractor’s taxable income as defined in the ITA 2007. Therefore, the special tax rate may be determined based on any relevant factors such as the expected revenue and expenditure of the contract, and the non-resident contractor’s other sources of income or losses. 16. A payment made to the non-resident contractor for the use of, or right to use personal property is a schedular payment taxed at 15 percent pursuant to Part A of Schedule 4. However, several double tax agreements (“DTAs”) that New Zealand has signed have a “royalties” article that includes as royalties, payments for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment. Therefore, a non- resident contractor who has received a schedular payment for the use of, or right to use personal property may request a special tax rate to align with the tax rate provided in the “royalties” article of the relevant DTA. An example that includes payments for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment as royalties is Article 12 of the Double Taxation Relief (Republic of South Africa) Order 2004. Under Article 12 of the Double Taxation Relief (Republic of South Africa) Order 2004 the tax shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. However, if those royalties are effectively connected with a 4 permanent establishment of the non resident contractor in New Zealand, those royalties will be considered under Article 7 (business profits). As individual DTAs can be different and are subject to change, the appropriate DTA will need to be considered when considering what the non resident contractor’s marginal tax rate will be. Exemption certificates 17. Section RD 24 provides that a non-resident contractor may apply to the Commissioner for an exemption certificate to be issued under section 24M of the TAA in respect of a contract payment. An exemption certificate can be applied for if one of the three conditions provided in section RD 24(1) are satisfied. However, section 24M(2) of the TAA provides that exemption certificates cannot be issued in respect of schedular payments to non-resident entertainers. 18. Section 24M of the TAA provides the Commissioner with the discretion to issue an exemption certificate that specifies payments to which no tax is to be withheld. An example of where a non resident contractor may apply for an exemption certificate is where it is clear there will be no final income tax liability. This may be because of the application of a DTA or because the income earned by the non resident contractor will not be assessable income under the ITA 2007 (eg under section CW 19 which provides that amounts are exempt income where they are derived from performing personal or professional services during visits of 92 or fewer days in New Zealand and certain other requirements are satisfied). 19. An exemption certificate issued by the Commissioner will specify that no tax is to be withheld from specific payments stated on the certificate, and will specify the period for which the certificate is valid. It is not the Commissioner’s practice to issue an exemption certificate that applies retrospectively. The Commissioner has previously required exemption certificates to be signed in order to be valid. The Commissioner has also required any expired exemption certificates to be returned to the Commissioner. Having reviewed the matter the Commissioner considers that the requirement to sign a certificate should remain but that, from the date of issue of this Interpretation Statement, non resident contractors will no longer be required to return any expired exemption certificates. Payments of tax to the Commissioner 20. Section RD 4(1) provides that the payer of a schedular payment to a non- resident contractor is required to pay the tax withheld from that payment to the Commissioner. 21. Where a payment to a non-resident contractor has had tax withheld but the tax has not been paid to the Commissioner, the tax owing will be calculated from applying the applicable rate on the amount before the employer withheld tax. That is, tax will be calculated on the gross payment. 22. Also, where it is clear from the contract that the payer of the schedular payment is responsible for the tax on the payment (as determined from records and/or contracts) and no tax has been deducted, the payment to 5 the non-resident contractor must be grossed up before the tax is calculated. 23. It is necessary to gross up the payment, in the above situations, because the payment is regarded as the net amount and therefore the payment must be grossed up to correctly tax that payment. The grossed up amount is calculated by dividing the net amount by 1 minus the applicable withholding tax rate from Schedule 4 (eg 0.85 where the 15% non resident withholding tax rate is applicable). Example: Where grossing up is required and the contract payment made to a non resident contractor is $85 then the grossed up amount will be $100. $85/(1 – 0.15) = $100 24. Section RD 4(2) provides that if the payer of a schedular payment to a non-resident contractor has not withheld the tax from the payment, and subsequently has not paid the tax to the Commissioner, then the non- resident contractor must pay the tax that should have been withheld. In such a case where the tax has not been withheld or where the non- resident contractor is responsible for the tax withheld (also determined from records and/or contracts), the non-resident contractor would have received a “before-tax” payment and so the tax owing is calculated from applying the applicable rate on the amount received. That is, the payment to the non-resident contractor is not grossed up before the tax is calculated. Who is liable for paying the tax 25. In cases where the payer of the schedular payment has withheld tax from the payment (or contracted to be responsible for the tax on the payment made) but has not paid the tax to the Commissioner, the payer of the schedular payment will be liable to pay the deficient tax. This is referred to as a failure to account. 26. Where tax has not been withheld, section 168 of the TAA provides that the tax owing constitutes a debt payable to the Commissioner by the payer of the schedular payment. This is referred to as a failure to deduct. Section 168 of the TAA provides the Commissioner with the right to recover the deficient tax from the payer, the non-resident contractor, or both concurrently. Therefore, in a case where the non-resident contractor has no continuing presence in New Zealand the Commissioner may solely seek payment from the payer of the schedular payment. Subcontractors and employees of non-resident contractors 27. Pursuant to section RD 20, a non-resident contractor must withhold and pay tax on payments made to a subcontractor, if the payments are PAYE income payments (which mean payments of salary or wages, extra pay, and schedular payments). 6 28. Further, pursuant to section RA 5, a non-resident contractor who has employees or subcontractors, must account for and pay to the Commissioner all of the following as applicable: • tax on PAYE income payments; • fringe benefit tax; • tax on employer’s superannuation contributions (including KiwiSaver contributions). 29. The non-resident contractor may also be required to fulfil obligations relating to accident compensation levies. For more information about employer’s tax obligations, see Inland Revenue’s Employers Guide (IR 335). Specific exemptions for non-residents from New Zealand tax 30. The question of whether a payment is exempt income under the ITA 2007 or whether the payment has full relief from New Zealand tax under a DTA is separate to whether or not that payment is a schedular payment. Therefore, tax on schedular payments to non-resident contractors must be withheld from the payment (even if the amount of the payment is exempt income under the ITA 2007 or the recipient has full relief from New Zealand tax under a DTA), unless the non-resident contractor holds an exemption certificate in respect of that payment. 31. However, pursuant to section RD 8(1)(b), a payment to a non-resident contractor will not be a schedular payment and so tax will not need to be withheld, if the payment is: • salary or wages; or • an extra pay; or • a payment for services provided by a public authority, a local authority, a Maori authority, or a company, other than a non- resident contractor, a non-resident entertainer, or an agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural company; or • a payment covered by an exemption certificate provided under section 24M of the TAA; or • a payment for services provided by a non-resident contractor who has full relief from tax under a DTA, and is present in New Zealand for 92 or fewer days in a 12-month period; or • a contract payment for a contract activity or service of a non- resident contractor when the total amount paid for those activities to the non-resident contractor or another person on their behalf is $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. 32. Section RD 8(1)(b)(v) provides that “a payment for services provided by a non-resident contractor who has full relief from tax under a double tax agreement, and is present in New Zealand for 92 or fewer days in a 12- month period” is not a schedular payment. The Commissioner considers 7 that the words “full relief from tax under a double tax agreement” refer to each particular contract activity. This means that, for the purposes of section RD 8(1)(b)(v), each contract activity needs to be considered under any applicable DTA. Where a non-resident contractor is involved in more than one particular type of activity or investment, the fact that one or more of those activities or investments does not have full relief, under any applicable DTA, will not affect whether or not payments for the other activities are excluded from being schedular payments under section RD 8(1)(b)(v). 33. An example of the above interpretation of section RD 8(1)(b)(v) is where a non resident contractor undertakes a contract activity which has relief under a DTA but also earns interest or dividends which are only partially relieved under a DTA. The fact that the interest or dividends do not have full relief does not affect whether or not the contract payments for the other activities are schedular payments. In addition, while each particular contract activity is considered separately for the purposes of section RD 8(1)(b)(v), some DTAs link different activities and deem that connected activity to be a permanent establishment. An example is Article 5(4) of the Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 2010 (Article 5 contains the definition of a permanent establishment). In this case the particular activity being considered will not be considered to have full relief under that particular DTA for the purposes of section RD 8(1)(b)(v). 34. Section RD 8(1)(b)(vi) provides that “a contract payment for a contract activity or service of a non-resident contractor when the total amount paid for those activities to the contractor or another person on their behalf is NZ$15,000 or less in a 12-month period” is not a contract payment. The phrase “a contract payment for a contract activity or service” means that section RD 8(1)(b)(vi) must be considered each time a person makes a contract payment to a non resident contractor. The phrase “the total amount paid for those activities” means that all contract payments for all contract activities undertaken by a non resident contractor in a 12 month period are added together to determine “the total amount paid for those activities”. Determining “the total amount paid for those activities” requires that the person paying the contract payment has regard to all New Zealand-sourced contract payments received by or on behalf of the non resident contractor and all contract payments to be received by or on behalf of the non resident contractor (from any person) in any 12 month period. For example, if a non resident contractor contracts with party A for NZ$10,000 in a 12 month period, and in that same period contracts with party B for NZ$20,000, the rule will not apply. 35. Section RD 23 provides that where it cannot reasonably be determined at the time of the PAYE income payment whether the payment will be exempt income of the non-resident contractor or non-resident employee under either section CW 19 or a DTA, then the payer of the PAYE income payment may apply to the Commissioner to be released from the obligation to withhold the amount by providing a bond or other security to the Commissioner for the amount that would otherwise be required to be withheld. An interim tax 36. The tax required to be withheld from schedular payments to non-resident contractors is an interim tax. That is, the withheld tax is paid to the 8 Commissioner towards the non-resident contractor’s New Zealand income tax liability. The non-resident contractor’s New Zealand income tax liability for a tax year is determined by an assessment of the contractor’s taxable income for that year. The taxable income is then multiplied by the basic tax rate, at which stage a refund of any overpaid tax can be requested, or additional tax paid, by the non-resident contractor. Relief under double tax agreements 37. A non-resident may be provided with relief from their New Zealand income tax liability if a DTA exists between New Zealand and the country in which the non-resident is a tax resident. 38. When considering whether a DTA provides a non-resident contractor with relief from New Zealand tax, common issues that arise are: • whether the income is a royalty as defined in the DTA; • if the non-resident contractor is an enterprise, whether it has a permanent establishment in New Zealand at the time the contract activity is performed; • if the non-resident contractor is an individual, whether relief is provided by the personal services articles of the DTA (often relief is based on the length of the visit and whether a fixed base is available to the non-resident contractor in New Zealand). 39. Many DTAs contain articles dealing with particular areas or industries, which may provide a non-resident contractor with relief from New Zealand tax. Although DTAs have many similarities, they can also differ, so relief provided under a DTA to a non-resident contractor from one country may not be provided under another DTA to a non-resident contractor from another country. Care should be taken in considering the effect of a DTA on any particular situation. 40. For the non-resident contractor’s employees, relief may be available under the “Dependent Personal Services” or similar article in the DTA. These articles usually contain the following three requirements that an employee must meet to obtain relief under the DTA: • The employee’s presence in New Zealand must not exceed in aggregate 183 days in a 12-month period. • The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of New Zealand. • The remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base that the employer has in New Zealand. 41. A non-resident who has a tax liability in New Zealand may still be required to declare New Zealand income in their country of tax residence. However, the non-resident may be able to claim some or all of the New Zealand paid taxes as a tax credit in the country of tax residence. 9 Applications and Enquiries 42. Applications for exemption certificates must contain the following information: • the name and tax residence of the non-resident contractor; • a detailed description of the contract activity to be performed by the non-resident contractor in New Zealand, including start and finish dates of the contract activity to be performed in New Zealand; • a copy of the contract entered into between the non-resident contractor and the payer; • details of the contract period, contract payment amounts and their payment dates; • names of all the non-resident contractor’s employees and/or subcontractors who will be present in New Zealand performing the contract activity, and their arrival and departure dates; and • a brief background of any previous contract activity performed in New Zealand in the past two years by the non-resident contractor, and comments on any anticipated contract activity that the non- resident contractor is likely to undertake in New Zealand in the future. 43. Applications for special tax rate certificates should include the same information as required for applications for exemption certificates, and also disclosure of anticipated total revenue and expenditure for the contract activity and any other anticipated income or losses that will be included in the non-resident’s New Zealand taxable income. 44. Applications for an exemption certificate or a special tax rate certificate, or any enquiries about tax on payments to non-resident contractors should be made to: Non-Resident Contractors Team Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand Telephone: 64 04 890 3056 Facsimile: 64 04 890 4510 Email: nr.contractors@ird.govt.nz 45. As well as tax on schedular payments to non-resident contractors, the Non-Resident Contractors Team also deals with the other associated tax issues of a non-resident contractor (ie, tax on other PAYE income payments, goods and services tax, and fringe benefit tax). 10 Examples 46. Unless specifically discussed, these examples assume that the contract payments are not excluded from being schedular payments by virtue of section RD 8(1)(b) and do not consider: • Whether the payment is exempt income under the ITA 2007 (in particular section CW 19), or • The effect of a DTA on the non resident contractor’s final tax liability. Example 1 47. A non-resident individual specialises in the computer programming of robotics machinery. The non-resident is contracted by a New Zealand manufacturing company to undertake a two-month contract in New Zealand writing a computer program for one of the company’s new automated plants. The contract for the non-resident’s services as a computer software consultant is a contract for service as opposed to a contract of service. Therefore, the non-resident is a “non-resident contractor”. The Commissioner notes that the schedular payment rules do not distinguish between a non-resident individual (who is an independent contractor) and a non-resident company. 48. In this example the non resident contractor is present in New Zealand for 92 or fewer days. Therefore, under section RD 8(1)(b)(v), if the non resident contractor is entitled to full relief under a DTA then the payment will not be a schedular payment. This means that tax would not need to be withheld from the payments to the non resident contractor. However, if the non resident contractor is not entitled to full relief under a DTA then the contract payments made under the contract will be schedular payments. This means that tax must be withheld from the payments to the non resident contractor at the appropriate rate under Schedule 4. 49. Contract payments will also be schedular payments if the New Zealand manufacturing company contracts a non-resident company to provide the computer programming services, and that company sends one of its employees to New Zealand to perform the contracted services. Example 2 50. A non-resident demolition expert is contracted by a New Zealand company to demolish a tall industrial chimney at one of the company’s sites in New Zealand. The non-resident demolition expert is required to provide all the necessary equipment and personnel to carry out the contracted work, and brings an employee to New Zealand to assist in the demolition contract. The contract is a contract for services and therefore, the non-resident demolition expert is a “non-resident contractor”. This means that the contract payments made under the contract to the non-resident demolition expert will be schedular payments unless the payment is excluded from being a schedular payment by section RD 8(1)(b). 51. The salary paid to the non-resident demolition expert’s employee while the employee is present in New Zealand is sourced here in accordance with section YD 4(4). However the employee’s salary is excluded from the 11 definition of the term “schedular payment” under section RD 8(1)(b). The salary will however be within the definition of the term “PAYE income payment” in section RD 3. This means that the non-resident demolition expert will have to withhold PAYE and pay this to the Commissioner under the PAYE rules in subpart RD of the ITA 2007, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the employee will be exempt from New Zealand tax under the ITA 2007 (eg section CW 19) or that the employee has full relief under a DTA. Example 3 52. A non-resident company has vehicles, vessels, and aircraft available for worldwide hire. A New Zealand company contracts the non-resident company to supply a small submarine on bare boat charter for a period of eight months for use in New Zealand. The contract provides for payment of a monthly rental fee. Therefore, the non-resident company is a “non- resident contractor” that is receiving payments for a “contract activity or service”, being the provision of the use, in New Zealand, of the non- resident’s personal property. 53. The contract also provides the New Zealand company with an option to have the non-resident company supply suitably qualified personnel to operate the submarine. An additional fee is charged for these services. The New Zealand company does not have a suitably qualified operator to operate the submarine, so it exercises its option under the contract. The non-resident company has on call several independent operators who it may contract. The non-resident company contracts a non-resident independent operator who is qualified to operate the submarine. The contract between the non-resident company and the non-resident independent operator is a contract for service and therefore the non- resident operator is a “non-resident contractor”. 54. The contract payments that the New Zealand company makes to the non- resident company for the hire of both the submarine and the personnel are schedular payments to which the New Zealand company must withhold tax. The contract payments by the non-resident company to the non- resident independent operator are also schedular payments, and the non- resident company must also withhold tax on these schedular payments. Example 4 55. A New Zealand company engages the services of a marketing company in Melbourne to undertake a marketing study in Australia of possible consumer interest in small appliances that are manufactured in New Zealand. The contract services provided by the Melbourne company are not performed in New Zealand. Therefore, the income does not have a source in New Zealand and consequently the payments will not be schedular payments. This means that tax will not need to be withheld from any payments for the company’s services. Example 5 56. A non-resident company specialising in the manufacture of compressed fibreboard fabricating machinery sells machinery to a New Zealand timber 12 company that is in the business of manufacturing compressed fibreboards. Fabrication of the machinery takes place outside New Zealand, and the non-resident company arranges for transport of the machinery to the New Zealand company’s premises. The machinery is all computer-controlled, and specially trained personnel are required to operate and maintain it. 57. The contract to supply the machinery includes the requirement for the non-resident company to supply specialist engineering personnel to supervise the installation of the machinery at the New Zealand timber company’s New Zealand plant, and to provide the New Zealand company’s personnel with training in the use and maintenance of the machinery. 58. The payments made for the actual supply of the machinery cannot be schedular payments, as there is no source in New Zealand. The machinery was fabricated outside New Zealand. 59. The contract payments made by the New Zealand company to the non- resident company for providing personnel to supervise the installation of the machinery and for the training services are schedular payments as both these activities are performed in New Zealand by the non-resident company, which is a “non-resident contractor”. 60. The salary paid to the non-resident company’s employee while the employee is present in New Zealand is sourced here in accordance with section YD 4(4). However the employee’s salary is excluded from the definition of the term “schedular payment” under section RD 8(1)(b). The salary will however be within the definition of the term “PAYE income payment” in section RD 3. Therefore the non-resident company will have to withhold PAYE and pay this to the Commissioner under the PAYE rules in subpart RD of the ITA 2007, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the employee will be exempt from New Zealand tax under the ITA 2007 (eg under section CW 19) or that the employee has full relief under a DTA. Example 6 61. The New Zealand company in example 5 enters into a further agreement with the non-resident company to manufacture and market the compressed fibreboard fabricating machinery in New Zealand. The non- resident company grants the New Zealand company exclusive rights to manufacture, market, and distribute the machine in New Zealand. The licence granted entitles the New Zealand company to the use of the trademark and technical information, including specifications and plans, and access to the non-resident company’s technical staff. 62. The New Zealand company pays a royalty to the non-resident company for the trademark and technical information. The non-resident company charges the New Zealand company an hourly rate for the services of its staff in support of the New Zealand company’s operations. 63. The royalty payments are not schedular payments as a royalty (as defined in section CC 9(2) and (3)) is specifically excluded from the definition of “contract payment”. Instead, the royalties paid for the trademark and technical information are subject to non-resident withholding tax, which is imposed under Subpart RF of the ITA 2007. (For more information on non-resident withholding tax contact the Non-resident Centre at nonres@ird.govt.nz, or on 64 03 951 2020.) 13 64. The fees paid to the non-resident company for the assistance provided by its staff also constitute royalties, as the fees come within the terms of paragraph (h) of the definition of “royalty” in section CC 9(2) and (3). Paragraph (h) provides that the supply of any assistance that enables the application of the trademark or technical information is also a royalty. Example 7 65. A non-resident freelance journalist comes to New Zealand to report on the New Zealand visit of an important overseas dignitary. A New Zealand newspaper company contracts the non-resident journalist to write a cover story on the visit of the overseas dignitary, for which a contract fee is payable. The newspaper will hold all rights to the story written. The contract is a contract for service that the non-resident journalist performs in New Zealand. Therefore, the contract payments to the non-resident journalist will be schedular payments because the non-resident is a “non- resident contractor” who is carrying out a “contract activity or service”. 66. Although Part A of Schedule 4 provides a 15 percent rate of tax for contract payments to non-resident contractors, clause 1 of Part F of Schedule 4 provides a 25 percent rate of tax to apply specifically for payments for contributions by freelance journalists. Therefore, the 25 percent rate will apply to these contract payments. 14 Appendix One: Legislation Schedular payments in subpart RD of the Income Tax Act 2007 67. Section RD 3(1) includes schedular payments as PAYE income payments. RD 3 PAYE income payments Meaning generally (1) The PAYE rules apply to a PAYE income payment which— (a) means— (i) a payment of salary or wages, see section RD 5; or (ii) extra pay, see section RD 7; or (iii) a schedular payment, see section RD 8: 68. Section RD 4(1) provides that the payer of the PAYE income payment must pay the required amount of tax withheld from the payment to the Commissioner. Section RD 4(2) provides that if some or all of the amount of tax for the PAYE income payment is not withheld and paid pursuant to section RD 4(1), then the recipient of the PAYE income payment must pay the tax. RD 4 Payment of amounts of tax to Commissioner Payments monthly or fortnightly (1) An employer or PAYE intermediary who withholds an amount of tax for a PAYE income payment must pay the amount to the Commissioner as follows (a) on a monthly basis, if they are an employer to whom section RD 22(3) or (4) applies: (b) for 2 payment periods in a month, if paragraph (a) does not apply. Liability when amount not withheld (2) If some or all of the amount of tax for a PAYE income payment is not withheld and paid under subsection (1), the employee in relation to whom the payment is made must— (a) pay an amount equal to the amount of tax to the Commissioner by the 20th day of the month following that in which the PAYE income payment was made; and (b) provide an employer monthly schedule to the Commissioner by the date described in paragraph (a). 69. Section RD 8 provides that payments of the classes specified in Schedule 4 are schedular payments. Section RD 8(1)(b) excludes particular payments from being schedular payments. RD 8 Schedular payments Meaning (1) A schedular payment— (a) means— 15 (i) a payment of a class set out in schedule 4 (Rates of tax for schedular payments); and (ii) in relation to a sale, the net amount paid after subtracting from the purchase price all commission, insurance, freight, classing charges and other expenses incurred by the seller in connection with the sale; and (b) does not include— (i) salary or wages; or (ii) an extra pay; or (iii) a payment for services provided by a public authority, a local authority, a Maori authority, or a company, other than a non-resident contractor, a non-resident entertainer, or an agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural company; or (iv) a payment covered by an exemption certificate provided under section 24M of the Tax Administration Act 1994; or (v) a payment for services provided by a non-resident contractor who has full relief from tax under a double tax agreement, and is present in New Zealand for 92 or fewer days in a 12-month period; or (vi) a contract payment for a contract activity or service of a non-resident contractor when the total amount paid for those activities to the contractor or another person on their behalf is $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. 70. Section RD 10(3) provides that the amount of tax for a schedular payment is calculated from the gross amount of the schedular payment at the relevant rate set out in Schedule 4. RD 10 Amounts of tax for PAYE income payments ... Schedular payments (3) The amount of tax for a schedular payment is determined— (a) at the relevant rate set out in schedule 4 (Rates of tax for schedular payments); and (b) on the basis of the gross amount of the payment, whether— (i) some or all of the payment is income; and (ii) the full income tax liability lies with the person receiving the payment, or lies partly with an employee or subcontractor of the person. ... 71. Section RD 18 provides the amount of tax that must be withheld by the payer of a schedular payment if notification required under section 24L of the TAA has not been provided to them. RD 18 Schedular payments without notification When this section applies 16 (1) This section applies when a person makes a schedular payment but the notification required under section 24L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has not been provided to them. When this section does not apply (2) This section does not apply when a person other than a company incorporates a company to obtain a reduction in an amount of tax for a schedular payment. Amount of tax (3) The person must withhold the amount of tax for the schedular payment of an amount determined as follows: (a) 5% of the amount of the schedular payment in addition to an amount calculated under section RD 10(3) if— (i) the person receiving the payment is a company that is a non-resident contractor; and (ii) the non-resident contractor receives the payment other than as a result of a choice that is made for purposes that include a purpose of defeating the intent and application of paragraph (c); and (iii) paragraph (b) does not apply: (b) zero, if the schedular payment is made to a non-resident entertainer: (c) 15% of the amount of the schedular payment if paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply. Note: If the payer of the schedular payment has not been notified with a completed Tax Code Declaration (IR 330) by the non-resident contractor, as required by section 24L of the TAA, then the payer must withhold tax from the payment at the applicable rate specified in section RD 18(3), which is to be applied in addition to the rate of tax specified in Schedule 4. 72. Section RD 19 sets out the non resident entertainer’s obligation to forward the tax on a schedular payment to the Commissioner where that schedular payment has been received without having NRCT deducted. RD 19 Schedular payments to non-resident entertainers When this section applies (1) This section applies when a non-resident entertainer derives income from an activity or performance connected with any of the activities or performances described in the definition of non-resident entertainer. Amounts withheld \[Repealed\] (2) \[Repealed\] Amounts not withheld (3) If the entertainer has received a schedular payment from which no amount of tax has been withheld, the entertainer must pay the amount of tax to the Commissioner by the 20th day of the month following that in which the payment was made, or by the date of their departure from New Zealand if that is earlier. 73. Section RD 20 provides that where a non-resident contractor is paid a schedular payment for services provided under a contract, and a subcontractor has provided services under that contract, the PAYE rules 17 apply to the non-resident contractor in relation to payments to the subcontractor for the work carried out under the contract. RD 20 Schedular payments to subcontractors When this section applies (1) This section applies when a contractor is paid a schedular payment for services provided under a contract, and a subcontractor has provided services under the contract. Obligation to retain amount (2) The PAYE rules apply to the contractor in relation to a payment made to the subcontractor in relation to the work carried out under the contract. 74. Section RD 24 provides that a non-resident contractor may apply to the Commissioner for an exemption certificate to be issued under section 24M of the TAA in respect of a contract payment. An exemption certificate can be applied for in respect of a contract payment for a contract activity or service if one of the three conditions provided in section RD 24(1) are satisfied. RD 24 Exemption certificates for non-resident contractors When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a non-resident contractor derives an amount from a contract activity or service that is not income, whether because of a double tax agreement or for another reason; or (b) the contractor provides a bond or other security for the payment of any income tax payable on an amount derived by them from a contract activity or service; or (c) the contractor has in the period of 24 months before the date of the application referred to in subsection (2) paid all income tax payable by them and complied with their obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts, and the Commissioner is satisfied that the contractor will continue to do this. Exemption certificate (2) The non-resident contractor may apply to the Commissioner to provide them with an exemption certificate under section 24M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for a contract payment made to them or another person acting on their behalf in relation to a contract activity or service set out in the certificate for which no amount of tax is to be withheld. Note: An application for an exemption certificate for a non-resident contractor should be made on the application form IR 197. Definitions in sections YA 1 and CC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 75. Section YA 1 includes a definition of a “non-resident contractor”. non-resident contractor, in the PAYE rules, means a person who— (a) is not resident in New Zealand under subpart YD (Residence and source in New Zealand); and (b) undertakes under a contract, agreement, or arrangement (other than a contract of service or apprenticeship)— 18 (i) to perform services of any kind in New Zealand: (ii) to supply the use, or right to use, in New Zealand any personal property or services of another person 76.

Therefore, the definition of “contract activity or service” would include the lease of any type of equipment for use in New Zealand. This can be relevant when these provisions interface with certain DTAs. This is discussed further above in the “special tax rate certificates” section of this statement. contract payment, for a non-resident contractor, means any payment other than— (a) a royalty; or (b) a payment made to the non-resident contractor by or on behalf of a person who is not associated with the contractor to reimburse costs incurred by the contractor; or (c) a payment referred to in schedule 4, part E (Rates of tax for schedular payments) Note: A royalty in the definition of “contract payment” is defined in section CC 9(2) and (3). 77. Section YA 1 also contains a definition of a “non resident entertainer”. non-resident entertainer is defined in section CW 20(4) (Amounts derived by visiting entertainers including sportspersons) for the purposes of that section, and in the PAYE rules, means a person who— (a) is not resident in New Zealand under subpart YD (Residence and source in New Zealand); and (b) undertakes a Part F activity (c) Repealed. Withholding rates found in Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 78.

(2) Before the person receives the schedular payment, they must notify the person making the payment of the applicable schedular tax code. (3) The notification referred to in subsection (2) must be in a form authorised by the Commissioner. 81.

Section 141AA of the TAA provides for a specific shortfall penalty in respect of schedular payments that are contract payments to non-resident contractors where the non-resident contractor is not liable to pay tax on the payment, whether because of a DTA or otherwise. 22 141AA Shortfall penalty if non-resident contractor relieved from all liability to pay tax on contract payment (1) If a person makes a schedular payment that is a contract payment to a person who is a non-resident contractor and the non-resident contractor is not liable to pay income tax on the contract payment, whether because of a double tax agreement or otherwise, the person who makes the contract payment to the non-resident contractor is liable to pay a shortfall penalty of $250 for each return period— (a) for which the person is required to deliver to the Commissioner an employer monthly schedule; and (b) in which the person fails to withhold an amount of tax that is required from a contract payment to the non-resident contractor. (2) A person who is liable to pay a shortfall penalty under subsection (1) is not liable to pay a shortfall penalty based on the tax shortfall that, but for this section, would be calculated under section 141 in relation to the amount of tax required to be withheld. (3) The liability under subsection (1) of a person is limited to a total of $1,000 for each return period for which the person is required to deliver to the Commissioner an employer monthly schedule. Note: If section 141AA of the TAA does not apply in respect of the tax shortfall, then section 141 of the TAA will apply. 84. Section 168(1) of the TAA provides that in the case where tax has not been withheld, the tax owing constitutes a debt payable to the Commissioner by the payer of the PAYE income payment. Section 168(2) of the TAA provides that the Commissioner’s right to recover the deficient tax from the payer is in addition to the right to recover from the recipient in accordance with the PAYE rules. 168 Employer or PAYE intermediary failing to withhold or deduct tax or payments (1) Where an employer fails to withhold or deduct an amount of tax or combined tax and earner-related payment in accordance with the employer's obligations under the PAYE rules and, where applicable, section 115 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or section 285 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or section 221 of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001, the amount in respect of which default has been made shall constitute a debt payable by the employer to the Commissioner, and shall be deemed to have become due and payable to the Commissioner on the date on which under section RD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 the employer would have been required to pay to the Commissioner the tax or combined tax and earner-related payment. (2) The right of the Commissioner to recover from the employer the amount in respect of which default has been made shall be in addition to any right of the Commissioner to recover that amount from the employee under the PAYE rules; and nothing in those rules shall be construed as preventing the Commissioner from taking such steps as the Commissioner thinks fit to recover that amount from the employer and from the employee concurrently, or from recovering that amount wholly from the employer or from the employee or partly from the employer and partly from the employee. 23 Appendix Two: Flowchart for considering whether a payment is a schedular payment and any applicable withholding rate Is there a contract, agreement or an arrangement with a non-resident for which payment is made?

Is the payment a cost reimbursing payment made to a non associated person? Is the NRC eligible for relief under a DTA? Has the NRC been present in New Zealand for 92 days or less in any 12 month period? Is the total amount paid to the NRC for any 12 month period less than $15,000?

Interpretation Statement IS 10/05 DEPRECIATION – ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE AND LEASE TERMS All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”) unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. This Interpretation Statement addresses whether a lease term is a relevant factor in determining an item’s estimated useful life (“EUL”) for the purposes of setting a special depreciation rate. 2. The issue arises where the item to be depreciated by the taxpayer is owned by the taxpayer (or deemed to be owned by the taxpayer for the purposes of being entitled to depreciate the item), but is located in something leased where the taxpayer is the lessee. However, section EE 35(2) provides that special rates cannot be set for buildings, so the issue does not arise for those items that are part of a building. 3. The issue also arises where the item to be depreciated by the taxpayer is the item that is being leased and the taxpayer is either the lessee (in the case of a finance lease as defined in the ITA 2007) or the lessor (in the case of an operating lease). 4. In the above situations, the issue is whether taxpayers may get a special depreciation rate that is based on an EUL that is equal to the length of the lease. 5. It is concluded that the term of a lease is not a relevant factor in determining a special rate for an item of depreciable property under section 91AAG(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). 6. A special rate is determined by considering all factors that are relevant to the EUL, as defined in the ITA 2007. Section EE 63(1) defines EUL as the period over which an item of depreciable property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, taking into account the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence, and an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. 7. It is considered that “passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence” involves the consideration of deterioration, exhaustion, and external factors that cause the item to no longer be of use to any business. Therefore, an individual taxpayer’s decision to abandon or demolish the item at the end of a lease term is irrelevant when determining the EUL of an item. This interpretation of EUL is supported by the provisions in the ITA 2007 that relate to loss on disposal and finance leases. 1 Legislation 8. The following are the relevant sections from the ITA 2007. 9. Section EE 2 defines “own” for the purposes of owning depreciable property: EE 2 Nature of ownership of item Kinds of ownership (1) Own, for the ownership of depreciable property,— (a) means legal or equitable ownership; and (b) includes ownership of the kinds described in sections EE 3 to EE 5. Shared ownership (2) When more than 1 person owns an item of depreciable property, own means the interest that the person has in the item. 10. Sections EE 4 and EE 5 describe when a lessee is deemed to own a fixture or an improvement that is located on land that they are leasing: EE 4 Ownership of lessee’s improvements: lessee When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a lessee of land incurs expenditure during the period during which the land is leased to the lessee in erecting a fixture on the land or making an improvement to the land; and (b) the lessor owns the fixture or improvement. Ownership of fixture or improvement (2) The following apply to the ownership of the fixture or improvement: (a) in the period during which the land is leased to the lessee,— (i) the lessee is treated as owning the fixture or improvement; and (ii) the lessor is treated as not owning the fixture or improvement; and (iii) a person to whom the lessor disposes of the land during the period is treated as not owning the fixture or improvement; and (b) after the period during which the land is leased to the lessee,— (i) the lessor is treated as not owning the fixture or improvement, unless the lessor incurs a cost relating to it at the end of the period; and (ii) a person to whom the lessor disposes of the land during the period is treated as not owning the fixture or improvement. EE 5 Ownership of lessee’s improvements: other person When this section applies: first case 2 (1) This section applies when— (a) a lessee of land incurs expenditure during the term of the lease in erecting a fixture on the land or making an improvement to the land; and (b) the lessee has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the fixture or improvement; and (c) the lessee disposes of their interest in the lease to another person; and (d) the other person pays the lessee for the fixture or improvement. When this section applies: second case (2) This section also applies when— (a) a lessee of land has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for a fixture on the land, or an improvement to the land, that a previous lessee erected or made; and (b) the lessee disposes of their interest in the lease to another person; and (c) the other person pays the lessee for the fixture or improvement. Other person treated as owner (3) The other person is treated as owning the fixture or improvement from the time at which they pay the lessee for it. 11. Section EE 35 provides that a special rate is set under section 91AAG to 91AAJ of the TAA: EE 35 Special rate or provisional rate Rate set for item of depreciable property (1) A special rate or a provisional rate is set for an item of depreciable property under sections 91AAG to 91AAJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. No special rate for excluded depreciable property, special excluded depreciable property, or building (2) A special rate may not be set for an item of excluded depreciable property, an item of special excluded depreciable property, or a building. ... 12. Section EE 44 provides for when the loss on disposal provision (section EE 48(2)) applies. EE 44 Application of sections EE 48 to EE 52 When sections apply (1) Sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply when a person derives consideration from the disposal of an item or from an event involving an item, if— (a) the consideration is consideration of a kind described in section EE 45; and (b) either— (i) the item is an item of a kind described in section EE 46; or 3 (ii) the event is an event of a kind described in section EE 47. ... 13. Section EE 46 describes the items to which the loss on disposal provision applies. EE 46 Items for purposes of section EE 44 Items to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, an item of property to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply is an item of depreciable property that a person owns, including ⎯ (a) an item for which the person has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss they have had under section EE 33; and (b) an item to which section CZ 11 (Recovery of deductions for software acquired before 1 April 1993) applies. ... 14. Section EE 47 describes the events to which the loss on disposal provision applies: EE 47 Events for purposes of section EE 44 Events to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, this section describes the events to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply. Change of use or location of use (2) The first event is the change of use, or change of location of use, of an item of property, as a result of which a person is denied a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the next income year. The event is treated as occurring on the first day of the next income year. Loss or theft (3) The second event is the loss or theft of an item of property, if the item is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Irreparable damage (4) The third event is the irreparable damage of an item of property. ... Cessation of ownership under section EE 4 or EE 5 (8) The seventh event is the cessation of ownership of a fixture or improvement— (a) that a lessee is treated as having under section EE 4(2); or (b) that a person is treated as having under section EE 5(3).

Analysis 21. At issue is whether taxpayers may get a special depreciation rate that is based on an EUL that is equal to the length of a lease. This analysis sets out the situations in which the issue tends to arise. The analysis then looks at the process by which the Commissioner determines a special rate, and concludes that the process includes determining an item’s EUL. It is concluded that factors that the Commissioner takes into account when determining a special rate are those that are relevant to determining the item’s EUL. The definition of EUL is then analysed to determine whether a lease term is a factor the Commissioner should take into account when determining a special rate. It is concluded that the definition of EUL does not allow a lease term to be a factor the Commissioner is to take into account when determining a special rate. This interpretation of EUL is supported by the legislative provisions relating to loss on disposal and finance leases. 6 Situations where the lease term issue arises 22. The issue of whether the Commissioner may set a special depreciation rate for an item of depreciable property based on an EUL equal to the length of a lease to which the item is subject to, tends to arise in either of two situations: • The item to be depreciated by the taxpayer is owned by the taxpayer (or deemed to be owned by the taxpayer for the purposes of being entitled to depreciate the item) and is located in something leased where the taxpayer is the lessee. • The item to be depreciated by the taxpayer is the item that is being leased where the taxpayer is either the lessee (in the case of a finance lease as defined in the ITA 2007) or the lessor (in the case of an operating lease). 23. The above two situations exist because of the operation of the provisions in the ITA 2007 that relate to who is entitled to depreciate items of property. Section EE 1(2) provides that in order to claim depreciation, a person must own the item of depreciable property. “Own”, for the purposes of ownership of depreciable property is defined in sections EE 2 to EE 5. Section EE 2(1) provides that “own” means legal or equitable ownership. Section EE 2(2) provides that “own” includes ownership of the kind described in sections EE 4 and EE 5. 24. The first situation exists where a person legally owns an item that is located in something leased, or, under section EE 4 or section EE 5, is deemed to own an item that is located on leased land (being a fixture or an improvement that is not considered part of a building). 25. The second situation exists where the item is the leased item. Such situations typically would involve personal property leases where only the lessee is allowed a depreciation deduction on the item. The definition of “finance lease” in section YA 1 includes leases of items of personal property, if the term of the lease of the item is more than 75 percent of the EUL for that item. Where the lease must be treated as a finance lease, section FA 6 deems that a sale of the property has occurred at the date that the lease term starts, and section FA 8(1) deems the lessee as the owner of the property for the purposes of being allowed a depreciation deduction for the property under subpart EE. How a special rate is determined 26. Section EE 35(1) provides that a special rate or provisional rate is set under sections 91AAG to 91AAJ of the TAA. EE 35 Special rate or provisional rate Rate set for item of depreciable property (1) A special rate or a provisional rate is set for an item of depreciable property under sections 91AAG to 91AAJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. ... 27. Section 91AAG(1)(a) of the TAA provides that a person may apply to the Commissioner to set a special depreciation rate that is higher or lower 7 than the economic rate for the item, for the person to use for depreciating the item. 91AAG Determination on special rates and provisional rates (1) A person may apply, in writing, to the Commissioner for the issue of a determination allowing them to use for an item, for a specified income year or years,— (a) a special rate higher or lower than the economic rate set in a determination under section 91AAF; or ... Section 91AAG(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 28. Section 91AAG(2) of the TAA provides that when determining a special rate, the Commissioner may have regard to any factors that are relevant in determining the item’s EUL, including an estimate based on a depreciation method or valuer’s report, or a rate of depreciation that the person uses for the item for financial reporting purposes. 91AAG Determination on special rates and provisional rates ... (2) When determining whether or not to grant an application for a special rate or a provisional rate, the level of any such rate, and the income year or years to which it applies, the Commissioner may have regard to any factors that are relevant in determining the item's estimated useful life, including an estimate based on a depreciation method or on a valuer's report, or a rate of depreciation that the person uses for the item for financial reporting purposes. ... 29. Having regard to section 91AAG(2), the EUL is the key component in determining a special rate. It is considered that the financial reporting treatment or “any \[other\] factors” are to be taken into regard in determining the EUL, rather than as separate considerations in determining a special rate. 30. The background to section 91AAG(2) of the TAA indicates that this interpretation is correct. The predecessor to section 91AAG(2) was section EG 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section EG 10(2) provided that, in determining a special rate, the Commissioner must have regard to the basic economic rate formula set out in section EG 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and the rate of depreciation used by the taxpayer for financial reporting. The formula set out in section EG 4(3) included the EUL as a necessary factor in the equation. 31. As a result of the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004, section 91AAG(2) of the TAA replaced section EG 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 91AAG(2) was virtually the same as section EG 10(2) until the section was amended in 2005 by the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005. Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division discussed section 91AAG(2) in its commentary on the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which resulted in the 2005 amendment to that provision (Policy Advice Division, Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (Inland Revenue Department, Wellington, 2004) (at page 19)): At present, the basis on which the Commissioner will issue special tax depreciation rates requires taxpayers to identify, for example, the actual economic life of 8 depreciable property with a high degree of certainty. This has led to concerns that this basis is too rigid. That is, if actual economic life cannot be clearly ascertained, a special tax depreciation rate will generally not be allowed. The changes will allow the Commissioner greater flexibility in considering special tax depreciation rate applications if he is reasonably satisfied that, in the circumstances, the actual economic life of depreciable property differs significantly to the estimate of economic life used to prescribe the general tax depreciation rate (estimated useful life). This would include taking into account assessments of economic life based on valuers' reports and other available best estimates (for example, from different depreciation methods). However, the current legislation guiding the Commissioner on the factors that he may have regard to in this area is unclear. The changes are intended to clarify this. At present, in section \[91AAG(2)\] of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the formula in section EE 25(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the rate of depreciation (if any) that the person uses for financial reporting purposes. How this provision is meant to be interpreted is unclear because financial reporting depreciation rates can differ significantly from tax depreciation rates, simply because of the differences in the underlying formula used or even the method - for example, diminishing value versus straight-line. In such cases the more important piece of information is likely to be the estimate of useful life and how this is calculated. To that effect, section \[91AAG(2)\] is being amended to explicitly allow the Commissioner to have regard to any factors that are relevant in determining estimated useful life. This will include, as noted above, estimates from independent valuers. \[Emphasis added\] 32. The above commentary shows that the changes to section 91AAG(2) of the TAA appear to have been intended to clarify that the EUL of an item to which a special rate is sought should be determined on an assessment of a broad range of factors that provide a reasonable level of certainty, although it does not have to be an absolute certainty. Therefore, the section expresses that the relevant factors may include estimates. 33. The above commentary also emphasises that special rates are determined if the economic life of the particular item is expected to be different from the economic life estimated for the general economic depreciation rate applicable to items of the kind to which a special rate is sought. EUL is equated with economic life and is considered an important piece of information in considering a special rate. Therefore, the changes to section 91AAG(2) of the TAA also appear to have been intended to clarify that the EUL is the key component that must be considered when determining a special rate. This supports the view that the financial reporting treatment, estimates from valuers, and other factors are to be taken into regard if they are relevant to determining the item’s EUL, rather than as separate considerations in determining a special rate. Section 91AAG(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 34. Section 91AAG(3) of the TAA sets out the methods the Commissioner may use to determine a special depreciation rate. It is considered that section 91AAG(3) is consistent with the view that the Commissioner must include the item’s EUL as the key component in determining any special rate. 35. Section 91AAG(3) of the TAA provides that the Commissioner may set a special depreciation rate using a statutorily set formula or an alternative straight-line method. This ability to issue a special rate based on a straight-line method other than in accordance with the statutory formula was introduced as part of the amendments in the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005. 9 36. Before the 2005 amendments, section 91AAG(3) of the TAA provided that the Commissioner could issue a special depreciation rate after having regard to the factors in section 91AAG(2) of the TAA. Before the 2005 amendments, the factors in section 91AAG(2) were the economic rate formula set out in section EE 25(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the rate of depreciation used for financial reporting purposes. 37. The reason for the 2005 amendments to section 91AAG(3) of the TAA was discussed in the Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division 2004 commentary on the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (at page 20): Another concern is whether, under section \[91AAG(3)\], the Commissioner can prescribe a special tax depreciation rate that is not determined using the legislated diminishing value formula (the formula in EE 25(4)). This has implications when, for example, a taxpayer requests a straight-line rate to be calculated without reference to the diminishing value formula. Changes are therefore proposed to section \[91AAG(3)\] to allow the Commissioner to prescribe special tax depreciation rates using a straight-line method from the outset, instead of setting a diminishing value rate and then prescribing a straight-line equivalent. 38. Section 91AAG(3)(d) of the TAA provides for the alternative straight-line method, and section 91AAG(3)(a) to (cb) of the TAA provides for a statutory formula provided in section EE 27, section EE 28, section EE 30, or section EZ 23, which the Commissioner may use to determine a special rate: 91AAG Determination on special rates and provisional rates ... (3) The Commissioner may issue a determination setting a special rate using— (a) the formula in section EE 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007; or (b) the formula in section EE 28 of that Act; or (c) the formula in section EE 30 of that Act; or (cb) the formula in section EZ 23 of that Act; or (d) the straight-line method other than under paragraph (b). ... 39. Each formula contained in sections EE 27, EE 28, EE 30, and EZ 23 includes the EUL as a component. Therefore, a statutory formula, which includes the EUL, must be used to determine a special rate unless an alternative straight-line method is chosen. The straight-line method is defined in section EE 67 as: the method of calculating an amount of depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property by subtracting, in each income year, a constant percentage of the item’s cost, to its owner, from the item’s adjusted tax value 40. Whether the EUL must be used to determine a rate for an alternative straight-line method is unclear from the above definition of the straight- line method, and is not discussed in the above commentary on the amendment. However, as discussed above, section 91AAG(2) of the TAA appears to clarify that the EUL is the overriding factor that must be considered when determining a special rate. This effectively suggests that even though the EUL is not expressed as a requirement of calculating an amount of depreciation loss under the straight-line method defined in 10 section EE 67, in order to set a special rate the Commissioner must consider factors that are relevant in determining an item’s EUL. This implies that the Commissioner must include the item’s EUL as a component in determining any special rate. 41. Therefore, it is considered the correct interpretation is that in order to set a special rate, whether using a statutory formula or an alternative straight-line method, the Commissioner must consider factors that are relevant in determining the item’s EUL and must include the item’s EUL as a component in determining the special rate. This means the definition of EUL needs to be examined to determine whether a particular factor, such as a lease term, is relevant to determining the EUL required for setting special rates. Estimated useful life defined 42. Section EE 63(1) sets out the definition of EUL for an item of depreciable property, other than a copyright in a sound recording. This is the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, taking into account the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence, and an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. EE 63 Meaning of estimated useful life Meaning for item of depreciable property, except for copyright in sound recording (1) Estimated useful life, for an item of depreciable property, other than a copyright in a sound recording, means the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, taking into account— (a) the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence; and (b) an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. 43. The definition of EUL was introduced into section 107A of the Income Tax Act 1976 by section 2(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1993 as part of the then new depreciation regime. The definition introduced into the Income Tax Act 1976 is substantially the same as the definition in the ITA 2007. The definition introduced into the Income Tax Act 1976 states: “Estimated useful life” means, in respect of any depreciable property, the period over which such property might reasonably be expected to be useful in gaining or producing assessable income or in carrying on a business in New Zealand, having regard to such factors as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence and based upon an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance: 44. The Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (“Valabh Committee”) in a letter to the Government dated 14 November 1991 on the Committee’s recommendations for the new depreciation regime (introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1993), states that it is necessary to identify objective criteria for determining useful life (Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, Final Report of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (Consultative Committee, Wellington, 1992, Appendix A, point 6 “Definition of useful life”)): 11 \[The\] definition \[of EUL in the draft legislation\] reflects our view that the useful life of an asset for depreciation purposes is not the life for which an asset could technically be used, but the life for which it is or will be useful in the income earning process. It is necessary to identify relevant objective criteria for determining useful life such as physical deterioration, technical obsolescence, obsolescence due to market factors and the average length of time for which an asset is held for income- earning or business purposes. However it is necessary to note that it is the useful life of the asset which is the important criteria for determining depreciation rates, not necessarily the length of time for which it will be used by any particular taxpayer. This means that where an asset will be disposed of to another taxpayer for use by that taxpayer, the useful life of the asset needs to be calculated having regard to the entire period for which the asset will be used, not just the period for which the asset is first used by a taxpayer. \[Emphasis added\] 45. Earlier in the Valabh Committee’s letter (under point 4 “Schedular Versus Taxpayer-initiated Rate Setting”), the Committee recommended that individual taxpayers should be entitled to apply for a rate specific to their circumstances, although the same statutory criteria for determining useful life should be applied for setting all rates: We continue to hold the view that the Commissioner should set a schedule of tax depreciation rates, and that taxpayers should be able to apply for higher rates where appropriate. Whether rates are calculated at the Commissioner's initiative or as a consequence of a taxpayer's request the same statutory criteria (ie determination of useful life and estimated residual value) should be applied. However, although the same criteria for determining useful life and estimated residual value would be used it does not follow that the rate determined should be the same. Tax depreciation rates set by the Commissioner have to apply for all assets of a class and to all taxpayers who own such assets. Many taxpayers will lack the resources to determine accurately the tax depreciation rates applying to their assets. This means that there will inevitably be some inaccuracies in the rates set by the Commissioner when applied to individual taxpayers. We would expect that rates set as a consequence of application by taxpayers and using information in respect of their own circumstances would be considerably more accurate than those set by the Commissioner which need to have general application. \[Emphasis added\] 46. It appears that the Valabh Committee envisaged a depreciation regime that would allow taxpayers to obtain special rates that are based on the useful life of the item in the specific conditions that the item is being used in the taxpayer’s business. However, the useful life of an item is determined by an assessment of the item’s usefulness, in the specific conditions, to any business rather than its usefulness to a particular taxpayer. The Valabh Committee envisaged objective criteria for determining an item’s useful life. Criteria for determining an item’s estimated useful life 47. In the Valabh Committee’s letter to the Government dated 14 November 1991, the Committee envisaged objective criteria for determining an item’s useful life, such as “physical deterioration, technical obsolescence, obsolescence due to market factors and the average length of time for which an asset is held for income-earning or business purposes”. Criteria of “likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence” were written into the definition of EUL from its introduction in 1993. These criteria are now provided in the definition of EUL in the ITA 12 2007, which provides that the Commissioner is to take them into account when determining the EUL of an item. 48. It is interesting to note as a preliminary observation that the term “the passage of time” seems rather vague in respect of its meaning in relation to considering EUL. It appears that the Valabh Committee’s reference to “the average length of time for which an asset is held for income-earning or business purposes” may have been the basis for the term “passage of time”. However, even if that is so, it is considered that it does not add any meaning to the term in the context of what should be considered in determining an EUL. This is because the phrase “average length of time for which an asset is held for income-earning or business purposes” appears to be another way of describing EUL, which the criteria are supposed to establish. That is, that phrase describes the outcome, but does not assist with determining what is required to be considered in determining an EUL. 49. The criteria of “likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence” have remained in the definition of EUL, except that in the Income Tax Act 2004 the order was changed to “the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence”, and has remained in this order in the ITA 2007. There is no obvious reason for this change in order, and there appears to be no published background commentary on this. The meanings of these terms are discussed below, with “likely wear and tear”, “exhaustion”, and “obsolescence” discussed briefly before “passage of time”. Likely wear and tear 50. “Wear and tear” is defined in Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (6 th ed, LexisNexis New Zealand, Wellington, 2005) as the “deterioration or waste of any substance by the ordinary use of it”. Therefore, the period over which an item is likely to become fully deteriorated is relevant in determining an EUL. Exhaustion 51. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006) defines “exhaustion” as “the action or state of exhausting something or of being exhausted”, and defines “exhaust” as “tire out completely” and “use up (resources or reserves) completely”. It is considered that exhaustion in the definition of EUL means the using up of the item itself or the using up of things such as resources to cause an item to become useless. Therefore, exhaustion will be a consideration in determining an EUL for an item where after a period of time an item can no longer be used due to the item being functionally used up or deterioration of resources used by the item, or some external factor such as resources no longer available. To this degree, exhaustion has similarities with obsolescence in the definition of EUL. Obsolescence 52. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006) defines “obsolescent” as “becoming obsolete” with “obsolescence” included as a derivative word, and defines “obsolete” as “no longer produced or used; out of date”. 13 53. There are no New Zealand cases on the meaning of “obsolescence” in the context of the current depreciation provisions. However, the ordinary meaning of obsolescence has been considered in various cases (see: Para Handkerchief & Textiles (1964) Ltd v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,125; Anaconda Co v Property Tax Department of the State of New Mexico App 94 NM 202; 608 P2d 514 (1979); Real Estate-Land Title & Trust Co v United States, 309 US 13 (1940); and SS White Dental Manufacturing Co v United States 38 F Supp 301; 93 Ct CL 469 (1941)). These cases tend to show that the meaning of obsolescence in the context of the definition of EUL is as follows: • Obsolescence is the process whereby an item loses its economic usefulness through causes other than physical deterioration. It is a progressive reduction in the item’s ability to function in the business of the taxpayer, such that it will become useless, before the end of its “normal” useful life. • Obsolescence is where the uselessness arises from external forces that are generally outside the taxpayer’s control. • Obsolescence may exist where an item becomes outmoded by virtue of improved alternatives that make the item uneconomic or uncompetitive such that it must be replaced. However, obsolescence does not equate to something simply being suboptimal, or there simply being “better” or more modern alternatives. A substantial diminution in utility will be necessary, which (in the case of depreciable property used in business) would be likely to progressively contribute to the decline in business (due to the loss of the underlying item’s utility). • Obsolescence is not established by the abandonment or demolition of the item, or a decision to do so. The presence and impact of obsolescence must be determined having regard to the status of the item before its abandonment or demolition. 54. Therefore, obsolescence will be an objective consideration in determining an EUL for an item where after a period of time external factors have caused the item to become useless to any business, disregarding any decision by a particular taxpayer to abandon or demolish the item. Passage of time 55. The term “passage of time” seems vague. It is not defined as a term in any of the dictionaries referred to above. However, given the ordinary meaning of “passage” is “the action or process of moving” (Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006)), it is possible to infer that “passage of time” means simply movement through time. This however provides little guidance on how “passage of time” is to be taken into consideration when determining an EUL. It merely indicates that the elapse of time is a consideration, which is already obvious from the nature of EUL, being inherently something that is a unit of time (a “life”). 56. The statutory interpretation concept of noscitur a sociis provides that groups or lists of words should be read together and will take meaning from each other. Given the vagueness of the term “passage of time” in relation to how it relates to considering EUL, noscitur a sociis appears to 14 be an appropriate concept to apply in the interpretation of the phrase “passage of time”. Under this concept, the words “likely wear and tear”, “exhaustion”, and “obsolescence” would add some meaning to “passage of time”. As outlined above, “likely wear and tear” brings into consideration the deterioration normally expected of items during their use. “Exhaustion” brings into consideration deterioration of resources used by the item and external factors such as resources no longer available, which cause the item to no longer be of use. “Obsolescence” brings into consideration external factors that cause the item to become useless to any business, disregarding any decision by a particular taxpayer to abandon or demolish the item. Therefore, “passage of time” will take on a meaning that is consistent with the considerations of deterioration of the item and resources used by the item, and external factors, which cause the item to no longer be of use to any business. 57. The above conclusion indicates that it is not the mere passage of time that can be taken into account when determining an EUL. This means any argument that the EUL should be equal to a lease term based on the fact that time has elapsed, would not withstand the interpretation of “passage of time” based on the noscitur a sociis concept. That is, something more than the passing of time to the end of the lease must occur for the EUL to be equal to the length of the lease. Something more would have to be the occurrence of deterioration or some external factor that causes the item to no longer be of use to any business. This interpretation is consistent with the objective criteria the Valabh Committee envisaged for determining an item’s useful life. That is, the EUL of an item is determined by an assessment of the usefulness of the item being used in particular conditions, rather than necessarily the item’s usefulness to a particular taxpayer. 58. An argument may be that if “passage of time” is to be interpreted with the same meaning as “likely wear and tear”, “exhaustion”, or “obsolescence”, it would be unnecessary to include it in the list of criteria. The answer would appear to be that “likely wear and tear”, “exhaustion”, and “obsolescence” were not meant to be exhaustive, and instead were indicators of the kind of things to be taken into account. Such things would be of a kind that would cause the item to become no longer useful to any business. This interpretation follows closely the most descriptive part of the definition of EUL being; “the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income”. 59. It is also noted that there may be cases where items of property depreciate in value even when they are not used. In such cases, it may be considered that the passage of time would have some bearing on the item’s EUL. However, it is considered that it is the deterioration over time caused by the lack of use of an item (for example, a car left idle) or the possible obsolescence of an item (for example, machinery unique to a particular situation) that would be relevant to determining the EUL. 60. The above interpretation that “passage of time” takes its meaning from the other terms in the list is also supported by consideration of the purpose of the 1993 amendments to the depreciation provisions. The February 1993 officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Taxation Reform Bill (No 6) stated that one intention of the 1993 amendments was to establish legislative criteria for setting depreciation rates and require the Commissioner to follow the criteria. Therefore, it 15 seems that the definition of EUL was phrased so to secure the kind of deduction for taxpayers that already had been established under the earlier provisions (although previously subject to the Commissioner’s discretion). 61. Before the 1993 amendments, the depreciation provisions (sections 74 and 108) in the Income Tax Act 1976 provided the Commissioner with a discretion to allow a deduction for depreciation of an item where the depreciation was caused by “fair wear and tear or by the fact of the asset becoming obsolete or useless” and the “depreciation cannot be made good by repair”. Therefore, it seems the definition of EUL introduced by the 1993 amendments included some of the terms from the old depreciation provisions, as well as “exhaustion” and “passage of time”. This tends to indicate that, to secure the same kind of deduction as established under the pre-1993 provisions, the term “passage of time” would take its meaning from the other terms in the list, which were seemingly provided for in the pre 1993 provisions. 62. Therefore, the above analysis of the terms “passage of time”, “likely wear and tear”, “exhaustion”, and “obsolescence” tends to indicate that considerations of an item’s EUL are not open to the mere passing of time, and instead are restricted to considerations of deterioration, exhaustion, and external factors that cause an item to no longer be of use to any business. Interpretation of estimated useful life supported by other provisions Loss on disposal 63. A loss on disposal may be claimed under section EE 48(2). EE 48 Effect of disposal or event ... Amount of depreciation loss (2) For the purposes of section EE 44, if the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, the person has an amount of depreciation loss, for the income year in which the disposal or the event occurs, that is the amount by which the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on that date. ... 64. Section EE 44(1) provides for when the above loss on disposal provision, section EE 48(2), applies. Section EE 44(1) provides for cases where there has been a “disposal of an item” that is “of a kind described in section EE 46” or where there has been an “event involving an item” where the event is “of a kind described in section EE 47”. EE 44 Application of sections EE 48 to EE 52 When sections apply (1) Sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply when a person derives consideration from the disposal of an item or from an event involving an item, if— (a) the consideration is consideration of a kind described in section EE 45; and (b) either— 16 (i) the item is an item of a kind described in section EE 46; or (ii) the event is an event of a kind described in section EE 47. ... 65. The term “disposal” for depreciation purposes takes its meaning from paragraph (f) of the definition of “dispose” in section YA 1, which provides that the word “dispose” “for depreciable property, includes destroy, withdraw, or let lapse”. This definition is not exhaustive, so the term “disposal” for depreciation purposes also takes on its ordinary meaning. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed (revised), Oxford University Press, 2006) defines “disposal” as “the action or process of disposing” and “the sale of assets”, and “dispose” as “get rid of”. Therefore, it is considered that the term “disposal” for depreciation purposes is wide enough to cover the abandonment of property after a lease. 66. Items described in section EE 46(1) are generally items of depreciable property that a person owns. EE 46 Items for purposes of section EE 44 Items to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, an item of property to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply is an item of depreciable property that a person owns ... 67. As seen, the word “own” is defined for depreciation purposes in sections EE 2 to EE 5. Section EE 2 provides that “own” means legal or equitable ownership, and includes ownership described in sections EE 3 to EE 5. Therefore, a taxpayer who legally owns an item that is being used in a lease situation (such as an item located in something leased, or machinery hired out) can apply the loss on disposal provision to that item on any disposal that may occur as a result of the termination of the lease. Also, as discussed above, a person can “own” an item for depreciation purposes under sections EE 4 to EE 5 in specific leasing situations involving deemed lessee ownership of fixtures or improvements, as well as finance lease situations under section FA 8. Therefore, the loss on disposal provision may be applied to the disposal of depreciable property as a result of the termination of a lease. 68. Therefore, section EE 48 specifically provides for an allowable deduction for loss on disposal where disposal is determined by the taxpayer’s decision to abandon or otherwise dispose of an item, and can include specific circumstances to the taxpayer such as lease arrangements. This indicates that depreciation deductions in general (that is, without this specific loss on disposal provision) are meant to apply to the expected total useful life of an item to any business, without shortening the expected total useful life of the item due to a taxpayer’s decision to dispose of the item in the future (for example, at the end of a lease term). Therefore, it is considered this indicates EUL is the estimated usefulness of the item to any business, which is consistent with the interpretation of EUL discussed above. Finance leases 69. The definition of “finance lease” in section YA 1 includes leases of items of personal property, if the term of the lease of the item is more than 75 17 percent of the EUL for that item. Therefore, it is expressly envisaged in the legislation that the EULs of items will not necessarily coincide with lease terms. Although this inclusion in the definition of finance lease is not determinative, it is consistent with the view that lease terms do not determine EULs. 70. It appears the drafters of the definition of “finance lease” also held this view. The definition of finance lease has included this requirement (where the term of the lease is more that 75 percent of the EUL) since the Taxation (Accruals and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 introduced it into the Income Tax Act 1994. The definition of “specified lease”, which “finance lease” replaced, did not contain this provision. In the 1999 officials' report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on submissions on the Taxation (Accruals and Other Remedial Matters) Bill, the above EUL requirement provided in the definition of “finance lease” was briefly discussed (at page 34): We also recommend that “estimated useful life” be linked to the estimated useful life as determined by the Commissioner when setting depreciation rates. Otherwise taxpayers could inappropriately determine their own “estimated useful life” for leased assets under the finance lease rules. 71. The above statement, which says it would be inappropriate for taxpayers to determine their own EUL for a leased asset under the finance lease rules, also tends to indicate that EULs are not determined by lease terms. This is also consistent with the above view that an individual taxpayer’s decision to abandon or demolish the item is an irrelevant consideration when determining an EUL. Lease terms and factors relevant to determining an estimated useful life 72. The EUL is defined in section EE 63(1) as the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, taking into account the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence, and an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. 73. The consideration of “likely wear and tear” indicates that the period over which an item is likely to become fully deteriorated is relevant in determining an EUL. It is considered that the term of a lease does not, by itself, indicate that an item will be fully deteriorated by the end of the lease. The item may still be in reasonable condition for another business to be able to use the item after the particular business has ended the lease. 74. The consideration of “exhaustion” indicates that exhaustion will exist for an item after a period of time where an item can no longer be used due to the item being functionally used up or deterioration of resources used by the item, or some external influence such as resources being used up. It is considered that the term of a lease does not, by itself, indicate that an item will be exhausted by the end of the lease. Other businesses may be able to use the item after the particular business has ended the lease. 75. The consideration of “obsolescence” indicates that obsolescence will exist for an item after a period of time where external factors have caused the item to become useless to any business, disregarding any decision by a particular taxpayer to abandon or demolish the item. There may be 18 situations where the taxpayer will use an item only during the term of a lease. However, it is considered that the term of the lease does not, by itself, indicate that something is obsolete by the end of the lease. As indicated above, the mere abandonment or demolition of an item does not constitute obsolescence. Other businesses may be able to use the item (but for the demolition), or wish to use the item, after the particular business has ended the lease. It is acknowledged that some items may be specifically designed for a particular situation and have no use beyond that situation, to which a lease term may coincide. In such cases, it is the termination of the situation that causes the item to be obsolete, rather than the coincidental end of the lease term. 76. The consideration of “passage of time” does not mean the mere passage of time will determine an EUL. It is considered that an EUL should not be determined to be equal to a lease term based merely on the fact that time has elapsed. It is considered that something more than the passing of time to the end of the lease must occur for the EUL to be equal to the length of the lease. Something more would have to be the occurrence of deterioration, exhaustion, or some external factor that causes the item to no longer be of use to any business. 77. Therefore, the analysis of the terms “passage of time”, “likely wear and tear”, “exhaustion”, and “obsolescence” indicates that lease terms are not consistent with any of the considerations that are to be taken into account in determining the EUL. This means that under section 91AAG(2), a lease term is not a relevant factor the Commissioner may have regard to when determining the EUL required for setting a special rate. Financial reporting 78. It is noted that section 91AAG(2) provides that the rate of depreciation that the person uses for the item for financial reporting purposes may be included as a relevant factor the Commissioner may have regard to when determining the EUL for the item. However, it is considered that the rate used for financial reporting purposes will not always be a relevant factor for determining an EUL. 79. New Zealand International Accounting Standard 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, states (at paragraph 50) that the “depreciable amount of an asset shall be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life”, and, of particular relevance, that legal or similar limits on the use of an asset, such as related leases, are factors in determining the useful life of an asset (at paragraph 56). Therefore, it appears that for financial reporting purposes lease terms are considered relevant to determining the “useful life” over which an item is to be depreciated, which conflicts with the above conclusion in relation to EUL. 80. New Zealand International Accounting Standard 16 states (at paragraph 57) that the “useful life of an asset is defined in terms of the asset’s expected utility to the entity” and that the “useful life of the asset may be shorter than its economic life”. In contrast, and discussed above, EUL is equated to an estimate of economic life and considered in terms of usefulness of the item to any entity, rather than usefulness to one particular entity. This is the case for any tax depreciation rate including special rates. Therefore, in the context of a lease situation, the “useful life” on which the rate of depreciation for financial reporting is based, will not necessarily be relevant to determining the EUL for the tax depreciation 19 rate. A “useful life” based on the term of a lease would not be consistent with the interpretation of the definition of EUL considered to be the correct interpretation. 81. Therefore, although section 91AAG(2) of the TAA provides that an estimate based on a depreciation method or on a valuer's report, or a rate of depreciation for financial reporting purposes may be relevant factors in considering an EUL for a special rate, such factors would be relevant only if they are consistent with the view of EUL being the estimated economic life or usefulness of the item to any business. Conclusion 82. It is concluded that the EUL is a necessary component in determining a special rate, and factors relevant to determining the EUL are the relevant factors the Commissioner may take into account when determining a special rate. The EUL is considered to be the estimated useful life of an item to any business, where an individual taxpayer’s decision to abandon or demolish an item is irrelevant. It is concluded that the definition of EUL does not allow lease terms to be relevant factors for the Commissioner to take into account when determining a special rate, because they are not consistent with the criteria for considering EUL. Therefore, the Commissioner cannot issue a special rate that is based on an EUL that has been determined by the length of a lease to which the item is subject. 83. There may be cases where the EUL coincides with the lease term. However, in such cases the EUL will not have been determined by the length of a lease. In all cases the EUL will be determined by reference to the applicable criteria, being “passage of time”, “likely wear and tear”, “exhaustion”, and “obsolescence”. It is considered that these criteria are restricted to considerations of deterioration, exhaustion, and external factors that cause an item to no longer be of use to any business. Examples 84. The following examples illustrate situations in which the issue arises as to whether taxpayers may get a special depreciation rate based on an EUL that is equal to the length of the lease. Example 1 85. The taxpayer is a lessee of an office and has purchased non-load-bearing partitions for the office. (This example assumes that the partitions are not part of the building. If they are part of the building then a special rate cannot be set for them as section EE 35(2) provides that a special rate cannot be set for buildings.) The taxpayer seeks an EUL for a special rate for the partitions equal to the length of the lease of the office, which is 10 years. The general economic depreciation rate for non-load-bearing partitions is based on an EUL of 20 years. 86. The Commissioner will not set a special rate for the partitions based on an EUL that is determined by the length of the lease. At the end of the lease, although the taxpayer may no longer use the partitions, the partitions would not necessarily be useless (but for any demolition at the end of the lease). 20 21 87. It is acknowledged that there may be factors that could cause the partitions to no longer be of use to any business after 10 years as a result of deterioration or external factors. However, a lease term is not such a factor, so is not considered a relevant factor in determining the EUL of the partitions. Example 2 88. The taxpayer is a lessee of a mobile crane and seeks an EUL for a special rate for the mobile crane equal to the term of the lease, which is five years. (The lessee will be entitled to depreciation deductions on the crane if the lease is a “finance lease” as defined in the ITA 2007.) The general economic depreciation rate for mobile cranes is based on an EUL of 15.5 years. 89. The Commissioner will not set a special rate for the mobile crane based on an EUL that is determined by the length of the lease. At the end of the lease, although the taxpayer would no longer use the crane, the crane would not necessarily be useless. 90. It is acknowledged that there may be factors that could cause the crane to no longer be of use to any business after five years as a result of deterioration or external factors. However, a lease term is not such a factor, so is not considered a relevant factor in determining its EUL.
Interpretation Statement IS 10/06 DEDUCTIBILITY OF BUSINESS RELOCATION COSTS 1. This Interpretation Statement considers the deductibility of business relocation expenditure incurred when a business relocates from one location to another location within New Zealand. 2. The Commissioner has previously published two policy statements on the deductibility of business relocation expenditure: “Costs allowable when moving business”, Public Information Bulletin 51 (September 1969), p 8, and “Setting up or moving a business—what costs may be allowed”, Public Information Bulletin 64 (October 1971), p 6. The content in those two items that relate to the deductibility of business relocation costs does not reflect the Commissioner’s current view of the law, so, to that extent, the items have been withdrawn effective from the beginning of the 2010/11 income year and taxpayers taking a taxpayer's tax position after that date should not rely on the items in Public Information Bulletin 51 or Public Information Bulletin 64. 3. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. The relevant legislation is at the end of the Interpretation Statement. Scope of this statement 4. When a business relocates within New Zealand, a business may incur a broad range of costs, costs associated with the premises being vacated, costs associated with physically moving the business and costs associated with preparing the new premises. 5. In this Interpretation Statement the Commissioner addresses the deductibility of business relocation expenditure incurred to physically move a business. That is, the costs associated with physically relocating business records, trading stock, employees, and items of depreciable property from the business’ existing location to its new location. In the Commissioner’s view the types of costs typically incurred to physically move a business (and those costs covered by this Interpretation Statement and referred to as “business relocation costs”) are:  packaging and packing/unpacking costs;  freight costs;  temporary storage costs;  additional insurance premiums on cover acquired specifically for the move;  hire charges for the use of containers, forklifts and similar machinery to effect the relocation; and  expenditure on labour, in the form of salary or wages, or payments to contractors to effect the dismantling, relocation and re-assembly of property. 6. This Interpretation Statement does not consider the deductibility of any costs associated with vacating the old premises or preparing the new premises. In the Commissioner’s view these costs although also incurred on the relocation of a business can be different in nature to the business 1 relocation costs set out above. The deductibility of these other costs may be determined by applying specific provisions of the Act or if necessary, by applying the capital/revenue tests. Under either scenario, the outcome (that is, whether the costs are deductible) may be different from the outcome provided for business relocation costs under this Interpretation Statement. 7. For this reason the statement does not address losses on obsolete depreciable property or demolition costs. In the Commissioner’s view the depreciation provisions in subpart EE set out the circumstances in which a loss on disposal of an item of depreciable property (including through obsolescence) can be claimed. The Interpretation Statement does not cover building alteration costs or fit-out costs, except for the cost of any walls that may need to be temporarily removed to enable egress for property to be re-sited. 8. The Statement also does not consider the deductibility of lease termination or surrender payments, lessee re-instatement costs, any costs incurred in obtaining a new site (for example, the cost of obtaining any licence or other permit), legal costs, or other similar types of expenditure relating to the location itself. In the Commissioner’s view these costs are one-step removed from the cost of physically relocating business property and therefore are outside of the scope of the Interpretation Statement. 9. This statement does not apply to costs incurred when a business relocates from one country to another country. 10. Discussion in this statement regarding the relocation of business property or employees is confined to relocations of property or employees occurring as a result of a business relocation. The statement does not consider the deductibility of costs incurred in respect of individual relocations of employees or plant or equipment that may occur from time to time. 11. Where employees are relocated as part of a business relocation, the relocation costs covered by this statement are confined to costs (or allowances) that relate to the actual physical relocation of the employees and their personal moveable property, rather than any inducement or compensation-type payments made to employees for relocating. It is not the purpose of this statement to address the deductibility of all relocation allowances or reimbursing payments made to employees, as they are many and varied in nature. To that end, the employee relocation costs covered by this statement are limited to the cost to the business of:  transporting employees to the new location (for example, removal expenses), including the cost of an allowance paid to an employee to cover such costs; and  temporary accommodation for employees moved to a new business location, including the cost of an allowance paid to an employee to cover such costs. Summary 12. A business is entitled to claim a deduction for business relocation expenditure if the costs are deductible under the general permission in section DA 1(1), and if those costs are not excluded from deductibility by the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). 13. For convenience this statement considers the deductibility of business relocation expenditure collectively, rather than as a series of apportioned 2 amounts based on the type of underlying business property being relocated. In the Commissioner’s view, the business relocation costs covered by this statement will all be incurred for the same principal reason, on the occurrence of the same event, and therefore all fall to be treated in the same way for tax purposes. General permission 14. To qualify for a deduction under the general permission in section DA 1(1), the principal reason for relocating the business to a new location must bear a sufficient relationship and nexus to the carrying on of the business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. 15. The Commissioner expects most business relocations to satisfy the general permission. However, some business relocations may fail to have the necessary nexus and in those circumstances the relocation costs will not be deductible. Satisfying the general permission will be a question of fact in each case. Deductible business relocation expenditure 16. On balance, the Commissioner concludes that business relocation expenditure will be deductible where the principal purpose of the relocation is to maintain and preserve the existing structure of the business. The Commissioner does not consider that a move to new, and possibly larger, premises is necessarily expansionary (and therefore capital expenditure). Where the principal purpose of a relocation is merely to enable a business to carry on operating in much the same way as it did before the move, and not to extend or enlarge the structure of the business, then the capital limitation will not prevent a deduction. This will be the case even if the new premises are larger or if there is a possibility that the business may make profitability gains over time as a result of the relocation. The Commissioner does not consider that business relocations that are made to take account of the organic growth or decline of a business are made for the purpose of extending or enlarging the structure of the business. Capital limitation 17. The capital limitation in section DA 2(1) will deny a deduction for business relocation costs that satisfy the general permission but that are capital in nature. Business relocation costs that are incurred for the principal purpose of extending or enlarging the structure of a business will be capital in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, this situation will arise when the relocation of a business forms part of a plan or strategy to embark on a new type of business, to introduce new product lines or services, or that changes the structure of the business to enable it to operate in a new or different way. In those circumstances, where the relocation forms part of a plan that has the purpose or effect of enlarging the business structure (as distinct from enlarging the business premises or the business operations), the relocation costs will be more in the nature of “once and for all” expenditure and more akin to costs incurred when establishing a new business. Depreciation 18. If the capital limitation in section DA 2(1) denies a deduction for business relocation costs, those costs cannot be added to the cost base of an item of depreciable property, unless the relocation results in an alteration, extension, or repair of the item that increases the capital value of the item. This means that unless the relocation costs result in an “improvement” to 3 the item of depreciable property being relocated (as defined in section EE 67) no depreciation loss will be available under subpart EE in respect of those relocation costs. Analysis General permission 19. The approach for determining whether business relocation expenditure is deductible is first to consider the general permission provision in section DA 1. Section DA 1(1) provides the general permission for a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred in gaining or producing the taxpayer’s assessable income or excluded income or a combination of both (section DA 1(1)(a)), or is incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s assessable income or excluded income or a combination of both (section DA 1(1)(b)). Nexus with income 20. The essential feature of section DA 1(1) is the requirement of a statutory nexus between the expenditure and the assessable income or the carrying on of a business by the taxpayer claiming the deduction. 21. The leading cases on deductibility under earlier income tax legislation are CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. In both cases, the Court of Appeal highlighted the requirement for a statutory nexus to exist between the expenditure incurred and the assessable income or carrying on of a business of the taxpayer in order for the expenditure to be deductible. The Commissioner considers these decisions remain relevant to the interpretation of section DA 1(1). Earlier provisions that correspond to section DA 1(1)(b) referred to “expenditure necessarily incurred in carrying on a business”. Section DA 1 preserves that requirement for nexus, notwithstanding that it has removed the word “necessarily”. It is the Commissioner’s considered view that the word “necessarily” did no more than indicate a requirement that there be a sufficient degree of connection between the expenditure and the business. 22. Therefore, in order to claim a deduction under section DA 1(1)(b) for expenditure incurred when relocating a business, a sufficient nexus must exist between the expenditure incurred in relocating the business and the assessable income or the carrying on of a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction. In every case, this will be a question of fact. Example where a sufficient nexus has been established 23. An example of a business relocation case where a sufficient nexus was established is the Australian decision Lister Blackstone Pty Ltd v FCT 76 ATC 4,285. Australia has the same nexus requirement for deductibility as New Zealand. 24. In Lister Blackstone, the taxpayer company rented work and office space that had become too small for the size of the business operations. It acquired new premises and moved the whole of its business operations. The main deduction sought was for the cost of moving trading stock from the old premises to the new. This cost was made up of labour costs, freight charges, the hire of a forklift truck, and certain travelling expenses. Both casual and permanent employees provided the labour, and the time spent 4 by them in the removal of the stock was calculated in relation to their salary and wages. 25. The company claimed that the costs incurred were part of the normal expenditure related to the carrying on of the business. This was accepted by each of the courts that heard the case. In the High Court (FCT v Lister Blackstone Pty Ltd 75 ATC 4,165) Sheppard J held that the expenditure was necessarily incurred because the prime reasons for the move were the need to:  have more space;  avoid having to use the premises jointly with the lessor; and  be able to conduct all the company’s operations from one set of premises If the company were to remain efficient and to continue to trade to the utmost advantage, the necessary consequence was that it had to move. 26. The court was satisfied that the taxpayer had established, in fact, that a sufficient nexus existed between the expenditure incurred in relocating the business and the carrying on of the business for the purpose of deriving assessable income of the taxpayer. 27. In the Commissioner’s view, most business relocations are likely to have a sufficient nexus between the expenditure incurred in relocating the business and the carrying on of the business for the purpose of deriving assessable income of the taxpayer. However, it remains that where a taxpayer is unable to establish a sufficient nexus with assessable income that a deduction will not be available. Example where nexus test may not be established 28. A sufficient nexus may not be established where a business relocates for reasons unrelated to the carrying on of the business. This might be the case where the principal reason for a business relocating is say, for the convenience of an owner or a shareholder. For example, the nexus test may not be satisfied if a business relocates for the principal reason of being closer to the owner’s home. 29. Likewise, where a business relocation occurs for reasons relating to a change in ownership of the business (for example, a change in shareholding) rather than for reasons relating to the carrying on of the business, the necessary nexus may not be established. The reason for the relocation must relate to the carrying on of the business. 30. The Commissioner acknowledges that in seeking to establish whether a sufficient nexus exists the inquiry is focussed in an objective manner on what the relocation was designed to effect. The object of the expenditure is ascertained by looking not at the actual thing achieved but at the need or occasion giving rise to the expenditure. This will involve identifying the principal reason for the move and what the business is seeking to achieve by relocating. The reason or need for relocating a business will be a question of fact. The taxpayer’s motive is relevant but only in so far as it may provide evidence of what the payment was designed to effect. Capital limitation 31. Having concluded that prima facie a deduction is available under the general permission (section DA 1(1)), the next step is to determine whether the capital limitation in section DA 2(1) applies to deny a deduction for the business relocation costs. 5 32. On the face of it, business relocation expenditure may appear to be capital in nature; given that it relates to the premises of a business, which arguably form part of the business structure, and the fact most businesses do not move premises on a regular basis. However, balanced against this is the fact that a business relocation is often triggered by the occurrence of an ordinary commercial event such as the expiry of a lease, the natural growth of a business as it prospers, or the contraction of a business during tougher economic times. Relocations occurring as a result of such occurrences do not necessarily result in a business expanding or enlarging its business structure or gaining any advantages of enduring benefit over and above mere efficiency or profitability gains achieved through continued trading over time. 33. Therefore, to decide whether the capital limitation applies to deny a deduction for business relocation expenditure it is necessary to consider the various tests the courts have formulated for determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. Before applying those tests, it is necessary to clarify the approach to be taken when applying those tests in the context of business relocation expenditure. Approach to applying the capital/revenue tests to business relocation costs 34. In the Commissioner’s view, the best approach for determining whether the capital limitation applies to deny a deduction for business relocation costs, is to consider the business relocation costs identified in the Interpretation Statement as costs all incurred for the same reason and on the same occasion, regardless of the type of underlying business property being relocated. 35. The alternative approach is to apply the capital/revenue tests to the apportioned relocation costs associated with each underlying type of property being relocated. In the Commissioner’s view such an approach is burdensome from a compliance-perspective, artificial and risks the overall reality of a relocation being overlooked in favour of a narrower application of the tests influenced by the type of property being relocated. This in turn could lead to the unsatisfactory application of the capital/revenue tests. 36. The approach outlined in this Interpretation Statement is consistent with that adopted by the United Kingdom’s HM Customs & Revenue. Although it has been suggested that some statements in HM Customs & Revenue’s manuals on the deductibility of relocation expenses could be taken as differing from this approach, the Commissioner understands that, notwithstanding those brief statements, HM Customs & Revenue adopts an approach that is consistent with the Commissioner’s approach in this statement. 37. In particular, it is understood that in the United Kingdom most relocation costs are allowable on first principles because they are revenue in nature, being the ordinary costs of managing and looking after the business. However, HM Customs & Revenue makes a distinction between ordinary business operations where the relocation is to enable the business to operate in as efficient a manner as possible and a relocation that is part of an expansion programme. Where a relocation is part of an expansion programme, then it is understood that HM Customs & Revenue treats the whole cost as coloured with a capital character (not just the expenditure associated with the plant or machinery). In those circumstances, there is no deduction for the costs on first principles. However, capital allowances may be available in respect of the cost of relocating plant and machinery. 6 38. In contrast, the Australian courts have taken a narrower approach to relocation costs. The full High Court of Australia in Lister Blackstone considered the deductibility of the cost of relocating trading stock separately from the cost of relocating fixed assets. The Australian legislation specifically recognises relocation costs in respect of fixed assets as being a “second element of cost” for depreciation purposes, so supports and requires the apportionment of relocation costs by reference to the type of property being relocated. That is, the court in Lister Blackstone simply followed the approach already contemplated by the Australian legislation. 39. New Zealand’s legislation is different, and, in the Commissioner’s view, our depreciation rules do not contemplate relocation costs being an addition to the cost base of items of depreciable property. (The reasons for this view are discussed further in paragraphs 126–133.) The New Zealand legislation ( u nlike the corresponding Australian legislation) does not support or require apportionment of relocation expenses by reference to the type of property being relocated. Therefore, the decision in Lister Blackstone, while relevant and useful in some regards, can be distinguished in New Zealand as authority for an apportionment approach to the deductibility of relocation costs. 40. In the Commissioner’s view, the better approach is to treat business relocation costs as being incurred for the same reason and on the same occasion, regardless of the type of property being relocated. This approach is also preferred from a practical viewpoint, as in many cases businesses will not distinguish between the cost of relocating its trading stock, assets or business records. It seems artificial and onerous in a compliance sense to require businesses to apportion their relocation costs according to the types of underlying property being relocated before applying the capital/revenue tests. General principles 41. The authoritative tests in New Zealand for determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature are derived from the Australian decision Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337. In Sun Newspapers Dixon J described (at page 359) the distinction between expenditure on capital account and expenditure on revenue account as: \[corresponding\] with the distinction between the business entity, structure, or organisation set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss. 42. Dixon J also identified three matters to be considered (at page 363):  a consideration of the character of the advantage sought (and in this its lasting qualities may play a part);  the manner in which the advantage is to be used, relied on or enjoyed (and in this and under the previous point recurrence may play its part); and  the means adopted to obtain the advantage, that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure further use or enjoyment. 43. The matters referred to in Sun Newspapers were adopted by the Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 1 and followed in New Zealand in CIR v L D Nathan & Co Ltd (1972) NZLR 209, Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271, CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 7 5,233, Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206, and Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. 44. The courts have extracted various indicia from these cases, and have identified seven tests to assist in determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature:  The need or occasion that calls for the expenditure: This test focuses on the principal reason or need for incurring the expenditure. In the context of this test the object of the expenditure is ascertained by looking not at the actual thing achieved, but the reason or need for making the expenditure. Clear and accurate application of this test is important, because it will often form the basis for applying the other capital/revenue tests accurately.  Whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature: This test involves a consideration of whether the expenditure is recurrent or a once and for all payment. If the expenditure is recurrent and made to meet a continuous demand this suggests the payment is part of the cost of ordinary business operations and will be a revenue outlay, whilst capital expenditure is going to be spent once and for all.  Whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital: This test focuses on whether the source of the payment was from fixed or circulating capital, rather than whether the payment affects the fixed or circulating capital of the business in question. This test is not as useful as other tests in determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature because of the ease with which a taxpayer can choose between financing an asset from circulating capital and financing it from fixed capital, irrespective of the nature of the asset financed. This test has been questioned judicially: Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17, 017 and CIR v Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,834.  Whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset: This test indicates that expenditure will be on capital account where an asset of a capital nature has been acquired by the expenditure, and where money is spent on improving the asset or making it more advantageous.  Whether the expenditure is a once and for all payment producing assets or advantages that are of an enduring benefit: Under this test, expenditure will be regarded as capital where it brings into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business. This test combines aspects of the recurrence and identifiable asset tests. This test is one of the more relevant and persuasive tests for deciding whether expenditure is on capital or revenue account.  Whether the expenditure is on the business structure or business process: This test focuses on the distinction between expenditure on the business structure set up for the earning of profit, and expenditure on the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means o f re gular outlay. This test is also one of the more relevant and persuasive tests used to determine whether expenditure is on capital or revenue account.  What the treatment of the expenditure is according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting: The test of applying ordinary principles of commercial accounting to the expenditure, although of some assistance, is not usually determinative. It needs to be remembered that tax and accounting have different aims, and the treatment for one may differ from the treatment for the other. 8 While this test will often be used to support an approach that the other tests have come to, it is not a sufficiently conclusive test by itself to determine the issue of whether the expenditure is on capital or revenue account. Qualifications when considering and applying the capital/revenue tests 45. Many of the above indicia will overlap and some factors will carry more weight than others in given circumstances. Therefore, while these indicia are helpful as a starting point, it is necessary to make a final judgement as to whether the expenditure is capital or revenue in nature by analysing the facts as a whole and weighing up which factors carry the most weight in light of these facts. Generally, no case will be decided under one test, and some cases do not refer directly to any of the tests. 46. One of the leading New Zealand cases on the capital/revenue distinction is the Court of Appeal decision in McKenzies. The Court of Appeal endorsed the dicta of Pearce LJ in BP Australia. Richardson J stated (at page 5,236): In deciding whether expenditure is capital or income the approach generally favoured by the courts in recent years is exemplified in the following observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 244 at pp 264-265: The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances, some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features, which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: “depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and a business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process”. Per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other; but those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors, which may incline the scale in the particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken. 47. The Privy Council in CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991 espoused the same approach to capital/revenue questions described in Hallstroms Proprietary Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648 (per Dixon J), BP Australia, Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 (HL), British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1925\] All ER Rep 623, and McKenzies. 48. Other more recent New Zealand cases have taken a consistent approach to the cases discussed above. In Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,779, Ellis J endorsed the approach of the courts in BP Australia, Sun Newspapers, and McKenzies. On appeal (Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001) the Court of Appeal referred to the approach of BP Australia, Hallstroms, and British Insulated and Helsby. In addition, the Court of Appeal in Birkdale endorsed the approach of the Privy Council in Wattie and BP Australia. 9 49. The cases cited above have recognised that although past cases can be useful in assisting with the resolution of a new case, there are dangers involved in this approach. For example, Viscount Radcliffe in Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd \[1964\] 1 All ER 208, 212 (PC) said that it was almost unavoidable to argue from analogy when considering allocations of expenditure between capital and income accounts: Nevertheless, it has to be remembered that all these phrases, as, for instance, “enduring benefit” or “capital structure” are essentially descriptive rather than definitive, and, as each new case arises for adjudication and it is sought to reason by analogy from its facts to those of one previously decided, a court’s primary duty is to inquire how far a description that was both relevant and significant in one set of circumstances is either significant or relevant in those which are presently before it. 50. Notwithstanding these judicial expressions, it is true that case law analogies are sometimes the only way, or at least the safest way, to proceed: Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801. 51. Based on the comments made in the leading cases, the Commissioner considers that the next step to determine the nature of business relocation expenditure is to apply the tests set out by the courts, with judgement and common sense. Applying the capital/revenue tests Need or occasion test 52. The need or occasion test is an important test for determining the deductibility of business relocation costs. The outcome of this test can form the basis for applying some of the other capital/revenue tests effectively. In the context of this test, the object of the expenditure is ascertained by looking not at the actual thing achieved but the reason or need for making the expenditure. The reason or need for relocating a business will be a question of fact. 53. A business may relocate and incur relocation expenditure for more than one reason. In these situations, the taxpayer’s principal motivation must be determined. In Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206 Gallen J noted (at page 10,210): The judge in this case accepted that there might be more than one reason for making a payment but considered that the principal motivation was what in the end coloured the expenditure and determined its nature. I think he was right in that conclusion. It is consistent with the illustration given by Lord Donovan \[in IRC v Land Securities Investment Trust Ltd (1969) 2 All ER 430, 433\]. On this basis, the need or occasion which covers the nature of the payment was a capital expenditure and did not cease to be one merely because there was an additional but secondary motive which had it stood alone or been the principal motive, would have allowed the payments to be deductible. 54. It is important when discerning the reason or need for a business relocation to take a view that is sufficiently wide so as not to ignore the reality of the situation. Taking a narrow view may result in the essential nature of the payment being wrongly determined. 55. In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Carron Company (1966–1969) 45 TC 18, the House of Lords held (at page 70) that expenditure incurred from changing the company’s charter was deductible because: the real value and purpose inherent in the alteration was to facilitate trading opportunities of the company. 56. Lord Reid said (at page 68): 10 In a case of this kind what matters is the nature of the advantage for which the money was spent ... Its true purpose was to facilitate trading. 57. To illustrate the difference between a wide view and a narrow view of the need or occasion for incurring business relocation expenditure, the Commissioner considers that the following descriptions of possible scenarios are examples of taking a wide view:  The business moved to larger premises to facilitate a planned expansion of the business into a new field of trading.  The business relocated so it could continue trading following the expiry of its lease.  The business relocated to a better location to improve its profitability.  The business relocated to cheaper premises as part of plan to reduce overheads to enable the business to continue trading in challenging economic times. 58. These examples consider the commercial reasons for the relocation rather than the mere fact that a relocation has occurred. In contrast, an example of a narrow view of the need or occasion for incurring business relocation expenditure might be “to maintain the taxpayer’s existing business structure”. Such a description provides no insight into the true purpose or commercial rationale for the relocation, making it no easier to determine whether the expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. 59. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, applying the need or occasion test when determining the deductibility of business relocation expenditure, helps clearly identify the principal reason for incurring the expenditure. When applying the test it is better to take a wide view of the circumstances giving rise to the relocation. In each case, the principal reason or need for the relocation will be a question of fact. Recurrence test 60. In general terms, the recurrence test involves determining whether expenditure is a recurrent expense or a once and for all payment. If the expenditure is recurrent this suggests it is part of the cost of ordinary business operations, so would be a revenue outlay. A once and for all payment suggests an outgoing of a capital nature. However, some one-off payments may be deductible, if they are the type of payment that might arise time and again over the duration of a business. 61. In W Nevill and Co Ltd v FCT (1937) 4 ATD 187, the full High Court of Australia held that a one-off amount paid to a retiring managing director was properly deductible. Rich J, when discussing whether the expenditure was recurrent or once and for all, said (at page 195) that the expenditure might be described as one-off in respect of the managing director level, but it was the sort of payment that would arise time and again for businesses with many employees. 62. Rich J focused on the fact that employing people is an ordinary incident of a company’s business and, presumably, this includes the necessity from time to time to pay money to remove employees. His Honour concluded that the payments were made genuinely in the course of business in the interests of the efficiency of the business. This was backed up by the facts where the court found the company believed abolishing the system of joint management would improve the company’s efficiency. 63. Dixon J believed that the payment was made for organising the staff and was part of a necessary expenditure of conducting the business. It was not 11 made for acquiring new plant or for any permanent improvement in the material or immaterial assets of the business. 64. In BP Australia Ltd v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 1 the Privy Council felt the taxpayer’s payment of trade ties to service station owners was recurrent, and a broad view should be taken of the general operation under which the expenditure was incurred. Their Lordships thought the payments were made to meet a continuous demand in trade and were prima facie matters connected with the ever-recurring question of a business’s marketing and its customers. 65. These cases demonstrate that in certain circumstances a once and for all payment will be deductible where it is made in response to an event that arises time and again in the course of carrying on a business. 66. This principle is reflected in the Australian decision Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd v FCT 94 ATC 4,499 where the full Federal Court held that a company was entitled to a deduction for costs associated with the removal and storage of major mining plant. The court stated (at page 4,504): If the nature of the activity of sand mining be considered for a moment, carried on as it is at successive locations where mineral sands exist, subject to interruption from time to time as deposits are exhausted, with a recurring possibility that a particular interruption may be lengthened by the lack of an immediately available fresh mining site, it is apparent that expenses of relocation, and on occasion also of temporary storage of the dredge and concentrator, are an inevitable part of the regular cost of the conduct of the business. 67. Associated Minerals is an example of a business relocating in response to an event that arises recurrently in the course of it carrying on its business. The decision supports a revenue classification of relocation expenses when relocations are recurrent. 68. Business relocation costs are a type of expenditure that arise for many businesses from time to time, and that in some cases may be recurring. If a business can demonstrate that relocation costs are an inevitable part of the regular cost of the conduct of the business, as in Associated Minerals, the test indicates that the costs will be more in the nature of revenue expenditure. 69. This leads the Commissioner to conclude that business relocation costs incurred as a result of a business lease expiring (or some other ordinary and reasonably predictable business event that can be expected to recur) may be more in the nature of recurring expenditure, and therefore deductible. On the other hand, relocation costs incurred as part of an event occurring outside the regular conduct of the business, for example, relocation costs incurred when an established business expands into a new field of trading, will be in the nature of once and for all expenditure, and therefore capital expenditure. 70. The Commissioner’s view is that such an interpretation reflects the commercial reality of many business relocations. Fixed or circulating capital test 71. In recent years the fixed or circulating capital test has not played an important part in determining whether expenditure is on capital or revenue account. This is because of the difficulties the courts have in applying the test consistently. As a result, some differences have evolved in how the test is defined, which in turn makes it even more difficult to apply (ie, whether the test is a use of funds test or a source of funds test). The use 12 of funds test determines whether the expenditure relates to the fixed or circulating capital of the business; the source of funds test determines whether the payment is made from fixed or circulating capital. 72. The source test has been criticised because it is very easy for a business to switch between financing an asset from circulating capital to financing it from fixed capital, irrespective of the nature of the asset being financed. Such substitution undermines, to an extent, the usefulness of the test. 73. The courts have concluded that the fixed or circulating capital test, in either of its forms, provides little benefit as an indicator of whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. 74. In Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017, Wild J stated that the fixed or circulating capital test was of little relevance. He considered the test provided no logical or reliable nexus to determine the character of the expenditure. Wild J stated (at page 17,025): The second test, described at p 219 in BP \[\[1965\] 3 All ER 209\], is whether the expenditure was from fixed or circulating capital. The two different forms of capital are described in BP. With all respect to the eminent economists and Judges who have propounded this test, I am unable to view it as compelling, or even useful. It is essentially a “source of funds” test. I cannot see any logical or reliable nexus between the source of moneys, and what they are spent on. It is well established that the character of expenditure (capital or revenue) by a payer taxpayer does not determine its character as a receipt in the hands of a payee taxpayer: Tasman Forestry Ltd v CIR \[1999\] 3 NZLR 129; (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA) at p 137; p 15,154. Although the moneys here are within a single taxpayer’s business, the position seems to me analogous. Thus, where the moneys came from is no reliable guide in determining the nature of their expenditure. Here, both Mr Reeves, General Manager, Finance, of Milburn, and Professor Trow, who gave expert accounting evidence for the taxpayers, said that the payments were from circulating rather than fixed capital. That points to the expenditure being of a revenue character. But it is also indicative of the long and soundly established nature of the business of both taxpayers. Mr Frankham shared my misgivings as to the relevance of this test, at least in 2001. I prefer to disregard this test and wonder whether it might not be given a quiet burial? \[Emphasis added\] 75. In CIR v Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,834, Baragwanath J supported the approach taken in Milburn. When considering the application of the approach, he commented (at page 18,841): A fifth \[test\] of whether the expenditure is from fixed or circulating capital – has proved difficult to apply: see BP Australia \[\[1965\] 3 All ER 209\] at 269 and Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017, at 17,025-17,026 para 48 per Wild J. The abandonment of the concept of nominal capital by the Companies Act 1993 points to the unreality of treating the source of funds as a significant guide to whether for tax purposes the acquisition is to be treated as on capital or revenue account. As Richardson J indicated in CIR v McKenzies (NZ) Ltd \[1988\] 2 NZLR 736, 746, the classification of the items in respect of which the payment is made is likely to be critical. What matters is rather the purpose of the expenditure than its source. \[Emphasis added\] 76. Following the approach outlined above, the Commissioner considers that the fixed or circulating capital test is of little relevance when determining the deductibility of business relocation expenditure. Therefore, the Commissioner places little weight on this test. Identifiable asset test 77. The identifiable asset test requires that there be an acquisition of a capital asset, a disposition of an onerous asset, or a modification to an existing asset to improve it or make it more advantageous for a payment to be 13 capital in nature. If there is no resulting identifiable asset, the payment is more likely to be of a revenue nature. 78. In many circumstances, the property and employees of a business will be relocated without any new identifiable asset being created or any capital asset being improved. The identifiable asset test may be satisfied where a business relocation results in a significant and contemporaneous increase in business goodwill (for example, if a relocation is part of a plan to acquire or enter into a new field of trading or to merge with another business that results in the addition of a new customer base). In those cases, where the addition of a new asset can be identified as an effect of incurring the relocation expenditure, then the relocation costs would tend to be capital in nature. However, if the incurring of the relocation expenditure merely has the effect of gradually increasing the business’ profitability over time (for example, gains attributable to operating from an enhanced trading location) or improving operating efficiency (for example, lower overheads as a result of operating from cheaper premises) it is difficult to identify an asset that has been acquired or improved in a capital sense. In these circumstances the Commissioner considers that test indicates the business relocation expenditure is not capital expenditure. 79. This Interpretation Statement is only considering the deductibility of business relocation costs relating to the physical relocation of a business. The Interpretation Statement is not considering the deductibility of costs associated with the old or new premises, for example, any lease payments or fit out costs. 80. Lord Wilberforce in Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801 said that the identifiable asset test meant that money spent on the acquisition of an asset was capital expenditure. Money spent on getting rid of a disadvantageous asset was also capital expenditure, as was money spent on improving the asset or making it more advantageous. In Granada Motorway Services, a lump sum payment made to improve the terms of a lease was held to be capital. 81. Lord Wilberforce reiterated in Granada Motorway Services comments he had earlier made on the identifiable asset test in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Carron Company (1966–1969) 45 TC 18. Carron involved the deductibility of expenditure incurred to alter a company’s charter. In referring to Carron, Lord Wilberforce said (at page 805): There the expenditure was incurred in order to procure a modification of the company’s charter in such a way as to enable it to trade more properly and to facilitate day-to-day operations. This House held that the payment had a revenue character. Unless indeed it could be said that the charter was a capital asset, it is difficult to see what other decision could have been given. In the course of my opinion I used these words (1968 SC (HL) 47 at 65, 45 Tax Cas 18 at 75): ... the disposition of a source of liability may be equivalent to the acquisition of a source of profit—an extension perhaps of, but not an exception to, the principle that in some sense or other, an asset of a capital nature, tangible or intangible, positive or negative, must be shown to be acquired. If this is correct—and until a case arises which constitutes a true exception, I shall continue to think that it is—the present expenditure cannot be brought within the capital class. With due caution against using these words as if they were statutory, I adhere to them. They were, of course, directed to excluding cases where no capital asset could be 'seen' or identified, which was so in that case; I had not intended to narrow the conception of capital payments to the case of the acquisition of an asset. Clearly expenditure on a capital asset may fall within the principle. 14 82. There has been some criticism that too much emphasis was placed on the identifiable asset test in Carron and Granada Motorway Services. In McKenzies it was argued that the courts were seeking to elevate the identifiable asset test above the other capital/revenue tests, and in so doing the courts risked creating an artificial distinction between leases (which are treated as capital assets, as in Granada Motorway Services) and other contracts under which payments are made (such as the charter in Carron, which was held not to be a capital asset). However, Richardson J responded by saying (at page 5,241): In short, in some circumstances it is appropriate to give very great weight to the ready identification and classification of the item in respect of which the payment is made as itself being held on capital account. It is in that sense that we understand Lord Wilberforce in Granada Motorway Services to endorse the identifiable asset test, and no doubt it, too, will yield in special cases where there are sufficient indicators pointing the other way, ... 83. These comments are important when considering the weight that should be given to the identifiable asset test when deciding whether business relocation expenditure is capital. As there frequently will be no new or modified asset to be “seen” or “identified” as a result of incurring relocation expenditure, this situation is analogous to the situation in Carron. Applying Lord Wilberforce’s comments in Granada Motorway Services, failing the identifiable asset test creates a strong prima facie case for excluding relocation costs from being capital. As Richardson J notes in McKenzies, in some circumstances it is appropriate to give great weight to the identifiable asset test. 84. The Commissioner, therefore, considers that if no capital asset can be readily identified as being acquired as a result of incurring the relocation costs, the identifiable asset test will support the expenditure being revenue in nature. However, this test still remains to be balanced with the other capital/revenue tests. Enduring benefit test 85. The source of the enduring benefit test is acknowledged as the House of Lords decision in British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1925\] All ER Rep 623. It was in this case that Viscount Cave LC commented (at page 629): But when an expenditure is made, not entirely once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is a very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital. 86. In McKenzies, Richardson J endorsed the enduring benefit test and Viscount Cave LC’s well-known comment. He referred to Lord Wilberforce’s judgment in Granada Motorway Services and the explanation of enduring benefit given by Rowlatt J in Anglo-Persian Oil v Dale (Inspector of Taxes) (1929–1932) 16 TC 253. 87. Lord Wilberforce in Granada Motorway Services commented on Viscount Cave LC’s test (at page 804): many discussions start from the well-known phrase of Viscount Cave LC in British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton (\[1926\] AC 205 at 213, \[1925\] All ER Rep 623 at 629, 10 Tax Cas 155 at 192): “... when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade.” These words were regarded as having quasi-statutory force until, in a later case, it was revealed that they might cover an advance more of a revenue character. So Rowlatt J in Anglo-Persian Oil Co v Dale (Inspector of Taxes) ((1931) 16 Tax Cas 253 at 262) explained the phrase as meaning: 15 a benefit which endures, in the way that fixed capital endures; not a benefit that endures in the sense that for a good number of years it relieves you of a revenue payment. It means a thing which endures in the way that fixed capital endures. It is not always an actual asset, but it endures in the way that getting rid of a lease or getting rid of onerous capital assets ... endures. 88. Richardson J (in McKenzies) discussed Rowlatt J’s explanation of the meaning of enduring benefit in Anglo-Persian. Richardson J commented (at page 5,239): In Anglo-Persian Oil Co Ltd v Dale the payment was made in order to free the company from a long term agency agreement which had become onerous to the company. It was held to be deductible. Applying Lord Cave’s test the payment in question did not bring any asset into existence and could not properly be said to have brought into existence an advantage for the benefit of the company's trade within the meaning of that expression as used by Lord Cave. Two points about the decision should be noticed. The first is that the distinction between fixed and circulating capital reflected in the Staveley Coal and Iron Co Ltd case was expressly recognised, and the agency agreement in question was held not to be a fixed capital asset of the company. The second is that Rowlatt J at p 262 explained Lord Cave's phrase "for the enduring benefit of a trade" as meaning: a benefit which endures, in the way that fixed capital endures; not a benefit that endures in the sense that for a good number of years it relieves you of a revenue payment. It means a thing which endures in the way that fixed capital endures. It is not always an actual asset, but it endures in the way that getting rid of a lease or getting rid of onerous capital assets ... endures. On appeal in that case Romer LJ emphasised (at p 146) that the advantage need not be of a positive character: “The advantage may consist in the getting rid of an item of fixed capital that is of an onerous character, as was pointed out by this Court in Mallett v Staveley Coal & Iron Co”. \[Emphasis added\] 89. Lord Wilberforce also considered the enduring benefit test in the earlier decision of Carron. As noted above, that case centred on a dispute about the deductibility of expenditure incurred in relation to changing a company’s charter. Amendments to the charter were required to enable the company to increase its borrowings and alter the shareholding restrictions on voting partners. The House of Lords held that expenditure to modify the company’s charter was a revenue expense and an allowable deduction. 90. Initially, in the First Division (Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Carron Company 1967 SC 204), Lord Guthrie commented (at page 216) on the changes to the company’s charter: In the present case the fixed capital was left untouched. No tangible asset was created by the expenditure which could appear in its balance sheet. No new trading sphere was acquired ... Therefore, although an advantage was obtained by the expenditure in question, and although that advantage conferred enduring benefit upon the company, I am of the opinion that the special circumstances of this case lead to the conclusion that the advantage was not a capital asset ... 91. Carron was then appealed to the House of Lords, which upheld the decision of the First Division. Their Lordships acknowledged that an advantage will generally always flow from a business decision, and stressed that what was important was the nature of that advantage. They emphasised that the payment by Carron created no new asset, but simply enabled the company to carry on its day-to-day trading more efficiently. In this regard, Lord Reid stated (at page 68): Of course they obtained an advantage: companies do not spend money either on capital or income account unless they expect to obtain an advantage. And 16 money spent on income account, for example on durable repairs, may often yield an enduring advantage. In a case of this kind what matters is the nature of the advantage for which the money was spent. This money was spent to remove antiquated restrictions which were preventing profits from being earned. It created no new asset. It did not even open new fields of trading which had previously been closed to the company. Its true purpose was to facilitate trading ... 92. Lord Wilberforce similarly found that the changes to the Carron charter did produce an advantage, but an advantage of a revenue character. He noted (at page 75): It procured indeed an advantage – important and not of a transitory nature – but one essentially of a revenue character in that it enabled the management and conduct of the Company’s business to be carried on more efficiently. 93. In the context of the enduring benefit test, it is also interesting to consider Latham CJ’s comments in Hallstroms Proprietary Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 (at page 641) in relation to the deductibility of legal fees paid to defend a competitor’s action: In my opinion, the expenditure by the company was not made for the purpose of acquiring an asset or of adding to the profit-yielding subject which constituted the capital structure of the business but as Lord Hanworth MR said in Mitchell v B W Noble Ltd, the expenditure was made “not in order to secure an actual asset to the company but to enable them to continue, as they had in the past, to carry on” the same business, unfettered by a particular difficulty which had arisen in the course of the year. ... Nor can it be said that the company by making the expenditure gain “an enduring advantage”. It gained nothing – it merely succeeded in maintaining an existing position. \[Emphasis added\] 94. In the Commissioner’s view, these cases suggest that, although an advantage (even an enduring advantage) may arise from incurring expenditure, that advantage needs to secure something more than efficiency gains or the maintenance of an existing position for it to be capital expenditure. 95. Therefore, in the context of business relocation expenditure, the Commissioner concludes that where a business relocation is entered into to enable the business to carry on as usual, to preserve or maintain the current business, even with the potential of making profitability or efficiency gains over time, the enduring advantage gained is unlikely to be sufficient for the expenditure to be capital in nature. 96. On the other hand, the Commissioner concludes that where expenditure is incurred to relocate a business as part of an expansion or clear move by the business into a new field of trading or as part of a plan that changes the structure of the business to enable it to operate in a new or different way, then the enduring advantage arising from that move will be capital in nature and the relocation costs will not be deductible. 97. Notwithstanding these conclusions, in the Commissioner’s view, the enduring benefit test alone is not determinative in deciding whether this type of expenditure is deductible; the other capital/revenue tests need to be applied to determine the true nature of any enduring advantage. Business structure or business process test 98. The business structure or business process test, in the Commissioner’s view, considers the effect the expenditure has on the existing structure of the business or the reason for incurring the expenditure. The cases have variously described the effect as strengthening, maintaining, preserving, 17 extending, or enlarging the business structure. Where the effect of the expenditure is to maintain or preserve the business structure, the cases have found the expenditure is more revenue in nature. Where the effect of the expenditure is to strengthen, enlarge, or improve the business structure, the cases suggest the expenditure is more capital in nature. 99. The operation of this test is best illustrated by the cases. In Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337, Dixon J stated (at page 364) that: \[for expenditure to be capital\] in principle the transaction must be regarded as strengthening and preserving the business organisation or entity and affecting the capital structure. 100. Lawrence LJ stated in Anglo-Persian (at page 270) that: It follows that the Company by cancelling the agency agreement, and itself undertaking the future management of its business in Persia, neither enlarged the area of its operations, nor improved its goodwill, nor embarked upon a new enterprise; it merely effected a change in its business methods and internal organisation, leaving its fixed capital untouched. \[Emphasis added\] 101. In Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206, 10,211, Gallen J referred to the observations of Dixon J in Hallstroms when deciding whether expenditure on installation work of new assets was deductible, and noted: it was I think open to the Authority to conclude that the expense was directed principally to the acquisition of the means of production rather than the use of them; to establishing or extending a business organisation rather than carrying on the business. 102. In Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd v CIR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,716, the Court of Appeal confirmed (at page 19,722) that the addition of a new ferry contract would have been an addition to the capital structure, so the legal fees incurred in respect of that acquisition were capital: The third test referred to by Baragwanath J \[in the High Court\] was the distinction between the business structure, which is a capital item, and the ordinary process by which it is operated to obtain regular returns, which is a matter of revenue. The ferry contract would have constituted a major addition to the structure of Fuller’s business which it would operate to obtain regular returns from passenger fares. The objective was to secure monopoly rights which are capital in nature. 103. These cases demonstrate the approach the courts have taken to distinguishing expenditure that relates to the business structure from expenditure that relates to the business process. The courts look at the effect of the expenditure and consider whether the result affects the business structure or the business process. 104. It is the Commissioner’s view that on many occasions a business relocation will not make the business any more valuable or strengthen or extend the business structure. It is quite possible for a business to incur relocation costs, even when moving into larger or better premises, without necessarily expanding its business structure. 105. Likewise, a business relocation made to take account, or in contemplation, of organic growth occurring within a business (that is, growth arising from a prospering business), in the Commissioner’s view, may not signify an expansion or enlargement of the structure of the business. 106. Similarly, a business relocation made to take account of contractions in the operations of a business will not have the effect of enlarging or extending the business structure. Usually when a business downsizes, relocation costs will be incurred to preserve or maintain the business structure. This 18 is particularly so when the contractions are in response to declining market conditions. 107. Therefore, by way of illustration, under the business structure/business process test, relocation expenditure incurred on the occasion of a business relocation will be revenue in nature in the following circumstances:  The relocation is primarily undertaken in response to external factors (such as the expiry of a lease) and is not part of any planned expansion of the business structure, with the effect that the existing business continues operating unchanged but in a new location.  The relocation is part of a strategy to improve the profitability of existing business operations or to make efficiency gains within the existing business structure, but without expanding or enlarging the business’ structure. This could include a move to a better trading location to improve profitability.  The relocation is a response to organic changes within the business (for example, the natural growth of staff numbers as a business prospers). This could include a relocation in contemplation of such growth, where the growth is not the result of a planned expansion into some new field of trading or a particular business expansion strategy that involves changing the business structure.  The relocation is as a result of downsizing the business, possibly in response to changes in market conditions. This could include a move to smaller or cheaper premises to enable the business to continue operating. 108. For business relocation expenditure to be capital under the business process/business structure test, the business relocation must have the effect of strengthening, extending, or enlarging the business structure. The Commissioner considers that the structure of a business will be enlarged or extended when the relocation forms part of a plan or strategy:  to embark on a new type of business or enter into a new field of trading, including the introduction of a new and different product line or service; or  that changes the structure of the business to enable it to operate in a new or different way (for example, a switch from an exclusively home-based business to a single retail store or a business relocation involving major restructuring of the business so that the business is carried on in a significantly different way). 109. In many ways, relocation expenditure will be capital under this test when it is akin to expenditure incurred on the establishment of a new business. Ordinary principles of commercial accounting test 110. Ordinary principles of commercial accounting, while of some assistance, are not determinative in deciding whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. 111. The accounting treatment of relocation costs is that all relocation expenditure is expensed in full in the year it is incurred. The Commissioner will take this conclusion into account when balancing the capital/revenue tests a n d reaching a conclusion on the overall nature of relocation expenditure, but the accounting treatment is not determinative. 19 Balancing the capital/revenue tests 112. Having considered the general permission and each of the capital/revenue tests in the context of business relocation expenditure, the Commissioner considers that some clear indicia exist to assist in determining the deductibility of business relocation expenditure. 113. The indica can be summarised as follows:  It is important to determine the need or occasion for the relocation. The test should not be applied too narrowly, so that the true reality of the situation is not overlooked. Where there is more than one reason for incurring the relocation expenditure, the principal reason for the relocation needs to be identified. This will be a question of fact.  Relocation expenditure must first satisfy the general permission before the capital/revenue tests are applied. To qualify for a deduction under the general permission, the cost of relocating the business must bear a sufficient relationship to the carrying on of the business. This is irrespective of whether the business expands or contracts as a result of the relocation.  In some circumstances, relocations may be a recurrent incidence of carrying on business, and in those circumstances, support for treating relocation costs as deductible will be stronger. Where business relocations are not a recurrent incidence of carrying on business, and the relocation costs are more in the nature of once and for all expenditure, then that is indicative of the costs having more of a capital nature.  The fixed or circulating capital test is difficult to apply. Accordingly, little weight should be given to this test.  Usually, no new or modified asset will be “seen” or “identified” as a result of relocation expenditure being incurred.  If a relocation is principally for the purpose of maintaining or preserving an existing business, it is unlikely any advantage obtained will be of sufficiently enduring benefit for the costs to be treated as capital expenditure. On the other hand, if a business relocation is made as part of a plan to extend or enlarge the structure of the business, any resulting advantage is more likely to be of enduring benefit to the business.  In some circumstances a business relocation will have an effect on the structure of a business. Where the relocation forms part of a planned enlargement or extension of the business then the costs will be capital in nature. A move to larger premises or a move to take account of a natural increase in the size of the business are not necessarily indicative of an enlargement of the structure of the business.  The accounting treatment of relocation costs supports their being revenue in nature. 114. The cases require that these indicia be balanced in a commonsense way to determine, from a practical and business viewpoint, the true nature of the expenses for tax purposes. To this end, the Commissioner sets out his approach, based on the cases, for deciding whether business relocation expenditure is deductible:  The cost of relocat ing a business must have sufficient nexus to the carrying on of the business to satisfy the general permission in section DA 1. Where the reason for relocating is not sufficiently related to the carrying on of the business, the expenditure will not be 20 deductible. Where the nexus test is satisfied (and this will be the result in most cases), the question becomes whether the relocation costs are capital costs excluded from deductibility by the capital limitation.  Relocation costs will not be capital costs (and so will be deductible) where the principal need or occasion for the business relocation is to maintain and preserve the business, without extending or enlarging the existing structure of the business. The Commissioner does not consider that a move by a business to new, and possibly larger, premises is necessarily expansionary (and therefore capital expenditure). Similarly, the Commissioner does not consider business relocations made to take account of organic growth or contraction within an existing business to be made for the purpose of extending or enlarging the structure of the business.  The capital limitation will apply to prevent a deduction for relocation costs that satisfy the general permission only if the business relocation forms part of a plan or strategy to: - embark on a new field of business or introduce a new product line or service; or - change the structure of the business to enable it to operate in an new or different way (for example, a switch from an exclusively home-based business to a single retail store or a business relocation involving major restructuring of the business so that the business is carried on in a significantly different way); with the effect that the: - business structure (as distinct from the business premises or the business operations) is enlarged or extended by the relocation; and - relocation costs are more in the nature of once and for all expenditure and are akin to the costs incurred when establishing a new business.  It is acknowledged that the tests will inevitably require an element of judgment by the Commissioner as to whether a relocation is principally due to natural growth or gaining efficiency/profitability in a business, or to a significant change in the way a business is carried on. In any move there may be a multiplicity of reasons giving rise to the relocation but in every case it is the principal need or occasion for the relocation which must be determined and that will be question of fact. Examples Example 1 - Enhanced trading location 115. Gloria’s Gorgeous Gift Shop operates from retail premises at the rear of a shopping arcade. A lease has become available at the front entrance to the arcade. Gloria decides to move to the front shop to improve the profitability of her business. The structure of Gloria’s business is unchanged by the move, even though she hopes to benefit from increased profits. Although Gloria will gain a new and possibly more valuable lease, the expenditure incurred to relocate the business’ property is not for the acquisition of that new lease. The expenditure is incurred to relocate the property and so to enable the shop to trade more profitably. On balance, the relocation costs will be deductible. 21 Example 2 - New location offering benefits 116. For the past few years Kiwi Exports Limited has chosen to use rail to transport its goods to the port for shipping overseas, even though the goods must first be transported by road to the rail yards for this to occur. However, now, a new site with a direct rail link to the port has become available. Taking into account the handling and freight cost savings that could be achieved, Kiwi Exports Limited decides to relocate its business to the new site. The relocation will reduce the company’s operating costs and improve its efficiency. The relocation will not expand or extend the structure of the company’s business. The cost of relocation will be deductible. Example 3 - Organic growth within a business 117. Business has been going well for Green, Grey, and White Limited, a law firm. Client numbers are increasing and it has recently taken on new staff. The firm’s current lease is due to expire, and it is keen to move to bigger offices. The firm has found some offices more suited to its current size and that will also give it room for further growth, assuming the business continues to prosper. The need for relocating has arisen from the expiry of the firm’s current lease and the firm’s internal growth. In such circumstances the structure of the business is unaffected by the relocation. It is simply that the same law firm has grown and is now being conducted from larger premises. Therefore, the relocation costs are deductible. Example 4 - Recurring relocations 118. Project Support Limited provides engineering support services to businesses involved in large infrastructure projects. The company needs to operate its workshop close to where an infrastructure project is being carried out. This means that periodically, depending on the duration of its contract, the company must relocate. For Project Support Limited, relocating is an inevitable and recurring cost of it carrying on business. The cost of relocating is a deductible expense. Example 5 - Planned expansion of business into new field of trading 119. Trusty Car Repairs Limited, a well-established mechanical garage, has decided to expand its business by also becoming a used car dealer. As a result, Trusty Car Repairs Limited needs to relocate its workshop and office to larger and more prominent premises. Any relocation expenditure Trusty Car Repairs Limited incurs will be capital expenditure because the relocation expenditure is incurred to effect a planned expansion by the business into a new field of trading. The relocation costs will not be deductible. 120. Bluett and Grayson Limited, an accounting firm, has decided to branch out into providing human resources and job placement services. In order to maximise the opportunity, the company must move to larger premises, with more meeting rooms and better client parking. The relocation expenditure the company incurs will be capital expenditure because it is incurred to implement the company’s planned expansion into a new field of trading. Therefore, the relocation costs are not deductible. 121. In contrast, if Bluett and Grayson Limited decided to expand the existing audit arm of its business, such an extension would not be a move into a new field of trading, because the company is already providing those services. Therefore, unless the expansion plan involves the company significantly changing the way it delivers those services, such an expansion 22 will not alter the structure of the business. Therefore, the relocation costs would be deductible. Example 6 - Relocating divisional operations to one centralised site 122. Frozen Foods New Zealand Limited has determined that if it combines and relocates its various local manufacturing divisions to one new purpose-built industrial site that is linked by rail to the local port, the company will be able to significantly expand its production capacity as well as make efficiency savings and reduce freight costs. While the efficiency and profitability of the business will improve, the principal driver for this relocation is the expansion of the company’s production capacity. This expansion is achieved through the company centralising and fundamentally reorganising its various manufacturing processes to one centralised site. In this case, the structure of the business will be affected by the relocation. While the nature of the business remains essentially the same, the relocation of the business forms part of a plan to carry on the business in a significantly different (and expanded) way. The relocation costs incurred to relocate to the new site will be capital and not deductible. Example 7 - Competing reasons for relocating business 123. Electrical Engineering Limited manufactures commercial fuse boxes. They have been thinking about relocating for some time. The business is prospering, their current lease will expire shortly and they can see benefits from being located closer to their local suppliers. They also have developed a plan to expand the business by starting to manufacture some of the specialist components used in the fuse boxes themselves. Currently the components are imported from overseas. As part of its plan the company has made inquiries about purchasing some new machinery and is recruiting new staff as they do not have the necessary manufacturing expertise in- house. Their investigations suggest that there will be a good market in New Zealand and possibly overseas for the components. While there are a number of reasons for the company moving, in this case, the principal reason is the need for larger premises to implement the planned expansion of the business. The fact that the lease is expiring and the business needs more space whether it expands or not, are not considered to be the principal reasons for the move in this case. The relocation costs will be capital and not deductible. Example 8 - Shift from home-based business to commercial premises 124. Gabriella has been manufacturing umbrellas at home in her garage and successfully selling them online and by mail order for some time. Business is flourishing and she wants to expand her business by having a retail store. Gabriella’s expansion strategy includes engaging two new workers and shifting from her garage to commercial premises from which she can both manufacture and sell her umbrellas directly to the public. The relocation will result in Gabriella carrying on her business in a different way with the effect that the structure of Gabriella’s business will be enlarged. The relocation is part of a planned expansion strategy. The relocation costs will be capital. Therefore, the relocation costs are not deductible. Example 9 - Relocation on merger 125. Local Trucking Limited has wanted to expand their operations for sometime and has been actively seeking businesses to takeover. The company recently entered into a deal to acquire a competitor company, Fast Fleet Limited. As part of its takeover plan, Local Trucking Limited has agreed to merge its operations with Fast Fleet Limited. This includes the company 23 relocating its operations to Fast Fleet’s larger premises as they have more storage space and better loading facilities. As the relocation forms part of an expansion plan the cost of relocating will be capital and not deductible. Depreciation 126. Business relocation costs incurred to relocate business property will not be deductible if they are of a capital nature. However, a question arises as to whether those capital costs can be added to the “cost” of an item of depreciable property to the extent they relate to the relocation of that item. 127. Subpart EE provides that a person has a depreciation loss, if the person owns an item of depreciable property that is used or available for use. The Act defines what is meant by ownership and depreciable property and prescribes how amounts of depreciation loss are to be calculated. It also specifically provides for depreciation losses in respect of improvements to items of depreciable property: section EE 37. However, the Act does not define the meaning of “cost” for depreciation purposes. Meaning of “cost” 128. The standard formula for calculating amounts of depreciation loss is set out in section EE 16. The formula relies on a person determining the “value or cost” of an item of depreciable property. However, no definition of the term “cost” is provided. Section EE 16(4)(c) does provide for two variations to the term “cost” for the purposes of the standard calculation. These variations are set out in sections EE 18 and EE 19, but neither is relevant to determining whether relocation costs can form part of the “cost” of an item of depreciable property. 129. The Commissioner acknowledges the comments of Kitto J in the Australian High Court case BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT (1960) 12 ATD 204. He interpreted the word “cost” as bearing the meaning it has in the business life of the community. At page 207 he states: Embracing the whole sum which, according to accepted accountancy practice as applied to the circumstances of the case, ought to be considered as having been laid out by the taxpayer in order to acquire the subject matter as plant, that is to say installed and ready for his use as plant for the purpose of producing assessable income. 130. In the Commissioner’s view, Kitto J’s interpretation supports the inclusion of initial assembly and installation costs as part of the “cost” of an item of depreciable property. However, the Commissioner does not consider that Kitto J’s comments go so far as to support the inclusion of subsequent relocation costs as also forming part of the “cost” of an item. This is especially so when the term “cost” is considered in the context of New Zealand’s depreciation rules. 131. In the Commissioner’s view the term “cost” as it is used in the depreciation rules is effectively restricted to the initial cost of an item of depreciable property. Case law and commercial practice dictate that included in the initial cost are set-up and installation costs. However, the scheme of the depreciation rules seems to prevent any costs incurred subsequent to the initial setting up of the item from coming within the “cost” of that item unless they qualify under sections EE 18 and EE 19 (variations to cost) or section EE 37 (improvements). If subsequent costs can be implicitly added to the cost of an item of depreciable property it becomes difficult to understand the need for sections EE 19 and EE 37 in the depreciation rules. 132. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s view is that under the depreciation rules relocation costs cannot be subsequently added to the cost of an item of 24 depreciable property except where the relocation costs result in an “improvement” to the item. This means no depreciation loss is available for those costs. Improvements 133. In order for a depreciation loss to be available in respect of relocation costs, the costs would need to result in an improvement to the item of depreciable property. Section EE 67 defines an “improvement” as an alteration, extension, or repair of an item of depreciable property that increases its capital value. 134. In the Commissioner’s view the relocation of an item of depreciable property does not necessarily result in the depreciable property having an increased capital value. This will be a question of fact. Comments on technical submissions received 135. In the course of producing this statement, various technical submissions were received. 136. The Commissioner does not consider that an across the board deduction for all relocation expenditure can be supported by case law. There will be circumstances where the general permission will not be met, and there will be circumstances where the expenditure has the purpose or effect of enlarging or expanding the structure of a business. 137. The Commissioner recognises that the exclusion of business relocation costs from the cost base of items of relocated depreciable property will result in the recognition of “black hole expenditure” when the costs incurred are found to be capital in nature. Although, such an outcome is unfortunate, in the Commissioner’s view, the cases, on balance, indicate that in certain circumstances costs incurred to expand or enlarge the structure of a business will be capital. In those situations the depreciation rules do not allow the cost base of items of depreciation property to be increased by the relocation costs, unless there is an “improvement” of the item. 138. It may seem incongruous in the case of a business expansion to treat the cost of relocating existing property as non-deductible expenditure and yet allow a depreciation loss for the cost of acquiring and installing new property as part of the same expansion. Arguably, the cost of relocating existing business property as part of an expansion in the structure of a business is revenue expenditure on the basis that no enduring advantage or benefit arises in respect of the existing property as a result of the move and, to the extent of that property, the business structure remains unchanged. 139. However, the Commissioner is not convinced by this argument. He considers the better view in such circumstances, based on the various cases, is that the need or occasion for relocating the existing property is the expansion of the business structure. The costs flow from the decision to expand the business. If it were not for the business structure expanding, the existing property would not be relocated, and likewise, the existing property needs to be relocated if the business is to expand. As a result, in those circumstances the relocation costs do give rise to an enduring advantage for the business and do have the purpose and effect of expanding or enlarging the business structure even though the costs relate to existing property. 25 Legislation 140. Section DA 1 is the general permission that allows a deduction for expenditure. Section DA 1(1) and (2) provides: DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 141. Section DA 2 sets out the limitations to the general permission in section DA 1 that may prevent a deduction. Section DA 2(1) provides: DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. 142. The depreciation rules in subpart EE set out how an amount of a depreciation loss is calculated. Section EE 16(4) specifies the value or cost to be used to calculate depreciation. Section EE 16(1), (2) and (4) provides: EE 16 Amount resulting from standard calculation Amount (1) For the purposes of the comparison of amounts required by section EE 14(1), the amount dealt with in this section is calculated using the formula— annual rate x value or cost x months 12 Definition of items in formula (2) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (3) to (5). ... Value or cost (4) Value or cost is,— (a) when the person uses the diminishing value method, the item’s adjusted tax value at the end of the income year before the deduction of an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the income year: (b) when the person uses the straight-line method,— (i) for a patent or plant variety rights in relation to which the person has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the relevant applicati on, the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the month in which the person acquires it: 26 27 (ii) for other items, its cost to the person excluding expenditure for which the person is allowed a deduction under a provision of this Act outside this subpart: (c) for the purposes of paragraph (b), variations to cost are in sections EE 18 and EE 19. 143. A depreciation loss can be deducted when a person makes an improvement to an item of depreciable property. Section EE 67 defines “improvement” as meaning: EE 67 Other definitions In this Act,— ... improvement means an alteration, extension, or repair of an item of depreciable property that increases its capital value
