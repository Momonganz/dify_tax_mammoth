APPENDIX 4 Page 9 of 26 (b) Principle 10: Limits on use of Personal Information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 10 for the Parties to use Personal Information that they obtain for one purpose for the purposes of this Agreement. (c) Principle 11: Limits on disclosure of Personal Information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 11 for the Parties to disclose Personal Information to each other for the purposes of this Agreement. 5. The public services that this Agreement is intended to facilitate This Agreement intends to facilitate the following public services: (a) IR’s administration of the tax system, including the protection of the public revenue, the integrity of the tax system and the development of public policy; (b) MIB’s administration of the Registers, including the performance of its statutory functions, duties and powers in relation to those Registers; (c) MIB’s enforcement and compliance activities in relation to the legislation it administers; (d) MIB’s administration of the insolvency regime, including carrying out the functions, duties and powers of the Official Assignee; and (e) BCB’s delivery of information to support New Zealand businesses. 6. Adverse Actions (a) Section 152 of the Privacy Act 2020 requires parties to an approved information sharing agreement to provide written notice to individuals before any Adverse Action is taken against them on the basis of information shared under that agreement, including details of the Adverse Action that the party proposes to take and the Personal Information about the individual on which the action is based. The notice must give those individuals 10 Working Days to dispute the correctness of the information. Section 153 of that Act allows an approved information sharing agreement to provide that a party to that agreement may give a shorter period of notice or dispense with the notice requirement. (b) The Parties agree to dispense with the notice requirement under section 152, in line with section 153(a)(ii), where the sharing of Personal Information under this Agreement gives either of them reasonable grounds to suspect that: (i) either: I. an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed under legislation that a Party administers; or II. a person has engaged, is engaging, or is likely to engage in activity that means they may be subject to an administrative APPENDIX 4 Page 10 of 26 sanction or may warrant the imposition of a penalty under legislation that a Party administers; and (ii) the Personal Information is relevant to the Party’s decision-making on preventative, investigative or enforcement interventions related to that offence, administrative sanction or penalty; and (iii) advance notification by a Party to a subject of an Adverse Action would be likely to defeat the purpose of the intervention. (c) The Adverse Actions that a Party may take under this Agreement are specified at Schedule 2. (d) Notwithstanding sub-clauses 6(a)-6(c) above, the Parties may not take any Adverse Action as a result of the sharing of Information solely for the purpose set out in sub-clause 2(d) (regarding public policy development). 7. Where members of the public can view this document This Agreement is available for viewing by members of the public: (a) on the public website or websites of each Party; and (b) in person at IR, 55 Featherston Street, Wellington. 8. Overview of operational details (a) The Information will be transferred securely between the Parties using the methods specified in clause 9 and in accordance with the Operational Protocols.

(g) Operational details will be included in the Operational Protocols, rather than in this Agreement, as they may need to be regularly updated over time, and they relate to matters that it is appropriate for the Parties to manage internally within their respective organisations. The Parties may provide copies of the Operational Protocols to the Privacy Commissioner either proactively or on request. (h) Information will only be accessible by those staff who need to use it for the purposes of this Agreement and who have signed certificates or declarations of confidentiality under the TAA if required by IR. (i) Each Party will be responsible for responding to requests for Personal Information as appropriate in the circumstances, in accordance with Part 4 of the Privacy Act 2020. 9. Safeguards that will be applied to protect the privacy of individuals and ensure that any interference with their privacy is minimised (a) Security Provisions The Parties will have mechanisms and procedures for: (i) the secure storage and transfer of Information in accordance with government security standards (including by encrypted USB Iron Key, SEEMail, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or B2B framework, as applicable to the particular Operational Protocol); (ii) the appointment of Authorised Staff; (iii) the training of Authorised Staff, so that they share Information appropriately and in accordance with this Agreement; (iv) ensuring that the Information is of adequate quality at the time it is provided to the other Party; (v) ensuring that the Information is used only as permitted under this Agreement.

(ii) This assessment may (as agreed by the Parties) involve a full audit or another form of assessment that is less than a full audit and that enables the exchange of letters of assurance between the Parties. (iii) The assessment of mechanisms and procedures for the secure storage and transfer of Information may involve completion of the security Certification and Accreditation process that is required by the Government Chief Information Officer at the Department of Internal Affairs. (iv) The Parties will co-operate with each other during the assessment process and will take all reasonable actions to make the required resources available. (v) The Lead Agency will use the results of the assessment to report on the operation of this Agreement as part of its annual report, in accordance with sections 154 to 156 of the Privacy Act 2020.

Application by Trinity investors to stay liquidation proceedings
================================================================

2014 case note – unsuccessful application by Trinity investors to stay liquidation proceedings brought by CIR.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Accent Management Ltd; Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Lexington Resources Ltd

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The Court dismissed the defendant's application to stay liquidation proceedings brought by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"), finding the Commissioner was a creditor for the purposes of recovering tax and appointing the liquidator did not perpetuate an unlawful order.

### Impact of decision

This is a further judgment of Courtney J rejecting applications by Trinity investors to stay liquidation proceedings. As with previous judgments, it confirms the Commissioner's ability to take enforcement/recovery action.

### Facts

Accent Management Ltd and Lexington Resources Ltd ("the defendants") were party to a forestry venture (known as the Trinity scheme) which was held to be a tax avoidance scheme by the High Court (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC)), Court of Appeal (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 230; (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323 (CA)) and Supreme Court (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115; \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289). The Commissioner applied to appoint a liquidator in respect of unpaid tax assessments confirmed by the Supreme Court. This proceeding concerned an application by the defendants to stay those proceedings.

### Decision

#### _Would appointing liquidators perpetuate an unlawful or illegal order?_

The defendants argue there was an unlawful/illegal imposition of tax by Venning J at first instance (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC)). Acting as a hearing authority under the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), his Honour's failure to assess under subpart EH of the Income Tax Act 1994  meant his orders were either of no effect or exceeded the jurisdiction conferred by sections 138B and 138P of the TAA.

This argument was raised in the context of the defendants' further applications to set aside statutory demands issued by the Commissioner. Associate Judge Faire (as he was then) considered the argument had already been determined by an earlier decision of Priestley J (_Accent Management Ltd v Attorney-General_ \[2013\] NZHC 1447, (2013) 26 NZTC 21,020). Associate Judge Faire dismissed those applications and required the defendants to pay the Commissioner the amount of tax being sought (_Accent Management Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 3197).

The defendants argued that Associate Judge Faire's order amounted to the unlawful and illegal imposition of tax and determination of the proceedings would perpetuate an unlawful and illegal order. Further, the Commissioner could not bring proceedings in reliance on that order.

Her Honour pointed out the fact that the subpart EH argument had already been raised by the defendants in the Priestley J proceedings. His Honour had dismissed the proceedings, finding that they were a collateral and impermissible attack on the judgments of the Supreme Court and Venning J.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld Priestley J's decision and rejected the argument that the failure to assess the tax under subpart EH led to Venning J levying a tax in breach of section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986 as being a tax levied other than by an Act of Parliament (_Accent Management Ltd v Attorney-General_ \[2014\] NZCA 351). The Court of Appeal also rejected the argument that acting as a hearing authority limited the High Court's jurisdiction.

In a separate appeal, the Court of Appeal also upheld the decision of Associate Judge Faire.

Her Honour rejected the defendants' submission that the present proceedings have been brought in reliance on the defendants' failure to comply with Associate Judge Faire's orders, as the validity of those orders would not affect the Commissioner's right to bring the proceedings in the form they were brought. It was clear from the Statement of Claim that the application was not made solely on the orders made by Associate Judge Faire.

Her Honour also rejected the defendants' submission that Associate Judge Faire's order requiring defendants to pay the sum of money demanded by the Commissioner amounted to the imposition of a tax for which the Associate Judge had no authority. The order did not create any new debt, much less a tax, it was merely a step in the enforcement process relating to the tax that was the subject of the statutory demand.

In relation to the defendants' subpart EH argument, her Honour noted that it was rejected by the Court of Appeal, with her Honour noting she agrees with and, in any event, is bound to follow that decision.

#### _Is the Commissioner a creditor?_

The defendants argue that, although the Commissioner has the power to sue in her own name under section 156 of the TAA, by virtue of section 14(1) of the Crown Proceedings Act 1950, liquidation proceedings are not an action for recovery of tax within the meaning of section 156.

Her Honour noted that this argument had already been rejected in the applications for stay of liquidation proceedings brought by the other Trinity scheme participants (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd_ \[2014\] NZHC 1746 and _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd_ \[2014\] NZHC 1877). The definition of "creditor" in section 240 of the Companies Act 1993 encompasses the Commissioner in relation to proceedings brought to recover or pay tax debt. Therefore, the Commissioner is a creditor for the purposes of liquidation proceedings brought under section 241 of the Companies Act 1993.

#### _Are the proceedings an abuse of process?_

The defendants submitted that the proceedings were an abuse of process as the Commissioner obtained the orders requiring payment of outstanding tax by deliberately or recklessly misleading the hearing authority. The defendants also relied on Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") served earlier this year, arguing that those notices must be determined before any further steps could be taken.

Her Honour found that the current proceedings were not an abuse of process, noting that those NOPAs are based on the subpart EH argument and this issue had already been determined by the Court of Appeal.

#### _Balance of convenience_

Her Honour found that, given the Supreme Court had confirmed the assessments as correct in 2008 and the taxpayers continue to engage in costly litigation even though they cannot meet the debt, there was prejudice to the Commissioner in not having the matter finally disposed of.

Courtney J found in the Commissioner's favour on every issue and dismissed the stay applications.

Application by Trinity investors to strike out or stay Commissioner's liquidation proceedings
=============================================================================================

2014 case note – High Court dismissed the defendants' application to strike out or stay the CIR's liquidation proceedings – insolvency, Trinity, strike out, stay.

Case

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited CIV 2014-404-4673; The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Bristol Forestry Ventures Limited CIV 2013-404-4676 \[2014\] NZHC 1746

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Companies Act 1993, Crown Law Proceedings Act 1950

### Summary

Courtney J dismissed the defendants' application to strike out or stay the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") liquidation proceedings. She found the Commissioner was a creditor for the purposes of recovering tax and further that the application to appoint liquidators was not premature on the part of the Commissioner.

### Impact of decision

The decision clearly affirms the Commissioner's powers to pursue liquidation steps against litigious debtors. The judgment discusses the public interest in the Commissioner pursing liquidation to maintain the integrity of the tax system.  

### Facts

This judgment relates to an application made by the Commissioner to have liquidators appointed to the defendants.

The defendants were involved in the Trinity tax avoidance scheme and the debts relate to their 1997/1998 assessments, which were ultimately confirmed by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289.

The defendants applied to strike out the Commissioner's application on the ground that she is not a creditor of the companies and therefore lacks standing to bring the proceedings. In the alternative, they sought a stay of the proceedings.

In addition to the above, the defendants also say the liquidation would be premature because there are decisions pending on various appeals and separate proceedings afoot, which, if successful, may result in the tax claimed being extinguished.

### Decision

#### _The strike out_

_Are the liquidation proceedings a suit?_  
First, Courtney J considered whether liquidation proceedings are a suit for the purposes of section 156 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

She considered the Commissioner's power to recover unpaid taxes under sections 6A(2) and 6A(3) of the TAA, plus the power and method conferred on the Commissioner under section 156, which provides:

*   All unpaid tax shall be recoverable by the Commissioner on behalf of the Crown by suit in the Commissioner's official name.

She also noted the effect of the Crown Proceedings Act 1950, which is specifically preserved under section 164 of the TAA.

_Are the liquidation proceedings a suit for the recovery of tax?_  
Satisfied the liquidation proceedings are a suit for the purposes of section 156 of the TAA, Courtney J went on to look at whether a liquidation proceeding was a suit for the recovery of unpaid tax as contemplated by section 156 of the TAA.  
  
She found the liquidation proceedings are a form of debt recovery and therefore the Commissioner's application for an order that a liquidator be appointed was a suit for the recovery of unpaid tax.

Her Honour relied on the Privy Council decision _Cambridge Gas Transport Corp v Unsecured Creditors of Navigator Holdings PLC_ \[2006\] UKPC 26, \[2007\] 1 AC 508 at \[14\]-\[15\] where Lord Hoffman said:

*   The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings ... is not to determine or establish the existence of rights, but to provide a mechanism of collective execution against the property of the debtor by creditors whose rights are admitted or established. That mechanism may vary in its details ... The important point is that bankruptcy, whether personal or corporate, is a collective proceeding to enforce rights and not to establish them.

_Is the Commissioner_ _a creditor for the purposes of the liquidation proceedings?_  
Her Honour then considered whether the Commissioner is a creditor under section 241(2)(c) of the Companies Act 1993 ("Companies Act"). The defendants argued the Commissioner is not a creditor because tax is public money and a property of the Crown. They argued this makes the Crown the creditor and the Commissioner an agent charged with the collection of a debt.

Courtney J found the Commissioner is a creditor for the purposes of section 241(2)(c)(iv). She found the opening words of section 240(1) "unless the context otherwise requires" meant the definition of creditor under section 241(2)(c) is not exhaustive and the context may require it to be interpreted more widely than is set out. She considered that the context in this case did require a wider interpretation basing this on both the purpose of the Companies Act and other provisions relating to creditors.

Courtney J therefore dismissed both the defendant's strike-out application arguments.

#### _The stay application_

_Application for stay principles_  
To begin, Courtney J set out the principles relating to an application for stay in winding up proceedings. Summarised by Wallace J in _Nemisis Holdings Ltd v North Harbour Industrial Holdings Ltd_ (1989) 1 PRNZ 379, citing _Exchange Finance Co Ltd v Lemington Holdings Ltd_ \[1984\] 2 NZLR 242 (CA); _Anglian Sales Ltd v South Pacific Manufacturing Co Ltd_ \[1984\] 2 NZLR 249 (CA); _Fletcher Development & Construction Ltd v New Plymouth Hotels Holdings Ltd_ \[1986\] as:  
 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1.1 | The Court has an inherent jurisdiction to stay winding up proceedings where the debt is the subject of a genuine dispute; |
| 1.2 | The jurisdiction is an inherent one to prevent the abuse of process. There is no inflexible rule; |
| 1.3 | The governing consideration is whether the proceedings suggest unfairness or undue pressure; |
| 1.4 | It is a serious matter to stay winding up proceedings and a decision to do so is not to be made lightly. The onus is on the applicant and it is normally necessary to demonstrate "something more" than the balance of convenience considerations usually considered on an application for an interim injunction. |

_The outstanding appeals and proceedings_  
Courtney J rejected the defendants' submission that the strike-out application raised complex issues of law, stating: "the issue raised in this appeal cannot truly be described as complex nor is it novel; it has been raised and rejected in other proceedings".

She went on to say for the many pending appeal decisions at \[40\] (CIV-2013-404-004673; CIV-2013-204-004676 \[2014\] NZHC 1746):

*   I do not accept that these circumstances justify staying the Commissioner's proceedings. This is not an application for a stay sought for a short time pending the determination of a genuinely new point where the decision would assuredly spell the end of the litigation. There is no reason to think that if the outcome of the appeals or the proceeding against the Attorney-General in this Court is adverse to the defendants, it will be accepted as determinative of the defendants' position. The history of this matter shows only that the defendants will continue to litigate, notwithstanding their insolvent state, until they get the answer they want.  
    Further, there is no prejudice to the defendants in the appointment of a liquidator, since they are not trading and have no assets. It was not suggested that, even if the appeals were successful, this position would change …

Her Honour concluded at \[43\]:

*   I am mindful of the Court of Appeal's caution in _Anglian Sales_ against too readily precluding the exercise of the Commissioner's statutory rights. Although it seems very unlikely that the tax will be paid, that fact should not be determinative. There is a significant public interest in maintaining the integrity of the taxation system through the resolution of unpaid tax debt. It ought not to be the case that apparently insolvent companies owing large amounts of tax can simply not pay while at the same time continuing to engage the Commissioner in costly and time-consuming litigation. That is a spectacle that surely undermines the taxation system and risks bringing it into disrepute in the eyes of other taxpayers.

Consequently Her Honour also rejected the defendants' stay application.

Application for conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council dismissed with costs
=====================================================================================

2005 case note - conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council dismissed - Supreme Court Act 2003, transitional provisions, sections 42 and 50.

Case

CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd & Ors

Legislative References

Supreme Court Act 2003

### Summary

The Court of Appeal has dismissed an application for conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council against a judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 7 March 2005. The Court found the transitional provisions in the Supreme Court Act 2003 do not operate in favour of a prospective appellant, merely because the High Court delivered a judgment in the matter before 31 December 2003. The appeal to the Court of Appeal must have also been heard before 1 January 2004, even if judgment was delivered later, for a further right of appeal to the Privy Council to exist.

### Facts

On 29 January 2004, the CIR filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal against a decision of the High Court delivered by Venning J on 11 December 2003. The appeal was heard on 15 February 2005, and a judgment allowing the appeal was delivered on 7 March 2005. The respondent filed an application for conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council.

Appeals to the Privy Council were abolished by the Supreme Court Act 2003, section 42 of which provides:

> **42 Ending of appeals to Her Majesty in Council**
> 
> 1.  No appeal to her Majesty in Council lies or may be brought from or in respect of any civil or criminal decision of a New Zealand court made after 31 December 2003 -
>     1.  whether by leave or special leave of any court or of her Majesty in Council, or otherwise; and
>     2.  whether by virtue of any Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom or of New Zealand, or the Royal prerogative, or otherwise.
> 2.  Subsection (1) is subject to section 50.

The Supreme Court Act contains a transitional provision in respect of decisions of the Court of Appeal made before 1 January 2004 or made after 31 December 2003 in a proceeding whose hearing was completed before 1 January 2004. The saving provision is section 50 of the Supreme Court Act. Of particular relevance is subsection1(a) which provides as follows:

> **50\. Privy Council may still determine appeals in certain existing proceedings**
> 
> 1.  The Privy Council may hear and determine, or continue to hear and determine, -
>     1.  an appeal against a final judgment of the Court of Appeal made before 1 January 2004, or made after 31 December 2003 in a proceeding whose hearing was completed before 1 January 2004, where
>         1.  the matter in dispute on the appeal amounts to or is of the value of $5,000 or upwards; or
>         2.  the appeal involves, directly or indirectly, some claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right amounting to or of the value of $5,000 or upwards;

The respondent contended that its case came within the dispensing scope of section 50(1)(a) submitting that on a proper construction of the provision, the reference to the "proceeding whose hearing was completed" is a reference to the High Court proceeding and the High Court hearing. On this approach a right of appeal would lie to the Privy Council because the High Court proceeding was heard and determined before 1 January 2004.

### Decision

The Court held that it was inconceivable that Parliament, in repatriating appeals by way of the Supreme Court Act, could have intended to continue a right of appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal, not by reference to the timing of that decision but by reference to a lower Court's decision in respect of which an appeal right had been exercised and dealt with.

If there was an ambiguity, it would have to be in terms of the possibility that the words "whose hearing" in section 50(1)(a) could mean "whose hearing in the High Court," but the Court considered that was not tenable, because all exemptions from the section 42 barrier, described in section 50(1), relate to final judgments or decisions of the Court of Appeal. There was no exemption for decisions of the High Court, notwithstanding that the New Zealand (Appeals to the Privy Council) Order 1910, Rule 2(c) provided for a right of appeal directly from the High Court. The Supreme Court Act has only preserved appeals from the Court of Appeal in limited circumstances, and abolished appeals from the High Court, so it cannot be the case that Parliament intended the disposal of the proceedings in the High Court to have significance.

The Court dismissed the application for conditional leave and ordered costs of $1,500 in favour of the Commissioner.

Application for Crown Law to cease to act for Commissioner on trinity matters
=============================================================================

2012 case note - Application for Crown Law to cease to act for CIR in proceedings related to the Trinity scheme dismissed - debar solicitors, abuse of process.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Accent Management Limited (and others) and Garry Albert Muir

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006

### Summary

An application by various taxpayers to prevent Crown Law from acting for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in certain proceedings related to the Trinity scheme was dismissed. The High Court considered that the application had no relevance to the proceedings and no arguable factual foundation.

### Impact of decision

This judgment is precedent for the remaining challenges in the on-going Trinity litigation.

### Facts

In a Trinity-related matter, an application was made by the taxpayers seeking orders that Crown Law cease acting as the solicitors for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and that no Crown counsel appear as counsel in certain proceedings for the Commissioner.

The application, which is the subject of this judgment, was made with respect to three proceedings. Two of the proceedings are appeals by Dr Muir against decisions of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") on 1 February 2011 and 16 June 2011. Dr Muir had, in his challenge proceedings, raised a preliminary issue to the effect that the assessments he challenged were invalid and the TRA had no power to consider whether the assessments were correct. The Commissioner responded by arguing that Dr Muir's challenge could not be advanced having regard to the Supreme Court's decision in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115; \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289. Dr Muir's application was dismissed and the Commissioner's application was granted. In the later decision of 16 June 2011, the TRA dismissed an application by Dr Muir to recall the decision of 1 February 2011.

The third proceeding is in respect of a transfer and consolidation application by the Commissioner to transfer from the TRA to the High Court, 66 challenge proceedings and have them consolidated with two challenge proceedings in the High Court and the two Dr Muir appeals.

### Decision

Justice Woodhouse dismissed the application for two reasons. Firstly, he held that the allegations had no relevance to the proceedings in question. Secondly, he held that from looking at the history of past Trinity litigation, in which most of the taxpayers have been involved, including final determinations of fact in the High Court, the taxpayers cannot establish an arguable factual foundation to support the applications.

Justice Woodhouse reviewed the litigation history starting with the original challenge proceedings, which culminated in the _Ben Nevis_ proceeding where the Supreme Court upheld the Commissioner's assessments. He also reviewed the judicial review proceeding _Accent Management Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,126 (HC) and quoted at length from Keane J's strike-out judgment. Finally, he reviewed the setting-aside proceeding _Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 and subsequent appeals from that decision.

Justice Woodhouse noted the legal principles from the case _Clear Communications Ltd v Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd_ (1999) 14 PRNZ 477 (HC) at 482-483, that "there must be something truly extraordinary before removal could be contemplated" and that the courts need to be alert to applications to debar being used as a tactical weapon or gaming the system.

Justice Woodhouse stated that the remaining challenges may give rise to material questions of fact and will give rise to material questions of law. With regard to the questions of fact, he reasoned that in the challenges, the hearing authority will decide as a matter of law that certain questions of fact were conclusively determined in the _Ben Nevis_ proceeding. Accordingly, the taxpayers' allegations of fact relating to the conduct of Crown Law, and the conduct of the Commissioner, are irrelevant.

The Judge went further to state that, with regard to the questions of law that will be before the hearing authority, the taxpayer's allegations against Crown Law are also irrelevant because they are allegations of fact which cannot assist in answering the questions of law which will arise in the challenges. In particular at \[42\]:

*   The hearing authority's determination as to what the law is, in respect of the challenged assessments, cannot be advanced in any way by determining whether or not the Commissioner acted in a particular way in the past and whether or not Crown Law promoted the particular conduct or in some way participated in it.

Justice Woodhouse noted that the heart of the taxpayers' argument was in relation to the applicability of subpart EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 to the assessments. In this regard, he stated (at \[45\]) that ... \[t\]he obligation of counsel to ensure that the court has all the relevant law before it cannot be converted into an obligation for counsel on one side to concede the legal argument that is being advanced on the other side".

Justice Woodhouse referred to the majority decision in _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158; \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 and the principle that "\[t\]here is ... no potential for separation of matters of legality from matters of correctness" when holding that the past conduct of Crown Law, and the past conduct of the Commissioner, in respect of the 1997 and 1998 assessments dealt with in _Ben Nevis_, do not have any relevance to the current challenges.

Justice Woodhouse referenced the comments of Tipping J in _Tannadyce_ about "gaming the system" and was satisfied that this application was an attempt to game the system. He found (at \[53\]) that:

*   ... it is an attempt to game the system within the statutory procedures. I am satisfied that the taxpayers have not brought this application because of a sincere and well-founded concern that their tax affairs will not be properly adjudicated on, but in an endeavour to cause unjustified difficulties for the Commissioner and to delay resolution of the tax disputes. The attempt to game the system, through the present applications, may be seen from the litigation history.

Justice Woodhouse went on to state that the allegations of the taxpayers were essentially the same as those in their judicial review proceeding and in that context, Keane J made findings of fact which were sufficient for the purposes of these applications to conclude that the taxpayers do not have a reasonably arguable factual foundation to advance the applications to debar. He was "satisfied that these applications are an abuse of process" (see \[54\]).

Application for discovery dismissed by the High Court
=====================================================

2014 case note – application for discovery from CIR dismissed on basis that documents sought not relevant - shortfall penalties, unacceptable tax position.

Case

ASB Bank Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court dismissed ASB Bank Limited's ("ASB") application for discovery from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"), on the basis that the documents sought were not relevant.

### Impact of decision

The High Court has restated that relevance (as determined by the pleadings) is the starting point in discovery. If a document is not relevant, it is not discoverable.

This judgment is High Court authority that informal, unfinalised views expressed by internal Inland Revenue staff will not be relevant to the determination of whether a tax position taken is "about as likely as not to be correct" (for the purposes of determining whether an assessment of shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position is correct).

### Facts

ASB's application for discovery sought all documents held by the Commissioner (including emails, meeting notes and minutes) that express a view on the Yen transaction, relevant to whether or not the tax position taken by ASB was "about as likely as not to be correct". In particular, ASB sought documents held by the Commissioner's Policy and Strategy Unit in relation to the second Yen transaction (which was contemplated by ASB but not commenced), documents held by Rulings and any/all other disputes documents held.

The Commissioner opposed the application for discovery on the basis that those documents are not relevant.

### Decision

Asher J dismissed ASB's application for discovery. His Honour restated the principle that the starting point for a discovery application is that the documents sought must be relevant to an issue in the proceedings. Relevance in this case is to be considered against the requirements of s 141B(1) of the TAA (unacceptable tax position). Asher J considered the test under s 141B(1) as stated by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited v CIR_ \[2006\] NZSC 115 (at 184-185) that the "merits of the arguments supporting the taxpayer's interpretation must be substantial". Thereby reiterating that the test is an objective one, so that the taxpayer's belief as to whether the tax position taken was correct is irrelevant. All tax laws, including the general anti-avoidance provision and decisions of the Courts and Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of the relevant tax laws are to be considered (s 141B(7) of the TAA ).

His Honour noted (at \[17\]) that the question of discoverability of documents in relation to the issue of whether a taxpayer's tax position had substantial merit has not been directly addressed in New Zealand. Asher J referred to Australian cases (_Prebble v CoT_ \[2002\] FCA 1434, _Walstern v CoT_ (2003) 138 FCR) that considered a similar test in the Australian penalties regime and stated that those cases did not suggest that informal views, which were not intended to be communicated to third parties, could be considered. His Honour stated (at \[18\]) that the observations of Venning J in _Accent Management Ltd v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC) at \[360\] and \[364\], is an indication that there were limits as to whether the private opinions held by the Commissioner's officers could be considered.

His Honour further stated (at \[19\], \[21\], \[23\] and \[24\]) that a judge may get some assistance from commentary on the law and other material of probative value (such as articles by reputable experts and Rulings of the Commissioner) in deciding whether a taxpayer's tax position had substantial merit but that a line must be drawn. Asher J held that "the documents fail the relevance test because their informal nature means they have no significant probative value" (at \[22\]).

Application for extension of time dismissed
===========================================

2014 case note - application for extension of time to file an appeal dismissed by Court of Appeal.

Case

Peter William Mawhinney as trustee of the Forest Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005

### Summary

The Court of Appeal dismissed the trustee of the Forest Trust's application for an extension of time to appeal a decision of Cooper J on an application for judicial review.

### Impact of decision

If the trustee of the Forest Trust does not seek to appeal this decision, the Court of Appeal has confirmed that the appropriate forum for the substantive issues to be heard is the statutory disputes and challenge procedures.

### Facts

This was an application for an extension of time brought by Peter William Mawhinney as trustee of the Forest Trust ("the Trust") under rule 29A of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 to appeal a decision of Cooper J on an application for judicial review (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ \[2013\] NZHC 3564, (2013) 26 NZTC 21-079).

The Forest Trust filed a goods and services tax ("GST") return claiming a refund of $67,011.65 for the GST period ended 31 July 2009. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") reassessed the refund to nil pursuant to s 89C(eb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), as the Commissioner believed the Trust was involved in fraudulent activity.

The Commissioner issued her assessment on 20 June 2012 and the Trust responded by issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment thus engaging the statutory dispute process. Prior to the Commissioner issuing a Challenge Notice (or amended assessment), the Trust filed a Notice of Claim with the Taxation Review Authority. Following a number of interactions between the parties, the Trust filed an application for judicial review relying on the following five causes of action:

1.  The Commissioner's adjustment of GST was unlawful and not authorised by s 89C(eb) of the TAA as nothing in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 excludes GST from being applied to fraudulent activity.
2.  The decision to adjust the GST was in breach of natural justice because of the failure to undertake "naturally just" investigations before making the determination.
3.  The failure to reassess the corresponding output tax in the relevant GST period was unreasonable.
4.  The Commissioner did not issue her Notice of Response within the two-month response period.
5.  There were allegations of breach of statutory duty.

In response, the Commissioner filed an objection to jurisdiction, applying for the proceeding to be dismissed.

On 23 December 2013, Justice Cooper issued his decision in favour of the Commissioner, dismissing Mr Mawhinney's application for Judicial Review (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ \[2013\] NZHC 3564, (2013) 26 NZTC 21-079). Justice Cooper held that each of the causes of action could be dealt with in the statutory disputes and challenge procedures and, therefore, applying _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153_,_ the High Court had no jurisdiction. The judge said that although various bases were argued "the end point in each case involves consideration of the correct GST position" over the period (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ as aboveat \[45\]).

The Trust attempted to appeal this decision to the Court of Appeal but its notice of appeal was rejected for filing by the Deputy Registrar due to a number of procedural defects. Miller J reviewed and upheld the Deputy Registrar's decision to reject the notice of appeal (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZCA 69). Accordingly, on 19 March 2014, the Trust filed the application for extension of time, which the Commissioner opposed.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal determined that, despite the delay being minimal, it was not in the interests of justice to extend the time for the Trust to "pursue a meritless appeal" (at \[19\]).

The Court dismissed the application for an extension of time to appeal confirming the High Court's view that there is another statutory remedy available and stating that the "proposed appeal is hopeless" (at \[19\]).

Application for Interim Liquidator
==================================

2017 case note – Associate Judge satisfied that the interests of creditors would be safeguarded by interim liquidators being appointed, as the assets in jeopardy.

Case

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chesterfields Preschools Limited & Therese Anne Sisson \[2017\] NZHC 3172

Legislative References

s 246 Companies Act 1993

### Summary

Associate Judge Matthews was satisfied that the interests of creditors would be safeguarded by interim liquidators being appointed, as the assets are in jeopardy.

### Impact

The order prevents the company from dealing with the property pending the outcome of the High Court liquidation rehearing.

### Facts

This follows the judgment of the Supreme Court dated 23 November 2017 which set aside the order made by the High Court in 2015 putting the company into liquidation and ordering a rehearing of the High Court liquidation.

Chesterfields Preschools Limited (“Chesterfields”) has two assets, a property at 854 Colombo Street, Christchurch and an insurance policy over a building which was previously on the land at 854 Colombo Street, Christchurch.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) is the principal creditor of Chesterfields. Income tax and goods and services tax (“GST”) arrears amount to $1,088,461.15 (This figure was established as at 22 July 2008 after application of a 15 per cent penalty relief, as suggested by the Court of Appeal, and an allowance for the cancellation of some interest.). The total amount currently owing, including income tax, GST, and court costs is $1,120,566.15. The Commissioner also claims a further $570,958.92 in GST from the sale of a neighbouring property and insurance proceeds.

### Decision

The application was served on all three persons named as directors of Chesterfields. However, two of them, Ms Sisson and Mr Hampton are undischarged bankrupts and are therefore disqualified from holding office as directors by s 151(2)(b) of the Companies Act 1993.

Therefore, Chesterfields had only one director, Anna Hampton, who did not take steps to oppose the application. Ms Sisson had filed an opposition to the Commissioner’s application; however, it was disregarded as she could not represent the company.

Associate Judge Matthews referred to the three factors to be considered in relation to an application under s 246 of the Companies Act 1993 identified in _Robert Bryce & Co Ltd v Chicken & Food Distributors Ltd_ (HC Wellington M297/90, 13 August 1990) namely:

1.  Whether the company's assets are in jeopardy;
2.  Whether the status quo should be maintained;
3.  Whether the interest of creditors are safeguarded.

Ms Sisson assessed the land value at $875,000 and had been trying to negotiate the sale of the land with neighbours of the property without the consent of the liquidator. However, no registered valuation was before the court nor were the terms on which the property might be sold. These facts established prima facie that the asset was in jeopardy.

Ms Sisson had also been negotiating a mortgage over a title to the property in order to secure $109,000; this being the sum the Court of Appeal required to be paid as a condition for the termination of the liquidation. These actions also raised the prospect that the property may be in jeopardy.

While the property had a caveat on the title, this would not stop Chesterfields entering into contractual arrangements with other parties.

The evidence before the Court also supported the view that Chesterfields was insolvent. To ensure a maximum return to creditors, it was imperative the remaining assets were handled responsibly.

As the assets were in jeopardy, the Court was satisfied it was in the interests of creditors for an interim liquidator to be appointed.

Application for judicial review of a decision of the Taxation Review Authority
==============================================================================

2014 case note - Applicant sought judicial review of decision that the CIR's Statement of Position was within the stipulated response period.

Case

Harris v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The applicant sought judicial review of the Taxation Review Authority's decision, in a preliminary hearing, that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's Statement of Position ("SOP") was within the response period as stipulated in section 89AB9(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The application for judicial review claimed that the Taxation Review Authority had erred in law in coming to that decision. Justice Woolford declined the application both as a matter of discretion, and on its merits.

### Facts

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"), in response to the plaintiff's SOP dated 20 November 2009, issued her SOP on 19 January 2010 (the date on or before she was required to issue her SOP), via facsimile to the plaintiff's agent at 11.07 pm and posted the same evening at 11.25 pm.

The plaintiff applied for judicial review of the Taxation Review Authority's ("TRA") decision on a preliminary point that the Commissioner's SOP was issued within the response period (two months) set out in section 89AB(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The application alleged that the findings of the TRA were the result of errors of law and should be judicially reviewed. The plaintiff sought a ruling that the Commissioner did not issue her SOP within the response period.

The plaintiff first filed a notice of appeal in the High Court on 30 August 2012 against the decision of the TRA, but withdrew the appeal two months later when he accepted that no appeal right on a preliminary point was available under section 26A of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 ("TRAA").

### Decision

#### Discretion

**_(i) Tannadyce_**

Woolford J began by considering the decision in _Tannadyce v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153, and observed that the Supreme Court had concluded that judicial review should only be available where the statutory procedures for tax disputes could never be invoked. His Honour noted that, in the present case, the statutory procedures had already been invoked and are on-going, with a date for the substantive hearing not having been set yet.

Woolford J further noted that the hearing of the preliminary point, before the substantive hearing, did not preclude the plaintiff from including the preliminary point in any future appeal under section 26A of the TRAA should the TRA's substantive decision be adverse to the plaintiff. He concluded that the plaintiff would be able to have his day in court, just not yet.

**_(ii) Withdrawn appeal_**

Woolford J also concluded, after reviewing the plaintiff's withdrawn notice of appeal, that the application for judicial review was the appeal recast into allegations that the TRA erred in law.

**_(iii) Objective of legislation_**

His Honour observed that the statutory procedures (disputes and challenges) are designed to resolve disputes in a just, expeditious and economical way. This legislation would be frustrated if judicial review were available in respect of all preliminary points decided prior to the substantive hearing.

Woolford J therefore declined the application for judicial review as a matter of discretion.

#### Error of law

In addition, his Honour concluded that the TRA had not made an error of law.

The Court dismissed the plaintiff's submission that the previous version of section 14(7) of the TAA applied because the dispute had commenced before the amendment to section 14(7) and the previous version did not allow the Commissioner to issue her SOP by facsimile without the plaintiff's consent. Woolford J, in agreeing with the TRA's finding, noted that section 14 applies when the TAA requires the Commissioner to give a notice, thus the amended section 14(7) applies to both existing and new disputes. His Honour observed that section 14(7) (both in its previous and present forms) is a procedural provision that does not give rise to a right or duty in terms of section 17 of the Interpretation Act 1999.

Secondly, the Court rejected the plaintiff's submission that the High Court Rules ("HCRs") apply in relation to the service of the Commissioner's SOP, which should therefore be treated as being served on the subsequent working day (rule 6.6(3)) because it was served after 5 pm. The plaintiff based this submission on the fact that he made an application to the High Court for an extension of time to issue his SOP under section 89M(11) of the TAA. By agreeing in a joint memorandum in that application to file the Commissioner's SOP on 19 January 2010, the plaintiff submitted that the issuance of the Commissioner's SOP was governed by the HCRs. The Court considered rule 6.1 of the HCRs and concluded that as the TAA, not the HCRs, governed the issuance of a SOP, thus the plaintiff's submission was flawed.

Finally, the Court disagreed with the plaintiff's submission that, based on section 11 of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002, the faxed SOP should have been taken to be received on 20 January 2010 as it was the date the facsimile came to the attention of the plaintiff. The Court held, drawing an analogy to receipt by post, that the SOP should be treated as having been served at 11.07 pm when it was facsimiled.

In conclusion, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's application both as a matter of discretion and on its merits.

Application for leave to commence proceedings after expiry of response period dismissed
=======================================================================================

2007 case note - applicant sought to commence proceedings out of time - expiry of response period, exceptional circumstances.

Case

Decision Number 5/2007

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994; section 138D.

### Summary

The applicant sought leave from the Authority to commence proceedings out of time, on the grounds exceptional circumstances applied. The Authority decided that no exceptional circumstances existed and dismissed the application.

### Facts

In about 2000, a dispute developed between the parties over tax payable in the 1994 and 1995 years. There were dealings between the applicant's solicitors and the investigator based in Nelson, IRD Wellington and the Crown Law Office. The in-house accountant received copies of all communications between the parties but generally such communications took place between the applicant's solicitor and the Department.

The Department sent a letter to the applicant's solicitor on 20 April 2006 to advise notices of assessment would be issued shortly. The letter also noted that the assessments would be sent directly to the applicant. A copy of the letter was sent to the in-house accountant, and the external accountant. The assessments issued on 27 April 2006. The applicant failed to commence proceedings before the response period expired on 26 June 2006, but did so on 10 August 2006.

The in-house accountant received the assessments on either 28 April or 1 May 2006, but took no action until 8 May 2006. That appeared to be due to the investigator having telephoned the external accountant in relation to the assessments, and the external accountant telephoning the in-house accountant who said he had received them and would contact the external accountant to discuss them.

In mid June 2006, the external accountant reminded the in-house accountant he had not forwarded on the assessments. The in-house accountant undertook to do so, but did not attend to that until 26 June 2006, the last day of the response period.

### Decision

1.  The applicant relied on four factors which it said amounted to exceptional circumstances beyond its control and provided it with reasonable justification for its failure to commence proceedings in time:
    1.  That there were very long delays between a process being agreed to between the parties and the IRD issuing the assessments.
    2.  The communications from the IRD suggested it would take a next step without any next step then following.
    3.  That the IRD were in the practice of forwarding copies of documents to, and primarily dealing with the applicant's solicitors, but did not do so with regard to the assessments.
    4.  That printing on the back of the notices of assessment recorded that the applicant had a four month period in which to challenge the assessments.

The submission for the Department was that there was no causal link between any of these factors, and the applicant's default, which arose from repeated failures of its agents.

The Authority accepted the IRD submission that any delays by it prior to issuing the assessments cannot be said to be the cause of the in-house accountants failure to properly consider correspondence copied to him, or to re-familiarise himself with the agreed process and to follow the matter up within two months.

The Authority noted the letter of 20 April 2006 from IRD made it clear the Commissioner would be issuing the assessments shortly. Thus any delays by the IRD prior to 20 April 2006 were irrelevant to the present situation.

The Authority also accepted an IRD submission that the facts did not show that the investigator indicated he would do something and then fail to do it.

On the facts, the Authority placed no weight on the fact the notices of assessment were sent directly to the inhouse accountant. There was no lack of control of the situation by the applicant. He also noted that this event or circumstance did not reasonably justify the default, as the letter of 20 April 2006 could not be clearer as to where the notices of assessment would be posted.

The Authority also found that the reference to a four month period on the back of the notices of assessment applied only to the issue of a NOPA and not to disputing the assessment by filing a challenge. He also noted those procedures do not apply where a tax audit has occurred, and the notices of assessment stated repeatedly "amended as per investigation."

Application for recall of TRA decision
======================================

2011 case note - confirms the limited grounds on which a decision may be recalled and that it is not appropriate to recall a decision that is also under appeal.

Case

TRA 42/03, 105/04, 23/05, 54/05 and 38/07 \[2011\] NZTRA 6

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant was not successful in the recall application. Due to an appeal having being lodged by the disputant, the Taxation Review Authority "TRA" is functus officio. Further, the decision relied upon by the disputant to justify the recall application was irrelevant.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms the limited grounds upon which a decision may be recalled and that it is not appropriate to recall a decision that is also under appeal.

### Facts

On 25 February 2011 the disputant applied to the TRA to recall Judge Barber's decision dated 1 February 2011 reported as \[2011\] TRA 2 "the Decision" and, on the same date, appealed the Decision to the High Court. The Decision struck out the disputant's challenges against assessments of income tax for the 1997 to 2005 income tax years. The proceedings related to the Trinity scheme.

The disputant applied to recall the Decision based on the following:

1.  The case of _Telstra New Zealand Holdings Ltd v CIR_ (2011) 25 NZTC 25,068 (HC) ("_Telstra_"); a purported new judicial decision of relevance, had not been drawn to Judge Barber's attention.
2.  There was an alleged abuse of process and the TRA was bound by previous Trinity decisions to accept his right to recall. The disputant submitted that his right to recall was directly covered by the High Court and Court of Appeal in the substantive Trinity proceedings (who purportedly refused to accept the Commissioner's submissions that they had no jurisdiction to hear a recall application filed nine months after the substantive challenge appeal was lodged).
3.  His Honour did not have jurisdiction to strike out challenges on the merits.

The Commissioner's position in respect of this application was that:

1.  the disputant's decision to appeal had taken the matter out of the TRA's hands as it was functus officio and was unable to take further action in respect of this matter
2.  the recall application was, in any event, unfounded and was a further demonstration of the disputant's refusal to accept any adverse judgment, and of his apparent determination to take any opportunity to indefinitely continue litigating Trinity issues.

### Decision

Judge Barber dismissed the disputant's application with reference to the disputant's appeal. Specifically His Honour found that:  

*   As Venning J recognised in Russell v Klinac \[HC Whangarei AP 18/01, 11 December 2001\] at \[27\], it cannot be appropriate for a trial court to revisit an apparently final decision after that decision has been submitted to the "processes of superior courts". That would give rise to the "plainly ... unacceptable" prospect of "the same matter being litigated twice in two Courts at the same time", refer _Redcliffe Forestry Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 (HC) at \[12\] ("_Redcliffe_") \[8\].  
    In this case, the "same matter" is the sustainability of the disputant's challenges in light of the previous Trinity judgments. I have found that the challenges are unsustainable. The disputant must overcome that on appeal. It is "plainly unacceptable", in the words of the current President of the Court of Appeal, for that finding to be revisited before this Authority while the appeal is pending \[9\].  
    Strictly, that view disposes of the disputant's application to recall which I therefore dismiss \[10\] ...

His Honour addressed some of the other matters raised in the application. Judge Barber rejected the disputant's "right to recall" argument finding that:  

*   The disputant acknowledges, the very late recall application in the Trinity challenge proceeding was only possible because the appellants failed to comply with their obligation to seal the High Court judgment promptly after lodging an appeal. The Commissioner (rightly) objected to this conduct but, nevertheless, decided to oppose the application on its merits. The application was heard and dismissed by Venning J on that basis in _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,758 (HC) at \[48\], \[52\]-\[53\] and \[88\]. The Court of Appeal expressed doubt about its own jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a refusal to recall, but was not asked to, and did not, express any view on the jurisdiction of the High Court \[12\].
    

Judge Barber reiterated that the grounds for recall are "strictly limited" and are "to be exercised only in the most limited of circumstances" referring to the recent decisions of _Erwood v Maxted_ \[2010\] NZCA 93 and _Case Z26_ (2010) 24 NZTC 14,380 respectively. For recall to be available on the basis of a new judicial decision, that new decision must either directly or indirectly overrule the decision subject to the recall application by making it "clear" that the decision was "wrong"; _Child Poverty Action Group Inc (CPAG) v Attorney-General_ HC Wellington CIV-2009-404-273, (at \[13\] to \[15\]).

Amongst other findings, it was held that _Telstra_ (which concerned an application by the Commissioner to have a notice of discontinuance set aside on the basis that there was an abuse of process):

1.  was not a Trinity scheme judgment; was not about striking out challenge proceedings; was, so far as relevant, consistent with the authorities cited in the Decision and did not, even according to the disputant, compel a different (or any particular) decision on the merits of the case
2.  did not indicate that the Decision was wrong or bring this case within the limited circumstances where recall was warranted
3.  was no basis for criticising the decision-making process in the Decision, nor any basis for criticising the outcome of that process.

Judge Barber held that the disputant's complaints about the merits of the Decision went to the correctness of that decision and should be pursued by way of appeal.

Application for recall
======================

2006 case note - taxpayer sought an order recalling a prior High Court judgment - Recall Jurisdiction, High Court Rules, re-litigate Statement of Claim.

Case

Clarence John Faloon v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxpayer sought an order recalling a prior High Court judgment of Asher J. The taxpayer essentially re-litigated his complaints contained in his Statement of Claim from Asher J's prior judgment. Referring to the leading case on recall of Wild CJ in Wild CJ in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) \[1968\] NZLR 632, Asher J found that there was no proper basis in which the taxpayer can recall the  
judgment.

### Facts

The Taxpayer filed a statement of claim in the High Court which related to a challenge under s 138F of the TAA 1994 to an assessment of gift duty made by the Commissioner. The claim alleged that the Commissioner had erred in his assessment, and sought directions to alter his decision.

The Commissioner sought to strike out the Taxpayer's claim on the basis that the Taxpayer had no reasonable cause of action against the Commissioner. The proceedings were struck out because Asher J found the Taxpayer had no status to bring the proceeding and he was not a party to the easement in respect of which the ruling was sought, and could not have been regarded as a "Disputant". The judgment for this decision was received on 7 November 2005.

The present proceedings involve the Taxpayer seeking an order recalling Asher J's judgment of 7 November 2005. The Taxpayer's application was made in reliance on Rule 542(3) of the High Court Rules. The Taxpayer's application challenged the judgment of 7 November 2005 and raised numerous points which essentially challenge the conclusions reached, and reiterated his prior Statement of Claim.

The Commissioner filed a Notice of Opposition which did not engage upon the substantive issues raised by the Taxpayer but focused on Rule 542(3). In essence, the Commissioner asserted that the recall jurisdiction was not properly invoked.

The Taxpayer criticised the Commissioner's Notice of Opposition asserting that it had not gone through the notice of application and admitted or denied all of the facts set out therein.

### Decision

Asher J looked at when a decision may be recalled. An application for recall comes under Rule 542(3) of the High Court Rules.

This rule does not set out a guide as to the basis upon which a judgment can be recalled, or indeed what the recall of a judgment empowers a Judge to do. However, the leading case on recall is that of Wild CJ in Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) \[1968\] NZLR 632.

Horowhenua County v Nash (No 2) provided for three categories of recall the third of which gives the Court the ability to recall a judgment for any very special reason which justice requires, and thereby avoid an injustice, or what might otherwise be a more cumbersome and expensive process, such as a retrial.

No attempt has been made to further define the third category. In Brake v Boote (1991) 4 PRNZ 86, the third category was used as the basis for recalling a judgment, the judge considered that on a very special occasion where a judge failed to determine an issue which was properly before the Court, the jurisdiction could be used to correct that error.

While the third category is not defined with particularity in the judgments, it is quite clear that the direction to recall must be exercised with circumspection, and it must not in any way be seen as a substitute for appeal. There are some things which the power of recall does not extend to. It does not extend to a party recasting arguments previously given, and re-presenting them in a new form. It does not extend to putting forward further arguments that could have been raised at an earlier hearing but were not.

The Taxpayer, in his application, sought to do all these things. None of the matters raised in his notice of application and affidavit in support related to developments since the judgment, or a legislative  
provision or authoritative decision of plain relevance which was not referred to. The judgment, being to strike out the statement of claim, was in terms of the order made quite simple and uncomplicated. His Honour held that what the Taxpayer sought in this application was to re-litigate his complaints contained in his statement of claim that was struck out by the High Court on 7 November 2005. No proper basis was put forward by Taxpayer for the recall of the 7 November 2005 judgment.

Asher J also found that the Commissioner's Notice of Opposition complied with Rule 244. Asher J noted that a Notice of Opposition must state the respondent's intention to oppose the application and the grounds of opposition, and contain a reference to any particular provision of an enactment or principle of law or judicial decision on which the respondent relies (Rule 244(3)). It does not have to have the function of a statement of defence, and respond to all the affirmative assertions contained in a Notice of Opposition.

The Taxpayer's application to recall Asher J's decision of 7 November 2005 was therefore dismissed.

Application for restoration to the Register of Companies
========================================================

The applicants sought orders to restore five companies to Register of Companies (“the Register”).

Case

Commercial Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2224

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993 s 329

### Summary

The applicants sought orders to restore five companies to Register of Companies (“the Register”). The Court considered that on balance, the private and public interests favoured restoration of the relevant companies to the Register.

### Impact

The judgment confirms the balancing exercise conducted by the court when considering an application to restore a company to the Register.

### Facts

The applicants sought restoration of the relevant companies relying primarily on the decision of the High Court in _FB Duvall Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC Auckland CIV-2009-404-1193, 15 December 2011, where Ellis J determined that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) had erred in refusing to accept late objections by a number of companies controlled by the late Mr J G Russell or his firm in relation to assessments for GST. In that matter the Commissioner was ordered to accept and consider the objections.

Since that judgment, there have been on-going negotiations between the parties to resolve the dispute. The applicants maintained that other companies, including those that are the subject of this application, are in a comparable position to the plaintiffs in the _FB Duvall_ case and wanted negotiations to include these companies. The Commissioner had advised that no such settlement could proceed, noting that the companies were struck off and no longer existed.

### Decision

The Court confirmed that as the Commissioner was a party to the litigation, she had standing to oppose the application. As for the form of the proceeding, the Court accepted that the application was not “run-of-the-mill” but was not especially complex either factually or legally. The Court noted that as the application, opposition and affidavits along with detailed submissions had been filed, there had been no handicap caused by the format of the proceeding and the better course was to simply dispose of the matter on that basis.

The Court confirmed that the factors the Court should have regard to in an application under s 329 are those set out in _Re Saxpack Foods Ltd_ \[1994\] 1 NZLR 605 (HC).

In particular, the Court referred to the delay of time since the companies were struck off, with his Honour inferring from _Re Saxpack_ that there will be times when an application will fail where there is no reasonable explanation for the delay and the delay may result in prejudice. The five companies in this matter were removed between seven and twenty-two years ago. The Court recognised that these appeared to be extreme periods of time but went on to say that there is an explanation, namely that it was not until the decision in _FB Duvall_ and the negotiations that followed that the need to apply for restoration became apparent to the applicants. Further, his Honour considered that the delay caused no obvious prejudice to the Commissioner. The delay was therefore not a bar to the application albeit the Court stated that such a delay meant it must look carefully at the other relevant factors.

The Court also referred to the fact that s 329(1)(A) provides that the Court is obliged to have regard to the reasons for the company’s removal and whether those grounds still exist. The Court accepted that it was fair to conclude that the grounds for removal from the Register had not changed and that this weighed against restoration.

The Commissioner submitted that as the companies were not carrying on business at the time of removal there was no proper reason for them to be restored. However, the Court held that whether there was a proper reason to order restoration depended on whether it was proper to do so to enable the applicants to test the issue of whether the companies were in the same position as the plaintiffs in _FB Duvall_. His Honour held that this factor weighed in favour of granting the application.

Additionally, the Court did not regard the fact that there was no live issue between the five defunct companies and the Commissioner as being a factor to influence the outcome of this application.

The Court saw the balancing exercise of private and public interests as the dispositive and most difficult aspect of the case. From the perspective of the applicants and the five defunct companies, they clearly envisaged a private advantage to be gained by restoration. The Court also held that there may be a public interest involved too, namely that the restoration of the five defunct companies to the Register would enable five corporate taxpayers - as they would then be - to pursue their rights through the methods available to all taxpayers. The Court stated that the right to do so is fundamental and there is public good in its reinforcement.

The Commissioner referred to the long history of litigation between Mr Russell and the Commissioner, and she submitted that this application was just another example of Mr Russell, and those associated with Mr Russell, looking to prolong meritless claims against the Commissioner.

The Court felt that it would not be appropriate in the context of this application to form any conclusions based on the history of litigation between Mr Russell and the Commissioner, either as to the propriety of the applicants’ motives in seeking to have the five defunct companies restored or as to the merits of the claims they might wish to make. While his Honour accepted that it is not in the public interest that the Commissioner be embroiled in what on its face appeared to be long standing disputes, there was a pre-existing dispute between the _FB Duvall_ plaintiffs and the Commissioner and the marginal cost of including five additional claimants would be minimal.

On balance, the Court’s view was that the private and public interests favoured the making of the orders sought.

Application for strike out granted
==================================

2017 case note - application for strike out of a claim alleging exceptional circumstances granted by the High Court.

Case

Donna Vitasovich v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 1501

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 3, 14, 89H, 89I, 89K, 89M, 138D, 138H, 141A, 141G Income Tax Act 2004 s HK 11

### Summary

On 30 June 2017 the High Court ("Court") gave judgment for the Respondent and granted the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s ("the Commissioner") strike out application under s138H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

The plaintiff disputed her liability for income tax in the years ended 31 March 2004, 2005 and 2006. In this proceeding she seeks that her "alleged debt" be cleared and that the exceptional circumstance provision under s89K of the TAA be invoked. The Commissioner disagreed and sought to strike out her claim.

The Court struck-out the plaintiff’s claim, and awarded costs on a category 2B basis.

### Impact

Disputants must engage in the statutory disputes process. As the plaintiff did not file a Statement of Position ("SOP") (failing to comply with s89M of the TAA) the Commissioner had established grounds to strike out the proceeding under s 138H of the TAA.

### Facts

The Commissioner assessed the disputant for income tax and shortfall penalties. The Commissioner issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment and the disputant issued a Notice of Response.  The Commissioner issued a SOP and the disputant was deemed to accept the Commissioner's proposed adjustment given the disputant had not issued a SOP. The disputant filed a statement of claim in the High Court in which she claimed that exceptional circumstances had prevented her from filing her SOP within the statutory timeframe.

The Commissioner applied to strike out the claim on the basis that the disputant had not complied with the disputes process and there were no exceptional circumstances which applied in her case.

### Decision

_First cause of action_

Ms Vitasovich denied liability for amounts the Commissioner had assessed on the basis that she was only liable for the market value of the shareholding in the company under s HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The Court held that s HK 11 did not apply as the proceedings were in relation to the disputant's personal tax liability not that of the company.

_Second cause of action_

The disputant asserted that refusing to exercise her discretion not to assess a shortfall penalty was in ignorance of the law and procedures. The Commissioner had failed to acknowledge the disputant's voluntary disclosure and had made disclosures of her details to others which were an alleged maladministration.

Clark J was satisfied that this cause of action was untenable as her Honour was not convinced that any disclosure made satisfied the requirements for full disclosure.

_Third cause of action_

Ms Vitasovich alleged that exceptional circumstances prevented her from issuing a SOP. Under s 89K of the TAA, an exceptional circumstance is an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant that provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not issuing (in this case) a SOP within the response period.

Ms Vitasovich claimed that her exceptional circumstances were:

1.  Wrong advice given to her by the Department;
2.  The Department's failure to acknowledge her voluntary disclosure;
3.  The Department refusing to confer with her;
4.  The fact the Department chose to use a "snail mail" address despite having an email address; and
5.  Handing out her details without permission to undesirable people and foreigners.

Ms Vitasovich went overseas in 2007 and requested that mail be sent to her Auckland address. Her Honour found that the evidence showed that while overseas Ms Vitasovich communicated by email and received correspondence sent to her Auckland address. Ms Vitasovich also confirmed that correspondence was to be by ‘snail mail'. The Court found that notice of the Commissioner's SOP was validly given by posting it to the Auckland address.

 Clark J also held that the evidence did not establish that an exceptional circumstance beyond the disputant's control prevented the disputant from filing her SOP as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of the failure to issue the SOP and in fact had not ever filed a SOP therefore, s 89K was inapplicable.

 _Section 138_

As the disputant failed to comply with s 89M of the TAA, the Commissioner had established the grounds for striking out the proceeding under s 138H.

_Prejudice or delay - amended pleading_

The Commissioner had alleged that the statement of claim was unintelligible and as such would likely cause prejudice or delay. As an alternative to striking out, Clark J considered whether the claim could be amended but found that the defects in the pleadings were such that it was not capable of cure.

Application of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) to Superannuation schemes and workplace savings schemes Please note that this memo does not apply to KiwiSaver funds (and accounts). The Commissioner has already determined that KiwiSaver will be exempt from CRS due diligence and reporting. 1 Purpose of memo The purpose of this memo is to provide guidance on the circumstances where: • superannuation schemes and workplace savings schemes will already be “exempt” “Non-Reporting Financial Institutions” (NRFIs) for the purposes of the CRS for Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), or otherwise will have excluded accounts. The principal focus of this guidance is on the potential application of the “Broad Participation Retirement Fund” (BPRF) exclusion to such schemes 2 . However, this guidance will also address the potential application of the “retirement or pension account” 3 exclusion, and • those superannuation schemes and workplace savings schemes, which are not already exempt for CRS purposes, may want to make a submission to Inland Revenue that they (and/or their accounts) should be exempted. Background In broad terms, the CRS requires that Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions (Reporting NZFIs): • carry out due diligence on their financial accounts to identify relevant foreign tax residents, and • report to Inland Revenue prescribed information about any reportable accounts that they have identified (and certain accounts that the CRS refers to as undocumented accounts). Non-Reporting Financial Institutions The CRS explicitly excludes various types of financial institutions as being NRFIs. These institutions are exempt from CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. Certain excluded accounts, that are also explicitly excluded by the CRS, are also not subject to such requirements. As explained in detail further below, the type of NRFI that is most likely to apply to superannuation schemes and workplace savings schemes is the BPRF category. 4 The definition of BPRF is set out in full in appendix 1 of this memo. 1 See CRS 2017/001 and CRS 2017/002. 2 The “broad participation retirement fund” exclusion is set out in Section VIII(B)(1)(b), as defined in Section VIII(B)(5) of the CRS. 3 The “retirement or pension account” exclusion is set out in Section VIII(C)(17)(a) of the CRS. 4 Alternatively, some smaller schemes could, potentially, come within the definition of “narrow participation retirement fund”, as defined in Section VIII(B)(6) of the CRS. The CRS also provides scope for implementing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) to define other types of financial institutions as being NRFIs, where the entity is not otherwise exempt, if certain specified criteria are met. In broad terms, this would apply if the following conditions are all substantially satisfied: • The financial institution is not otherwise exempt under the CRS • The financial institution presents a low risk of being used to evade tax • The financial institution has substantially similar characteristics to any of the financial institutions described in sub-paragraphs B(1)(a) and (b) of section VIII of the CRS (for example, in this context, the scheme may be substantially similar to a BPRF), and • Defining the financial institution in domestic law as a NRFI will not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will determine what other types of financial institutions are NRFIs (in this way) and publish a corresponding list of these institutions. However, the Commissioner is not able to make a determination that a type or class of financial institution is a NRFI, if it includes institutions that are already exempted for CRS purposes. Therefore, it will be important that any financial institution first considers whether or not it is already a NRFI for CRS purposes before making any submission to Inland Revenue that the Commissioner should determine that it is another low risk entity type of NRFI. Excluded accounts As explained in detail further below, the type of already excluded account that is most likely to apply to superannuation schemes and workplace savings schemes is the retirement or pension account category. The definition of retirement or pension account is set out in full in appendix 2 of this memo. The CRS also provides scope for implementing jurisdictions (such as New Zealand) to define other types of financial accounts as being excluded accounts, where the account is not otherwise exempt, if certain specified criteria are met. In broad terms, this would apply if the following conditions are all substantially satisfied: • the account is a financial account • the account is not otherwise exempt under the CRS • the account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax • the account has substantially similar characteristics to any of the financial accounts described in section VIII(C)(17)(a)-(f) of the CRS (for example, in this context, the account may be substantially similar to an excluded “retirement or pension account”) and • defining the account in domestic law as an excluded account will not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will determine what other types of financial accounts are excluded accounts (in this way) and publish a corresponding list of these accounts. 2 Again, the Commissioner is not able to make a determination that a type or class of financial account is an excluded account, if it includes accounts that are already exempted for CRS purposes. Application to superannuation schemes and workplace savings schemes This guidance will now outline how these CRS exemptions apply to superannuation schemes and workplace savings schemes. Superannuation schemes Some superannuation schemes may already come within the definition of BPRT, and therefore be, excluded NRFIs. This could be on the basis that: (a) they are employment based retirement funds (b) they do not have a single beneficiary with a right to more than five per cent of the fund’s assets. Superannuation schemes are likely to satisfy this requirement - ie not have a single beneficiary which owns more than 5% of the fund’s assets) (c) they are subject to government regulation (superannuation schemes will satisfy this requirement) 5 (d) They provide information reporting to Inland Revenue (superannuation schemes are likely to satisfy this requirement), 6 and (e) they satisfy at least one of the following requirements 7 : • distributions or withdrawals from the scheme are generally allowed only upon the occurrence of specified events related to retirement, disability, or death, or • the scheme receives at least 50% of its total contributions from sponsoring employers 8 , or • contributions by employees to the scheme are either limited by reference to earned income of the employee, 9 or may not exceed USD/NZD 50,000 annually. 5 Superannuation schemes are subject to government regulation such as Anti-Money Laundering (the Anti - Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 – unless exempt) and financial markets regulation (the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013). 6 The reference in this context to information reporting to the Inland Revenue relates to information reporting by a BPRF to the Inland Revenue - such as providing regular information about their account holders (refer to paragraph 37, page 168, of the CRS commentary) e.g. prescribed investor rate (PIR) taxation, and employer’s superannuation contribution tax. 7 Inland Revenue does not consider that superannuation schemes are tax favoured due to their status of retirement or pension plans. Therefore, sub-paragraph (c)(i) of the CRS definition of BPRF is unlikely to be satisfied. However, only one of the four requirements in sub-paragraph (c) needs to be satisfied. As noted in this memo, the “withdrawal” and “contribution” criteria in (c)(ii), (iii), and (iv) are the most likely to be satisfied for such schemes. 8 In determining whether an employer makes the majority of the contributions to the fund, transfers into the fund from excluded pension and retirement funds and accounts can be ignored. However, other employee contributions, and transfers from other funds or schemes, must be included in this calculation. 3 A superannuation scheme that already comes within the definition of BPRT will be a NRFI as defined in the CRS, and will not have any CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. Any superannuation scheme that does not fully meet the definition of BPRF in the CRS (and is not otherwise exempted) 10 is able to make a submission to Inland Revenue that it should be treated as a NRFI, on the basis that: • the scheme is a financial institution • the financial institution is not otherwise exempt under the CRS • the financial institution presents a low risk of being used to evade tax • the financial institution has “substantially similar characteristics” to any of the financial institutions described in sub-paragraphs B(1)(a) and (b) of section VIII of the CRS (for example, the submission may be that the scheme is substantially similar in characteristics to a BPRF), and • defining the financial institution in domestic law as a NRFI (i.e. by way of a determination by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue) will not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. Please ensure that any submission covers all of these key criteria. Please send submissions via: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz. If a superannuation scheme does not meet the definition of BPRF (and is not otherwise exempted) you should also consider whether the financial accounts that the scheme maintains are either excluded “retirement or pension accounts” coming within Section VIII(B)(17)(a) of the CRS 11 (please see appendix 2 to this memo for a full definition of such accounts) or are potentially excluded because of being substantially similar to such “retirement or pension” accounts. If you consider that a superannuation scheme’s accounts are substantially similar to such excluded “retirement or pension” accounts (in this way) please include the reasons for this view in your submission, covering the following points: • why the account is a financial account • Why the account is not otherwise exempt under the CRS • why the account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax • why the account has substantially similar characteristics to any of the types of excluded accounts in section VIII(C)(17)(a)-(f) of the CRS (for example, the submission may be that the account of such a superannuation scheme is substantially similar to an excluded “retirement or pension account”), and • why defining the account in domestic law as being an excluded account will not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. 9 The Inland Revenue considers that employee contributions which are calculated by reference to the employee’s earned income, and deducted from an employee’s salary, satisfy the “earned income” requirement. 10 For example, some smaller schemes could potentially come within the definition of “narrow participation retirement fund” set out in Section VIII(B)(6) of the CRS. Some government retirement or pension funds will also already be exempted under the CRS (see, for example, Section VIII(B)(1)(b) ). 11 This is the type of excluded account that is most likely to be relevant to superannuation schemes. 4 Workplace savings schemes Some workplace savings schemes may already come within with the definition of BPRF, and therefore be, excluded NRFIs. This could be on the basis that they: • are employment based retirement funds • do not have a single beneficiary with a right to more than five per cent of the fund’s assets (workplace savings schemes are likely to satisfy this requirement – ie not have a single beneficiary which owns more than 5% of the fund’s assets) • are subject to government regulation (workplace savings schemes will satisfy this requirement) 12 • provide information reporting to Inland Revenue (workplace savings schemes are likely to satisfy this requirement); 13 and • satisfy either 14 of the following: o The scheme receives at least 50% of its total contributions from their sponsoring employers; or o Contributions by employees to the scheme are either limited by reference to earned income of the employee, or may not exceed USD/NZD 50,000 annually. A workplace savings scheme that already comes within the definition of BPRF in the CRS will be a NRFI, and will not have any CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. Any workplace savings scheme that does not fully meet the definition of BPRF in the CRS (and is not otherwise exempted) 15 is able to make a submission to Inland Revenue that it should be treated as a NRFI on the basis that: • the scheme is a financial institution • the financial institution is not otherwise exempt under the CRS • the financial institution presents a low risk of being used to evade tax • the financial institution has substantially similar characteristics to any of the non- reporting financial institutions described in sub-paragraphs B(1)(a) and (b) of section VIII of the CRS (for example, the submission may be that the scheme has substantially similar characteristics to a BPRF), and 12 Workplace savings schemes are subject to government regulation such as Anti-Money Laundering (the Anti - Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 – unless exempt) and financial markets regulation (the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013). 13 The reference in this context to information reporting to the Inland Revenue relates to information reporting by a BPRF to the Inland Revenue - such as providing regular information about their account holders (refer to paragraph 37, page 168, of the CRS commentary) e.g. prescribed investor rate (PIR) taxation, and employer’s superannuation contribution tax. 14 The Inland Revenue considers that workplace savings schemes are not tax favoured due to their status of retirement or pension plans and are unlikely to satisfy the withdrawal criteria in the definition of BPRF. Therefore, sub-paragraph (c)(i) and (c)(iii) of the definition of BPRF are unlikely to be satisfied. However, only one of the four requirements in sub-paragraph (c) needs to be satisfied. As noted in this memo, the “contribution” criteria in sub-paragraphs (c)(ii) and (iv) are the most likely to be satisfied for such schemes. 15 For example, some smaller schemes could potentially come within the definition of “narrow participation fund” set out in section VIII(B)(6) of the CRS. Some government retirement or pension funds will also already be exempted under the CRS (see, for example, CRS Section VIII(B)(1)(b)). 5 • defining the financial institution in domestic law as a NRFI will not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. Please ensure that any submission covers all of these key criteria. Please send submissions via: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz . \[If a workplace savings scheme does not meet the definition of BPRF (and is not otherwise exempted) you should also consider whether the financial accounts it maintains are either: excluded “retirement or pension accounts” coming within Section VIII(B)(17)(a) 16 of the CRS (please see appendix 2 to this memo for a full definition of such accounts) or are potentially excluded because of being substantially similar to such “retirement or pension accounts”. If you consider that a workplace savings scheme’s accounts are substantially similar to such excluded “retirement or pension accounts” (in this way) please include the reasons for this view in your submission covering the following points: • why the account is a financial account • why the account is not otherwise excluded from the CRS • why the account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax • why the account has substantially similar characteristics to any of the types of excluded accounts in section VIII(C)(17)(a)-(f) of the CRS (for example, the submission may be that the account maintained by a workplace savings scheme is substantially similar to an excluded retirement or pension account), and • why defining the account in domestic law as being an excluded account will not frustrate the purposes of the CRS\]. 16 This is the type of excluded account that is most likely to be relevant to workplace savings schemes. 6 Appendix 1 – Definition of Broad Participation Retirement Fund (a type of non- reporting financial institution) The term “Broad Participation Retirement Fund” means a fund established to provide retirement, disability, or death benefits, or any combination thereof, to beneficiaries that are current or former employees (or persons designated by such employees) of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered, provided that the fund: a) does not have a single beneficiary with a right to more than five per cent of the fund’s assets; b) is subject to government regulation and provides information reporting to the tax authorities; and c) satisfies at least one of the following requirements: i) the fund is generally exempt from tax on investment income, or taxation of such income is deferred or taxed at a reduced rate, due to its status as a retirement or pension plan; ii) the fund receives at least 50% of its total contributions (other than transfers of assets from other plans described in subparagraphs B(5) through (7) or from retirement and pension accounts described in subparagraph C(17)(a)) from the sponsoring employers; iii) distributions or withdrawals from the fund are allowed only upon the occurrence of specified events related to retirement, disability, or death (except rollover distributions to other retirement funds described in subparagraphs B(5) through (7) or retirement and pension accounts described in subparagraph C(17)(a)), or penalties apply to distributions or withdrawals made before such specified events; or iv) contributions (other than certain permitted make-up contributions) by employees to the fund are limited by reference to earned income of the employee or may not exceed USD 50000 annually, applying the rules set forth in paragraph C of Section VII for account aggregation and currency translation. 7 Appendix 2 – Definition of excluded “retirement or pension account” (a type of excluded account) a) a retirement or pension account that satisfies the following requirements: i) the account is subject to regulation as a personal retirement account or is part of a registered or regulated retirement or pension plan for the provision of retirement or pension benefits (including disability or death benefits); ii) the account is tax-favoured (i.e. contributions to the account that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from the gross income of the account holder or taxed at a reduced rate, or taxation of investment income from the account is deferred or taxed at a reduced rate); iii) information reporting is required to the tax authorities with respect to the account; iv) withdrawals are conditioned on reaching a specified retirement age, disability, or death, or penalties apply to withdrawals made before such specified events; and v) either (i) annual contributions are limited to USD 50 000 or less, or (ii) there is a maximum lifetime contribution limit to the account of USD 1 000 000 or less, in each case applying the rules set forth in paragraph C of Section VII for account aggregation and currency translation. A Financial Account that otherwise satisfies the requirement of subparagraph C(17)(a)(v) will not fail to satisfy such requirement solely because such Financial Account may receive assets or funds transferred from one or more Financial Accounts that meet the requirements of subparagraph C(17)(a) or (b) or from one or more retirement or pension funds that meet the requirements of any of subparagraphs B(5) through (7). 8

Application of the foreign investor tax credit rules to foreign investment PIEs
===============================================================================

2012 legislative changes apply the supplementary dividend tax credit rules (or FITC rules) to foreign investment PIEs.

_Sections HM 5, HM 17, HM 35, HM 55FB, LP 2, RF 8 and schedule 6, table 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007_

These changes apply the supplementary dividend tax credit rules (also known as the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules) to foreign investment PIEs. This more closely aligns the tax treatment of non-resident portfolio investments made through foreign investment PIEs with that of portfolio investments made directly.

### Background

In broad terms, the FITC rules ensure that the New Zealand tax rate on non-resident portfolio investment is limited to the company tax rate.  

The rules achieve this by allowing a New Zealand company to pay a "supplementary dividend" to portfolio non-resident investors to offset non-resident withholding tax payable on imputed dividends from the company. The company receives a tax credit equal to the supplementary dividend paid. The supplementary dividend is based on the amount of imputation credit attached to the dividend. This means the FITC rules apply to the extent that company tax has already been paid.

Previously, the FITC rules were only available to non-residents that made portfolio investments directly into New Zealand companies. As a result, non-residents investing through New Zealand PIEs were disadvantaged compared with those investing into New Zealand companies directly. Applying the FITC rules to foreign investment PIEs removes this distortion.

### Key features

*   Applying FITC is optional for foreign investment PIEs.
*   The FITC mechanism applies at the level of the company paying the dividend to the foreign investment PIE.
*   A FITC is only available when a New Zealand-resident company pays a dividend and related supplementary dividend to a foreign investment PIE that has notified foreign investors that have a less than 10% interest in the resident company and have a double tax treaty tax rate of 15% or more (these investors are referred to as "qualifying investors").
*   The PIE must notify the company before the dividend distribution of the qualifying investors that it had on the date on which the legal entitlement to the dividend was determined. Notification enables the company to calculate and distribute the supplementary dividend to the qualifying investors.
*   A supplementary dividend must only be paid when attached to a fully imputed dividend (or to the part of the dividend that is imputed) and is attributed to notified foreign investors that qualify for the payment of a supplementary dividend, unless the PIE chooses to pay NRWT on dividends.

### Detailed analysis

#### Tax credits for supplementary dividends

_Section LP 2_

Section LP 2 allows a tax credit for supplementary dividends when a New Zealand-resident company pays a dividend and related supplementary dividend to a foreign investment PIE when:

*   the foreign investment PIE has notified foreign investors that have less than a 10% voting interest in the company, and the foreign investors have a double tax treaty tax rate on the dividends and supplementary dividends of 15% or more (these investor are referred to as "qualifying investors"); and
*   the dividend and related supplementary dividend are attributed to these qualifying investors, or the PIE chooses to pay NRWT on the dividends; and
*   the foreign investment PIE notifies the company of the qualifying investors it had on the date on which legal entitlement to the dividend has been determined.

#### Notification requirements

_Section HM 55FB_

To enable the payment of supplementary dividends, it is necessary for the foreign investment PIE to notify the company paying the dividend of the qualifying investors it had on the date on which legal entitlement to the dividend has been determined.  
The notification must be made after the company has declared a dividend but before the payment of the dividends. The information must be sufficient to enable the calculation and payment of a supplementary dividend. The company is also required to use the information supplied by the PIE in calculating the supplementary dividend.

#### NRWT calculation option

_Section HM 44B_

The foreign investment PIE can choose to pay NRWT on the dividends and related supplementary dividends when the PIE:

*   receives dividends with imputation credits attached;
*   receives related supplementary dividends;
*   has "qualifying investors";
*   pays the qualifying investors the total amount of the dividend and supplementary dividend; and
*   pays the amount by the required time.

#### Rights to investment proceeds

_Sections HM 5, HM 17, HM 35 and schedule 6, table 1B_

The dividend and related supplementary dividend must be attributed to the qualifying investors. The entire amount of the dividend and the supplementary dividend is taxed at 15% as PIE income if the NRWT option has not been chosen.

This ensures that if NRWT has not been paid, the tax credit for supplementary dividends paid is clawed back at the PIE level.

**Application date**

The new rules apply from 2013-14 and later income years.

2016 case note - Taxation Review Authority decision on a preliminary time bar issue dismissing the disputant's claim.

Case

TRA 019/15 \[2016\] NZTRA 08

Legislative References

Section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This is a decision of the Taxation Review Authority on a preliminary time bar issue dismissing the disputant's claim in relation to the application of time bar provisions to the assessments in respect of the disputant's 2001-2005 tax years.

### Impact

The decision provides clarification on the interaction between ss 108 and 108B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). In particular, the decision reinforces the wide powers that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") has to reopen the time bar pursuant to s 108(2) of the TAA where the required opinion has been formed. 

### Facts

This decision concerns preliminary issues raised by the disputant regarding the application of the time bar provisions in relation to a challenge commenced in 2015.

In October 2006 an investigation was commenced into the disputant's tax affairs for various income tax years including the 2001-2005 tax years.  Following a lengthy investigation, the Commissioner commenced the disputes process in March 2010.

In October 2010 during the conference phase of the disputes process, a notice of time bar waiver ("the waiver") was signed. The waiver recorded that the existing time bar for the 2001-2005 tax years of 31 March 2011 would be waived for 12 months to 31 March 2012.

In August 2013 the Commissioner issued a Statement of Position in which she contended that the disputant's taxable income had been understated and that she was able to reopen the time bar for the relevant tax years on the grounds that the returns were fraudulent or wilfully misleading or alternatively they failed to mention income.

Following the conclusion of the disputes process the Commissioner made amended assessments on the basis that:

1.  amounts deposited into various business and personal bank accounts were the disputant's assessable income as dividend income; employment income; income under ordinary concepts; or beneficiary income from a trust; and
2.  one or other of the time bar exceptions in s 108(2) of the TAA applied to allow the Commissioner to amend the disputant's self-assessments so as to increase the amount assessed. 

### Decision

_Onus of proof_

The disputant contended that, as the Commissioner alleges evasion in terms of s 141E of the TAA, the onus of proof rests with the Commissioner in accordance with s 149A(2) of the TAA. 

Judge Sinclair held that the onus of proof rests on the disputant because the Commissioner relies on both of the exceptions in s 108(2) of the TAA (one of which does not rely on fraudulent or wilfully misleading conduct). Notwithstanding the above, Judge Sinclair noted that the question of onus is irrelevant given that the Authority is not being asked to make any evidential findings in this preliminary matter. 

_Issue 1_

Judge Sinclair, having noted that ss 108 and 108B of the TAA perform different functions, found that by signing the waiver the parties agreed to delay the time bar specified in s 108 of the TAA for a period of 12 months. Her Honour did not consider that by agreeing to the waiver the parties agreed to a consensual limitation period which cannot be extended. 

Judge Sinclair considered that there is no restriction under s 108B of the TAA as to the circumstances when the Commissioner and a taxpayer can agree to a time bar waiver. Her Honour agreed with the Commissioner that it would be an absurd situation if a taxpayer could agree to a waiver which then imposed a limitation period that had the effect of removing the ability of the Commissioner to lift the time bar where tax returns filed by a taxpayer were later found to be fraudulent or wilfully misleading or that assessable income had not been mentioned.

Judge Sinclair did not agree with the disputant's submission that s 108B(1B) of the TAA indicates ‘implicitly' that the extended period provides a limitation to any disputed matter known to the parties. Judge Sinclair found that this subsection relates specifically to circumstances where the ground was not identified and known to the parties and that, as such, it does not follow that where a ground is known, the parties have agreed to a new limitation period.  

Judge Sinclair also noted that s 108(3) of the TAA makes it clear that the time limits which apply are those set out in s 108(1) and (2) of the TAA.

_Issue 2_

Judge Sinclair considered the history of the time bar period under s 108(2) of the TAA and, in particular, the provisions of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1968 ("the 1968 Act"). Pursuant to the 1968 Act, the time bar period was amended from 10 years to provide that (where the Commissioner has formed the required opinion) it shall be lawful for the Commissioner to amend an assessment to increase the amount at any time. Judge Sinclair found that the purpose of the amendment was clearly to remove any time limitation period which would bar the Commissioner from amending an assessment where s 108(2) of the TAA applied.

Judge Sinclair disagreed with the disputant's submission that the calculation of the four year period under s 108(1) of the TAA should be fixed from the date the Commissioner formed the required opinion. In this regard Judge Sinclair considered the text of s 108(2) of the TAA to be clear and unambiguous in its meaning - no time period is specified and nor can one otherwise be implied.

_Issue 3_

Judge Sinclair, noting that the Commissioner has wide powers under s 108(2) of the TAA, did not consider that the Commissioner's exercise of her right to make amended assessments in any way breached her obligation under s 6 of the TAA to maintain the integrity of the tax regime.

Application to debar Crown Law from acting
==========================================

2013 case note - Application to debar Crown Law from acting in Trinity Scheme proceedings – tax avoidance, removal/rebar, Crown Law Office.

Case

Accent Management Ltd & Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006

### Summary

An unsuccessful appeal by the taxpayers of the High Court judgment dismissing their application to debar Crown Law from acting for the Commissioner in certain proceedings relating to the Trinity tax avoidance scheme.

During the appeal the principal focus became whether the protocol, between the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Solicitor-General, allowed sufficient independence and in particular whether Crown Law could meet their obligations under rule 13 of the Client Care Rules. Dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held the issue under rule 13.5.3 is whether the Solicitor General and Crown Law can discharge their duties to the Court and even on the taxpayers' interpretation of the protocol they could clearly comply with their obligations to the Court.

### Impact of Decision

This decision considers the protocol between the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Solicitor-General. The Court of Appeal held that the protocol allows both parties to act with sufficient independence so that Crown Law can meet their obligation to the Court and the Commissioner does not delegate her assessment power.

### Facts

This appeal relates to the Trinity tax avoidance litigation. The Trinity scheme taxpayers had claimed deductions for the 1997 and 1998 tax years under subpart EG of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA"), but the Commissioner disallowed the deductions on the basis of section BG 1 and imposed penalties. The Supreme Court upheld the Commissioner's decision in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 (_"Ben Nevis"_). During the course of the hearing in the Supreme Court, some of the taxpayers sought leave to argue, for the first time, that deduction and spreading issues should have been determined under subpart EH of the ITA, rather than subpart EG. The Court declined to hear those arguments.

Some of the investors in the Trinity scheme have continued to litigate various issues and this was an appeal against a decision of Woodhouse J, in the High Court, dismissing the applications made by the taxpayers for orders that the Crown Law Office ("Crown Law") be debarred from acting for the Commissioner in various proceedings to which the taxpayers and the Commissioner are parties (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Accent Management Ltd_ \[2012\] NZHC 1430, (2012) 25 NZTC 20-130).

The application to debar Crown Law was primarily based on allegations that Crown Law could not act with the required degree of independence and could not comply with its duties to the Court. This was because Crown Law had allegedly colluded in assessments being made fraudulently or knowingly on the basis of Part EG rather than EH and had wrongly maintained that position in the _Ben Nevis_ proceedings.

As well as dismissing the taxpayers' application, Woodhouse J also awarded indemnity costs against them. Both of these rulings were challenged on appeal.

### Decision

In oral argument before the Court of Appeal, Dr Muir for the investors reduced considerably the scope of the appeal. The allegation that Crown Law was insufficiently independent of the Commissioner to meet its professional obligations under rule 13.5 of the Client Care Rules became the principal focus of the appeal. For the sake of completeness, the Court also addressed other issues raised in the written submissions.

#### _Was Crown Law sufficiently independent?_

The Court considered that their assessment of the merits of the argument required them to consider the terms of a protocol in place between the Solicitor-General and the Commissioner ("the protocol").

The protocol states that the Solicitor-General is "the Crown's principal professional legal adviser", and, as part of this role, the Solicitor-General has responsibility for "determining the Crown's view of what the law is and conducting the Crown's litigation in the Courts". The Commissioner is "an independent officer of the Crown" and in performing his or her functions he or she will at times require legal advice on the meaning of the law.

The protocol records that Crown Law and Inland Revenue will "respect each other's roles" and "must work together with the aim of ensuring that \[both departments\] have consistent positions on the interpretation and application of tax laws".

Dr Muir's argument focused on part 5 of the protocol. Dr Muir said that clauses 5.1 and 5.2 of the protocol provided that the Solicitor-General had an absolute discretion over the conduct of litigation involving the Commissioner. He submitted that this meant that Crown Law was not independent from the Commissioner when conducting litigation. In effect Crown Law was both client and advocate.

Dr Palmer for the Commissioner replied that the protocol simply reflected constitutional orthodoxy. He submitted that clause 4.1 sets out that the Commissioner will consult the Solicitor-General on legal issues, but under clause 4.3, the Commissioner retains independence for determining how Inland Revenue will apply the Solicitor-General's advice. He went on to submit that part 5 of the protocol simply reflect that the Solicitor-General is constitutionally responsible for conducting the Crown's litigation.

Dr Muir submitted that by giving the Solicitor-General the final say in the conduct of litigation involving the Commissioner, the Commissioner unlawfully delegated the Commissioner's powers under sections 6 and 6A Tax Administration Act 1994. This meant that the Solicitor-General and Commissioner were too closely entwined for the Solicitor-General to comply with his or her duties to the Court under rule 13 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008 (the Client Care Rules).

The Court held that Dr Muir's argument was flawed in two respects. First, clause 4.3 of the protocol makes it clear that how the Commissioner applies the law is left to the Commissioner; the Commissioner does not delegate her assessment power. Second, the issue under rule 13.5.3 is whether the Solicitor-General and Crown Law can discharge their duties to the Court. Even if Dr Muir's interpretation of the protocol was correct, clauses 5.1 and 5.2 make it clear that the Solicitor-General is free to conduct litigation as he or she chooses. The Solicitor-General is thus free to comply with his or her obligations to the Court.

The Court considered that the protocol set out the boundaries of a consultative working relationship between the Solicitor-General and Commissioner, reflecting their constitutional roles. The Commissioner is an independent officer of the Crown and clause 4.3 of the protocol recognises that the Commissioner retains independence in determining how Inland Revenue will interpret the law. Litigation against the Commissioner is litigation against the Crown and so it is constitutionally proper that the Solicitor-General should have the final say about how litigation involving the Commissioner is conducted as recognised in clauses 5.1 and 5.2 of the protocol.

The Court concluded that the answer to this ground of appeal was that there was nothing in the protocol that raised a risk that Crown lawyers would not be able to discharge their professional obligations in the extant challenges. The Court concluded that there was nothing to suggest that Crown Law would have any "compromising influences or loyalties" (rule 5) that would prevent it from acting.

**_Was there an estoppel preventing Woodhouse J from considering the application of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 and the Client Care Rules to Crown Law?_**

Woodhouse J did not find that there was an estoppel. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the taxpayers had no reasonably arguable factual foundation for their allegations against Crown Law.

**_Was Woodhouse J correct to award indemnity costs against the taxpayers?_**

The Court reiterated that the award of indemnity costs is the exercise of a judicial discretion, as set out in rule 14.6(4)(a) of the High Court Rules, and held that the taxpayers did not demonstrate that Woodhouse J erred by acting contrary to principle, disregarding a material factor or being wholly wrong.

The Court considered this appeal proceeding also a further step in the "gaming" referred to by Woodhouse J in the High Court and considered that the present proceeding is one in a long line of attempts to re-litigate the _Ben Nevis_ proceedings, and another attempt to make allegations of fraud and concealment against the Commissioner and Crown Law that have already been dealt with.

The appeal was dismissed and indemnity costs awarded to the Commissioner.

Application to extend time for SOP dismissed
============================================

Two companies were in dispute with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue concerning GST input credits and had two months to issue Statements of Position in response to the Commissioner’s SOPs.

Case

Vicente Badillo Lopez v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2329

Legislative References

High Court Rules 2016; Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Two companies were in dispute with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) concerning GST input credits and had two months to issue Statements of Position (“SOPs”) in response to the Commissioner’s SOPs. Vicente Lopez, the sole director and shareholder of both companies, applied in his own name to extend time for the companies to issue their SOPs. The Commissioner successfully applied to dismiss Mr Lopez’s application, both for lack of jurisdiction (the companies should have applied, not Mr Lopez) and, even if the companies had made the application, it would not have succeeded as the grounds in s 89M(11) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) for an extension of time were not met.

### Impact

It is the taxpayer company, not a director or shareholder, that must apply under s 89M(11) of the TAA for an extension of time to issue a SOP.

An application for an extension of time under s 89M(11) must include an allegation that there are issues in dispute that have not been previously discussed between the Commissioner and taxpayer. Even if there is such an allegation, the Court will consider whether, factually, the issues in dispute have been previously discussed or the taxpayer has been given ample opportunity to raise and discuss any issues but has not pursued those opportunities.

### Facts

The applicant, Vincente Lopez, was the sole director and shareholder of Galaxy Private Transport Ltd and Mars.XXX Ltd (“the Companies”). The Companies were in dispute with the Commissioner (GST input credits and income tax) and the Commissioner had issued SOPs to each Company respectively.

Mr Lopez applied to the High Court for a year’s extension under 89M(11) of the TAA to reply to the SOPs issued by the Commissioner, and, in the alternative, on the basis of exceptional circumstances under 89K of the TAA.

The Commissioner opposed the application on the grounds that the Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the application:

Mr Lopez had purported to file an originating application when he requires the Court’s leave to do so under r 19.5 of the High Court Rules (“the HCR”). Without such leave the proceeding is invalid;

The appropriate applicants are the Companies and there should be a separate application from each company, rather than a single application from Mr Lopez;

Mr Lopez, who is not a barrister or solicitor, is unable to bring an application on behalf of the companies under the _Mannix_ rule (_Re GJ Mannix Ltd_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 309 (CA)), without leave of the Court.

### Decision

The Court noted that any issues between the Commissioner and the Companies can only be resolved in proceedings to which they are parties. There is no dispute under Part 4A of the TAA between Mr Lopez and the Commissioner, rather any disputes are between the Companies and the Commissioner.

It is the Companies which must seek the extension of time and they have not done so. The proceeding does not provide a jurisdictional basis to grant an extension of time to the Companies and Mr Lopez’s application therefore failed on procedural grounds.

For completeness the Court considered the substantive merits of the extension application (putting aside that the application was made by Mr Lopez, not the Companies), with the principles relevant to a strikeout being considered. Rule 15.1(1)(a) of the HCR provides that the court may strike out all or part of a pleading if it discloses no reasonably arguable cause of action, defence, or case appropriate to the nature of the pleading. The Court may dismiss a proceeding on the same basis.

Under 89M(11) of the TAA an extension must be applied for before the expiry of the response period and it must have been unreasonable to respond within the response period due to there being issues not previously discussed. While Mr Lopez had filed the application before the expiry of the response period, the grounds relied on did not include an allegation that the issues in dispute were not previously discussed. Nor would such a submission, if made, appear sustainable in light of the evidence filed by the Commissioner.

There was substantial correspondence between the Inland Revenue and Mr Lopez, on behalf of the companies, and he had been given several opportunities to supply information, discuss the audits and explain what the claimed GST expenses related to; meetings had been arranged which Mr Lopez refused to attend. Input credits were allowed where clear explanations and/or verifiable proof was given of the claimed expenditure.

As Mr Lopez had had ample opportunities to raise and discuss issues in dispute with the Commissioner, but did not pursue those opportunities, the Court found that, therefore, s 89M(11) of the TAA did not appear to apply.

The Court also noted that the “exceptional circumstances” exception in s 89K of the TAA which Mr Lopez relied on did not apply as the section only becomes operative once a taxpayer (belatedly) submits a SOP to the Commissioner. As the Companies have not filed their respective SOPs they were not in the position to request the Commissioner to exercise her discretion to treat the SOPs as if they had been filed within the appropriate response period.

Accordingly, even if Mr Lopez were able to overcome the procedural obstacles, the Commissioner’s strike out application would have succeeded on substantive grounds.

The Court dismissed Mr Lopez’s application and awarded costs.

Application to raise new propositions of law and issues dismissed
=================================================================

2015 case note - section 138G(2) Tax Administration Act 1994 must be met before applicant can raise new propositions of law and new issues in challenge proceedings.

Case

TRA 018/12 \[2015\] NZTRA 17

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This was an application of the disputant to raise new propositions of law and new issues in challenge proceedings. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found that the disputant had not identified any propositions of law or new issues that the disputant could not have discerned with due diligence at the time of delivery of his Statement of Position (“SOP”). Accordingly, the application was dismissed.

### Impact

The Authority must be satisfied that s 138G(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) has been met before an applicant can raise new propositions of law and new issues in challenge proceedings.

### Facts

This was an application brought by the disputant, pursuant to s 138G(2) of the TAA, to raise new propositions of law and new issues in the challenge proceeding.

The disputant sought to raise new propositions of law and new issues relating to a purported finding at paragraph \[6\] in a judgment of Williams J, delivered in August 2013. The August 2013 case was an appeal from a decision of the Environment Court.

The disputant also made oral and written submissions with other propositions of law and new issues that the Authority addressed.

### Decision

The disputant’s application under s 138G(2) of the TAA was dismissed.

**_New propositions of law and new issues raised in notice of application_**

The disputant wished to raise in his challenge, new propositions of law and new issues related to the judgment of Williams J at paragraph \[6\], which states:

*   \[6\] In 1977, TLL built the 410 metre diversion of the Kawau Stream accordingly (I call this the \[name\] diversion to differentiate it from the runway diversion). The appellant’s father piped 205 odd metres of the downstream end of the diversion before his death in 1977, and the appellant completed the upstream section after his father’s death. This section was not piped. The appellant used open channelling.

The Authority found that there were no findings of fact at paragraph \[6\] of the judgment of Williams J. Furthermore, it simply formed part of the narrative which Williams J considered was necessary to set out before considering the matters for determination in that case.

The disputant made oral submissions that the statement made by Williams J at paragraph \[6\] is particularly significant having regard to the definition of land inserted into the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 with effect from 1 April 2011. As the goods and services tax (“GST”) periods subject to this proceeding predate 1 April 2011, the Authority found that the definition has no application.

The disputant stated that the judgment of Williams J referred to the disputant’s late father and the disputant as joint “special powers” for the 1977 year diversion of the Kawau Stream in four “private lands” in Palmerston North. The Authority agreed with the Commissioner that the disputant’s submission in this regard was misleading and wrong. The Authority noted that there was certainly no finding of the existence of a joint “special power” made in the judgment of Williams J.

The Authority concluded that the disputant had not identified any propositions of law or new issues that the disputant could not have discerned with due diligence at the time of delivery of his SOP.

**_Other propositions of law and new issues raised in the disputant's submissions_**

_Aviation-related service_

The disputant submitted that he was supplying an “aviation related service” as defined in s 2 of the Civil Aviation Act 1990 to the \[named\] airport on every day of every year since 1977.

The Authority agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that if the service has been provided since 1977, the issue of whether the disputant has been providing such a service is not one which he could not, at the time of delivery of his SOP, with due diligence, have discerned. Accordingly, the Authority found that that the disputant’s application in respect of this alleged issue also failed at the first stage under s 138G(2).

_Alleged trustee income under s 93B of the TAA_

The disputant submitted that the Authority may determine in a fair and reasonable manner the amount of trustee income of the disputant, for each year since 1977 under s 93B(1)(e) and s 93B(2) of the TAA.

The Authority found that s 93B provides that the Commissioner may assess a trust for income tax not a Taxation Review Authority (the powers of a Taxation Review Authority are set out in s 138P of the TAA). The Authority also noted that this proceeding is not about income tax and therefore s 93B is not relevant.

_Section HR 6(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The disputant claimed that failing an agreement between the airport operator and the Commissioner, a Taxation Review Authority may determine disputes concerning value or timing under s HR 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Authority found that any question in respect of value of assets or timing issues for the purposes of income tax must be resolved by agreement between the Commissioner and the airport operator, or failing agreement, the Commissioner (not a Taxation Review Authority).

Furthermore, the Authority noted that this provision involves the assessment of income tax, which is not relevant in this case.

_Trustee income_

The Authority noted that the disputant’s submission under this heading was somewhat difficult to follow and found that the current proceeding concerned the disputant’s GST claims for specific periods and did not involve any other GST-related matters. The Authority therefore found the issue not relevant.

Application to set aside bankruptcy notice declined
===================================================

2015 case note – High Court declined application - proposal, bankruptcy notice, just and equitable, public interest, integrity of the tax system.

Case

John George Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 2006

### Summary

The High Court declined Mr Russell's application for approval of payment terms of $1,000 per week. Accordingly, the High Court declined to set aside the bankruptcy notice issued to Mr Russell by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner").

### Impact of decision

The duty to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax does not mean the Commissioner is required to accept any repayment proposal made to her. Preserving the integrity of the tax system and promoting compliance by other taxpayers are engaged when considering whether to set aside a bankruptcy notice.

### Facts

Mr Russell owes the Commissioner, his sole creditor, a debt of over $400 million as a result of tax liabilities, penalties and interest accrued over a period of years.

Mr Russell applied to the High Court to exercise its discretion and approve his proposal in respect of his judgment debt and to set aside a bankruptcy notice issued by the Commissioner in respect of his proposed bankruptcy.

Mr Russell's proposal was:

1.  to pay the Commissioner $1,000 per week for the rest of his life; and
2.  to permit the Commissioner to prove in his deceased estate for the remainder of any debt claimed to be owing to her at the time of his death.

Mr Russell had previously made a proposal to the Commissioner on terms substantively similar to the current proposal that was refused and Mr Russell was not successful in his subsequent application to have the refusal judicially reviewed.

The Commissioner opposed the proposal on the basis that she not only has a duty to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax but also to preserve the integrity of the tax system, including promoting taxpayer compliance.

### Decision

The Court acknowledged that in reality Mr Russell's proposal is concerned with a disguised write-off of a massive debt owed to the Commissioner, which he openly acknowledges neither he nor his estate can pay.

Mr Russell's application was made on a somewhat confused basis. Initially he purported to rely on s 29(1)(b)(iii) of the Insolvency Act 2006, contending that the subsection required the Commissioner to accept an adequate compromise if one were made. At the hearing it became clear that Mr Russell's argument was that he was unable to pay the debt, he had made an informal proposal for a modest part-payment and that should be sufficient justification for the Court to exercise its discretion so as to pre-empt Mr Russell being adjudicated bankrupt.

The Court does have an inherent jurisdiction to set aside bankruptcy notices but this is aimed at preventing serious abuses of processes arising from procedural defects. No allegation made in this case could found an application under that inherent jurisdiction.

Associate Judge Sargisson identified issues of res judicata and issue estoppel as the present application traversed almost exactly the same ground as the judicial review proceedings. If the High Court here were to reach a conclusion that would allow Mr Russell to impose his proposal on the Commissioner, it would amount to a collateral attack on the High Court and Court of Appeal judgments in the judicial review.

Mr Russell also contended that the Court should consider how the debt came about, that it was attributed to him as a debt he was responsible for despite actually being incurred by various companies and this was a factor that weighed against allowing the bankruptcy to proceed. Associate Judge Sargisson found that to do so would be a collateral attack on decisions of the Taxation Review Authority, High Court, Court of Appeal, as well as possibly the Supreme Court and she cannot, and will not, differ from the Courts' previous conclusions on the legitimacy of the debt.

In response to Mr Russell's argument that bankruptcy would not be a just and equitable outcome, Associate Judge Sargisson found his arguments unconvincing. Though the Commissioner has a duty to recover as much tax as possible, that does not mean accepting any proposal made to her. The goals of preserving the integrity of the tax system and promoting compliance by other taxpayers are reasonable ones. The Court agreed with the Commissioner that in the present situation where Mr Russell has knowingly engaged in large-scale tax avoidance over a period of years and wasted large amounts of public money on unmeritorious challenges, the broader public interest considerations are clearly not to set aside the bankruptcy notice.

The Court noted how the core tax debt was a very small proportion of the total debt, but the situation was one of Mr Russell's own making created by his failure to recognise the core debt and either pay it or reach a compromise with Inland Revenue at an early stage.

Mr Russell's "informal" proposal was demonstrably not a ground for setting aside the bankruptcy notice. Associate Judge Sargisson dismissed the application, declined to set aside the bankruptcy notice issued by the Commissioner and held that the Commissioner may proceed with filing an application for adjudication.

Application to set aside freezing order granted and indemnity costs awarded against Commissioner
================================================================================================

2013 case note - Application to set aside freezing order over bank accounts granted and indemnity costs awarded against CIR.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Marcus Seymour Dymock and Charlotte Jane Dymock \[2013\] NZHC 3346

Legislative References

n/a

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") obtained freezing orders over the defendants' bank accounts on 14 November 2013. However, prior to the application being made, and unbeknown to the Commissioner, the defendants had transferred sufficient funds to cover the assessments back to the liquidator of the assessed companies. The defendants' application to set aside the freezing order was granted and indemnity costs awarded against the Commissioner.

### Impact of decision

There is a responsibility on parties who apply for a freezing order ex parte to ensure the Court is properly informed. This responsibility is not discharged by saying that they were relying on someone else to keep them up to date.

### Facts

This decision relates to an application by the defendants to set aside an ex parte freezing order over funds of $462,000 held by the second defendant ("Mrs Dymock") in a personal account.

The first defendant ("Mr Dymock") was the sole shareholder of three related companies. The companies were placed into voluntary liquidation on 25 June 2013. At the date of liquidation, two of the companies had, between them, $1.3 million in funds from the proceeds from a sale of land. In mid-August 2013, an interim distribution of $1.3 million was made to Mr Dymock as sole shareholder.

The Commissioner contends that the two companies are related by common ownership to the original owner of the land, the third of the Dymock companies. On 1 November 2013, the Commissioner issued default assessments for the two companies totalling $462,018.92. The Commissioner considered that the full $1.3 million should be returned to the liquidator. However, the liquidator only sought $450,000 from Mr Dymock to be added to the $25,000 he already held. The combined total of which would therefore meet the default assessment if that proved to be the liability.

The Dymocks agreed to return $450,000, but there were complications in the funds being transferred, resulting in delays. The liquidator said he would update the Commissioner when the funds had been transferred. He did not do that. As it happens, the money did arrive at the liquidators on 4 November 2013.

The Commissioner sought to obtain undertakings from the liquidator that the money be preserved to satisfy her debt. The undertakings were not provided.

On 8 November 2013, the Commissioner filed an ex parte application for a freezing order over funds of up to $462,000 in Mr and Mrs Dymock's bank accounts. The order was granted on 14 November 2013.

Complications with the implementation of the freezing order meant that instead of only $462,000 being frozen, all funds in the accounts were frozen. Mrs Dymock encountered difficulties in paying for expenditure. On 18 November 2013, revised orders were sought limiting the freezing order to one specific account owned by Mrs Dymock.

### Decision

#### Whether there was a need for the freezing order

In reliance on section 301 of the Companies Act 1993, the Commissioner submitted that she was not in control of the sum sought in the substantive proceedings. It was also submitted that more money may be needed as there is an on-going investigation, the liquidator's fee to take into account and the tax losses said to be available not yet being accepted.

The Court found that the purpose of the substantive proceeding was fulfilled. The Court noted that the Commissioner was the only creditor, suggesting her ranking as creditor in the liquidation would remain unchallenged. The Commissioner's desire for the sum to be more was considered irrelevant by the Court as nothing beyond $462,000 had been sought. The Court found that there was no basis for the continuation of the freezing order and it was subsequently discharged.

#### Whether there was a risk of dissipation

In her application for a freezing order, the Commissioner had argued that there was a risk of dissipation on the basis that (a) the assets were liquid assets, (b) Mr Dymock had gone to the Netherlands, (c) Mr Dymock had a poor history of tax compliance, and (d) there was an on-going investigation.

The Court was satisfied that the Commissioner had failed to establish a risk of dissipation. This view was supported by the fact that Mr Dymock had returned to the country before the application was filed, the audit investigations did not add any worth as a factor indicating risk and, in respect to his history of tax compliance, Mr Dymock always paid assessments once finalised.

In respect of the Commissioner's description of Mr Dymock's tax history as one of "poor tax compliance", the Court noted that more care was needed with the language used and the claims made. Specifically, the Court stated that "more objectivity is required, and a clear basis for any such claim articulated" (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Marcus Seymour Dymock_ \[2013\] NZHC 3346 at \[25\]).

#### Whether the application was misleading

The Court identified a number of errors in the affidavit filed in support of the freezing order that were "significant, avoidable, and troubling", and which suggested "a lack of objectivity and care that should not be found in a document filed to support _ex parte_ orders of this type" (at \[36\]).

#### Whether indemnity costs should be awarded

The Court found a combination of factors made an award of indemnity costs appropriate. These factors were that:

1.  there was no sound basis for the orders once the liquidator received funds to a sum equivalent to that sought in the proceedings;
2.  enquiries should have been made as to the location of the funds prior to the application being filed in the Court;
3.  the unsubstantiated claim that Mr Dymock may have left New Zealand permanently, although not deliberate, is at the upper end of misleading the Court.

Application to stay judgment pending appeal dismissed
=====================================================

2013 case note - sets out the law and factors to be balanced when considering whether a stay of a proceeding should be ordered – liquidation.

Case

Bristol Forestry Venture Ltd and Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 and Judicature Act 1908, schedule 2, High Court Rules

### Summary

The plaintiffs had previously unsuccessfully applied to have the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") statutory demands set aside. This application was to stay the orders of the judgment of Faire AJ, pending the hearing and determination of an appeal. The plaintiff's application was refused.

### Impact of decision

This judgment sets out the applicable law and the factors to be balanced when considering whether a stay of a proceeding should be ordered.

This judgment also confirms the position that due to the debt being owed and not paid within the ordered time frame of 10 working days by the plaintiffs, the Commissioner is entitled to make an application for the liquidation of the companies.

### Facts

On 12 September 2013, Faire AJ declined the plaintiffs' application to set aside the statutory demands. Faire AJ ordered that the plaintiffs pay the sums claimed in the respective statutory demands and if they failed to make the required payments within ten (10) working days of the judgment, the Commissioner could make an application to put the companies into liquidation.

The plaintiffs have filed an appeal against the judgment of Faire AJ based on the grounds that one, the tax liability of the plaintiffs has not been finally determined as there is an outstanding application by the plaintiffs to set aside the 2004 Venning J decision _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 22 NZTC 19,027, and two, that the Commissioner is not a creditor.

The plaintiffs now apply for orders seeking to:

1.  extend the time for payment until ten (10) working days after the Court of Appeal has delivered its decision; or alternatively
2.  stay the orders of the judgment of Faire AJ, pending the hearing and determination of the appeal.

### Decision

#### Extension of time pursuant to r 1.19 of the High Court Rules

The Court noted that this matter was considered by Bell AJ, who made an order on 31 May 2013 as follows:

*   I make an order under s 290(3) of the Companies Act 1993 extending the time for compliance with the statutory demands until a decision is given on the application under s 290 to set aside the statutory demands.

Faire AJ held that if the judgment of 12 September 2013 was to be stayed, pending the hearing of the appeal, the order made by Bell AJ would apply and time would be extended by his order without the need for the possible and questionable intervention of rule 1.19(2) of the High Court Rules.

#### Stay of the orders sought in reliance on r 12 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005

Faire AJ was required to balance the two principles set out in _Duncan v Osborne Building Ltd_ (1992) 6 PRNZ 85 (CA) at \[87\], as well as consider the matters set out in _Keung v GBR Investment Ltd_ \[2010\] NZCA 396, \[2012\] NZAR 17.

After considering these matters, Faire AJ found as follows:

1.  The status of the plaintiffs will ultimately depend on whether an application to appoint a liquidator is filed and its outcome. The right of appeal will not be rendered nugatory by a refusal of a stay.
2.  There is a risk of prejudice and injury to the Commissioner if the stay is granted; if the liquidation of the companies is the ultimate outcome, any delay will prejudice the remedies available to a liquidator and therefore the benefits that might accrue to creditors.
3.  The public interest favours the refusal of a stay. Faire AJ made this conclusion after hearing the submissions of counsel for the Commissioner. The Commissioner submitted that there was a public interest in maintaining the integrity of the tax system, and in not allowing meritless litigation to consume public resources and delay the collection of tax that has been determined to be due after taxpayers have exhausted their challenge rights.
4.  The plaintiffs have no intention of paying or providing security for the debt, despite the Supreme Court judgment. The balance of convenience favours a refusal of a stay in this case.
5.  The debt arose following the upholding of decisions by the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. The debt was accordingly due on the thirtieth day following completion of the final appeal in relation to the challenge to the assessment. This first ground of the plaintiffs' appeal is not soundly based.
6.  The new ground sought to be introduced, that the Commissioner is not a creditor, is a novel argument. A final view on the issue is not expressed and the plaintiffs will need leave from the Court of Appeal to raise this further ground. This ground is not a significant factor in determining whether a stay should be granted in this case.

Faire AJ accordingly held that a stay, pending the appeal, should not be granted. The plaintiffs' application was refused and costs were reserved.

Application to stay liquidation proceedings
===========================================

2014 case note - Court held that the CIR entitled to bring proceedings as a creditor - Trinity, liquidation, stay proceedings.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Court dismissed the defendant's application to stay liquidation proceedings brought by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"), finding the Commissioner was a creditor for the purposes of recovering tax and further that the application to appoint liquidators was not an abuse of process.

### Impact of decision

The Court held that the Commissioner is entitled to bring these proceedings as a creditor.

The judgment reinforces the points made in _Raynel v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583 (HC) ("_Raynel_") and _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd_ \[2014\] NZHC 1746 regarding the Commissioner's obligation to preserve the integrity of the tax administration system in enforcement/recovery proceedings. In this case, although recovery was unlikely, the integrity of the tax system provided a sound justification for liquidation proceedings.

### Facts

Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd ("Redcliffe") was a party to a forestry venture (known as the Trinity scheme) which was held to be a tax avoidance scheme by the High Court (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC)), Court of Appeal (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 230; (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323 (CA)) and Supreme Court (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115; \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289). The Commissioner applied to appoint a liquidator in respect of unpaid tax assessments confirmed by the Supreme Court. This proceeding concerned Redcliffe's application to stay those proceedings.

### Decision

#### _Is the Commissioner a creditor?_

Courtney J referred to, and relied upon, similar applications brought by Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd and Bristol Forestry Venture Ltd (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd_ \[2014\] NZHC 1746) in which she had to consider the same arguments. Her Honour concluded that section 156 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") conferred creditor status on the Commissioner for the purposes of bringing liquidation proceedings under section 241 of the Companies Act 1993.

Her Honour also noted that the Court of Appeal has rejected a similar argument by Redcliffe (and others) made in appeals against Associate Judge Faire's (as he was then) decision not to set aside statutory demands issued by the Commissioner (_Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZCA 349).

#### _Are the liquidation proceedings an abuse of process?_

Her Honour referred to _Raynel,_ where Randerson J considered that section 6A(3) of the TAA prevailed over other provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts, including section 176 of the TAA; and that the obligation to collect the highest net revenue was not an absolute one. The Commissioner was also required to have regard to the available resources, the importance of promoting compliance by all taxpayers and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers.

Her Honour, agreeing with Randerson J, considered that Redcliffe, not trading and having no assets, had engaged the Commissioner in expensive litigation and held that, as a consequence, there is no abuse by the Commissioner in seeking to have liquidators appointed.

#### _Is there a genuine dispute and should a stay be granted pending the outcome of outstanding appeal?_

Her Honour noted that the outstanding appeal against Associate Judge Faire's refusal to set aside a statutory demand, which the applicant was referring to, has now been dismissed.

Referring to Associate Judge Faire's finding that there was no basis on which to find a genuine dispute as the position had been finally determined by the Supreme Court in 2008, her Honour found that tax is due under assessments confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008 and the application to appoint liquidators is part of that process.

Her Honour also held that the existence of an appeal against the decision not to set aside the statutory demand is not a good reason for staying the proceedings.

#### _Is there prejudice to the Commissioner in granting the stay?_

The defendant submitted that there was no prejudice to the Commissioner in granting the stay as Redcliffe is not trading and there are no assets at risk of dissipation. However, her Honour did not find this submission to be persuasive, stating that so long as Redcliffe's status remains undetermined, the Commissioner will continue to incur costs in relation to the litigation pursued by this insolvent company.

The High Court dismissed the defendant's stay application.

Tono ki tētahi whakaritenga utu harangote Apply for an instalment arrangement
=============================================================================

An instalment arrangement is a formal debt repayment plan. It’s for debt you cannot pay in full by the due date, or overdue debt.

By keeping to the agreed repayment plan you may stop us taking further collection action. You can set up an instalment arrangement to repay your debt in set amounts weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. 

If you’re paying with internet banking you do not need to set up a direct debit agreement. You still need to request an instalment arrangement for any debt you cannot pay in full before the due date.

Any overdue debt balances may cause use of money interest (UOMI) and penalties. You can find more information about penalties and interest on our website.

[Applying the FIF rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012/applying-the-fif-rules "Applying the FIF rules")

Applying FIF calculation methods to indirect interests in foreign companies
===========================================================================

2012 Order in Council covers applying FIF calculation methods to indirect interests in foreign companies.

_Sections EX 50(6), EX 50(7) and EX 50(7B)_

In many cases, a person will own shares in a foreign company which itself owns shares in a second foreign company.

If the shares represent an interest in a CFC, the person is always required to "look-through" that CFC to determine if the second foreign company is a CFC (in which case the investor would apply the CFC rules), or an attributing interest in a FIF (for which the investor would apply a FIF calculation method).

However if the first company is not a CFC, the requirement to "look-through" to the second foreign company depends on whether the person uses the attributable FIF income method for that company and whether an exception to the "look-through" rule applies.

If the fair dividend rate, cost, comparative value or deemed rate of return method is used for a FIF, any foreign shares held by that FIF are not subject to the FIF rules (as in most cases the FIF rules only apply to direct interests in foreign companies. (See section EX 29(2).)

If the attributable FIF income method is used for a foreign company, the default position is to "look-through" this foreign company and apply the FIF rules to any shares that the company holds in other foreign companies. This is achieved by the formula in sections EX 50(6) and (7) and is consistent with the previous rules that applied under the branch equivalent method.

**Example**

NZ Co uses the attributable FIF income method for FIF 1. NZ Co will generally have to "look-through" their direct interest in FIF 1 and apply a FIF calculation method to their indirect interest in FIF 2.

![An example of CFC teat groups and FIF test groups.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/c/2cc612804c0a26ac847badc74b7f9625/page-28.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214406&hash=69A0906251FF42182EABA36A08B3CFB8)

However, there are several important exceptions to the "look-through" rule in section EX 50(6). These are listed in section EX 50(7B).

Consider a person with an interest in a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method. The FIF holds shares in a second foreign company. The person will need to consider if any of the exceptions in section EX 50(7B) apply. If, so they will not need to apply the FIF rules to the second foreign company.

One case where the FIF rules do not apply is when the person's  indirect interest in the second foreign company would satisfy the requirements of the section EX 35 exemption for foreign companies that are resident and subject to tax in Australia (see section EX 50(7B)(c)). For example, this condition could be met when a person owns 20% of a US company that owns 50% of an Australian company (a 10% indirect income interest).

Another case is when the person can demonstrate that the second foreign company is able to apply and pass the active business test (see section EX 50(7B)(a)(i)). Note that the second foreign company would have to satisfy the requirements for applying the attributable FIF income method and applying the active business test.

Alternatively, a person will not need to apply a FIF attribution method to a second-tier company if that company has been included in the same test group as another FIF which has applied and passed the active business test when that test is applied on a test group basis (see section EX 50(7B)(a)(ii)). For the FIF and the second foreign company to be part of the same FIF test group the FIF would have to have a more than 50% voting interest in the second foreign company as well as meet several other requirements (see the previous section on the "Requirements for applying the active business test to a FIF test group").

In cases where a FIF has less than a 50% voting interest in a second foreign company, the person will not be able to include the FIF and the second foreign company in the same FIF test group. However, section EX 50(7B) allows the person to apply a modified version of the active business test to the FIF, which includes additional amounts relating to the FIF's shareholdings in other foreign companies. If the FIF passes both the ordinary active business test and the modified test, then the person will not need to attribute FIF income from any foreign companies whose amounts have been included in the modified test.

The FIF must first pass the active business test, excluding these additional amounts. It then performs the accounting-based active test in section EX 21E a second time, this time including the additional amounts that are reported in the FIF's accounts and that relate to the FIF's non-controlling interests in other foreign companies. More specifically, for the second test, the following amounts are included in the "added passive" and "reported revenue" items:

*   Amounts which are recognised in the FIF's profit or loss accounts under the equity method in accordance with New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 28 (NZIAS 28) or an equivalent IFRSE, or an equivalent US GAAP standard or principle. These amounts should show up in the accounts as the share of the associate's profit.
*   Amounts which are recognised in the FIF's profit or loss accounts under proportionate consolidation in accordance with NZIAS 31 or an equivalent IFRSE, or an equivalent US GAAP standard or principle. These standards may apply when the FIF has income from a joint venture investment.
*   Any dividends and net fair value changes are recorded under NZIAS 39 or an equivalent IFRSE, or equivalent US GAAP standard or principle. Note that because the definition of NZIAS 39 includes an equivalent standard issued in its place, this reference will include NZIFRS 9 when this standard replaces NZIAS 39. Note also that, when a taxpayer includes a dividend as part of the "added passive" item, this dividend cannot also be included in the "removed passive" item. (Normally, most dividends can be included in the removed passive item and therefore ignored for the purpose of the active business test.)  This is achieved by section EX 50(4B)(l).

The above amounts will be net amounts (so they could be negative). The active business test usually only considers gross amounts.

**Example**

NZ Co invests into a 50/50 joint venture in Ireland (Ireland FIF) which holds 50% of the shares in a UK FIF, 20% of the shares in a US FIF and 10% of the shares in a German FIF.

![An example of CFC teat groups and FIF test groups.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/7/27c0d6004c0a29c0848eadc74b7f9625/page-29.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214407&hash=CBD4B0EF37A0FB6037A41EE80F8077C9)

The Ireland FIF has $1,000 of sales income and $20 of interest income and so has a result of 2% after applying the formula in section EX 21E(5). This means the Ireland FIF passes the active business test as an independent company. As a consequence, NZ Co does not attribute income from the Ireland FIF.

|     | Ireland FIF accounts |
| --- | --- |
| _Income_ |     |
| Sales | 1,000 |
| Less cost of goods sold | 800 |
| Profit | 200 |
| _Other income_ |     |
| Interest | 20  |
| **Active business test** |     |
| Reported Passive | 20  |
| Added Passive | 0   |
| Total Passive | 20  |
| Total Revenue | 1,000 |
| % Total Passive to Total Revenue | 2.00 |

NZ Co must now determine whether it needs to apply FIF calculation methods with respect to its indirect shareholdings in the UK FIF, US FIF and German FIF.

It does this by performing the active business test a second time, but this time it adds the amounts that appear in the Ireland FIF's accounts that relate to profits from the UK FIF, the US FIF and the German FIF.

|     | Ireland FIF accounts |     | UK FIF | US FIF | German FIF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | Ireland FIF's shareholding | 50% | 20% | 10% |
| Sales | 1,000 |     |     |     |     |
|     |     | Profit | 70  | \-100 | 100 |

| % Total Passive to Total Revenue | 4.31 |     |     |     |     |

The amounts that go into the formula are total passive of $45 and total revenue of $1,045. This results in a passive income to revenue ratio of 4.31%. Because this result is less than 5%, section EX 50(7B)(b) applies and the investor would not apply a FIF calculation method to the UK FIF, the US FIF or the German FIF.

If this result had been 5% or greater, the NZ Co would be required to apply FIF calculation methods in respect of its indirect interests in the UK FIF, the US FIF and the German FIF. This result only applies for the look-through rule in section EX 50(7B). It does not disqualify the Ireland FIF from being an active non-attributing FIF, so NZ Co would not attribute income from the Ireland FIF.

Alternatively, NZ Co could choose to use a different FIF calculation method for the Ireland FIF (other than the attributable FIF income method). This would mean that income would be attributed from the Ireland FIF, but not from the indirect interests in the UK FIF, the US FIF or the German FIF because the look-through rule in section EX 50(7B) would not come into play.

Applying for child support from a 2007 Child Support convention country
=======================================================================

 New Zealand joined the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance (the 2007 Child Support Convention), on 1 November 2021. This means that if you live in New Zealand and the other parent lives in a 2007 Child Support Convention [member country](/api/glossary/item?id={4D333AA0-3C53-4247-9D29-C8535FFA01D5})
, you can apply for child support through us. Inland Revenue is the [Central Authority](/api/glossary/item?id={BADD0F5B-0C28-4A79-9EDC-B3DB33126C42})
 for New Zealand for the 2007 Child Support Convention.

If the applicant lives in a 2007 Child Support Convention country and the other parent lives in New Zealand 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you and the child live in a member country and the other parent lives in New Zealand, you can either apply through your country's [Central Authority](/api/glossary/item?id={BADD0F5B-0C28-4A79-9EDC-B3DB33126C42})
 or directly to us for a formula assessment of child support. If you apply through your country's Central Authority, they can help you apply and send us the information we need to make the assessment. 

You can find a list of Central Authorities for each member country on the Hague website.

[2007 Child Support Convention Central Authorities](https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/authorities1/print1/?cid=131)

In most cases the country the applicant lives in makes the assessment, but both countries can collect or enforce payments. 

[Formula assessment](/child-support/types/formula-assessment)

If the applicant lives in New Zealand and the other parent lives in a 2007 Child Support Convention country 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you and the child live in New Zealand, you'll need to apply to us for child support. If you were receiving child support in another country, you'll need to let them know when you've applied in New Zealand. 

If you're owed child support and the other parent is in another Hague [member country](/api/glossary/item?id={4D333AA0-3C53-4247-9D29-C8535FFA01D5})
, we can ask the other country to collect the payments. It may take some time before you receive payments, as that country’s collection processes will apply.

[](https://www.ird.govt.nz/child-support/types)
When you're a liable parent living in another [member country](/api/glossary/item?id={4D333AA0-3C53-4247-9D29-C8535FFA01D5})
 and you have a child support assessment from us in New Zealand, you'll need to make your child support payments to us. If you do not keep up with your payments, we may ask the Central Authority in the country you're living in to collect your child support for us.

If you already have an overseas Court Order, Child Support Assessment or formal Agreement for Child Support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're a liable parent living in New Zealand and have been assessed to pay child support in another Hague country, you'll need to make payments to the Central Authority there. However, we may be asked to collect your child support payments on their behalf. If that happens, we'll contact you and collect the payments and pass them on.  

If we're collecting your payments, you'll still need to discuss your child support assessment with the Central Authority in the country that made the court order or assessment. For example, if you have a change in circumstances you will need to contact that Central Authority.  

Domestic Maintenance
--------------------

Domestic Maintenance is called spousal support in the 2007 Child Support Convention.

If you have an order or agreement for maintenance that was made in New Zealand or another member country, you may be able to apply to have it registered and collected on your behalf if the payer is living in another member country.

If you do not have an order for maintenance, you may be able to apply for one.

Te tono i ētahi atu momo whakataunga Applying for other types of rulings
========================================================================

If you need to apply for a different type of ruling, these are the forms to use. Beyond short-process rulings, the other types are:

*   private
*   product
*   public
*   status.

There is also a determination for financial arrangements available here. Our guidance in Binding rulings - IR715 will help you choose the right application.

[Binding rulings IR715 2020 (PDF 101KB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir700---ir799/ir715/ir715-2020.pdf?modified=20200529011650&modified=20200529011650)

  
Private ruling applications
------------------------------

A private ruling gives a single taxpayer or group of taxpayers an interpretation of how the tax law applies to a particular:

*   arrangement
*   person
*   item of property.

A private ruling only applies to the people named in the ruling and is confidential to you and any other applicants. The facts must be exactly as described in the ruling and the people named must satisfy any stated conditions.

[Application for private ruling IR713 2022 (PDF 125KB) Download form](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir700---ir799/ir713/ir713-2022.pdf?modified=20230810034356&modified=20230810034356)

### Advance pricing agreements (APAs)

These are a type of private ruling. APAs represent a co-operative approach to addressing transfer pricing compliance. They can produce significant time and cost savings for both tax authorities and multinationals in comparison with an audit. APAs encourage up-front taxpayer compliance and early resolution of potential disputes. They offer a practical solution to complex cases with difficult facts and circumstances.

APAs are ideally suited to issues involving intangibles and specialised services which can result in a wide range of opinions as to pricing.

[Advance pricing agreements](/international-tax/business/transfer-pricing/practice-issues/advance-pricing-agreements)

Product ruling applications
---------------------------

A product ruling is an interpretation of how the tax law applies to a particular 'product' or 'consumers' of a 'product', that is entered into by several people on identical terms. For example, a product ruling could be given on whether delivery drivers are employees or independent contractors. Product rulings can only be made where it is not practicable to identify the relevant taxpayers and whose characteristics will not affect the content of the ruling.

A product ruling only applies to people who transact as described in the ruling and satisfy all stated conditions.

Public ruling applications
-----------------------------

Public rulings interpret how a tax law applies to a specific type of arrangement that has a wide general application. If your circumstances match those in a public ruling and you meet all requirements in the ruling Inland Revenue is bound to follow it. You may apply it, but you are not required to.

You can suggest tax interpretation topics of broad interest, by emailing us at:

Status ruling applications
--------------------------

If a relevant tax law is amended or repealed, the person who applied for an existing private or product ruling can apply for a status ruling on whether that amendment or repeal changes the way that the law applies in the private or product ruling.

[Application for status ruling IR712 2020 (PDF 75KB) Download form](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir700---ir799/ir712/ir712-2020.pdf?modified=20200507233838&modified=20200507233838)

  
Determinations for financial arrangements
--------------------------------------------

Regarding financial arrangements rules, we can issue taxpayer-specific determinations set out in the legislation. This is only if no general determination applies. We can determine the method for working out:

*   how to spread the income and expenses of a financial arrangement
*   what portion of the income or loss is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement
*   the future value of property.

We may also be able to rule on some of these situations under s91CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994. We treat applications for determinations in the same way as private rulings, except they are published.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

Applying the FIF rules
======================

Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 changes the Foreign Investment Funds rules and how they are applied from 1 Jul 2011.

If an exemption from the FIF rules applies, the normal domestic tax treatment applies. This generally includes taxation of any dividend and taxation of gains on sale if the FIF interest is held on revenue account.

If no exemption from the FIF rules applies, the choice of FIF method determines the tax treatment. In particular, using the new attributable FIF income method means that dividends will not usually be taxable if received by a company. Using the other methods, dividends are usually ignored entirely.

In addition, dividends will usually be taxable when they are received from exempt FIFs (exceptions are dividends received by companies from CFCs or FIFs that satisfy the section EX 35 exemption). In contrast, dividends will usually be exempt if the FIF rules apply (an exception is when a dividend is received by a person who is not a company and that uses the attributable FIF income method for that FIF).

The exemptions from the FIF rules and the foreign dividend exemptions are explained below.

### Application date

Except when otherwise noted, the changes to the FIF rules apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011.

#### Examples

**Example 1**

Company A has a 30 April balance date. For its income year of 1 May 2011 to 30 April 2012 it will continue to apply the previous FIF rules. From its income year beginning 1 May 2012 it will apply the new FIF rules.

**Example 2**

Company B has a 30 June balance date. From its income year beginning 1 July 2011 it will apply the new FIF rules.

**Example 3**

Company C has a 30 October balance date. From its income year beginning 1 November 2011 it will apply the new FIF rules.

Appropriate course for dealing with an allegation that the High Court was functus officio

2011 case note - Allegation that the High Court was functus officio therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine proceeding – High Court Rules.

Case

Redcliffe Forestry Venture Limited & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

This decision concerned the appropriate course to take when the High Court is confronted with an allegation that the High Court was _functus officio_ and thus lacked the jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings.

### Impact of decision

Although this is a procedural decision it concerns the Trinity scheme. The Commissioner is yet to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court or continue with the setting aside application in the High Court, following repleading by the taxpayers.

### Facts

In September 2009 the taxpayers filed a proceeding in the High Court seeking an order to set aside a December 2004 High Court judgment _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC). This was the original High Court judgment (upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court) finding that the Trinity scheme was a tax avoidance arrangement. The Commissioner responded to this setting-aside proceeding by filing a protest to jurisdiction and an application under rule 5.49 of the High Court Rules ("HCRs") for an order dismissing the proceeding.

The Commissioner asserted that the High Court was _functus officio_ and thus lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings and that any application to set aside the 2004 judgment must be made to the Supreme Court.

The taxpayers conversely asserted that the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain their setting-aside proceeding and that there was no restraint on their bringing that proceeding to the High Court.

The setting-aside proceeding pleaded that the Commissioner presented a false case to the High Court in 2004 which resulted in the High Court making an order which it could not legally make and would not otherwise have made.

The High Court (Venning J) concluded that fraud had not been alleged which is a requirement for the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction to set aside the 2004 judgment. The Commissioner's assessments and the High Court's findings of tax avoidance, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, remained valid. The High Court was _functus officio_ and the setting-aside proceeding was dismissed (_Redcliffe Forestry Venture Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 (HC)).

The taxpayers submitted in the Court of Appeal that arguments as to the meaning and scope of the pleadings are to be decided in a strike-out application should the Commissioner make such an application under rule 15.1 of the HCRs. In the High Court, the taxpayers were deprived of any opportunity to re-plead and or present evidence of their claim of fraud.

The Commissioner responded by submitting that (inter alia) the Commissioner was correct to use a protest to jurisdiction as the means of bringing the setting-aside proceeding to an end. The taxpayers had abandoned three Trinity scheme appeals which rendered this setting-aside proceeding moot and an abuse of process which should be struck out. The taxpayers were wrong to submit that the High Court had general jurisdiction to set aside one of its own judgments that had been confirmed on appeal. The High Court did have jurisdiction to entertain an application to set aside the 2004 judgment that it had been obtained by fraud but the taxpayers were alleging error of law on the part of the Supreme Court and not fraud by the Commissioner.

### Decision

The Court stated that had the Commissioner applied to strike out the proceeding it would have been made under rule 15.1 of the HCRs. Such an application proceeds on the assumption that the facts pleaded in the claim are true except where a proceeding alleges fraud. In that case there is an obligation on the plaintiff to produce probative evidence to support the claim of fraud.

The protest to jurisdiction application was made under rule 5.49 of the HCRs. The Court stated that this procedure only concerns the Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine the application or proceeding, not the Court's jurisdiction to grant relief in a proceeding within its jurisdiction.

The Court held that rule 5.49 of the HCRs was not the appropriate vehicle for the Commissioner's challenge to the setting-aside proceeding \[58\].

The Court went on to state that:

*   The question whether the High Court's jurisdiction to set aside its own judgments that have been appealed is limited to cases where fraud is alleged and proved, or is wider in scope, goes to the High Court's jurisdiction to grant the remedy sought by the appellants. But, as we have said, that is not what the rule 5.49 procedure is designed to address \[65\].

Having found for the taxpayers, the Court affirmed that the taxpayers should now be able to amend their pleadings, put forward what they allege as probative evidence of fraud and argue their repleaded case contending that the evidence brings the case within the fraud exception or that the fraud exception should be broadened to encompass their case.

2015

Approval - income tax - currency conversion for branches
========================================================

Determination covers foreign currency conversion methods approved by the CIR for branches – published 2015.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

### Summary

1.  The Act requires foreign currency amounts to be converted to New Zealand dollars to calculate a taxpayer's New Zealand income tax liability.
2.  In some cases, the Act may prescribe a currency conversion method or foreign exchange rate source to use, but in most cases it does not.  Section YF 1(2) applies where the Act does not provide a specific currency conversion method or exchange rate source to use.  It requires taxpayers to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the amount is required to be measured or calculated.

3.  However, the Act gives the Commissioner the power to approve alternative currency conversion methods and foreign exchange rate sources.  The following currency conversion methods have been approved by the Commissioner for branches:
    *   Entities that prepare financial statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (as defined in s YA 1) may use the currency conversion method and rates adopted under IFRS to convert their branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars (the IFRS method).
    *   Non-IFRS taxpayers may use:
        *   the average mid-month exchange rate method;
        *   the average end-of-month exchange rate method;
        *   the mid-month exchange rate method;
        *   the end-of-month exchange rate method; or
        *   the monthly average exchange rate method.

4.  Use of the annual and monthly methods is subject to certain conditions and thresholds that are discussed later in this item. 
5.  Entities using one of the approved currency conversion methods may need to make tax adjustments.  Where relevant, entities using the IFRS method should use the actual amounts, as already converted to New Zealand dollars, in their financial statements (see para \[13\]).  When making tax adjustments under an annual or monthly method, the adjustments should be consistent with the nature of the item being adjusted (see para \[25\]). 

6.  The Commissioner also approves the following alternative foreign exchange rate sources for branches under ss YF 1(5) and YF 2(2), subject to conditions outlined at \[34\] to \[42\]:
    *   [Read the foreign exchange rates.](https://www.ird.govt.nz/how-to/overseas-currency/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
        
    *   The foreign exchange rates published on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand website: www.rbnz.govt.nz.
    *   Foreign exchange rates from one of New Zealand's registered banks.
    *   Any reputable externally-sourced exchange rate that is appropriate given the nature of the branch's business.

7.  All of the methods and exchange rate sources are approved for a foreign branch of a New Zealand entity's business or a New Zealand branch of a foreign entity's business. 
8.  This Approval does not apply to financial arrangements.  Financial arrangements must be converted to New Zealand dollars using the methods and rates prescribed under the financial arrangements rules.
9.  If a taxpayer is using, or would like to use, a method or rate source not outlined in this Approval, the taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner under ss YF 1(5), YF 1(6) or YF 2(2) for approval to use that method or rate source.  (Applications can be emailed to: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
    .)
10.  This Approval updates and replaces "Tax effects of exchange alterations on 21 November 1967" _Public Information Bulletin_ No 44 (February/March 1968), and "How revaluation affects tax" _Public Information Bulletin_ No 75 (November 1973).

### Interpretation

11.  Unless the context otherwise requires, these terms have the following meanings:
    *   "Annual method" means the average mid-month exchange rate method or the average end-of-month exchange rate method.
    *   "Branch" means a division of an entity's business located somewhere other than the head office.  A branch is not a separate legal entity.
    *   "Currency conversion method" means an "annual method", a "monthly method" or the "IFRS method".
    *   "Foreign currency amount" means an amount denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars.
    *   "IFRS method" is the method set out at \[12\]. 
    *   "Monthly method" means the mid-month exchange rate method, the end-of-month exchange rate method, or the monthly average exchange rate method.

### IFRS method

12.  Entities that prepare financial statements that comply with IFRS (as defined in s YA 1) may use the currency conversion method and rates adopted under IFRS to convert their branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars.  When separate financial statements are not prepared for the branch, the IFRS method can be used when the entity (of which the branch is a part) prepares IFRS financial statements that include the branch. 
13.  When making tax adjustments, where relevant, entities should use the actual amounts (as already converted to New Zealand dollars) in those financial statements.
14.  For fixed assets, tax depreciation should be calculated in New Zealand dollars on the New Zealand dollar cost, determined under subpart EW (if applicable), using the cost in New Zealand dollars as per the Statement of Financial Position, or determined using the spot rate on the date of acquisition. 

### Annual methods

15.  The Commissioner has approved two annual currency conversion methods.  These are the average mid-month exchange rate method and the average end-of-month exchange rate method.  The essential difference between the two methods is the rate used to convert the foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars. 
16.  The annual methods can only be used by a branch where the New Zealand group (ie, the branch and any associated New Zealand entities) has an annual turnover of less than NZD$10,000,000.  The threshold has been imposed because the annual methods are a significant departure from the close of trading spot exchange rate (the default position under the Act).  Therefore, the Commissioner has only approved the annual methods for smaller taxpayers.  This should help reduce compliance costs for those taxpayers in circumstances where the variances between the methods are likely to be less significant.

#### _Average mid-month exchange rate method_

17.  The average mid-month exchange rate method converts foreign currency amounts using the average mid-month exchange rate.  This means that instead of converting foreign currency amounts on a daily basis, a branch's income and expenditure can be separately aggregated and converted at the end of the income year. 
18.  The average mid-month exchange rate for the currency conversion is calculated by adding together the exchange rates for the 15th day of each month in the relevant period (usually 12 months) and then dividing that total by the number of months in the relevant period (usually 12) to arrive at a single annual exchange rate.  This exchange rate is then applied to the aggregated foreign currency amounts. 

#### _Average end-of-month exchange rate method_

19.  The average end-of-month exchange rate method converts foreign currency amounts using the average end-of-month exchange rate.  This means that instead of converting foreign currency amounts on a daily basis, a branch's income and expenditure can be separately aggregated and converted at the end of the income year. 
20.  The exchange rate for the currency conversion is calculated by adding together the exchange rates for the last day of each month in the relevant period (usually 12 months) and then dividing that total by the number of months in the relevant period (usually 12) to arrive at a single annual exchange rate.  This exchange rate is then applied to the aggregated foreign currency amounts. 

### Monthly methods

21.  The Commissioner has approved three monthly currency conversion methods.  These are the mid-month exchange rate method, the end-of-month exchange rate method, and the monthly average exchange rate method.  The essential difference between the three methods is the rate used to convert the foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars.

#### _Mid-month exchange rate method_

22.  The mid-month exchange rate method converts foreign currency amounts using the exchange rate for the 15th day of the month.  This means that instead of converting foreign currency amounts on a daily basis, a branch's income and expenditure can be separately aggregated and converted at the end of each month using the exchange rate for the 15th day of the month. 

#### _End-of-month exchange rate method_

23.  The end-of-month exchange rate method converts foreign currency amounts using the exchange rate for the last day of the month.  This means that instead of converting foreign currency amounts on a daily basis, a branch's income and expenditure can be separately aggregated and converted at the end of each month using the exchange rate

#### _Monthly average exchange rate method_

24.  The monthly average exchange rate method converts foreign currency amounts using the average exchange rate for the month.  This means that instead of converting foreign currency amounts on a daily basis, a branch's income and expenditure can be separately aggregated and converted at the end of each month using the average daily exchange rate for the month. 

### Annual tax adjustments under the annual and monthly methods

25.  When using an annual method or a monthly method, entities may need to make tax adjustments.  The adjustments should be consistent with the nature of the item being adjusted.  Items could be adjusted in one of the following ways:
    *   An item could be adjusted using the actual amount converted during the period (eg, reversing out non-deductible legal fees using the New Zealand dollar amount already converted in the Statement of Financial Performance).
    *   An item could be adjusted using the daily rate on the last day of the period for adjustments to items in the Statement of Financial Position (eg, adjustments reversing/including the opening and closing balances of provisions or reserves).
    *   An item could be adjusted using an average annual rate for adjustments that occur throughout the period.
    *   For fixed assets, tax depreciation should be calculated in New Zealand dollars on the New Zealand dollar cost, determined under subpart EW (if applicable), using the cost in New Zealand dollars as per the Statement of Financial Position, or determined using the spot rate on the date of acquisition.

### Conditions for use of currency conversion methods 

26.  If a branch is part of a company that is part of a consolidated tax group (subpart FM of the Act), all companies in the group must also use the chosen currency conversion method to convert their branches' foreign currency amounts.
27.  Where the Act specifies a method to be used for a particular transaction or arrangement, an entity will not be able to use an annual method or a monthly method for that transaction or arrangement.  For example, s EX 57 specifies methods for calculating income or loss for foreign investment funds.  Similarly, any financial arrangements will need to be converted under the financial arrangements rules.
28.  Where a branch has paid foreign income tax, the entity must convert the tax payments to New Zealand dollars at the exchange rate on the date the foreign income tax was paid.  This is because foreign tax credits are allowed under subpart LJ when foreign tax is paid.  

### Notification requirements for currency conversion methods

29.  An entity does not need to notify the Commissioner that it will be using a currency conversion method approved in this item to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars.  However, once an entity decides to use that method, it must use that method consistently for all future income years. 
30.  If an entity wishes to change to a different method, it will need to apply to the Commissioner for approval to do so.  (Applications can be emailed to: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
    .)

31.  If a branch becomes unable to satisfy the annual method threshold conditions outlined at \[16\] above, the entity has four options:
    *   It could convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using the close of trading spot exchange rate (s YF 1(2)).
    *   It could convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using one of the monthly methods set out in this Approval.
    *   It could apply to the Commissioner, under s YF 1(6), seeking approval to continue to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using the annual method.
    *   It could apply to the Commissioner under s YF 1(6), seeking approval to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using an alternative currency conversion method. 

### Foreign exchange rate sources for branches

#### _Approval of alternative foreign exchange rate sources for branches_

32.  The Act gives the Commissioner the power to approve alternative foreign exchange rate sources.  Section YF 1(5) permits the Commissioner to approve alternative foreign exchange rate sources in circumstances where the Act has failed to specify a rate.  Section YF 2(2) permits the Commissioner to do the same in circumstances where the Act **has** specified a foreign exchange rate source. 

33.  The Commissioner has approved the following foreign exchange rate sources for use by branches under ss YF 1(5) and YF 2(2):
    *   [Read the foreign exchange rates](https://www.ird.govt.nz/how-to/overseas-currency/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
        
    *   The foreign exchange rates published on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand website: www.rbnz.govt.nz  (daily or monthly average exchange rates are available).
    *   Foreign exchange rates from one of New Zealand's registered banks (a list of registered banks is available on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's website at www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation\_and\_supervision/banks/register/).
    *   Any reputable externally-sourced exchange rate.

34.  A foreign exchange rate obtained from a registered bank or a reputable external source will need to be appropriate, given the nature of the business carried on by the entity and branch.  For example, depending on the nature of the business, a wholesale rate may be more appropriate than a retail rate.
35.  These foreign exchange rate sources are approved for a foreign branch of a New Zealand entity's business or a New Zealand branch of a foreign entity's business.
36.  The foreign exchange rate sources can be used even where the Act specifies a foreign exchange rate source to use.  However, they cannot be used where the financial arrangements rules specify that a particular foreign exchange rate source must be used (see \[37\] below).

### Conditions

37.  The approved exchange rate sources cannot be used where the financial arrangements rules specify that a particular foreign exchange rate source must be used.  For example, Determination G6D specifies the foreign exchange rate sources that must be used to determine foreign exchange rates for financial arrangements.  
38.  Some of the foreign exchange rate sources listed may only provide rates for trading days.  If the relevant date is not a trading day, an entity should use the foreign exchange rate on the preceding trading day. 
39.  Entities are reminded of their obligation to keep sufficient records in case they later need to verify the foreign exchange rates used.  This is especially important where the source of rates is not published or readily available.  Further, where an entity uses a registered bank rate or a reputable externally-sourced exchange rate, the entity must be able to show that the rate is appropriate for its business.
40.  The rates must be applied consistently.  This means that a branch must use the same exchange rate source for all foreign currency amounts derived in a particular year, and that the same exchange rate source must be used from year to year. 

### Notification

41.  An entity does not need to notify the Commissioner that it will be using one of the approved foreign exchange rate sources to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars.  However, once an entity decides to use an approved foreign exchange rate source, it must use that source consistently throughout the income year and for future income years.
42.  If, in a later income year, an entity wants to use a foreign exchange rate from another source to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars, the entity will need to seek approval from the Commissioner to do so. (Applications can be emailed to: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
    .)

### Examples

Example 1 - average end-of-month exchange rate method 

Pink Enterprises is a New Zealand company with an Australian branch.  Pink Enterprises has an annual New Zealand group turnover of NZD$6,000,000 and a balance date of 31 March.  The branch transacts in Australian dollars.  For New Zealand tax purposes, Pink Enterprises must convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars.  For the 2016 income year, Pink Enterprises decides to use an annual method to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts.  It chooses the average end-of-month exchange rate method.

Pink Enterprises does not need to notify the Commissioner of this change. 

For the purposes of this example, assume that the branch has income of AUD$5,000,000 and expenditure of AUD$3,000,000 earned/incurred over the 2016 income year.  These amounts must be converted using the average exchange rate for the last day of each complete month in the relevant period (in this case, 12 months):

**Income:** AUD$5,000,000 divided by 0.9509\* = NZD$5,258,176.40.  This amount is included in Pink Enterprises' gross income from a foreign branch.  
  
**Expenditure:** AUD$3,000,000 divided by 0.9509\* = NZD$3,154,905.80.  This amount is included in Pink Enterprises' expenditure from a foreign branch. 

(\* For the purposes of this example, the assumed AUD$ average exchange rate for the last day of each complete month in the 2016 income year.)

During the year the branch makes two Australian tax payments - on 1 August 2015 and on 1 December 2015.  These amounts must be converted using the daily exchange rate that applied on the date the tax payments were made.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example 2 - threshold exceeded |     |
| For the last four years, Purple Enterprises has used the average mid-month exchange rate method to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars.  In 2018, Purple Enterprises' annual New Zealand group turnover increases to NZD$15,000,000.  The branch is no longer able to use an annual method.  Purple Enterprises has four options:<br><br>*   It could convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using the close of trading spot exchange rate (s YF 1(2)).<br>*   It could convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using one of the monthly methods set out in this Approval.<br>*   It could apply to the Commissioner, under s YF 1(6), seeking approval to continue to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using the average mid-month exchange rate method.<br>*   It could apply to the Commissioner, under s YF 1(6), seeking approval to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars using an alternative currency conversion method. |     |

Example 3 - mid-month exchange rate method 

Maroon Enterprises is a New Zealand company with an Australian branch.  Maroon Enterprises has a balance date of 31 March.  The branch transacts in Australian dollars.  For New Zealand tax purposes, Maroon Enterprises must convert its branch's foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars.  For the 2016 income year, Maroon Enterprises decides to use the mid-month exchange rate method to convert its branch's foreign currency amounts. 

Maroon Enterprises does not need to notify the Commissioner of this change. 

For the purpose of this example, assume that the branch has income of AUD$400,000 and expenditure of AUD$300,000 earned/incurred in June 2016.  These amounts must be converted using the exchange rate for the 15th day of June:

**Income:** AUD$400,000  divided by 0.9509\* = NZD$420,654.11.  This amount is included in Maroon Enterprises' gross income from a foreign branch for the month of June.  
  
**Expenditure:** AUD$300,000 divided by  0.9509\* = NZD$315,490.58.  This amount is included in Maroon Enterprises' expenditure from a foreign branch for the month of June. 

(\* For the purpose of this example, the assumed AUD$ average exchange rate for the 15th day of June 2016.)  
On 1 June 2016 the branch makes an Australian tax payment.  This amount must be converted using the daily exchange rate that applied on the date the tax payment was made.

Approved issuer levy and withholding taxes - High Court dismisses appeal and allows Commissioner's cross-appeal on shortfall penalty
====================================================================================================================================

2012 case note - approved issuer levy and withholding taxes - High Court dismisses appeal and allows CIR's cross-appeal on shortfall penalty – residency.

Case

Vinelight Nominees Limited and Weyand Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 199

### Summary

The appeal was dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed. The High Court concluded that Weyand Investments Ltd had its centre of management in New Zealand, was liable to deduct resident withholding tax ("RWT") and that the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement. The Court also considered that the appellants were liable for a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position, allowing the cross-appeal by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner").

### Impact of decision

The High Court confirmed that the centre of management test is factual and the enquiry is to be made by reference to the nature of the company's business and activities. The Court also applied section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") to arguments not raised in the statements of position. The Court also confirmed that the test for applying the abusive tax position shortfall penalty is an objective test.

### Background

This was an appeal by the appellants against the decision of the Taxation Review Authority (_Case 11/2011_ (2011) 25 NZTC 15,177) upholding the Commissioner's assessments. The Commissioner cross-appealed the Authority's decision to disallow the shortfall penalty.

### Facts

Mr and Mrs Chin lived in New Zealand from 1949 to 1973, in Hong Kong from 1973 to 1989 and in New Zealand from late 1989 onwards. Weyand Investments Limited ("Weyand") is a Hong Kong registered company, incorporated in 1982 by Mr and Mrs Chin, who were the directors and shareholders prior to 1997.

In 1990, Mr and Mrs Chin incorporated a New Zealand company, Vinelight Investments Limited ("VIL"), the shareholders of which were Mr and Mrs Chin's three children. In 1989, Mr and Mrs Chin made advances to Weyand. In 1990, Weyand then made substantial loans to VIL, which were converted to redeemable preference shares in VIL. These were redeemed in 1996 by VIL with the result being VIL was indebted to Weyand for over $3 million.

After receiving tax advice in 1996, a plan was devised to allow income earned in New Zealand by VIL and other Chin family entities to be paid to Weyand subject only to the payment of approved issuer levy ("AIL"). The first step in this plan was the settlement of the Vinelight Trust, with Vinelight Nominees Limited ("Vinelight Nominees") as the sole trustee. Mr and Mrs Chin were the directors of Vinelight Nominees.

In 1997, Mr and Mrs Chin transferred their shares in Weyand to their three children who were appointed additional directors. A deed of acknowledgement of debt was executed in 1997 recording that Weyand had advanced $3 million to Vinelight Nominees by way of a loan with Vinelight Nominees acknowledging the debt to Weyand and was repayable on demand. However, the advance was made to VIL not Vinelight Nominees. An additional deed of assignment of debts and acknowledgement of debts was executed in 1998 recording that in consideration for the assignment to Vinelight Nominees of debts owed by 195 Khyber Pass Road Limited to VIL, Vinelight Nominees agreed to assume liability for VIL's debt to Weyand in the amount of $1.8 million repayable on demand with interest payable pending repayment. Vinelight Nominees also agreed to pay AIL on any interest payments made.

In 1998, Vinelight Trust applied for (and was granted) AIL status and in 1999 applied for (and was granted) registration of the debt owed to Weyand as a registered security.

The Commissioner asserted that from 1999 to October 2003 Weyand was a New Zealand tax resident and accordingly should have deducted RWT as opposed to AIL. The Commissioner accepted that from October 2003, Weyand was not a New Zealand resident. However, the payment of AIL as opposed to non-resident withholding tax ("NRWT") formed part of a tax avoidance arrangement. The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position.

### Decision

The Court dismissed the appeal and allowed the Commissioner's cross-appeal.

#### _Residency_

The Court concluded that it was satisfied Weyand had its centre of management in New Zealand, confirming the test is factual and the enquiry is to be made by reference to the nature of the company's business and activities. Among a number of factors, the Court relied on the fact that Mr Chin, in Auckland, instructed Ernst & Young regarding the various Chin family companies (including Weyand) and there was no evidence he consulted anyone outside New Zealand in implementing the advice of Ernst & Young. The Court also confirmed that Mr Chin made the demand for interest on behalf of Weyand and it was significant that the advice to the children, that a reduction in interest rate was desirable and ought to be made, came from Mr Chin in New Zealand.

#### _Was Vinelight Nominees liable to deduct RWT?_

The Court considered the appellants' submission that Vinelight Nominees was not liable to deduct RWT because it did not satisfy the criteria in section NF 2(4)(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the Act") but held that the effect of section 138G(1) of the TAA meant it was not open to the appellants to make submissions on the issue at first instance or on appeal.

The appellants also submitted that Vinelight Nominees was not liable to pay RWT pursuant to section NF 5 of the Act. The Court was satisfied that Vinelight Nominees must be taken to have concluded that its payment to Weyand constituted non-resident withholding income and that all reasonable inquiries can be taken to have been made. However, the Court considered that the conclusion reached by the appellants could not be reached on reasonable grounds. Accordingly, the Court held that section NF 5(1) of the Act was not satisfied.

In addition, the Court considered that despite submissions to the contrary from the appellants, section 108(1)(a) of the TAA should be read as substituting the phrase "RWT return" for "income tax return" when applied in the context of section 99 of the TAA. Accordingly, the Court was satisfied the Commissioner's assessments were not statute barred.

#### _Tax avoidance arrangement_

The Court was satisfied that the appellant's use of section NG 2(1)(b)(i) of the Act could not have been within Parliament's contemplation when it enacted the provision. In particular, the Court concluded that the whole purpose of the arrangement was to ensure Vinelight Nominees would not pay income tax on income that it received and paid to Weyand as interest other than AIL at 2%. The Court also held that if tax avoidance was not the sole purpose, it was the predominant purpose and therefore was not merely incidental. Accordingly, the Court concluded a tax avoidance arrangement existed, which was void as against the Commissioner.

The appellants submitted that even if a tax avoidance arrangement existed, the Commissioner was not able to exercise the reconstruction power in section GB 1 of the Act as the provision is limited to adjusting amounts of gross income, allowable deductions and net losses included in the calculation of taxable income. The Court concluded that section 138G of the TAA precluded the appellants from raising this issue.

#### _Shortfall penalties_

The Court accepted that the judgment of the Authority suggests it did not consider the tax position taken by the appellants wholly objectively. The Court concluded that viewed objectively, each tax position was an unacceptable tax position and that the test in section 141D(7)(b) of the TAA was met. Accordingly, the Court allowed the Commissioner's cross-appeal.

Approved issuer levy structure found to be tax avoidance
========================================================

2011 case note – structure found to be tax avoidance but shortfall penalty did not apply - trust, investment company, unacceptable position, RWT, statute bar.

Case

VI Limited and WI Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Taxpayer WI Limited ("WIL") is a Hong Kong resident company. It incorporated a company VI Limited ("VIL") in New Zealand. WIL made substantial loans to VIL which were converted to redeemable preference shares in VIL. The Commissioner asserted that WIL was a New Zealand tax resident and accordingly should have resident withholding tax (RWT) as opposed to payment of an approved issuer levy (AIL). The Commissioner also asserted that the structure had a purpose or effect of avoiding non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) as tax avoidance.

The Taxation Review Authority (TRA) found in favour of the Commissioner on issues 1 to 4 but concluded that a shortfall penalty did not apply.

### Impact of decision

The TRA has suggested that a subjective test for unacceptable tax position may be relevant where the case is complicated or the structure used appears compliant until "deeply analysed" and that an objectively unacceptable position may not be an "unacceptable tax position" for the purposes of the penalty provisions.

Further, it is implied from the decision that while the position may have a dominant purpose of tax avoidance (on an objective basis) the position may still be an "acceptable tax position".

### Facts

WIL is a Hong Kong registered company, incorporated in 1982 when the C family resided in Hong Kong. In 1989, the family moved back to New Zealand and incorporated a company VIL to undertake property investment. In 1990, WIL made substantial loans to VIL which were converted to redeemable preference shares in VIL. These were redeemed in 1996 by VIL on the basis that their value was left as a debt owing by VIL to WIL as an "on demand" loan.

In May 1997, Mr and Mrs C transferred their shares in WIL to their three children who were appointed additional directors. A deed was executed recording that V Trust owed WIL over $3 million (the loan owed by VIL to WIL was novated to the V Trust). The loan was repaid in 2005. An AIL was paid in respect of the interest payments.

The Commissioner accepted WIL remained a Hong Kong resident until 1998 (and again from 2004 onwards). The Commissioner asserted that from 31 March 1999 to 31 March 2003, WIL was a New Zealand tax resident and accordingly should have deducted RWT as opposed to AIL. The Commissioner asserted that for the purposes of the 2004 income year and following (and, should the Commissioner be incorrect in his residency arguments, also in relation to the 1999 to 2003 income years) a tax avoidance arrangement existed which had the purpose or effect of avoiding NRWT.

### Decision

The TRA found in favour of the Commissioner in respect of tax residency, filing RWT returns, statute bar issues and tax avoidance, however concluded that the shortfall penalty did not apply.

### Residency

The TRA accepted that the centre of management test in section OE 2(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA") refers to day-to-day management at an administrative level and that the control test in section OE 2(1)(d) refers to directorial control, being something distinct from management on a day-to-day basis. Barber DJ also agreed that the residency test is a factual enquiry about actual control and actual management functions as opposed to de jure control or management. The TRA rejected the submission that in a period where little or no business was carried out there is "insufficient business to identify a place of either central management; or director control".

With respect to directorial control, the TRA also accepted that the law indicates that it is where the "brain which controls the company resides" even if the majority of the directors live elsewhere. Barber DJ also accepted that the control test is satisfied if control by the directors is exercised from New Zealand on a continuing basis and any occasional control from outside New Zealand is not relevant.

Barber DJ concluded on the facts that the centre of management of WIL was in New Zealand, based on a large amount of documentary and oral evidence. The TRA also agreed with the Commissioner that the directorial control was exercised by Mr C in New Zealand (even taking into account the fact that he considered the children as professionals could have resisted Mr C's advice had they thought it necessary).

In concluding on his residency remarks, Barber DJ again restated that the centre of management of WIL was carried out by Mr C in New Zealand. However, the TRA stated that it was _arguable_ that Mr C also controlled the directorate of WIL and its decisions, accepting that to a large degree he was the controlling mind of the companies, but stating that as the children were all intelligent and sensible they could not be regarded as controlled by Mr C except to some degree by default (they respected their parents and their acumen and left it to Mr C to obtain and implement tax advice).

#### Sections NF 2(4) and NF 5

The disputants had raised a new argument that even if WIL was a tax resident, section NF 2(4) did not apply and so the V Trust was not required to pay RWT. The TRA accepted that the interest payments were made in the course or furtherance of V Trust's taxable activity of lending money, investing in shares, managing property and leasing cars. Accordingly, WIL was obliged to account for RWT.

The disputants had also argued that section NF 5 applied to excuse V Trust from accounting for RWT as it concluded the payment was non-resident withholding income on reasonable grounds and having made all reasonable enquiries. Barber DJ concluded that Mr and Mrs C needed to have obtained advice from the accountants (who had been instructed since 1996) to have reasonable grounds and to have made reasonable inquiries. The TRA accepted that there was no evidence of the disputants having received any such advice until May 2003. Accordingly, section NF 5 did not apply to excuse payment of RWT.

#### Statute bar

The disputants had argued that the filing of AIL returns precluded it from filing NRWT and RWT returns and, therefore, the AIL returns should be construed as the relevant RWT returns for the purposes of section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). Barber DJ accepted the Commissioner's submission that AIL returns are not RWT returns, noting these are prescribed in section 50 of the TAA as being the IR 15P form. Barber DJ also referred to section NF 13 of the ITA which provides that the provisions of the TAA apply to every amount a person is liable to pay in the RWT rules as if it were income tax.

The TRA also stated (citing _Miller v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,961) that it was irrelevant that there may be some overlap of information in the AIL and RWT returns. Barber DJ also referred to section NF 5 and noted that this provision excuses a person from the obligation to pay RWT when AIL returns are filed and all reasonable inquiries have been made, implying that if not all reasonable inquiries are made, the expectation is that RWT will be paid irrespective of whether AIL returns have been filed.

The disputants also argued that as annual IR 15S reconciliation forms had been filed (to account for RWT paid in periods not in dispute) arguably RWT returns had been filed. The TRA accepted the Commissioner's submission that the IR 15S does not constitute a return for the periods where no IR 15P was filed - it only reconciles the RWT paid in the periods where a return has been filed. Barber DJ stated that section 99(2) of the TAA deems the Commissioner to have made an assessment on the receipt of each IR 15P form.

Accordingly, section 108 did not apply and the assessments were not statute barred.

#### Tax avoidance

The TRA referred to the _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 decision, concluding there was a tax avoidance arrangement which frustrated the scheme of the AIL and RWT regimes and clearly had tax-induced features as its dominant purpose. The TRA rejected the disputants' submission that using a clear, concessionary provision (the AIL regime) could not frustrate the scheme and purpose of the TAA, concluding that the arrangement was contrived in that the disputants colluded to siphon profits from New Zealand investment companies into the V Trust and remit those profits to WIL at a 2% tax rate.

#### Abusive tax position

The TRA concluded that Mr C was relying on professional accounting advice and so was entitled to assume he was complying with "quite subtle tax laws" and the position taken was at least as likely as not to be correct. Barber DJ acknowledged that this was a subjective approach and the test is an objective test, but considered that in the context of a quite complicated case the "structures seem compliant until deeply analysed". Barber DJ stated that while he may be "stretching the point" and although he found the position taken was unacceptable, it was not an unacceptable tax position as defined.

With regard to the dominant purpose of tax avoidance element of the provision, despite stating that he considered the dominant purpose in the mind of Mr C was to pay as little tax as he needed as opposed to actually voiding tax, he stated that he could conclude on an objective basis that the dominant purpose of the arrangement was tax avoidance.

The TRA concluded that no penalty applied because the disputants did not take an unacceptable tax position.

Approved issuer levy: Technical changes
=======================================

2010 Act has amended legislation to clarify the relationship between domestic law and treaty law for interest derived from NZ by foreign banks.

_Sections 86I and 86L of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 and section 32M of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Some technical changes have been made to the rules for the approved issuer levy in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The purpose of the amendments is to clarify the relationship between domestic law and treaty law for interest derived from New Zealand by foreign banks. The intention is to make the law more transparent rather than to substantively alter its effect.

### Background

The approved issuer levy (AIL) is a domestic-law mechanism that can provide relief from non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest paid to non-residents. NRWT on interest paid to an unrelated foreign lender can be reduced to nil if the borrower agrees to pay a 2% levy. Borrowers may agree to do this if the lender would simply demand more interest to cover the NRWT.

Provisions recently included in some of New Zealand's double tax agreements provide an exemption from source-country tax for interest derived by banks. For interest derived from New Zealand, the availability of the exemption depends on the borrower paying AIL, unless the borrower is not eligible to elect to pay the levy, or there is no such levy, or the rate of the levy exceeds 2% of gross payments. (See the Interest Articles of New Zealand's double tax agreements with Australia and the United States.)

### Key features

The Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to clarify the circumstances in which a person is eligible to elect to pay AIL. The question of whether a person is eligible to elect to pay AIL under domestic law may now be relevant to a double tax agreement.

As amended, section 32M(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a borrower is eligible to elect to pay AIL for the purposes of an exemption under a double tax agreement, as well as for the purposes of the NRWT rules. This makes it clear that a borrower can pay AIL to qualify the interest for a treaty exemption, even if paying the levy makes no difference to the way a transaction is dealt with under domestic law. Similar changes have been made to Part 6B of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.

Section 32M(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, together with Part 6B of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, now set out the process by which a person elects to pay AIL. Essentially, this process is the same as before but is now clearer that the process of taking the necessary steps constitutes an election and that a person chooses to have approved issuer status rather than applying for it. This ensures consistency with terminology used in the relevant treaty provisions.

The main purpose of these changes is to address uncertainty around the treatment of interest paid to foreign banks operating through a branch in New Zealand. That uncertainty arose from the interaction between domestic law and the new treaty provisions mentioned above. Interest derived by a foreign bank with a New Zealand branch is taxed on a net basis, along with branch income, rather than being subject to NRWT. This means that the AIL mechanism is not relevant domestically. However, the new treaty provisions could still apply to such interest if the loan was made from offshore instead of through the New Zealand branch. It is therefore appropriate to make clear that the borrower can elect to pay AIL for the purposes of a treaty exemption.

It is considered that borrowers were eligible to elect to pay AIL for the purposes of a treaty exemption under the law as it stood before these amendments, including in relation to interest outside the scope of the domestic NRWT rules. The amendments make this transparent. There should be no risk for a taxpayer that relied on this interpretation of the law before the amendments took effect. Where it applies, the relevant treaty exemption requires that, if a borrower is eligible to pay AIL, the levy must be paid for the exemption to apply. This is not the same as the exemption being contingent on the borrower's eligibility to pay AIL. As long as the borrower has paid AIL and the other requirements for the exemption are satisfied, the exemption should apply.

### Application date

The changes come into force on 1 August 2010.
\[ IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive release: This document has been released by Inland Revenue under section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. An error was identified in paragraph 13 of this report after it was sent to Ministers. The legislative changes were incorrectly noted as all taking effect in October 2021, rather than progressively after go-live. This error has been corrected in this version of the report. Inland Revenue r eport: Transformation s tatus update: April 2021 Date: 10 May 2021 Priority: Medium Security level: In confidence Report number: IR2021/180 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Note the contents of this report None Minister of Revenue Note the contents of this report None Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA. 3 IR2021/180: Transformation status update: April 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Budget performance to date 6. Between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, the programme spent $747 million in operating, and $374.9 million in capital. Any under-spending to date has either been moved to later periods or returned to the Crown. Stage 4 budget 7. Including the contingency held by the Commissioner and transitional funding, the overall budget for the current phase of transformation, Stage 4, is $211.5 million for operating expenditure and $88.3 million for capital expenditure. We are on track to come in on budget for Stage 4. Recommended action 8. I recommend that you note the contents of this report. Noted Noted Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation 10 May 2021 Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 4 IR2021/180: Transformation status update: April 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stage 4 first release update 9. Paid parental leave, unclaimed money, New Zealand foreign trusts, and duties continue to run smoothly on new systems and processes. We continue to experience a very low number of issues being raised, with no critical or high priority issues to resolve. 10. On 8 April 2021, a new, searchable online claims process for unclaimed money went live on our website. 11. Early life support is scheduled to end on 28 May 2021. Stage 4 second release 12. Following the passing of the Child Support Amendment Bill, from 1 April 2021, we will no longer charge incremental penalties on outstanding balances for child support. From 1 November 2021, newly liable parents will have a penalty grace period. Together, these changes will make child support penalties fairer. 13. Other changes in the Bill will take effect progressively once child support has moved to new systems and processes: • Deductions of financial support from source deduction payments made by an employer will be compulsory for newly liable parents. • A fairer definition of “income” will be used for child support purposes. • A four-year time bar on the reassessment of child support will be implemented. 14. From October 2021, child support customers will have improved digital services. They will have better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR, our secure online service, and will be able to do more for themselves, including registering online and advising us of any changes in their circumstances. Over time, this will reduce the amount of paper we receive fr om customers and encourage customers to use digital channels where possible. 15. Information sharing and communication with other agencies will improve through the use of portals and secure file transfer. The processing of payments and employer deductions will be streamlined and will help to ensure that receiving carers get their child support as soon as possible after the due date. 16. This second release of Stage 4 will also upgrade both the START software our people use and the online services our customers use. 17. The myIR service will have a lighter, more modern look and feel, and will simplify how information is presented, making it easier for customers to focus on what is relevant and important. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality, making it seamless to use myIR across different devices. Simplified navigation will allow customers to easily find and do what they need to do. 18. A new Action Centre in myIR will give customers access to all their alerts, rather than only some alerts being visible. Alerts will be separated by customer, account, and due date, ensuring that those with access to multiple customers (such as tax agents) will be able to easily identify which alerts relate to which customers. Customers will be able to see when an alert is due, the action they need to take, and easily navigate to the action from their alert. They will also have the ability to dismiss alerts. 19. A new Intermediary Centre will replace the current Tax Preparer tab in myIR. From here, intermediaries will be able to access the new Action Centre and have a centralised 5 IR2021/180: Transformation status update: April 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] view of alerts for all the clients they are subscribed to. The Tax Agent Workspace will be retired, and access to clients will be through a client search screen or a new “favourites” functionality. 20. This release impacts all customers to some degree, but the degree varies depending on the product and type of change. As expected with the final stage of transformation, the impact for customers overall is reducing. 21. In general, we expect the impact of this release on child support customers, businesses and employers, and business partners such as other government agencies, to be medium to low. For intermediaries such as tax agents, we expect the impact to be medium to high, as the changes being made to online services are more significant for them. 22. Finalising the design and keeping build verification, test preparation and test execution on track is a careful balancing act. There is some minor slippage in business systems testing (making sure START works as expected). Overall, solution delivery remains on track to key milestones, with no immediate risk. 23. Given the vulnerability of child support customers, a risk that they may experience unexpected outcomes is being actively managed (refer to paragraph 34) . 24. Recruitment of trainers and preparation for the delivery of training has begun. As many users will be new to START with this release, there will be more on-site, classroom- based training than for the first release in Stage 4. 25. Data cleansing continues, with the data analysis and remediation activity leading up to the mock conversions and scaled business simulation testing ( practising go-live step- by -step). This pre-emptive work places the team in a strong position heading into deployment, reducing the risk of unexpected results at cut-over. Other updates E- File decommissioning 26. E- file, a service which allows tax agents to file their clients’ returns to us, was successfully decommissioned on 16 April 2021. By that date, all software providers had prepared their systems, choosing which of our gateway services they would integrate with and offer to their customers. We will continue to work with software providers and tax agents as questions arise and they adapt to the new gateway services. New payday filing format 27. From 1 April 2021, employers have been required to send us employment information using a new payday filing format (IR2021/105 refers). All gateway-enabled payroll software providers who were using version one of payday filing are now live with version two. We continue to work with other providers and employers who may need to update their software. Convenience fees 28. As reported to you (IR2021/105 refers), from October 2021 we will no longer absorb the 1.42% convenience fee for overseas customers paying student loan and child support obligations by credit card. This change will also apply to student loan and child support payments made by debit card. There are multiple alternative payment options for our overseas customers. T he convenience fee is already passed on to customers paying other obligations (such as GST) by credit or debit card. 6 IR2021/180: Transformation status update: April 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Protecting customer information 29. On 16 April 2021, the media reported a major data breach at a large company where hackers may have obtained past and present staff members’ passport and IRD numbers, and other personal information. By close of business the same day, we had applied an indicator to the accounts of all approximately 66,000 p revious and current employees. This indicator highlights to our people the need to be vigilant when validating customer identities , helping to protect the information we hold about them. This is a further demonstration of the agility of our new systems and processes, and the speed at which we can make changes when necessary. Key risks and issues 30. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber 1 , with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 31. We are monitoring two issues (risks that have been realised). The first relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. There are no concerns to report at this time. 32. The second issue relates to the departures of some key people working in the security architecture area, both in the programme and in the wider business. Security architecture is the technology, tools and processes that help protect an organisation from cyber threats. The departure of these key people is impacting delivery in some areas, as security risk assessment and certification activities are being delayed and programme members are becoming more involved in detailed security conversations. We are talking to a number of external consulting organisations about bringing in resources to fill this gap in the short- term. 33. As at April 2021, the programme has a total of 58 open risks 2 , of which 13 are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). 34. One new risk was reported to the PGC this month. There is a risk that customers’ payments could change once child support is moved to new systems and processes in October 2021. People who pay child support, and those who receive it, could see their payments increase or decrease. This could occur as a result of differences between FIRST and START in how assessments are processed, the way debt/payment allocation is handled, and the timing of employment income information processing. The current rating of this risk is high. It is currently likely that this risk will occur (a 21% to 50% change of occurring), with major consequences if it does. We are developing a mitigation plan and, once this is finalised, will develop a detailed action plan. 35. Two risks previously reported to the PGC were closed during the month. 36. The risk relating to the programme being perceived only as a technology replacement has been closed. Our communications and engagement activities have successfully built understanding among internal and external audiences of the scope and scale of transformation. All the policy changes in the scope of the programme have now been enacted. 1 The risk RAG status is separate from the overall programme status which is light amber as stated on page 2. Table 1 on page 2 shows the RAG key for risk as amber and the overall programme rating as light amber. 2 During April 2021, two new programme risks were accepted and five programme risks were closed. 7 IR2021/180: Transformation status update: April 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 37. The risk relating to external decision-making taking longer than planned has been closed. All anticipated government decisions, including policy and legislative changes, have now been made. 38. The status of two risks reported to the PGC improved during the month. 39. The current rating of the risk relating to relying on SAP after 1 July 2022, when support for heritage systems ends, has improved from very high to high. SAP is a heritage system we use for all back-office processes, including financials and payroll, and to make paid parental leave payments. We have moved all our financial processes to our new enterprise support services system and moved paid parental leave to START. Payroll remains on SAP. As reported (IR2021/105 refers), we have a confirmed plan to move SAP to the cloud. We have now finalised a commercial arrangement with SAP. The current likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from possible (an 11% to 20% chance of occurring) to unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance of occurring). 40. Although the current rating of the risk relating to delays in completing the decommissioning of FIRST satellite functions (processes that are attached to FIRST) by 30 June 2022 remains at very high, the likelihood of occurrence has improved. The current likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from likely (a 21 to 50% chance of occurring) to possible (an 11% to 20% chance of occurring). Detailed decommissioning plans are in place and we have a solution to archive the data held in FIRST. 41. The top three risks for transformation are: • The need to move KiwiSaver providers off the heritage function they use to automatically send data to us, and onto new gateway services, by 30 June 2022. • Realising the benefits that we committed to deliver in the timeframes indicated. • Possible changes in payments once child support is moved to new systems and processes. Coming up in the next two months 42. Key activities over the next two months include: May 2021 • Exit early life support for the first release in Stage 4 (paid parental leave, unclaimed money, New Zealand foreign trusts and duties). • Complete the solution design for the second release in Stage 4 (child support and upgraded online services). June 2021 • Complete the first checkpoint for the second release in Stage 4 (child support and upgraded online services) in the readiness assessment framework. • Provide a copy of the July 2021 Transformation Update Cabinet paper to the Minister of Revenue to review.

April/May IRD cases in the courts
=================================

**10 June 2019**

Inland Revenue plays a critical role in improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders.  We collect and distribute more than 80% of the Crown’s Revenue and collect and distribute social support payments.

Paying tax helps pay for the public services we all rely on like education, health and roads.

Sometimes people intentionally choose to participate in the hidden economy; don’t declare all their income; and try to get tax refunds they’re not entitled to.  Where we find this, we take appropriate action.

Here are the cases that have been through the courts in April and May.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Eric Francis Calvert 31 May**

An Upper Hutt electrician has been sentenced to 11 months home detention and ordered to pay $20,000 in reparations on 56 charges of aiding and abetting City Electricians evade tax.  

Eric Francis Calvert was in charge of the management, finance and tax affairs of City Electricians which deducted PAYE, KiwiSaver, student loan and Child support payments from wages but didn’t pass them on to Inland Revenue from 31 October 2011 to March 31 2017.

The company was placed into liquidation by the High Court in May 2017 with a total estimated to all creditors of $887,270.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Rachelle Suzanne Wood 24 May**

Canterbury woman Rachelle Suzanne Wood has been sentenced to 2 years, 6 months in prison for aiding and abetting Nan and Gran’s Food bar which claimed nearly $250,000 in GST refunds they weren’t entitled to.

Wood leased a business unit in 2014 which wasn’t built until June 2015. Trading didn’t begin until September that year and the business was sold as a going concern in April 2016.

The GST returns filed by Wood weren’t supported by business records or bank statements. Inland Revenue analysis of Nan and Gran's business account and the private bank accounts held by Wood and her husband show that GST refunds from the business have predominantly been used for personal expenses.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Colin George Ackroyd 23 May**

A Rangiora man, Colin George Ackroyd, was has been fined $6,000 by the Christchurch District court on 30 charges of failing to furnish GST and income tax returns.

Ackroyd ran a business along with Margaret Anne Ackroyd as sales agents. He didn’t file GST returns from 2014 until 2018 and didn’t file income tax over the corresponding five years.

He was contacted several times and asked to file returns, which he said he would do. However, no returns were forthcoming, and a final notice was sent. His wife, Margaret Ackroyd, who was also facing 30 charges, was convicted and discharged.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Clive Rex Baker 22 May**

A New Plymouth builder, Clive Rex Baker, has been sentenced to 6 months home detention plus 175 hours community work for failing to pay employees’ deductions to Inland Revenue.

From April 2014 Baker stopped declaring and paying the deductions on time and then stopped altogether.  Until then he had been on time with his tax affairs.

There were just over $300,000 of unpaid taxes owing. Baker told IR he didn’t pay the deductions because his business had cashflow problems.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Reynaldo Hilaga 17 May**

Christchurch cleaning company director Reynaldo Hilaga has been fined $7,725 on 27 charges of aiding and abetting his company which failed to file tax returns to Inland Revenue.

Immaculate Living Ltd failed to file PAYE returns from October 2015 to November 2017.  It also failed to file GST returns from September 2015 until September 2017.

Inland Revenue tried to contact the company and Hilaga personally several times with no response.  A final notice was sent in December 2017 advising that legal action would be taken.  

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Marcie Wales 10 May**

One of the directors of a tree cutting and heat pump company has been sentenced to 8 months home detention plus $5,000 in reparation on 63 charges of tax evasion.

Christchurch-based Marcie Wales was charged with aiding and abetting Treecorp companies in Christchurch, Wellington and Taranaki.

She was responsible for the PAYE affairs for each of the companies. $153,232.65 was deducted from wages over 26 months but wasn’t handed on to Inland Revenue.  An analysis of bank accounts showed wages were sometimes paid in cash and preference was given to trade creditors.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Russell George Best 3 May**

Auckland company director Russell George Best has been fined nearly $3,000 for aiding and abetting his company to evade GST and income tax.

Best faced 21 charges in total – 13 in regard to not filing GST returns and 8 for not filing income tax returns.

Reminder notices were sent to him and IR contacted Best on two occasions when he said he would file the returns. When nothing was filed a final notice was sent reminding him of his obligations and he was told legal action would be taken.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Dahlia Naepi 18 April**

A major shareholder in Pasifika Integrated Health Care Limited has been sentenced to 11 months home detention on tax fraud and tax evasion charges totalling more than a million dollars. Dahlia Naepi was sentenced on April 18th.

Naepi had complete oversight of the operations of the company and ultimate responsibility for compliance with its tax obligations.  The offending amounted to $1,271,322.81 some of which was paid after Naepi sold her home.  The total amount that remains unpaid is $479,188.75.

As well as home detention, Naepi was ordered to pay $60,000 at $1,000 per month over 5 years.  Pasifika Integrated Health Care Limited is now in liquidation.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Stephen Goble 12 April**

The director of 2 Wellington companies, Stephen Gordon Goble, has been fined $2,000 and ordered to pay court costs of $130 on a charge of refusing or wilfully neglecting to appear before the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to give evidence.

Goble had been required to appear before the Commissioner to answer questions about returns filed by the companies, and to provide records to substantiate the expenses claimed in the returns.  He only did so a number of months after being charged.

Inland Revenue had been unable to progress its investigation of the companies without the information.  Goble had previously not complied with a Court Order to provide other information to the Commissioner, and had been held in contempt of court as a result.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Sean Rhyse Edmonds 11 April**

The director of a former Whanganui shearing gang has been sentenced to 10 months and 2 weeks home detention and 200 hours community work for failing to pay employees’ tax deductions to Inland Revenue .

Sean Rhyse Edmonds faced 56 charges of aiding and abetting his wife, and two companies, to make PAYE deductions but not pass the money on to Inland Revenue.  He also faced 1 representative charge aiding and abetting one of the companies to evade tax by filing false returns.  The total amount unpaid against his name is $354,235.95.

Edmonds' wife, Te Waimoko Jacqueline Edmonds, was earlier this year sentenced to 7 months home detention and 120 hours community work 40 charges.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Vincent Teremoana Peters 11 April**

A former security guard and company director has been sentenced to 13 months in prison for evading or attempting to evade personal income tax and GST.

Vincent Teremoana Peters was sentenced in the Manukau District court on April 11. Peters was earning income and GST; knew he had to file income tax and GST returns but chose not to do so.

The total tax evaded was $159,696.82 none of which has been paid by Peters.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Jillian Rosemarie Scott 5 April**

Former chartered accountant Jillian Rosemarie Scott was sentenced to 6 months Community detention, 300 hours community work when she appeared in the Hamilton District Court on April 5. She was ordered to pay $53,000 in reparation which was on top of the $45,000 paid prior to sentencing.

Over a 6-year period, Scott and two of her brothers set up a complex scheme to evade taxes and obtain fraudulent refunds from Inland Revenue.  They set up limited companies, charitable trusts and societies, which were then used to buy houses and claim GST refunds. 

They also used the entities to make it look like they were making charitable donations and claimed charitable donation rebates. Altogether Jillian Scott claimed $101,366.00 and received $88,879.57 in various refunds. The charges against brothers Lindsay and Roger Scott have still to be heard.

Are embankments and runway end safety areas depreciable property? No says the Court of Appeal
=============================================================================================

2017 case note – Court of Appeal finds embankments and runway end safety areas not depreciable property - airport, hardstanding, decline in value, geogrid.

Case

Queenstown Airport Corporation Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 20

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007 ss DA 1, EE 1, EE 6, EE 7, EE 37, EE 67 and Schedule 13

### Summary

Due to updated Civil Aviation Rules, Queenstown Airport Corporation Limited ("QA") was required to provide a minimum 90-metre Runway End Safety Area (“RESA”) at each end of its runway. Due to the steep drop-off into the Shotover River on the east end of the runway, QA constructed a 45-metre high embankment upon which to place the RESA and sought to deduct the construction costs on the basis the RESA was a depreciable land improvement.

The High Court rejected this argument and QA appealed. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court, and found that the allowed depreciable land improvements contained within Schedule 13 was an exhaustive list. There was no indication that a generous interpretation could be taken to allow items such as RESAs to be included. The Court also agreed that the RESA was not the same as an airport runway, was not an improvement to a runway, and was not hardstanding so could not fall within those categories of depreciable land improvement. Nor was the RESA expected to decline in value. For these reasons the Court dismissed the appeal.

### Impact

In general, the judgment provides a useful guidance as to how Courts will interpret ss EE 1, EE 6, EE 7 and Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA"). It also supports the approach to statutory interpretation adopted in _Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd_ \[2007\] NZSC 36, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 ("_Fonterra"_).

More specifically, the judgment illustrates the factors that will be taken into account when determining whether or not a RESA will come within any of the items of depreciable land improvements contained in Schedule 13 of the ITA.

### Facts

QA is the owner and operator of the Queenstown Airport. The dispute concerns depreciation deductions for income tax purposes.

The appellant expended some $8.7 million in constructing QA's eastern RESA which was required under the Civil Aviation Rules. Due to the steep 45-metre drop-off into the Shotover River on the east end of the runway, QA formed a very substantial supporting embankment for the RESA. In the 2012 and 2013 income tax years, the appellant sought to deduct amounts for depreciation on the basis that the east RESA was an “airport runway” under the ITA, or alternatively, that the depreciation deductions were permitted as "hardstanding" or as a "road". The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") disallowed the deductions.

### High Court decision

The dispute was first heard by the High Court, who held that the deductions were not permitted as the east RESA did not fit within any of the descriptions relied upon by the appellant (_Queenstown Airport Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZHC 1299, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-054).

The appellant appealed this decision.

### The Appellant's arguments

The appellant submitted that the High Court erred in concluding that the east RESA was not an airport runway or hardstanding under ss EE 6, EE 7 and Schedule 13 of the ITA. The appellant did not appeal the High Court finding that the east RESA was a "road" under the ITA.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal (the Court") dismissed the appeal. They did not agree with the appellant's argument that the High Court lost sight of the proper approach to the statutory interpretation question. The Court commented that the High Court followed the approach of _Fonterra_ at \[22\] in considering the meaning of the enactment from the text in light of its purpose, having regard to the immediate and the general legislative context and the social, commercial or other objective of the enactment and crosschecking the meaning against the purpose.

### The interpretation issue - analysis

#### Depreciation policy

The Court stated that the policy underlying the current depreciation rules in the ITA is to allow the deduction of the cost of depreciation in respect of assets used or available for use in deriving assessable income when the value of those assets is reasonably expected to decline in value over their estimated useful life. The rationale for allowing a deduction for depreciation is that capital assets used in the production of income will eventually wear out and need to be replaced in whole or in part. Land (apart from certain specified land improvements) is not depreciable because it does not have a determinate design life after which replacement in whole or in part is expected to be necessary; nor is it expected to decline in value over time through ordinary wear and tear.

The Court concluded that the text of the ITA makes it clear that the items listed as improvements in schedule 13 are exceptions to the general rule that land is not depreciable. In the Court’s view, there is nothing to suggest Parliament intended that the generous approach advocated by the appellant should be adopted in interpreting the specified items. The structure of the relevant provisions does not support this. Rather, Parliament has chosen to specify the items it has concluded are to be treated as exceptions to the general prohibition on the depreciation of land.

#### "Airport runway"

The Court stated that the eastern RESA does not form part of the runway either in its natural meaning or as "airport runway" is defined under the Civil Aviation Rules. The eastern RESA was not intended or available for use by aircraft taking off or landing other than for use for safety reasons in an emergency.

Unlike the airport runway, which has a five- to 10-year design life after which its surface will require complete replacement; the eastern RESA’s overall design life is at least 120 years, after which only one of its components (the Geogrids) is likely to require major work.

#### "RESA as an improvement to the airport runway"

The Court noted the appellant’s submission, made in his reply that a deduction for depreciation should be allowed, under s EE 37 of the ITA, as the eastern RESA was an improvement to an item of depreciable property. The Court noted that "improvement" is defined in s EE 67 of the ITA as an "alteration, extension or repair of an item of depreciable property that increases its capital value."

The appellant submitted that the eastern RESA was an extension of the airport runway, an acknowledged depreciable asset.

The Court was unable to accept the argument as they did not find the eastern RESA and supporting embankment could be regarded as an extension of the airport runway. As the Court found the eastern RESA was not "airport runway", it also found, for the same reasons, that it cannot be regarded as an extension of the airport runway.

#### Hardstanding

The Court agreed with the High Court that the eastern RESA is not "hardstanding" for the purposes of the depreciation provisions. The Court noted that the eastern RESA is designed and constructed to allow aircraft to sink into its surface to decelerate the aircraft in an emergency situation and that this is the opposite of an area that is "hard". It also noted that the eastern RESA might be designed to bear the weight of an aircraft for a short period in an emergency, but this does not fall naturally within the meaning of "standing" which refers to an area where a vehicle or aircraft might stand when not in use. There is nothing in the characteristics or purpose of a RESA to suggest otherwise.

#### Decline in value

The High Court also found that the eastern RESA was not property that in, normal circumstances might reasonably be expected to decline in value while used or available for use in terms of s EE 6(1) of the ITA. Noting that, given the Court of Appeal's conclusions above, it was not strictly necessary for it to deal with the second element the appellant was required to satisfy before being entitled to deduct depreciation loss, the Court of Appeal gave its view on this issue.

In interpreting s EE 6(1) of the ITA, the Court first stated that "normal circumstances" refers to circumstances that might ordinarily be expected to affect the value of the relevant asset over time (contrasted with "abnormal circumstances" such as an earthquake). Second, the assessment is ordinarily made at the time when the relevant deduction is sought. This necessarily involves a prediction of future events. Third, the test is objective - it would not be sufficient for a taxpayer to believe that the asset might deteriorate in time. There must be a reasonable basis for that expectation. Fourth, the expression "might reasonably be expected to decline in value"sets a relatively low threshold. So long as there is a reasonable prospect that the asset might decline in value in the future, that is sufficient. Fifth, it is not necessary that the asset is actually used, only that it is available for use. Finally, the test does not require that the asset in question would require complete replacement at the end of its useful life (See, by analogy, the discussion of the distinction between repairs or maintenance and improvements of a capital nature in _Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1999\] 2 NZLR 438 (CA) at 445). Nevertheless, the extent, nature and cost of any work required to reinstate the relevant asset may have a material bearing on the assessment of whether a decline in value might reasonably be expected.

The Court of Appeal noted that contrary to the view of the High Court, the expert evidence that Geogrids reached the end of their design life after about 120 years and that major work would then be required must be accepted, although it should be considered in context. The Court noted that the Geogrids, while an important component of the overall eastern RESA, comprised only a minor part of the overall structure, which is massive in scale.

The Court concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that any work would be required to repair or reinstate the great majority of the compacted soils and gravels comprising the eastern RESA (only the Geogrids would require replacement). The Court noted that no evidence was placed before the High Court as to the extent and nature of any work required at the end of the Geogrid design life, the cost of that work or the anticipated effect on the value of the asset overall. The Court of Appeal stated that it was reasonable to infer on the evidence that the cost and any consequent effect on the long term value of the asset would likely amount only to a small fraction of the cost of the structure overall. Any amount properly deductible as depreciation would accordingly be reduced to a very low level.

#### Dr Emery's brief of evidence

The Court of Appeal noted that the High Court did not make a ruling on the challenged admissibility of Dr Emery's brief, but it made no reference to this evidence in the judgment. Given that the Court of Appeal could not determine what weight, if any, the High Court placed on Dr Emery’s evidence, and given that the Commissioner’s counsel accepted that the Commissioner was not prejudiced by the High Court’s failure to rule on the admissibility (because she was able to put the relevant, but challenged parts of Dr Emery’s briefs to the appellant’s witnesses), the Court of Appeal did not place any weight on the brief for the purposed of its judgment and no ruling as to the admissibility of that evidence was required.

Arrangement seen as tax avoidance
=================================

2010 case note – High Court holds arrangement in which property developer lived off 'loans' taken from various companies over a 10-year period to be tax avoidance.

Case

Krukziener v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Sections 108 and 141 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, TRA Case Z23

### Summary

A property developer lived substantially off “loans” taken from his various companies over a 10-year period. Repayments only occurred after he was audited and only from tax-free capital receipts. In the TRA and now in the High Court, the arrangement has been held to be tax avoidance, and the “loans” are in fact, assessable income.

### Facts

The taxpayer is a property developer who operated his businesses through a series of trusts. Each property development project was undertaken through a trading trust set up for that purpose. Most of the developments were successful, and as each development finished, the profits from it were distributed from the trust to another trust in the “group”. That other trust was in a loss position at that stage, as the development for which it was set up was in its “start-up” phase. When that second trust eventually turned to profit, the profits were distributed to the next trust, and so on. The effect of this was that none of the trusts were ever required to pay tax; there was always another trust in a loss position that the profits could be distributed.

The taxpayer operated this structure between 1991 and 2002. During this period, the taxpayer returned very little income. However, he received net funds of over $5 million from the “group” by way of loans, which were used to meet his everyday living expenses. The loans were repaid by way of a capital distribution once the Commissioner's investigation had begun.

The Commissioner took the view that the arrangement was void as tax avoidance and reconstructed the loans as income to the taxpayer. Shortfall penalties for abusive tax position were also imposed.

The taxpayer challenged the assessments in the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) _Case_ _Z23_ and lost. He appealed to the High Court.

### Issues

#### _1\. Is the arrangement tax avoidance?_

*   **_1.1 Was there an arrangement?_**  
    The taxpayer argued that there could be no arrangement as some of the steps were not, and could not have been, contemplated at the time the structure was created. To hold there was an arrangement would be to tax retrospectively and would offend the rule of law.  
      
    The taxpayer further challenged the TRA's finding that there were separate arrangements in each of the tax years. Taxpayers must be able to determine, at the end of each year, their tax liability for that year.
*     
    
*   **_1.2 Was the purpose and effect of the arrangement tax avoidance?_**  
    The taxpayer argued that the loans were genuine liabilities that were always intended to be, and were, repaid, and that the TRA had erred in holding that a receipt had to be either income or capital. In this case the receipts were neither; they were loans.  
      
    The taxpayer asserted that there was no requirement to take a salary from the trusts, relying on _Penny & Hooper_ (CA).
*     
    
*   **_1.3 Was tax avoidance merely incidental?_**  
    The taxpayer argued there was a legitimate commercial rationale for using the structure.

#### _2\. Were some years time-barred under s 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994?_

*   The taxpayer argued that the assessments for the earlier tax years were time-barred under s 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) as more than four years had passed since the end of the period in which the relevant return was filed.

#### _3\. Were penalties correctly imposed?_

*   The taxpayer argued that the tax positions taken were tenable, and could meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct.
*   The taxpayer also argued that the tax position taken should be offset against deductions allowed to related entities under s 141(7) of the TAA.

### Decision

The Commissioner won on all issues.

#### _Arrangement_

Her Honour held that the evidence showed there was a plan that the taxpayer would not repay advances unless there was a (tax free) capital distribution available (paragraph \[24\]). Her Honour also held that the TRA's conclusion that there was more than one arrangement was inevitable (paragraph \[26\]).

#### _Purpose or effect of tax avoidance and commercial rationale_

In responding to the taxpayer's contention that there were practical commercial reasons for not paying a salary from the trusts, Her Honour analysed the Court of Appeal decision in _Penny & Hooper_ and held at \[42\] that:  

*   It may be that the proprietor of a property development business would, for the reasons that Mr Krukziener gave in evidence, be justified in accepting a salary below market or even no salary at all pending the completion of the project. So, in principle, Mr Lennard's submission stands, notwithstanding the Court of Appeal's decision. However, there is an obvious question on the facts of this case as to why Mr Krukziener would not have received any income over such a long period.

The taxpayer's submission that he was building towards a significant project which would leave him with tax to pay was rejected on the facts, and Her Honour went on to note that even if that was the case, the deferral of tax for such a long period would have the effect of tax avoidance \[48\]-\[49\]. Her Honour went on to note:

*   Where the proprietor of a business has expended time and effort on a project, and incurred debt waiting for the project to be completed, and the project is completed at a profit, there would seem to be no legitimate reason for some of that profit not to be distributed. The need of the next project for funds does not preclude such distribution since it is always open to the proprietor of the business to advance funds for the next project. In the circumstances of this case, therefore, I do not accept that the level of income provided to Mr Krukziener over such a long period can be regarded as legitimate.

Her Honour accepted that there was a commercial reason for not making distributions to the taxpayer from the profits of the trusts, being to leave the taxpayer in debt as a defensive strategy. However, Her Honour did not put much weight on this rationale for the reasons explained at \[51\].

Her Honour accepted the Commissioner's argument that, from the trusts' perspective, lending money to the taxpayer interest-free while borrowing elsewhere at commercial rates, pointed to an absence of commerciality \[57\].

In summary, Her Honour stated \[58\]:  

*   Against these various disadvantages, the tax benefits of the arrangement stand out clearly. Notwithstanding the asserted rationale, the effect of the arrangement was clearly tax avoidance, at least in the sense of deferring the tax obligation. Over more than a decade during which more than 80, mostly profitable, projects were completed under Mr Krukziener's stewardship, he received more than $5 million nett to cover his living expenses on which no tax was paid. He repaid most of that from capital receipts on which no tax was payable and the balance has never been repaid. Nor was interest paid until 2001, by which time Mr Krukziener was aware that his tax affairs were to be investigated. Looking at the overall benefits of the arrangements to Mr Krukziener, it is apparent that the protection offered by the debt had much less effect in commercial terms than the deferment or avoidance of income tax.

#### _Time bar_

Her Honour followed the Privy Council decision in _Miller v CIR_ which held that although reconstructed income is deemed to be derived, the nature and source of the deemed income does not change. In this case, that nature and source was loans from the trusts. These were not disclosed, so the time bar did not apply \[64\]-\[65\].

#### _Shortfall penalties_

Her Honour held that the tax benefits from the arrangement stood out as being the dominant purpose, and therefore the standard of "about as likely as not to be correct" could not be met \[71\].

Her Honour noted that as the taxpayer had been found to have taken an abusive tax position, set-off under s 141(7) of the TAA was not available, by virtue of s 141(7B).

#### _Implications_

The structure used in this case had a number of features which meant that, when the arrangement is looked at as a whole, the tax benefits flowing from it were the only explicable reason.

This case is not authority for invoking the anti-avoidance provision simply because a taxpayer takes a loan in lieu of a salary, though the Commissioner is aware there are a number of taxpayers (particularly property developers) using a similar structure who will be affected by this decision. In each case, as with any tax avoidance inquiry, it will be a matter of examining the arrangement to determine the tax effects which flow from it, and the commercial rationale for implementing it.

#### _Appeal period_

[Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2014](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2014 "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2014")

Arrest at border
================

2014 legislation enables IR to request an arrest warrant for persistent student loan defaulters attempting to leave NZ after returning from overseas.

#### _Sections 162A and 162B of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011_

There is a group of borrowers who persistently default on their student loan repayment obligations. The new legislation strengthens Inland Revenue's ability to deal with those individuals by making it an offence for overseas-based borrowers to continue avoiding repayments. The legislation enables Inland Revenue to request an arrest warrant for borrowers if the District Court is satisfied that a borrower has committed the offence and is about to leave or attempt to leave New Zealand after returning from overseas.

### Background

Some borrowers refuse to repay their loans despite having the ability to do so. For this group, applying penalties for overdue payments and potential Inland Revenue debt-recovery action does not deter them from defaulting on their loan repayments. New section 162A makes it an offence for them to continue to do so.

The amendment enables Inland Revenue to apply for an arrest warrant to prevent an overseas-based borrower who is visiting New Zealand from leaving the country if the District Court is satisfied that they have committed the offence.

The provision is modelled on a similar provision in the Child Support Act 1991, under which Inland Revenue can request the District Court to issue an arrest warrant for a liable parent who is about to leave New Zealand with the intent to avoid their obligations.

Similar provisions for student loan borrowers will send a clear message to all borrowers that non-compliance is unacceptable and there are consequences for ignoring repayment responsibilities. This is a targeted measure that will be applied to the worst cases of default, while acting as a deterrent to the wider group of borrowers.

### Key features

Section 162A makes it a criminal offence for a borrower who is in default of their overseas-based repayment obligation and who, having been notified by the Commissioner that he or she is in default, knowingly fails, or refuses by the due date specified in the notification to make reasonable efforts to pay the amount in default or to make arrangements with Inland Revenue to pay the amount in default.

Section 162B enables the District Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of a person if it is satisfied that the person has committed the offence and is about to leave or attempt to leave New Zealand.

A person who is arrested under this provision must be brought before a District Court as soon as possible. The District Court may make a range of orders if it is satisfied that the person is about to leave or attempt to leave New Zealand without making reasonable efforts to pay the amount in default or without making arrangements with Inland Revenue to pay the amount in default.

These include orders that the liable person:

*   pay the amount in default;
*   make arrangements with Inland Revenue to pay the amount in default;
*   give security (including the provision of sureties) for the payment of the liability as specified by the court;
*   not leave New Zealand without written permission of the court;
*   surrender to the court, for a specified period, any travel documents or tickets in the person's possession; and
*   provide the court, within a specified period, with any information the court thinks appropriate.

Sections 164 to 166 have been amended so administration of the new offence is consistent with the treatment of other offences under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. This includes requiring prosecution of the offence to be done within ten years of the offence being committed, allowing multiple prosecutions using the same documents and allowing prosecutions to be made summarily (enabling a faster court process).

### Application date

The amendments apply from the day after Royal assent, being 8 March 2014.

Assessments by the Commissioner
===============================

2006 amendment extends the circumstances in which the CIR can make an assessment without having first issued a NOPA to cover fraudulent activity.

##### Section 89C of the Tax Administration Act 1994

Circumstances in which the Commissioner may make an assessment without having first issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) have been extended to cover the situation when the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity, irrespective of whether the taxpayer remains in New Zealand.

### Application date

The amendment applies from 18 December 2006.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

We're aware that the drought is causing financial issues for many farmers and growers in the Northland, North Auckland down to the Harbour Bridge and understand it's likely to affect income for the 2020 and later years.

Income equalisation scheme - deposits
-------------------------------------

We're able to accept later deposits to the income equalisation scheme.

For farmers and growers whose current or future income will be significantly affected by the drought in the above-mentioned areas, we'll allow late deposits for the 2019 income tax year up to 30 April 2020, regardless of when the 2019 return is filed or what the due date is for filing the tax return.

An affected farmer will need to:

*   provide evidence of how they were significantly affected by the drought - the minimum criteria for this is a statement signed by the farmer or tax agent that the farmer was significantly affected
*   ensure the deposit is received by us by 30 April 2020
*   provide a notice with the deposit stating that:
    *   it is for the main income equalisation deposit scheme
    *   it is to apply for the 2019 tax year
    *   the late deposit criteria in this notice apply.

Income equalisation scheme - withdrawals
----------------------------------------

Normally income equalisation deposits are not available for refund until 12 months after the deposit is made. However, we do have discretion to allow early refunds, particularly in the case of a medium-scale adverse event or when the person is suffering serious hardship.

We also have the ability to determine a "class of case" that qualify for an early refund.

We'll allow farmers and growers in the Northland North Auckland down to the Harbour Bridge who are materially affected by the drought to make early withdrawals. In this case, materially affected means that the farmer or grower is in financial difficulty or is incurring extra expenditure as a result of the drought.

All applications for an early refund must be in writing and will take approximately 20 days to process. It should be remembered that the refund will be income in the year that the application is made unless it is elected to treat the refund as income in the prior income year where the application for refund is made in the specified period.

For more information on income equalisation and deposits please refer to our Standard Practice on income equalisation deposits and refunds.

"Associated persons" definition - tripartite test
=================================================

2013 legislative amendment prevents overreach of the tripartite test by treating a limited partnership as a company for the purposes of the test.

_Section YB 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The amendment to section YB 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 prevents overreach of the tripartite test by treating a limited partnership as a company for the purposes of the tripartite test.

### Background

The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent.

The requirement that the two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests in section YB 14(1)(b) ensures that the tripartite test does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base.

Previously, there was an overreach of the tripartite test in relation to a limited partnership.

### Key features

New section YB 14(4) treats a limited partnership as a company for the purposes of applying the tripartite test in section YB 14(1). This remedial amendment is intended to prevent the overreach of the tripartite test in relation to limited partnerships.

| Example 1 |     |
| Company A holds 25% of a limited partnership, which holds 25% of Company B.<br><br>![Associated persons definition - tripartite test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/7/375e262f-d8d5-4ab3-8117-21e2bbef82b3/new-leg-image19.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214400&hash=9829A82BD9DC06B30B618477ACD16400 "Associated persons definition - tripartite test")<br><br>Under the associated persons definition, Company A is associated with the limited partnership under the limited partnership test in section YB 12(2). The limited partnership is associated with Company B under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3.<br><br>Previously, the tripartite test applied to associate Company A and Company B (the limited partnership being the common third person). This was the case even though Company A only had an effective 6.25% interest in Company B (by multiplying Company A's 25% interest in the limited partnership by the limited partnership's 25% interest in Company B). Company A and Company B have no other common shareholders.<br><br>New section YB 14(4) treats a limited partnership as a company for the purposes of applying the tripartite test. As a consequence, Company A and Company B are now not associated under the tripartite test. |     |

| Example 2 |     |
| Tom holds 25% of a company and 25% of a limited partnership.<br><br>![Associated persons definition - tripartite test](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/e/5/e57abcc6-cb93-43dd-8b38-d74de43724f2/new-leg-image20.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214359&hash=7F20A077742C304A63100EEA9588575C "Associated persons definition - tripartite test")<br><br>Under the associated persons definitions, Tom is associated with the company under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3. Tom is also associated with the limited partnership under the limited partnership test in section YB 12(2).<br><br>Previously, the tripartite test applied to associate the company and the limited partnership (Tom being the common third person). This was the case even though Tom, the common owner in the entities, only held a 25% interest in each entity.<br><br>The company and the limited partnership are now not associated under the tripartite test. This is because under that test, Tom is associated with the company and the limited partnership (which is treated as a company under section YB 14(4)) under the same associated persons test - the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3. |     |

### Application date

The application date for this amendment is the same as the date when the current associated persons definition came into force.

The general application date for the amendment (excluding those applying for the land provisions) is the 2010-11 income year.

For the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1) other than section CB 11 (which relates to disposal of land within 10 years of completing improvements), the amendment applies to land acquired on or after 6 October 2009.

For the purpose of section CB 11, the amendment applies to land on which improvements began on or after 6 October 2009.

Key Objectives and Outcomes Transformation will enable Inland Revenue to deliver on government expectations and priorities, and meet New Zealanders’ expectations of a modern revenue system. Transformation will: • Provide confidence in the continued collection of tax revenue and distribution of entitlements; • Improve government’s ability to make policy changes faster and more cost-effectively; • Grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right; and • Create an information asset to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealand. At the end of transformation, Inland Revenue will be more agile, effective and efficient, enable customers to self-manage with speed and certainty, enable government to make timely policy changes, and work with other agencies to optimise interaction across government. 1.1 Business Transformation Programme Overview The Programme is a multi-year, multi-stage initiative as illustrated in the programme roadmap below, noted by Cabinet that will deliver outcomes over four stages, as described below. The roadmap illustrates the expected delivery sequencing of the programme. Page 7 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.2 Programme Costs and Benefits 1. 2.1 Costs and Benefits The table below shows the estimated whole of life cost and expected monetary benefits (adjusted for inflation) NZD $ Estimated Whole-of-life Cost (WOLC) Expected Monetary Benefits WOLC Duration To 2023-2024 1. 2.2 Benefits committed to government The Detailed Business Case (November 2015) outlines financial and non-financial benefits across five benefit areas. These benefit areas are mapped to the programme’s investment objectives. Benefit Area Description Easier for customers Customers will find it easier to meet their obligations and receive their entitlements. Agility to implement policy The time and costs for IR to implement (policy) changes will be markedly reduced. Revenue system resilience The revenue system will be simpler and more resilient, and recover from any failure quickly. Additional Crown revenue and efficiency savings Improved customer compliance increases assessed Crown revenue and IR will be more efficient and smaller than today. Compliance effort savings The compliance effort for businesses will reduce. More detail on the programme’s costs and benefits are fully documented in the November 2015 Programme Update and Detailed Business Case. This is published on Inland Revenue’s website. Page 8 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.3 Risk Rating Risk Rating from Risk Profile Assessment (RPA) High Overall the programme is considered to be inherently high risk. Accordingly, considerable emphasis has been placed on developing the capabilities required to manage and mitigate risks and issues. The programme’s management of risk was recognised as “an exemplar” in the last six Gateway reviews (last one completed March 2020). Refer to Section 1.5 below, for the current Programme risks that are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee 1.4 Key Risks as per the Programme Business Case The Programme has been recognised as a high-risk initiative and a number of key risks have been identified, as per the Programme Business Case (March 2013). These key risks can be categorised in three broad areas, as shown in the table below – scope, delivery and downstream impacts, with how the Programme is currently mitigating these Scope – Is Inland Revenue doing the right things? Risks Mitigations • Transformational planning is not fully mature, so the preferred way forward may not deliver the benefits anticipated or may cost more. • The external environment, including government and customer requirements/expectations and technology developments, may change over the life of the programme. • Inland Revenue has adopted strong programme governance and management that includes internal and external stakeholders. • Inland Revenue’s benefits management framework provides clear accountabilities and owners for realisation of benefits. • Programme plans will be designed around giving Inland Revenue and government flexibility to respond to changes • Inland Revenue has a strong focus on stakeholder engagement to ensure that stakeholders' needs are well understood. Delivery - Can Inland Revenue deliver the programme? Risks Mitigations • Inland Revenue cannot manage the programme and business as usual. • Inland Revenue’s senior management is distracted by competing priorities and pressures. • Inland Revenue has adopted strong organisational and programme governance and management to ensure that organisational priorities are clear and any trade-offs are discussed and agreed with the Government. • Inland Revenue cannot source and manage the services and expertise that we require to deliver the programme. • Resources with proven experience in procuring and managing large-scale vendor contracts have been acquired. Retention strategies have been developed for critical resources across the transformation journey. • Inland Revenue has a strong focus on stakeholder engagement to ensure that stakeholders' needs are well understood. Page 9 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • High dependence on third parties, including other government agencies and intermediaries, to support the changes proposed. • The programme becomes disconnected from Inland Revenue service delivery functions and revenue system participants, and the transition to the new operating model is slow and complex. • Inland Revenue will extensively engage with other government agencies, revenue system participants and within Inland Revenue to ensure the proposed change is fit for purpose and all parties are prepared for change. Downstream impacts - Are there other implications for government? Risks Mitigations • The potential impact of Inland Revenue’s transformation on other agencies has not been assessed. • The Commissioner will continue to work closely with the chief executives of other agencies to identify where changes may be required and to ensure that any impacts are carefully planned for. • There may be intervals in which Government’s ability to make significant policy changes is constrained because of the need to instigate a change freeze while migrating to the new platform. • Inland Revenue will continue to work closely with Ministers to ensure that any potential constraints or trade-offs are identified and discussed early. Page 10 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.5 Programme Risks As at 16 September 2020, there are currently 56 programme risks, of which 14 are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee as follows: Risk Ref Type of Risk Risk BTR- 19\*\* Stakeholders There is a risk that Government loses confidence in IR's ability to deliver the Business Transformation Programme. BTR- 29\*\* External Environment There is a risk that external decision-making takes longer than planned and timescales are extended. BTR- 77\*\* Business Process There is a risk that the Business Transformation Programme becomes a technology replacement rather than a true business transformation. BTR- 84\*\* Information management There is a risk that the benefits to the Crown, customers and IR that were committed to Cabinet in the 2015 programme business case are not realised and/or are not realised within required timeframes. BTR- 90\*\* External Environment There is a risk that the scope, timing and priorities of the Business Transformation Programme may change due to external factors. BTR- 168\*\* Financial There is a risk that the contingency agreed by Cabinet as part of the business case funding approval is applied to fund other competing priorities/pressures, creating a risk of insufficient funding to complete delivery of BT. BTR- 178\*\* Stakeholders There is a risk of misalignment between the programme’s agreed scope, roadmap and delivery timeframes, and expectations on the programme to deliver all-of-government (AoG) capabilities. BTR- 3260^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing cutover of products to START and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on FIRST after 1 July 2022 will result in operating on an unsupported Mainframe ecosystem BTR- 4767^ Stakeholders In the event of a Major Incident (P1 & P2), if clear processes and responsibilities are not known or effective, and/or the correct skills are not available, then time taken to successfully resolve the incident will be prolonged. BTR- 6394^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing the decommission of \[Information redacted\] and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on \[Information redacted\] after 1 July 2022 may result in inability of IR to exit the \[Information redacted\] Data Centre resulting in potential cost and contractual impact BTR- 6395^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing decommission of EDW and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on EDW after 1 July 2022 will result in inability of IR to exit the \[Information redacted\] Data Centre resulting in potential cost and contractual issues BTR- 6396^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing decommission of FIRST satellite functions and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on FIRST after 1 July 2022, will result operating on an unsupported Mainframe and cause IR to potentially delay the exit of \[Information redacted\] Data Centre BTR- 6838^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing the decommission of E-File and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on E-File after 1 July 2022, may cause IR to delay the exit of \[Information redacted\] Data Centre BTR- 6839^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing the decommission of Kiwisaver B2B (OFM) and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on OFM after 1 July 2022, may cause IR to delay the exit of \[Information redacted\] Data Centre Note: \*\* = Programme risks that are non Stage specific. ^ = Programme risk that impacts Stage 4. Page 11 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The diagrams below map the likelihood and the consequences of these risks occurring. The risk profile of these risks based on the respective current r isk rating is as follows: The risk profile of these risks is based on the respective target risk is as follows: Page 12 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Part 2 – Assurance Management Plan Overview 2.1 Assurance Approach The key focus of the assurance approach is to ensure that all governance and management aspects of the programme are working appropriately, and that the programme stays on target to achieve its objectives. The objective of the Assurance Management Plan is to ensure the effective coordination of all assurance activities across the Programme. The primary objectives of assurance within the Programme are to: • Increase confidence that the agreed scope and deliverables will be delivered and are appropriate considering the business outcomes expected and the size and scale of the programme • Provide assurance to the CIR/SRO and key stakeholders that the Programme is producing quality outcomes, including delivery within schedule and budget • Provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the programme management functions, within the context of the required activities and outcomes detailed in the programme business case • Provide an independent assessment of the status of deliverables and processes at critical stages of the programme • Ensure that any risks and issues identified within the programme are managed in a timely manner with the right level of focus • Identify improvement opportunities, which may further increase the likelihood of programme success • Leverage past review results to ensure that common pitfalls can be avoided where necessary; and • Ensure adherence to ICT and Government procurement guidelines and rules. 2.2 Lessons Learned and Post Implementation Reviews The programme undertakes key lessons learned during and at the end of each release/stage, to capture proposed actions to address the learnings, to improve Programme performance for the remaining releases/stages. Lessons identified are assigned action owners and are incorporated into planning for the subsequent releases/stages. The programme also incorporates any key lessons learned from other programmes and projects from within Inland Revenue and other government agencies. The programme utilises independent quality assurance activities to gain additional insights and to identify any opportunities for improvement. Any recommendations identified from these reviews are assigned owners to action and are followed up by the Programme. These responses and updates are also provided to Internal Assurance and Advice’s as part of their quarterly process to follow up, monitor and report completion of these actions. The Programme is committed to sharing its key lessons learned with its external stakeholders. A Post-Implementation Review is conducted after completing a major release/stage. Its purpose is to evaluate whether the release/stage objectives were met, to determine how effectively the release/stage was run, to learn lessons for the future, and to ensure that the organisation gets the greatest possible benefit from the release/stage. Page 13 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.3 Key Assurance Activities The Programme will require a variety of assurance services through all releases/stages of the Programme, with key assurance reports and advice aligning with milestones as outlined in current planning documentation. The table below summarises the key assurance activities that will be performed across the Programme to provide assurance to our key internal and external stakeholders that the programme is set up to succeed and achieve its outcomes.

The programme will continue to make available to Joint Ministers the opportunity to meet with independent assurance providers. External assurance reports will be provided to Ministers and the Central Agencies, together with Inland Revenue’s management responses to any recommendations. In addition, Inland Revenue will continue to offer to provide a full debrief for Ministers on the outcome of each assurance review.

Attempt to relitigate matters previously determined struck out as an abuse of process
=====================================================================================

2017 case note – unsuccessful attempt to relitigate matters previously determined - strike out, abuse of process, standing, bankruptcy.

Case

Tamihere v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 3012

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972; Tax Administration Act 1994, s109

### Summary

Mr Tamihere filed judicial review proceedings which appeared to seek to revisit a 2012 District Court decision ("the Civil decision") granting the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") judgment against Mr Tamihere for unpaid tax debt as well as decisions resulting in criminal convictions and sentence. The Commissioner applied to strike out the proceeding.

### Impact

The Decision applies the standard principles governing strike-out applications.

### Facts

Mr Tamihere was the sole director of Rags 2 Go Limited ("Rags 2 Go"). Mr Tamihere had also operated as a sole trader in the same field within which Rags 2 Go operated.

Rags 2 Go was placed into liquidation in June 2011 on the basis, primarily, of unpaid PAYE. Rags 2 Go was removed from the register in June 2014.

While operating as a sole trader, Mr Tamihere, either himself or through a tax agent filed self-assessed GST returns and PAYE deductions were assessed as owing based on Employer Monthly Schedules provided by Mr Tamihere and/or his tax agent.

The statutory disputes procedures under Part 4A and 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") were not engaged in to dispute or challenge the assessments. In August 2012 the Commissioner obtained judgment against Mr Tamihere for $199,737.12, being the total unpaid tax debt as at that date.

Mr Tamihere filed an application for leave to appeal out of time which was dismissed in 2013. In August 2013 Mr Tamihere was adjudicated bankrupt on the Commissioner's application. An application seeking a stay of the bankruptcy order was dismissed as was a further document treated as an application for recall of the bankruptcy decision. An application to annul the bankruptcy in June 2014 was also struck out.

In January 2014 Mr Tamihere was convicted of charges relating to PAYE and sentenced to home detention in October 2014. Mr Tamihere appeared not to have sought to exercise any right of appeal against his convictions or sentence.

In April 2017 Mr Tamihere filed judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner, Attorney-General and District Court. The claim made wide-ranging allegations of corruption and breaches of human rights but failed to specify the particulars or factual basis for the claims.

### Decision

The Court granted the Commissioner's application to strike out the statement of claim and dismiss the proceeding on the basis there was no reasonably arguable cause of action and it was also an abuse of process.

The Court took the view the application was primarily directed at the Civil decision however Mr Tamihere was also challenging the decisions resulting in his criminal convictions and bankruptcy.

The Court held there were no grounds upon which Mr Tamihere might challenge his convictions or sentence, finding the complaint of double jeopardy relating to the criminal convictions was based on a misunderstanding of the matters considered by the District Court in the Civil decision. The Court noted that while that proceeding resulted in a determination that Mr Tamihere was required to repay a debt to the Commissioner, it so happened his actions in relation to that debt were also a criminal offence.

The Court noted Mr Tamihere';s challenge to the Civil decision amounted to a challenge to the tax payable which was only able to be challenged through the statutory disputes process, and Mr Tamihere had raised no factual basis to suggest it could not practically be invoked.

The Court found none of the alleged procedural and jurisdictional errors raised in respect to the civil proceedings had any factual foundation or basis. Rather the Court found they were based on misunderstandings of the legal process and earlier proceedings.

The Court noted most if not all of the claims had already been addressed and dismissed in decisions of other judges, as summarised by the Court in its decision. The Court considered the present claim to be a further attempt to relitigate matters already determined and was an abuse of process.

The Court also found there was no foundation to any of the allegations made against other respondents (including various Ministers and public servants) named by Mr Tamihere and no proof of service of the proceedings in relation to those respondents. The Court found there was no reasonably arguable cause of action maintainable against any of those other respondents, the proceeding against them was an abuse of process and it was appropriate to strike it out.

Attitudes shift as more tradies declare cashies
===============================================

**11 May 2015**

More tradies across New Zealand are declaring all income they earn from cash jobs following the launch of a crackdown on cashies.

Lester Binns, Chief Executive of MyTax.co.nz said only one day into Inland Revenue's campaign he had received around 1,000 calls from people checking if they needed to add in cashies to their tax refund information which they'd submitted.

Inland Revenue's Marketing and Communications Group Manager, Andrew Stott, said the results of the campaign so far have been outstanding.

Mr Binns said his call volumes had been much higher than normal since the advertising began.

"We have received a wide range of calls from people and businesses including one tradie who received $68,000 of cashies for painting jobs," Mr Binns said.

"Callers also wanted to check they're doing the right thing and to pay the right amount of tax. Reminding individuals and businesses it's illegal to do work for cashies is a good thing as it only disadvantages the majority of Kiwis who work hard and pay their fair share of tax," said Mr Binns.

Mr Stott said, "the 'declare it all or risk everything' radio, newspaper and mobile adverts are a prompt for everyone not just 'the little guys'.

#### Not just the 'small fry'

"It's early days but already we're seeing a shift in attitude. What's also clear is there's a common misconception we only target 'small fry' evaders - this is not the case. We have identified tradespeople as being a high risk sector but we take all levels of tax evasion seriously. We're finding people who receive $30,000 in cash for a job and put it straight into their pocket.

"Our concern is when individuals or businesses don't pay their fair share of tax they're basically cheating those who are doing the right thing and expecting others to pay their way," said Mr Stott.

Last year, for every dollar Inland Revenue invested in its Hidden Economy programme it got nearly $6 back.

Inland Revenue also uses tools and intelligence to identify individuals and companies not paying their fair share of tax. By providing information, reminders, seminars, compliance checks and online self-assessment tools it help taxpayers declare and pay the right amounts. It also closely scrutinises large corporates to ensure they're getting their taxes right.

The 'declare it all or risk everything' campaign runs in the Auckland suburbs of Flatbush, Takanini, Silverdale and Albany until the end of June and may be rolled out wider.

[Applying the FIF rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012/applying-the-fif-rules "Applying the FIF rules")

Attributable FIF income method
==============================

2012 amendment relating to FIF rules - The branch equivalent method has been replaced with the attributable FIF income method.

_Section EX 50_

The branch equivalent method has been replaced with the attributable FIF income method. The attributable FIF income method is based on the CFC rules with certain modifications (see section EX 50). These modifications are described below.

When a person uses the attributable FIF income method, they first apply an active business test to the FIF. If the FIF satisfies the active business test, either independently or as part of a group of FIFs, the person will have no attributed income from that FIF. Persons with FIF interests that do not satisfy the active business test, attribute the portion of attributable income that corresponds with their income interest in the FIF (the person's income interest is worked out by applying the CFC rules). If the attributable FIF income method is used, the attributable income is calculated by applying sections EX 18 to EX 21.

In other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007, such as subpart FE, there are references to "a person who uses the attributable FIF income method for a FIF". Note that a person is still considered to use the attributable FIF income method in cases where the FIF passes the active business test. If the person uses a different FIF calculation method such as the fair dividend rate or cost methods to attribute income from the FIF, these references do not apply.

#### Using the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50)

Section EX 50 outlines how a taxpayer applies the attributable FIF income method.

Taxpayers who use the attributable FIF income method for a FIF generally calculate their attributed income from that FIF as though the FIF were a CFC. This means they use the CFC rules in sections EX 18 to EX 21, although some modifications are made to make these rules easier to apply to foreign companies that are not CFCs, as described below.

The active business test is relaxed for persons who apply the attributable FIF income method. This change enables them to use consolidated accounting information to apply the test to related groups of FIFs (including when those FIFs are in different jurisdictions). The accounts can be prepared in accordance with New Zealand IFRS (IFRS), International IFRS (IFRSE) or United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). Note, US GAAP accounts cannot be used when applying the active business test to an interest of 10% or more in a CFC, and the active business test can only be applied to groups of CFCs if all the CFCs are controlled by the New Zealand person and are resident in the same jurisdiction.

If an investor applies the CFC rules or the attributable FIF income method to a foreign company, and that foreign company holds shares in another foreign company, the investor is generally required to "look-through" and apply a FIF calculation method to the investor's indirect interest in the second foreign company. There are several exceptions to this look-through rule that apply when the upper-tier company is a FIF, but do not apply when the upper-tier company is a CFC.

The exemption that applies to payments of interest, rent and royalties from an active CFC to an associated CFC (that is, 50% common ownership) has been modified so that a similar exemption applies when there is a group of persons who control (own more than 50%) of both FIFs. These modifications are explained in the detailed analysis below.

These modifications are made by sections EX 50(4B) and EX 50(7B) and are covered in more detail below.

Note that any references to "the CFC" in sections EX 18 to EX 21, including those that are modified by section EX 50(4B), should be read as references to "the FIF" when a person applies the attributable FIF income method to that FIF (see section EX 50(3)(a)).

#### Key features

#### _Active business exemption_

A person with an interest in a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method will not have to include attributed FIF income or loss in the person's gross income if the FIF passes an active business test. This is expected to result in most users of the attributable FIF income method being relieved of the need to calculate attributed income.

A FIF will pass the active business test (and so will not have to attribute any income) if it has attributable income that is less than 5% of its gross income. Attributable and gross income, for the purposes of the test, are measured using either financial accounting or tax measures of income. These measures are defined in the legislation.

It is expected that most people will prefer to use accounting measures of income, because they will be more readily available or easier to calculate. Accounting measures may be used to calculate the ratio if they are taken from accounts that comply with IFRS or US GAAP, and certain other conditions are met.

For people who do not wish to or who are unable to use accounting measures of income, tax measures of income may also be used to calculate the ratio of attributable income to gross income.

FIFs that are commonly controlled may be consolidated for the purposes of the calculation of the 5% ratio calculation, subject to certain conditions.

#### Detailed analysis

#### _Requirements for using the active business test_

The active business test can be performed using accounting information or tax concepts. Certain accounting and audit requirements must be satisfied for accounting information to be used.

The active business test can be performed for an individual FIF or for a FIF test group. Additional requirements must be met for a FIF to be included in a FIF test group.

#### _Accounting requirements for using the accounting-based test_

_Accounting standards that may be used (section EX 21C)_

Section EX 21C, as modified by section EX 50(4B) outlines the accounting standards that may be used to calculate the ratio of a FIF or FIF test group's attributable income to total income under section EX 21E. Three types of accounting standards can be used:

*   New Zealand IFRS (IFRS);
*   International IFRS (IFRSE); or
*   United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).

Note that section EX 21C is modified by section EX 50(4B) to allow US GAAP accounts to be used. This means that US GAAP accounts can be used only when the attributable FIF income method applies. US GAAP accounts cannot be used for interests of 10% or more in CFCs.

Taxpayers should use the accounting standard that is most appropriate. For example, if the FIF prepares IFRSE accounts, it should use IFRSE accounting concepts as opposed to US GAAP concepts.

An "IFRSE" is defined in section YA 1 as "an International Financial Reporting Standard approved by the International Accounting Standards Board, as amended from time to time".

Certain conditions must be satisfied before any particular set of accounting standards can be used. This means the person may be unable to use any of the sets of accounting standards because the relevant conditions are not satisfied. A person may also choose not to use any of the sets of accounting standards, even if they are available.

The main requirement is that the FIF's income appears in IFRS or IFRSE accounts. This ensures that, whatever accounting standard might be used by the FIF itself, the resulting income - at least in aggregate - will be subject to an audit that checks for compliance with IFRS or IFRSE.

There are two ways that this requirement can be met.

The FIF's income could appear in IFRS / IFRSE accounts firstly because the FIF's accounts are fully or partially consolidated into the IFRS or IFRSE accounts.

Alternatively, it could appear if the FIF's income is included in the IFRS or IFRSE accounts using the equity method in IAS 28 or IAS 31, or by inclusion of dividends and fair value changes under IAS 39. If the FIF's income is included under one of those standards, the FIF itself must also produce accounts under an acceptable standard, including US GAAP.

Once it has been determined that there is an acceptable set of accounts, information used to prepare those accounts, including underlying information, may be used as long as it is consistent with the relevant standard (see existing section EX 21E(4)(b)).

For instance, if a FIF's income was recognised in the IFRS accounts of the New Zealand investor under IAS 28, and the FIF itself used US GAAP, it would be possible to take the detailed US GAAP information and use this in the active business test calculation in most cases. However, there would be an exception if the associate's profit appearing in the IFRS accounts was not the same as the US GAAP profit because of an adjustment made to ensure compliance with IFRS. In such a case, it would be necessary to adjust the detailed US GAAP information to ensure consistency.

**Example**

NZ Co has a 30% shareholding in a US company (US FIF) that prepares US GAAP accounts.

The US GAAP accounts report $20 million of profit being earned by the US FIF.

NZ Co has IFRS accounts. The IFRS accounts include a line item for income from associates. This item displays $6 million from the US FIF (30% of the $20 million).

Because the US GAAP accounts are reported consistently in the IFRS accounts, NZ Co will be able to use the information underlying the FIF's US GAAP accounts for the purpose of applying the active business test in section EX 21E to the US FIF.

![An example of using the accounting based test.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/8/28e12d804c09e15b842eadc74b7f9625/nl-page26.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214403&hash=0D9BDBC82F468002D88D2CD99B576906)

#### _Audit requirements for using the accounting-based test_

Subsection EX 21C(8) contains the two audit requirements that must be met in each of subsections EX 21C(2) to (7). The first requirement in subsection (8) is that the accounts in question must be audited by a chartered accountant who is independent of the FIF and of the person. In the case of a test group, the chartered accountant must be independent of all the FIFs in the test group.

The use of the term "chartered accountant" is regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand Act 1996, and requires membership of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA). Because the accounts of a FIF will commonly be audited in a country other than New Zealand, it is also acceptable for the auditor to be a person who is not a chartered accountant (as defined in New Zealand legislation), provided they meet a professional standard, in their country, that is equivalent to the professional standard a chartered accountant must meet in New Zealand.

The second requirement in subsection (8) is that the auditor must have given an unqualified audit opinion or - in countries in which the term "unqualified audit opinion" is not used or has a different meaning - a type of audit opinion that is used in that country and is of a standard that is equivalent to an unqualified audit opinion in New Zealand.

#### _Requirements for applying the active business test to a FIF test group_

Under the CFC rules, New Zealand investors that have more than one majority-owned CFC in a jurisdiction are allowed to use consolidated accounts for all their majority-owned CFCs in that jurisdiction for the purposes of the active business test. The purpose of this measure is to simplify the application of the test when accounting information is available at a consolidated level, such as when a group produces segmental reporting by country.

The attributable FIF income method provides a similar consolidation rule for groups of FIFs. This should enable more investors to use the active business test as it may be easier to access consolidated accounting information for an entire group of FIFs than to access information for each separate company.

In cases where the test is applied and passed by a test group or a top-tier FIF that includes amounts from lower-tier FIFs, the investor may not be required to "look-through" the top-tier FIF and apply a FIF attribution method to the lower-tier FIFs. This is explained in the next section ("Applying FIF calculation methods to indirect interests in foreign companies").

The requirements for being able to apply the active business test to a group of foreign companies under the attributable FIF income method are more relaxed than those that apply to a group of CFCs.

The CFC rules require the investor to have more than a 50% income interest in each CFC. Under the attributable FIF income method, it is the FIF for which that method is used which must have more than a 50% voting interest in the lower-tier foreign companies.

The CFC rules also require all the CFCs to be in the same jurisdiction in order to apply the active business test on a consolidated basis to a group of CFCs. Under the attributable FIF income method, the foreign companies can be in different jurisdictions. However, none of the foreign companies can be a CFC (an actual CFC, as opposed to a FIF that is treated as a CFC because of section EX 50).

Finally, the CFC rules require the investor to remove amounts corresponding to income interests not held by the investor (such as minority interests). The attributable FIF income method omits this requirement so amounts belonging to other investors are included in the calculations. This concession is purely because of concerns about the practical difficulties for a non-controlling shareholder in identifying amounts attributable to other shareholders.

##### CFC test groups and FIF test groups

  

|     | CFC test group | FIF (non-CFC) test group |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control requirement? | Control by NZ investor | Control by a top-tier FIF |
| Requires all companies in the test group to be in the same jurisdiction? | Yes | No  |
| Remove income owned by other shareholders? | Yes | No  |

The above modifications to the CFC rules occur through sections EX 50(4B) and EX 50(7B).

Note that the modifications in section EX 50(4B) should be read as replacing the sections that they refer to. For example, the requirement that the companies in the test group be located in the same jurisdiction has been replaced by a requirement that none of the companies can be a CFC.

As a consequence, when applying section EX 21D(1) to a FIF that is using the attributable FIF income method, that section should be read as follows (replacement text in italics):  
A person (the **interest holder**) with an interest in a _FIF_ may choose to apply this section for the _FIF_ as a member of a group (a **test group**) if the group consists of companies-

1.  _none of which is a CFC; and_
2.  in each of which the _FIF holds a voting interest of more than 50%;_ and
3.  each of which is required to use the same currency under section EX 21(4); and

5.  that are consolidated for the purposes of this section -
    1.  using like tax treatments for like transactions and for other events in similar circumstances; and
    2.  eliminating in full all balances, transactions, income, and expenses arising between members of the test group.

When applying section EX 21E(2) to a FIF that is using the attributable FIF income method, that section should be read as follows (replacement text in italics):

2.  The interest holder may choose to apply this section for the _FIF_ as a member of a group (a **test group**) if -
    
    1.  the group consists of companies required under the applicable accounting standard to consolidate, whether or not with companies that are not in the group; and
    2.  _none of the other companies \[in the test group\] is a CFC; and_
    3.  _the FIF holds a voting interest of more than 50% in each of the other companies in the test group_; and
    
    5.  there are audited and consolidated financial statements that -
        1.  include the accounts of the companies in the group, whether or not with accounts of companies that are not in the group; and
        2.  comply with the applicable accounting standard.

Note the top-tier FIF must hold a **more than** 50% voting interest in each of the underlying FIFs.

**Example**

![An example of CFC teat groups and FIF test groups.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/5/856328004c0a0ace843fadc74b7f9625/page-27-1.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214405&hash=F5FA27200F44C44274C86E9A6BF50B32)

In this example, NZ Co would **not** be able to group together FIF 1 and FIF 2 for the purposes of applying the active business test because FIF 1 does not hold a voting interest of **more than** 50% in FIF 2.

Unlike CFC test groups, FIF test groups are not required to remove (subtract out) amounts that correspond to income interests held by other shareholders. This is achieved by sections EX 50(7)(f) and EX 50(7)(j) which omit these CFC requirements for FIF test groups.

**Example**

FIF 1 and FIF 2 apply the test as a consolidated group. Although FIF 1 only owns 80% of FIF 2, 100% of the relevant amounts of FIF 2 can be included when working out the formula for the FIF test group under section EX 21E(5).

[Applying the FIF rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012/applying-the-fif-rules "Applying the FIF rules")

Attributable income
===================

2012 changes to the FIF rules around attributable income.

#### No income or loss attributable from active FIFs and certain Australian FIFs

_Subsections CQ 5(1)(c) and DN 6(1)(c)_ 

No income is attributable from a FIF if it applies the attributable FIF income method and passes the active business test. This is provided for by section CQ 5(1)(c)(xv). An equivalent provision in section DN 6(1)(c)(xv) ensures that no loss is attributable if a loss-making FIF passes the active business test.

Similar provisions in sections CQ 5(1)(c)(v) and DN 6(1)(c)(v) prevent income or loss arising from interests in FIFs that satisfy the requirements of the Australian exemption in section EX 35.

#### Attributing income under the attributable FIF income method

If a person uses the attributable FIF income method for a FIF, and they are required to attribute income from that FIF (because it fails the active business test), they must apply section EX 50 in conjunction with sections EX 20B to EX 21 to work out their net attributable FIF income or loss from that FIF.

In general, the attribution rules are identical to those that were introduced in 2009 for CFCs. However, the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 makes some small modifications to the attribution rules which are detailed below.  

#### Dividends

_Subsection EX 20B(3)(a)_

Section EX 20B(3)(a) mirrors section CW 9(2) by attributing income from CFCs and FIFs which use the attributable FIF income method in respect of those dividends that would be taxable if they were received directly by a New Zealand company. The previous section on the foreign dividend exemption has more detail on how section CW 9(2) operates.

#### Attributable telecommunications income

_Subsection EX 20B(3)(m)(ii)_

Subsection EX 20B(3)(m)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 deems certain telecommunications services income to be attributable income to the extent to which the equipment is owned by "the CFC or by another CFC that is associated with the CFC". This subsection has been amended so it also covers situations when a CFC (or a FIF using the attributable FIF income method) is associated with any CFC or FIF. In the absence of this change it would be possible to reduce a foreign company's attributable income by dealing with an associated FIF that is not a CFC.

#### Exemption for intra-group payments

_Sections EX 50(4B)(a), (b) and (c) and EX 50(4C)_

Under the existing CFC rules, there is an exemption for interest, rent and royalty payments between associated CFCs so long as both CFCs are in the same jurisdiction and the CFC that makes the payment is a non-attributing active CFC (in other words, it passes the active business test).

A slightly different exemption applies under the attributable FIF income method.

While the CFC rules require the two CFCs to be associated companies, the attributable FIF income method requires both FIFs to be commonly controlled by a group of persons that hold more than 50% voting interests in both companies. This is achieved by section EX 50(4C) in conjunction with sections EX 50(4B)(a) to (c).

Section EX 50(4C)(a) requires the foreign company that makes the payments to be a FIF for which the person uses the attributable FIF income method. It is implicit that the FIF that receives the payments must also be using the attributable FIF income method, otherwise section EX 50(4C) would not apply.

Section EX 50(4C)(b) requires the foreign company that makes the payment to be a company that would be a non-attributing CFC or FIF. When determining whether the CFC or FIF is non-attributing, the exclusions in sections EX 20B(5)(c)(i), EX 20B(7)(c), and EX 20B(12)(a) as modified by section EX 50(4C) are ignored. This is necessary to avoid a circularity problem whereby the status of the paying company cannot be determined, because that company itself needs to apply the same exclusions.

Section EX 50(4C)(ab) requires there to be a group of persons with more than 50% voting rights in both foreign companies.

Section EX 50(4C)(c) requires both foreign companies to be resident and subject to tax in the same jurisdiction.

#### Examples

Interest, rent or royalty payments in examples 1, 2 and 3 would be not be attributable income of the FIFs that receive those payments.

**Example 1**

The payment in Example 4 would be attributable income of the US FIF as the person (NZ Co) does not use the attributable FIF income method in relation to the US company that pays the interest, rent or royalty (in fact they do not even have an income interest in the company that makes the payment).

**Example 4**

The payment in Example 5 would be attributable income of UK FIF 1 as UK FIF 2 is not controlled by the same persons as UK FIF 1.

#### Rules for deducting certain non-ordinary dividends

_Sections EX 20C and EX 20D_

Section EX 20C includes rules that limit the deductibility of interest payments. Similar rules limit the deductibility of payments made in respect of fixed rate foreign equity or deductible foreign equity.

These rules have been modified to reflect the fact that such payments may now be deductible when paid by a FIF for which the person uses the attributable FIF income method.

Whether section EX 20C provides a deduction for a fixed-rate foreign dividend or a deductible foreign dividend depends on the following principles:

1.  A deduction is generally provided when the recipient could face New Zealand tax on the dividend. This occurs when the dividend is paid to a New Zealand company, a CFC or a FIF that uses the attributable FIF income method (see section EX 20C(6)(a)(ii)).
2.  However, the deduction is limited, based on the payer's ratio of passive to total assets (for example, if the paying CFC or FIF has 100% passive assets they will be entitled to a full deduction. If the paying CFC or FIF has 50% passive assets, they will only be able to claim half the deduction).
3.  An on-lending concession is provided which allows a full deduction when the dividend is paid to an associated CFC or to an associated FIF for which the person uses the attributable FIF income method (see section EX 20C(6)(c)(i) and (7)(b)(i)).

Sections EX 20D and EX 20E restrict interest deductions if some CFCs are excessively debt-funded relative to other CFCs in the group. More specifically, if the CFC has a debt-to-asset ratio determined under section EX 20D(4) of more than 0.75, and also has a relative debt-asset ratio determined under section EX 20E of more than 1.10, a portion of their interest deductions is non-deductible. The portion is determined by the formula in section EX 20C(8).

For the purposes of working out these ratios, fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity issued by the CFC or FIF to New Zealand residents, CFCs or FIFs for which the attributable FIF income method is used, count towards the CFC or FIF's total debt.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

Attributed foreign income - liability to tax
============================================

2012 legislation extends income that can be excluded from attributed foreign income, by permitting certain companies to be treated as resident in that country.

_Sections EX 20B(7)(a), EX 20B(11)(a), EX 21D(1)(a) and EX 21E(2)(b), subsections EX 20B(16), EX 21D(10), EX 21E(14), and definition of associated non-attributing active CFC in section YA 1_

The Act expands the scope of income that can be excluded from attributed foreign income, by permitting some companies, which are not recognised for tax purposes in the country they operate in, to nevertheless be treated as resident in that country.

The Act also adds requirements to prevent abuse of the rules that allow some income to be ignored.

#### Application date

The changes apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009.

#### Key features

*   Income that a controlled foreign company receives from a non-attributing active CFC (an active business) resident in the same country may be ignored for tax purposes even if one or both CFCs are not liable to tax in that country.
*   Income that a controlled foreign company receives from rental property in the same country may be ignored even if the CFC is not liable to tax in that country.
*   Income that a controlled foreign company receives from telecommunications services between the country in which it is resident and New Zealand may be ignored even if the CFC is not liable to tax in that country.
*   A CFC may be part of a test group in the country in which it is resident, even if it is not liable to tax in that country.

For these to apply, all the following requirements must be met:

*   The CFC is a resident of the country in question under section YD 3 (this does not require liability to tax).
*   The CFC is wholly owned (directly or indirectly through a wholly owned chain of companies) under the laws of both New Zealand and the foreign country, by another CFC that is resident in that country under section YD 3.
*   That other CFC is liable to tax in the jurisdiction on the income of the CFC by reason of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation or centre of management, in the same period as the CFC would be liable if it were an ordinary company liable to tax.
*   Neither the CFC nor the other CFC is treated as a dual-resident.
*   Neither the CFC nor the other CFC has a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment outside the country.

The first, fourth and fifth requirements are extended to apply to all companies, not just those that are not liable to tax in a particular country. If these requirements are not met, it will not be possible to use the exemptions for payments from a non-attributing active CFC, rent from property in the same country or income from telecommunications services between the CFC's country of residence and New Zealand, or to be in a test group, regardless of liability to tax.

As well as applying to CFCs, the changes also apply to FIFs that use the attributable FIF income method.

#### Detailed analysis

#### _Same country exemptions_

Existing law provides that amounts that would be included in attributed foreign income for taxpayers with interests in foreign companies may be ignored in some cases where the income arises in the same country as the foreign company (see paragraphs EX 20B(5)(c), (7)(a), (7)(c), (11)(a), (12)(a), and paragraphs EX 21D(1)(a) and 21E(2)(a)).

To take advantage of these "same country exemptions", the foreign company must show it is resident in that country by reason of liability to tax.

#### _When same country exemptions do not apply (not liable to tax)_

Some entities that New Zealand considers to be foreign companies are not treated as taxable entities in the country in which they are registered or organised. For example, a  
United States Limited Liability Company (LLC) such as a so-called "Delaware company" is often considered by the United States to be analogous to a partnership for tax purposes. In that case, it is not liable to tax in that country (though its shareholders may be) and the foreign company is not able to take advantage of the same country exemptions.

#### _When the current position is logical_

Excluding entities such as LLCs from the same country exemptions is often the correct result. For example, if an LLC owns an ordinary active company in the same country, and is able to extract the profit from that active company in the form of an interest payment, there may be very little foreign tax imposed on the income of the LLC, its shareholders, or the active company. In that case, it would not be appropriate to exempt the income from New Zealand tax.

#### _When the exemptions should apply even though there is no liability to tax_

However, there are cases when excluding entities such as LLCs from the same country exemptions is unnecessary and even counterproductive.

In particular, if the LLC is wholly owned by another company in the same country, and that other company is liable for tax on the LLC's income, the outcome should be similar to the case in which all of the companies are liable to tax in that country. In those cases, normal tax is paid on the active income of the group in the foreign country and New Zealand should be prepared to exempt the income here.

_Remedial amendments when liability to tax is not an issue_

The widening of the same country exemptions to entities that are not liable to tax in the foreign country has highlighted some situations in which the existing exemption - for entities that are liable to tax in the foreign country - may be too wide.

Companies may be resident by reason of liability to tax in more than one country. Or they may be resident in one country but conduct significant operations in another. In that case, it may not be appropriate to assume that the country in which income is being earned is ultimately taxing the income.

#### _Imposing additional conditions on the same country exemptions for all entities_

_Sections EX 20B(7)(a), EX 20B(11)(a), EX 21D(1)(a) and EX 21E(2)(b), subsections EX 20B(16), EX 21D(10), EX 21E(14), and definition of associated non-attributing active CFC in section YA 1_

To limit the use of the same country exemptions to cases when it is more likely that active income is being taxed normally by the relevant foreign country, there are three additional conditions for residence.

These are:

*   first, that the CFC is a resident of the country in question under section YD 3;
*   secondly, that the CFC is not treated as a dual-resident; and
*   thirdly, that the CFC does not have a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment outside the country.

The existing section YD 3 determines a single country of residence of a CFC (it does not require liability to tax).

A CFC is regarded as a dual-resident if one or more of three conditions is met:

*   The CFC is treated as a resident of a country other than the country in section YD 3 under the law of the relevant jurisdiction.
*   The company is liable to income tax by reason of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or centre of management in a country other than the country in section YD 3.
*   The company is treated as a resident of a country other than the country in section YD 3, under an agreement that would be a double tax agreement if New Zealand was a party to it.

"Fixed establishment" is a defined term in the Income Tax Act. "Permanent establishment" is an analogous term used in double tax agreements and extensively discussed in the OECD's commentary to the _Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital_.

#### _Widening the same country exemptions for entities with no liability to tax_

_Sections EX 20B(7)(a), EX 20B(11)(a), EX 21D(1)(a) and EX 21E(2)(b), subsections EX 20B(16), EX 21D(10), EX 21E(14), and definition of associated non-attributing active CFC in section YA 1_

At the same time as clarifying the requirements for all companies that use the same country exemptions, the new Act widens the scope of the exemptions to include entities that are not liable to income tax because they are not considered to be taxable entities in the country where they are resident.

A CFC that is not liable to tax in the relevant country may still make use of the exemption if it meets the conditions for residence (see previous section) and two further conditions are met:

*   the CFC is wholly owned, under the laws of New Zealand and the foreign country, either directly or through a chain of wholly owned companies, by another CFC that meets the conditions for residence in the previous section; and
*   the other CFC is liable to tax on the income of the CFC in the relevant country by reason of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation or centre of management, in the same period as the CFC would be liable if it was an ordinary company liable to tax there.

**Example: Using same country exemptions when not liable to tax**

Hold Co owns 100% of LLC Co, which in turn owns 100% of Op Co. All three companies are CFCs incorporated in and managed from the United States, and are treated as residents of the United States under section YD 3. None of the companies has operations outside the United States.

Op Co and Hold Co are liable to tax by reason of residence in the United States, but LLC Co is treated as a partnership for tax purposes and so is not liable to tax.

Op Co is a non-attributing active CFC.

Op Co pays interest to LLC Co.

The interest is not subject to tax in the United States in the hands of LLC Co, but is subject to tax in the hands of Hold Co.

LLC Co can ignore the payment of interest from Op Co, even though it is not liable to income tax in the United States. LLC Co is wholly owned by owned by Hold Co, and Hold Co is liable to tax in the United States on LLC Co's income (including interest income).

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

The attribution rule is aimed at ensuring people do not avoid the higher income tax rates by diverting employment income to an associated entity (such as a company, trust or partnership).

Attribution rules
-----------------

The attribution rule applies when all of the following apply.

*   A person (the working person) provides personal services.
*   They are associated with an entity (the associated entity).
*   The associated entity provides services to a third person (the buyer), and the services are personally performed by the working person, and the working person earns net income of more than $70,000 including income of the associated entity if the attribution rule applies.
*   At least 80% of the associated entity’s income from personal services comes from the buyer and/or a person associated with them.
*   At least 80% of the associated entity’s income from personal services is earned by the working person and/or a relative of the working person.

Exemptions
----------

The attribution rule does not apply when any of the following apply.

*   Both the associated entity and the working person are non-residents for the full income year.
*   The associated entity is a natural person acting in that capacity (and is not a partner of a partnership or a trustee).
*   The services being provided are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity.
*   The associated entity has substantial business assets (discussed below).
*   The associated entity is a CFC and the CFC rules (discussed below) apply.
*   The total amount to be attributed for the income year is less than $5,000. However, this exception can only be relied on once - it does not apply if the working person has more than 1 associated entity and the other associated entity has not had income attributed because of this exception.

Substantial business assets
---------------------------

The attribution rule is not applied when the associated entity has substantial business assets that are a necessary part of the business structure used to derive the entity’s assessable income.

Substantial business assets are depreciable property that both:

*   are not for private use, or if they are then no more than 20% is for private use
*   have a total cost of more than $75,000, or 25% or more of the associated entity’s income from services for the year.

Controlled foreign companies (CFC)
----------------------------------

The attribution rule is not applied when all of the following apply.

*   The associated entity is a CFC.
*   The amount that would be attributed to the working person under the income attribution rules would also be attributed CFC income or a loss (under the rules for when attributed CFC income or losses arise).
*   The working person files a return of income in which they return the amount as attributed CFC income.

The $5,000 exemption will not apply if the associated entity is a CFC.

[Controlled foreign companies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies/controlled-foreign-companies)

Example: Diverting income to a company

An individual earns a salary of $190,000 from their employer. Without the attribution rule they could establish a company which would be contracted to the employer whereby the individual performs the same employment services. Tax on income to the company would be at the company rate of 28%, rather than the applicable personal rate of up to 33% (or up to 39% from the 2021-2022 year onwards) if the employee was receiving the income directly. The individual could then choose to receive $70,000 in salary (taxed at up to 30%), and either leave the remainder in the company, or distribute it to an associated person such as a spouse. Without the attribution rule in both cases the top tax rate applied would be either 30% or lower.

Auckland couple sentenced for repeated tax evasion
==================================================

**20 January 2021**

A South Auckland husband and wife, who a judge says used a repeat pattern of tax evasion and used their children as puppets in their ongoing businesses, have been sentenced to prison and home detention respectively.

Tamanini Muaiava and his wife Uputaua Muaiava were sentenced in the Papakura District Court this week on 65 charges each of evading or attempting to evade the assessment or payment of goods and services tax, and PAYE.

Tamanini Muaiava was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment and Uputaua Muaiava was sentenced to nine months home detention.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Tony Morris says Tamanini Muaiava has previous tax convictions and says someone who persistently evades their tax obligations in the way Mr Muaiava did, deserves to be held to account.

“Tamanini and Uputaua Muaiava jointly operated businesses supplying labour to agricultural growers in South Auckland. When they were confronted about one company’s failure to pay tax, that company would be wound up and a new company incorporated to continue their trading.

“On at least three separate occasions they used one of their children as sole director and shareholder in a company. The sentencing judge noted the children were “enlisted as mere puppets for the ongoing business”.

“The judge noted that English is a second language for Mr Muaiava but rejected any claim of misunderstanding about his tax obligations. He said while Muaiava’s ‘cultural’ obligation to ensure harvesters were paid may provide the context of his offending, it doesn’t excuse it.”

The various companies kept few records and traded mostly in cash for both income and expenditure and IR has had to reconstruct income from invoice records. The total tax evaded by the Muaiava’s is estimated at $431,644.66.

Tony Morris says the offending is straight theft from the community and a gross abuse of trust.

“The offending not only involved the deliberate failure to file GST and PAYE returns, but also the careful use of new companies to continue trading in the same business, with the same primary customers and in the same way.

“It’s why the judge found their offending was premeditated, repetitive and deliberate. While the couple are of modest means and have few assets or exhibit a lavish lifestyle their family accepted considerable income from this tax fraud”, Mr Morris says.

In his judgement, Judge Winter accepted that Tamanini Muaiava felt pressure to pay his workers and may have tried to help them on occasions by giving them extra money for their special needs, such as family funerals. However, he didn’t accept that either he or his family made no financial gain from his tax evasion.

Judge Winter says there is a clear connection between Tamanini Muaiava’s personal, family, community and Samoan cultural background that explains but cannot excuse his offending. He also accepted the couples now deep sense of shame (Maasiasi) and profound remorse.

\[ IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive release: This document has been released by Inland Revenue under section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. Inland Revenue r eport: Transformation s tatus update: August 2021 Date: 31 August 2021 Priority: Medium Security level: In confidence Report number: IR2021/309 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Note the contents of this report None Minister of Revenue Note the contents of this report None Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA 3 IR2021/309: Transformation status update: August 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Budget performance to date 6. Between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, the programme spent $747 million in operating, and $374.9 million in capital. Any under-spending to date has either been moved to later periods or returned to the Crown. Stage 4 budget 7. Including transitional funding until 30 June 2022, the overall budget for the current phase of transformation, Stage 4, is $251.2 million for operating expenditure and $90.3 million for capital expenditure. We are on track to come in on budget for Stage 4. 8. Forecast Stage 4 costs have increased slightly this month for both operating and capital expenditure following a detailed review of all workstreams. On 19 August 2021, our Portfolio Governance Committee approved a drawdown from contingency to fund these costs. Transitional costs have decreased, reflecting some of the funding set aside for the 2020/21 year not being required. Recommended action 9. I recommend that you: a) Note the contents of this report. Noted Noted b) Agree to defer the final progress update to the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee until February 2022.

This final release will move child support to new systems and processes and upgrade the online services all customers use and the START software our people use. 11. The closure of the Asteron Centre, and the Level 4 lockdown, have been very disruptive to the release. Prior to the Level 4 lockdown, with access to shared hub facilities and rotating co-location teams in both Wellington and Hamilton, the impact of the Asteron closure had been partially mitigated. 12. Our focus remains on delivering the release to the highest level of quality possible. We are closely monitoring external events, such as lockdowns and building closures. As we have for previous releases, we have contingency plans in place should we need to delay go -live for any reason. 13. As part of our response plan for the closure of Asteron, we moved the start dates of the second and third mock go-lives (a dress rehearsal for go-live) and the related scaled business simulation testing (testing of key end-to-end processes) out by a week. The second mock go-live was originally scheduled to commence on 9 August and started on 16 August 2021. We had allowed 2 weeks in our planning as a contingency. 14. The first round of scaled business simulation testing has been completed, with no major issues identified. As with every round of mock go-live and scaled business simulation testing, there are a small number of issues we are working through. 15. Business system testing (making sure START works as expected) is 93% complete and daily tracking is in place to drive towards completion. 16. Conversion of data continues. Reconciliation of the data extracted from our old system to the data converted to our new system is well advanced. The tail end of issues resulting in differences is being worked through. 17. On 19 August 2021, the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) approved the third checkpoint in our readiness assessment framework. The checkpoint results indicate that while this release is at a similar state of readiness compared to previous large releases, we cannot assume that progress will continue from here in line with previous releases. There is an elevated risk of delay due to the Asteron closure, the complexity of the child support product, and the Alert Level 4 lockdown. Readying our people 18. Mandatory training for people who work with child support is being delivered from August to October 2021. Most people will have a virtual classroom session and three in- person classroom sessions to attend as shown in the table below. Table 3: P lanned schedule for mandatory child support training Month Mandatory training August 2021 Overview of child support legislation changes: • Self-paced pre-reading (30 mins) • Virtual classroom session (1.5 hours) September 2021 Child Support in START: • In-person classroom session one (full day) • In-person classroom session two (full day) October 2021 Child Support in START: • In-person classroom session three (full day) • Self-paced online modules 19. The first online learning modules for our people were launched on 2 August 2021. 5 IR2021/309: Transformation status update: August 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 20. At this stage we are proceeding with the training schedule as planned, with contingencies around sessions for people who are displaced because of the closure of Asteron and the move to Alert Level 4. Our contingency includes switching face-to-face classroom sessions to virtual classroom sessions and, if alert levels reduce, shifting Wellington-based classroom sessions to a venue other than Asteron. 21. Mandatory training for people who use START and/or support customers with using myIR will also be delivered from August to October 2021. All of this training will be completed online and is self-paced as shown in the table below. Table 4: Planned schedule for mandatory training for the upgrade to the software our people use, and the online services customers use Month Mandatory training August 2021 Overview of START changes: • Self-paced online modules (1 hour) September 2021 Overview of myIR changes: • Self-paced online modules ( 1 hour) START training: • Self-paced online modules (1 hour) October 2021 myIR detailed training: • Self-paced online modules (3 hours) 22. We have held a number of “masterclasses ’’ for our people about the changes to online services. F ive sessions in total have been held, with around 220 people dialling into the session held on 12 August 2021 about changes for micro, not for profit, and small to medium-sized businesses. On 26 August 2021, around 175 people dialled into the session about changes for significant enterprises. Sessions are available on demand for people to view if they could not attend them live. 23. Comprehensive help and guidance will be available for our people through Te Mātāwai (online help for our people who work with customers). Readying our customers 24. We continue to update the information on our website, including directing customers and intermediaries to webinars as they are published. 25. During the month, we made a further three webinars available on our website, all related to the upgrade to our online services: • How alerts will work in myIR. • Sending and receiving correspondence through myIR. • Filing, viewing and amending returns, and making payments through myIR. 26. Communications activity will ramp up in September 2021 based on our planned go- live date. Pou Whirinaki 27. After each release, we provide early life support for a period. This is known as Pou Whirinaki, and additional support is provided to customers and our people to resolve any issues that are identified with the release. Our planning assumption is that the initial period of heightened support (known as hyper-care) will run until 3 December 2021, followed by ongoing early life support until 31 January 2022. 28. We will use the same tried and true processes, structure, monitoring, and reporting as we have for previous releases. This includes a sub-group of our Executive Leadership 6 IR2021/309: Transformation status update: August 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Team meeting daily for the first two weeks after go-live to enable regular updates and quick escalation when required. Risks to the release 29. This release brings with it a different set of challenges than we have previously had. Child support is a complex product with a vulnerable customer base. Our previous experience has shown us that making changes to child support is difficult and can result in customers needing reassurance that their payments are right. The upgrade to online services involves wide-ranging change across all products, bringing a new look and feel to our staff and customers, which may also create reactions. 30. While we are doing our utmost to ensure our customers are ready for the changes and that our people are ready to support them, it is possible that issues will occur after go -live. 31. We have spent some time thinking about the challenges we could face following go- live and how we would respond if needed. Responses will depend on the situation and could include targeting messaging to particular groups of customers, updates to our website, or proactively contacting customers. Other updates Payroll update 32. As we have previously reported (IR2020/ 457 refers), we need to exit our heritage datacentres as Unisys is exiting the data centre market in New Zealand and will close its facilities in 2022. 33. This has required us to relocate various heritage systems including payroll to new systems. In March 2021, the PGC decided to relocate our payroll system to a cloud-based solution (IR2021/105 refers). We are taking a low risk, staged approach and detailed testing has begun. Delivery is proceeding well with no significant risks identified and we are confident we can move our payroll system to the cloud by November 2021. Timing of final Cabinet paper 34. When the government agreed to invest in the transformation of the revenue system (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers), we were directed to report back on progress by July and December each year. Since July 2016, we have provided 12 progress updates to Cabinet. 35. Under our original implementation plan, the final stage would have gone live in one big release in April 2021, and we would have provided our final update to Cabinet by December 2021. Due to the impacts of COVID-19, we made the decision to split the final stage into two releases (IR2020/267 refers). 36. Given this, there are few options available to provide a meaningful update to Cabinet before the end of the year. There are two meetings of the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee we could aim for once we have gone live – 25 November or 16 December 2021. To provide the Minister of Revenue with sufficient time to review the draft paper, it would need to be provided to him by 4 November or 25 November 2021 respectively. In either case, based on our planning assumptions, we would only be a few weeks into our early life support activity and would not have exited the hyper care period. 37. We are therefore seeking your approval to defer the final progress update to Cabinet until February 2022. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive update about the implementation of the final release. This means we would provide the draft paper to the 7 IR2021/309: Transformation status update: August 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Minister of Revenue in late January 2022. Please note that these dates may need to be revised if go-live is delayed. Key risks and issues 38. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber, with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 39. Please note that the issues and risks in this report, and their respective ratings, were updated just prior to the move to COVID-19 Alert Level 4 so do not reflect any impacts that may have. 40. We are actively managing two issues. 41. One new issue (a risk that has been realised) was raised during the month regarding the need for alternative accommodation to be found for critical resources on the programme as a result of the closure of the Asteron building. Our response to the closure of Asteron was well underway prior to the Level 4 lockdown. Some of the teams critical to the upcoming release had been relocated to our other sites in Hamilton and Upper Hutt, and we had been progressively moving other people and teams into accommodation Inland Revenue has secured in other buildings in the Wellington CBD. 42. We continue to monitor the issue relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. At the time this issue was reviewed, just prior to the lock down, t here were no concerns to report. This may change, depending on the length of the lock down. 43. As of August 2021, the programme has a total of 46 open risks 1 , of which 10 are reported to the PGC. 44. One new risk was raised during the month relating to the potential for a delay in go- live of the final release due to the Asteron building closure. We are actively managing this risk, including relocating people as noted above, and are assessing the impacts of any delays. 45. Two risks previously reported to the PGC were closed during the month: 46. The risk relating to Government losing confidence in Inland Revenue's ability to deliver the business transformation programme has been closed. The programme is nearing completion and has successfully delivered five releases across four stages to date. 47. The risk relating to insufficient funding being available to complete delivery of the programme due to competing priorities/pressures or changes in government priorities has been closed. The programme is nearing completion with sufficient funding available for the remainder of the work in scope. 48. There has been no change in the status of any of the other risks reported to the PGC since the last report. 1 During August 2021, one new programme risk was raised and reported to the PGC and four programme risks were closed, including two reported to the PGC. The status of one programme level risk improved. 8 IR2021/309: Transformation status update: August 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 49. The top three risks for transformation are: • The potential for delay of the final release as a result of the Asteron building closure and the COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown. • Realising the benefits we committed to deliver in the timeframes indicated. • Possible changes in payments once child support is moved to new systems and processes. Coming up in the next two months 50. Key activities over the next two months include: September 2021 • Complete business system testing. • Complete the second round of scaled business simulation testing and begin the third round. • Complete the third mock go-live. • Complete a further readiness assessment checkpoint for child support and upgraded online services. October 2021 • Final checkpoints in our readiness assessment framework. • Planned go- live of child support on new systems and processes and upgrade of our online services. • Planned beginning of early life support.

Australian unit trusts
======================

2005 amendments close a loophole that allowed certain NZ investments in Australian unit trusts to be tax-free.

**_Sections CF 2(1)(i), CF 2(6)(a), CF 3(2)(c)(ii), CF 8(a), DJ 11B and_** **_OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and sections CD 7B, CD 7C, CD 21B, DB 44 and_** **_OB1 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

### Introduction

An issue of units in an offshore unit trust when there is an arrangement to issue the units instead of vesting money or property absolutely in the unit holder will be treated as a taxable bonus issue. Amendments also clarify that an amount that vests absolutely in a unit holder of an offshore unit trust is treated as a taxable dividend. The changes close a loophole that allowed certain New Zealand investments in Australian unit trusts to be tax-free.

### Background

An opportunity existed for New Zealand resident investors to use Australian unit trust (AUT) structures to reduce or eliminate tax on certain investment income. This problem gave rise to a significant tax base maintenance concern and provided an incentive for New Zealand residents to use AUT structures rather than New Zealand vehicles when making certain investments.

Income earned by non-Australian residents through an AUT that is not sourced in Australia is not subject to Australian tax if it is distributed in the same year that it is earned. Previously, this income could also escape New Zealand tax if it was distributed by way of a non-taxable bonus issue of new units in the AUT. The amendment was introduced by Supplementary Order Paper number 210 on 11 May 2004.

### Key features

*   The amendments treat as a taxable bonus issue an issue of units in an offshore unit trust where there is an arrangement to issue the units instead of vesting money or property absolutely in the unit holder (sections OB 1 of the 1994 Act and CD 7C of the 2004 Act).
*   An amendment also clarifies that an amount vesting absolutely in a unit holder of an offshore unit trust is treated as a taxable dividend (section OB 1 of both Acts and sections CF 2(1) (i) of the 1994 Act and CD 7B of the 2004 Act).
*   The application of the change is limited to offshore unit trusts (various sections).
*   An amendment also ensures that companies deriving exempt offshore dividends can claim an appropriate deduction for expenses incurred (sections DJ 11B of the 1994 Act and DB 44 of the 2004 Act).

### Application date

The amendments apply to amounts vested and units issued on or after the date the Act came into force, 21 December 2004.

### Detailed analysis

**The problem dealt with by the amendments**

When applicable, New Zealand's international tax rules tax offshore equity investments comprehensively. An exemption exists, however, for investments in countries that have a similar tax system to New Zealand's. These countries are known as "grey list" countries, and Australia is included on this list. For many investors this means that they are taxed only on a distribution of dividends derived from these offshore entities.

Under New Zealand tax law investments in unit trusts, including offshore unit trusts, are treated as investments in a company. Trust law still applies to these investments such that if the trustee of a trust vests funds absolutely in a beneficiary, the beneficiary has an absolute beneficial interest in those funds. The dividend tax rules applicable to companies treat amounts that are distributed from a company to a shareholder as a taxable dividend. Therefore, given that a unit trust is treated as a company, and the beneficiary of the unit trust gains an absolute beneficial interest in an amount, the absolute vesting of that amount in a beneficiary was, before the amendment was made, probably already treated as a dividend for tax purposes.

Previously, however, an amount that would otherwise be treated as a dividend could, in certain circumstances, be non-taxable if it was distributed by way of a "bonus issue" of new units rather than cash. Section OB 1 defines a "bonus issue" as, essentially, the issue by a company to a shareholder of new shares in a situation where the company does not receive consideration for the issue. If the shareholder pays for the new units this is not a "bonus issue".

The problem with the rules as they were was that a unit holder could, when units of a particular class were purchased, agree that future amounts that the trustee or the trust deed vested absolutely in them were to be reinvested in new units rather than distributed in cash. If such an agreement was made it would appear that, before the amendment, the reinvestment of the amount was not consideration provided by the unit holder to the unit trust. This means that the unit trust could issue new units that were treated as "bonus issues". These could then be treated as non-taxable bonus issues.

This is clearly the wrong result from a policy perspective. The amounts which vest absolutely in the beneficiary are economically equivalent to a dividend and should, therefore, be treated equivalently. The fact that the shareholder has chosen to have the amount reinvested in a new unit should not alter the dividend character of the amount that vests absolutely.

Examples of structures that caused particular concern are those that invested back into New Zealand government stock. This is problematic because, if the New Zealand resident had invested in the government stock directly rather than through the AUT, full New Zealand tax would have been paid on the interest income.

**The solution**

_Amendments to definition of taxable bonus issue (section_ _OB 1 and section CD 7C of the 2004 Act)_

The main amendment is to the definition of "taxable bonus issue" in section OB 1 and the definition of dividend in section CD 7C of the 2004 Act. The amendment provides that an issue of units in an offshore unit trust that are made as part of an arrangement when units are issued instead of the unit trust vesting money or property absolutely in the unit holder is a taxable bonus issue. This ensures that unit holders in offshore unit trusts cannot, essentially, agree to have distributions reinvested in new units in order to escape dividend taxation.

_Amendments to dividend definition (sections CF 2(1)(i) of the 1994 Act and CD 7B of the 2004 Act))_

Section CF 2(1)(i) has been amended and new section CD 7B inserted, to put beyond doubt that amounts distributed by an offshore unit trust that vest absolutely in the unit holder are treated as taxable dividends.

While it is almost certain that an amount that vests absolutely in a beneficiary is already treated as a dividend under sections CF 2(1)(a) of the 1994 Act and CD 3(1) and CD 4(1) of the 2004 Act, this amendment puts the issue beyond doubt. For the amendments to deal effectively with AUT structures it is vital that a vesting from a unit trust is treated as a dividend. If it could be argued that such a vesting was not treated as a dividend, the AUT structures could still provide an opportunity for New Zealand resident investors to minimise or eliminate tax on their investments.

This could be achieved by the AUT vesting an amount of income absolutely in the New Zealand resident beneficiary. This would result in the income not being taxed in Australia and, if the amount that was vested was not a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes, the amount would not be taxed in New Zealand. It would not be necessary for the vesting to be accompanied by the issue of a new unit. The vested amount would simply be reflected in a higher value for existing units. If the New Zealand resident beneficiary held such units on capital account, this additional value could be realised as a tax-free capital gain when the unit was eventually sold.

_Expenditure derived by a company in deriving exempt dividends_

The problem that arose in the AUT investment context is that, as a result of the amendments, the treatment of certain bonus issues of units from unit trusts have changed from non-taxable in nature to taxable dividends. For a company that holds units in such a unit trust, this will result in the issue of those units being treated as exempt dividends under section CB 10(1) of the 1994 Act and section CW 9(1) of the 2004 Act and, therefore, subject to a dividend withholding payment (DWP) deduction of 33%. Expenditure incurred by the New Zealand resident company in deriving the exempt dividends is not likely to be tax-deductible, in the absence of the current amendment, as the expenditure would have been incurred to derive exempt income (section BD 2(2)(b) of the 1994 Act and section DA 2(3) of the 2004 Act). The problem has existed for some time and was on the government's tax policy work programme.

From a policy perspective a full deduction should be allowed when the income is fully subject to either New Zealand income tax or DWP. However, if a New Zealand resident company derives a dividend from a non-resident company, situations can arise where the dividend is not subject to full New Zealand tax or full DWP. Allowing a full deduction in these situations would give rise to an inappropriate result.

The amendment solves this problem by, essentially, providing that a deduction be allowed for expenditure incurred by a company deriving dividends that are exempt under section CB 10(1) of the 1994 Act and section CW 9(1) of the 2004 Act to the extent that DWP on the dividends is not relieved by the conduit tax rules (new section DJ 11B of the 1994 Act and section DB 44 of the 2004 Act).

Authority concludes notice of assessment correctly given but finds exceptional circumstances under s 89k
========================================================================================================

2016 case note - TRA concludes notice of assessment correctly given but finds exceptional circumstances under s 89K of the Tax Administration Act.

Case

TRA 020/15

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 14, 89K, 111

### Summary

This case concerned two separate issues: first, when did the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") give notice of an assessment such that dispute rights commenced, and secondly, whether the Commissioner's decision to refuse to accept out of time a notice of proposed assessment ("NOPA") was correct. The Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") held that notice was given when the Commissioner issued a notice of assessment to the taxpayer at its last known address. However, her decision to refuse to accept the late NOPA was incorrect as there were exceptional circumstances.

### Impact

In relation to obligations under s 14 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), the Judge adopted the _Aitken_ (_Chief Executive, Ministry of Fisheries v Peter Aitken and Anor_ 2009 Wellington Registry CIV-2005-485-001947) case, which means that the Commissioner need not make any enquiry as to a taxpayer's correct address and is able to give notice by sending it to the last known address.

Judge Sinclair's analysis of what constitutes notice of an assessment makes it clear that, while in some cases documents may be combined to form notice of an assessment, on these facts the claimed documents could not be read together to form notice of the assessment.

The judgment also provides some guidance on the application of s 89K of the TAA, although this guidance is specific to the facts in this case.

### Facts

This decision concerns preliminary issues that were required to be determined prior to any hearing on the substantive tax issues.

The disputant (trustees of a trust) claimed a goods and services tax ("GST") refund which, following audit by the Commissioner, was reassessed to nil. The disputant contends that the Commissioner gave notice of the (re)assessment in a letter dated 23 January 2013, to which the disputant purported to issue a NOPA on 19 February 2013. No notice of response ("NOR") was issued by the Commissioner and the disputant claimed that the NOPA is deemed accepted and the Commissioner is liable to pay the refund claimed.

The Commissioner denies that the letter of 23 January 2013 was a notice of assessment and says the notice of assessment was given under cover of a letter dated 16 April 2013. The disputant says that notice was not given in accordance with s 14 of the TAA until a copy was included with a letter from the Commissioner dated 5 March 2015. The disputant then issued a second NOPA dated 30 March 2015, along with an application under s 89K of the TAA for that NOPA to be accepted out of time on the basis of exceptional circumstances. The Commissioner declined the application to accept the second NOPA out of time.

### Decision

_When did the Commissioner give notice of the assessment for the GST period ended 31 October 2008 so that dispute rights commenced?_

Judge Sinclair concluded that notice of the assessment was given under cover of the Commissioner's letter dated 16 April 2013, and the letter of 23 January 2013 was not a notice of assessment. Accordingly, the purported NOPA dated 19 February 2013 was not valid and the Commissioner was under no obligation to have issued a NOR.

In May 2010 Mr S (whom the Commissioner understood to be the trustee of the trust) moved to China. In December 2010 he asked Inland Revenue to send any mail to a Chinese postal address. He also included an email address and a Chinese mobile number.

In July 2011 Mr S signed and filed a form headed "Elect someone to act on your behalf" appointing a trustee company to act on behalf of the disputant in its dealings with Inland Revenue. The form had an expiry date of 1 January 2020.

In December 2012 the Commissioner received a letter from Mr B, as trustee of the disputant, requesting payment of the GST refund given four years had passed since the GST return was filed. The Commissioner replied to Mr B on 23 January 2013 advising that the GST period referred to had been reassessed in December 2010, the trustee at the time had been advised, and that no refund was available.

The disputant claimed that the December 2012 and January 2013 letters, when read together, contained sufficient information to constitute notice of the assessment.

The Commissioner argued that the January 2013 letter did not have the characteristics of a notice of assessment as (1) it did not purport to be a notice of assessment and did not use those words; (2) it did not contain any particulars of the assessment, such as the tax periods, amount or extent of the assessment; (3) it asserted that the reassessment occurred over two years previously and had been notified accordingly; and (4) it asserted that no refund was available.

The TRA noted that no particular form is prescribed by which the Commissioner is required to give notice of an assessment to a taxpayer pursuant to s 111, that in some cases documents may be combined to form an assessment, and that each case will depend on its facts.

The TRA was satisfied that the January 2013 letter did not constitute a notice of assessment for the purposes of s 111 of the TAA. It was clearly written to answer the matters raised in the December 2012 letter, was not intended to be a notice of assessment and did not include the information expected to be contained in a notice of assessment. The TRA noted that the notice of assessment triggers dispute rights and is an important document in the disputes procedure.

It was accepted by all parties that the notice accompanying the letter of 16 April 2013 was a notice of assessment for the purposes of s 111 of the TAA, but what was at issue was whether the notice was given in accordance with s 14 of the TAA. The Commissioner posted the notice of assessment to the Chinese address provided by Mr S in December 2010. The Judge found there was no evidence that Mr S ever told the Commissioner not to use the Chinese postal address.

Judge Sinclair adopted the approach in _Chief Executive, Ministry of Fisheries v Peter Aitken and Anor_ (2009 Wellington Registry CIV-2005-485-001947) that there was no obligation on the Commissioner to establish the correct address for the disputant, and that she was entitled to use the disputant's last advised postal address.

_Was the Commissioner's decision under s 89K of the TAA to refuse to accept out of time a NOPA dated 30 March 2015 correct?_

Judge Sinclair concluded that the Commissioner's decision under s 89K to refuse to accept the second NOPA out of time was incorrect and set it aside.

Section 89K(1) provides that the Commissioner may accept a late NOPA where (a) the Commissioner considers that an exceptional circumstance has prevented a disputant from issuing a NOPA; and (b) the NOPA is sent as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of their failure to issue a NOPA within the response period.

Judge Sinclair concluded that there were exceptional circumstances in this case, that the disputant acted reasonably, and that events were a consequence of the following decisions and actions taken by the Commissioner:

1.  Although aware of the nomination of the trustee company to act on behalf of the disputant, the Commissioner did not act on this but asked Mr S to confirm that Mr A B (director of the trustee company, who had replaced Mr B as director after Mr B's bankruptcy) continued to have authority to act on behalf of the disputant. In the Judge's opinion, this overlooked that the nomination had been given to the trustee company;
2.  Inland Revenue knew Mr S was resident in China. He gave an email address as his contact address and during a telephone conversation gave authority to send correspondence by email. Although some correspondence was sent by email, the Commissioner did not ask Mr S to sign the email consent form, and the notice of assessment was sent to the disputant by post only;
3.  Despite giving 28 days for reply to questions, the Commissioner issued the notice of assessment before this period expired. The Judge considered that the disputant was entitled to expect that the specified time would be available for reply before the Commissioner took further action;
4.  The disputant was not expecting the service of the notice;
5.  Correspondence sent in response to Mr B's December 2012 letter was addressed to an incorrect post office box number;
6.  The Commissioner did not take any action after documents were received on 7 May 2013 which showed that Mr S had retired as trustee some months earlier and that Mr B had been appointed trustee.

The TRA concluded that the disputant had met the second limb of the test (i.e. issuing the NOPA as soon as reasonably practicable). When asked by the disputant in November 2014 to pay the GST refund, the Commissioner replied that a notice of assessment had been issued in April 2013, although the Commissioner did not attach a copy of the notice of assessment to her letter. The disputant wrote again in November 2014, which was not replied to until 5 March 2015, this time attaching a copy of the notice of assessment. The disputant then issued a NOPA on 30 March 2015 and made an application under s 89K of the TAA. Judge Sinclair considered that the disputant had responded as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of the giving of the notice of assessment, which was following receipt of the Commissioner's letter of 5 March 2015 and a copy of the notice of assessment.

Automatic tax system off to a smooth start – more than $80 million of refunds issued in the first week
======================================================================================================

**24 May 2019**

The first two batches of automatic tax assessments have been successfully issued by Inland Revenue this week with over $80 million of refunds going out to taxpayers, along with just over $10 million of tax bills to pay. Further batches go out shortly and the process will be completed by the end of July.

Deputy Commissioner, Transformation, Greg James says the sort of numbers the new system is dealing with is far exceeding expectations. “Almost every day we’re seeing myIR break new records with the number of customers logging in. Yesterday alone, we had just under 500,000 logins from customers completing a wide range of tasks.

“That would have been enough to either see the old system grind to a halt or slow down considerably,” he said, “but the new system takes this in its stride.

“Of course, our latest release hasn’t been without its wrinkles and that’s to be expected with a transformation of this size and scale,” said Mr James.

“Tax agents in particular are playing valuable role in letting us know when something isn’t happening as they would expect. We’re grateful for that contribution and we’re trying to be as responsive as possible in making any enhancements or adjustments.”

Tax assessments are automatic for the first time

Week one has seen 247,379 assessments issued comprising:

• 178,457 refunds  
• 29,080 bills to pay  
• 39,842 customers who have been told they have already paid the right amount of tax throughout the year or have had a small debt written off.

The total value of refunds paid out so far is $83.3 million and there are bills to pay worth $10.4 million. More batches will go out each week between now and the end of July.

Since the new system went live on April 26 it has handled:

• 7.1m logins to myIR  
• 93,833 IR3 returns filed by individuals (99% filed digitally)  
• 801,732 payday filing returns  
• 690,148 Working for Families payments made, worth $152 million in total  
• 366,218 GST returns

“We’re really encouraged to see so many customers are able to get on with their business,” says Greg James. “Some aspects will still take some getting used to and there are definitely some features that could be better but what we have now is far superior to the previous system.

“I think we have a great platform to keep developing and making improvements so New Zealanders continue to get the world class tax system they deserve.”

Avoidance arrangement and Commissioner's reconstruction confirmed

2009 case note - Income was personal income and not earned by business entities - Avoidance, vendetta, time bar, CIR's Policy Statement.

Case

TRA Dec No 15/2009

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976

### Summary

The Commissioner's assessments based upon section 99 and section BG1 that income was personal income and not earned by business entities was confirmed.

### Impact of decision

Limited to the specific facts.

### Facts

The disputant was personally assessed for income tax on income derived by various business entities on the basis that the use of those entities (which involved locating and exploitation of loss carrying companies by use of management and agency agreements) were an avoidance arrangement to disguise the fact that the income had been earned by personal exertions.

The disputant challenged the assessments (the tax years 1985 to 2000) on both substantive and procedural grounds.

The case is a complex factual one and the summary above does not include all the finer detail. For this, the decision should be consulted.

### Decision

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found there were no procedural defects or any substantive errors in the assessments and these were confirmed.

#### Procedural challenges

These are summarised at paragraph \[9\] of the judgment. Looking at each the Authority found:

*   _Did the assessor have the necessary delegation under section 99 and BG1?_ Yes at paragraphs \[14\] to \[23\];
*   _Did the assessor have the necessary delegations to lift the statute bar?_ Yes at paragraphs \[36\] to \[72\]. The Authority concluded at paragraph \[71\] that of the two options open to the Commissioner for lifting the statute bar, he may rely upon one or the other or both together.
*   _Did the assessor comply with the Commissioner's Policy Statement (Feb 1990)?_ Yes, even though this was not strictly necessary according to the _O'Neil_ decision at the Privy Council. See TRA decision at paragraphs \[24\] to \[35\].
*   _Was there a vendetta by the Commissioner against the disputant?_ No (at par \[73\] to \[102\]). The Authority concluded there was no evidential basis for concluding there was a vendetta and further concluded that, even if there had been, if the vendetta had not made the assessments incorrect then its existence was irrelevant anyway (see at paragraph \[74\]).

#### Substantive challenges

Having dealt with the procedural points the Authority turned to address the actual assessments:

*   _Was there an arrangement?_ Yes, all the parties to the transactions wererepresented by the disputant in various different capacities and were in effect his alter egos) see decision at \[131\] to \[170\];
*   _Was there tax avoidance?_ Yes at paragraphs \[171\] to \[189\]. The authority referred extensively to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court decisions in _Accent Management_ case to conclude the use of losses in the way the disputant's arrangement achieved was not in the contemplation of Parliament: "An objective viewing of the facts in terms of commercial sense clearly leads to the conclusion that the arrangement was to avoid tax by using losses in a manner not approved by the law." (at paragraph \[187\])
*   _Was the disputant a person affected?_ Yes, at paragraph \[190\] to \[206\] saying "I now add that those monies were earned by the disputant's personal exertions. He is clearly a person affected by the tax avoidance arrangement because only he controls the profits of that arrangement." (at paragraph \[206\])
*   _Did the disputant receive an advantage from the arrangement?_ Yes, at paragraphs \[207\] to \[216\] as his personal exertions income was not taxed as a consequence of the tax avoidance arrangement.

The Commissioner's reconstruction was confirmed (at paragraphs \[217\] to \[278\]). In particular the Authority accepted that a lack of a deduction to the disputant's client (under section 104 of the 1976 Act) did not mean the disputant was not obliged to account for the receipt (see at paragraph \[237\]) as the fee was not addressed using section 99 or BG1 then the alleged protection of section 99(4) did not apply (at \[240\]).

The Abusive Tax Position Shortfall Penalty was also confirmed with the Authority wondering why a penalty for Evasion had not been applied (at paragraph \[284\]).

Backdated ACC compensation not double taxed
===========================================

2009 case note - case sets out the mechanics of the relationship between the various benefits, ACC and tax - Income-tested benefit, PAYE, backdated compensation.

Case

TRA Decision Number 03/2009

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994 and Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant received a taxable income-tested benefit and non-taxable supplementary benefits comprising disability and accommodation allowances from Work and Income New Zealand (now Ministry of Social Development and referred to below for convenience as "MSD") for a period for which she was later determined to be entitled to weekly compensation from the Accident Compensation Corporation ("ACC").

The dispute between the parties arose out of what took place when the change-over from MSD to ACC as the paying agency occurred and the effect of that for tax purposes in the 2004 income year.

### Impact of decision

Although confined to its specific facts, this case sets out the mechanics of the relationship between the various benefits, ACC and tax.

### Facts

During 2004 the disputant received two lump sum payments from ACC, representing weekly entitlements which had not been paid from 1998 to 2003.However, during the period of entitlement the disputant had also been receiving an income-tested benefit and supplementary benefits from MSD. The lump sum ACC payments attributable to the 1998 to 2003 period affected the disputant's eligibility for income-tested benefits and MSD required reimbursement of those amounts which had been paid.

When calculating the lump sum amounts to be paid, ACC deducted an amount equivalent to the gross income-tested benefit which had previously been received by the disputant, being the amount required to repay MSD including PAYE due on that amount. Tax was then deducted from the remaining lump sum amount, being the backdated weekly compensation arrears before the amount of non-taxable supplementary benefit was deducted and reimbursed to MSD. The total amount of tax deducted was then paid to the Inland Revenue Department.

The disputant considered that this resulted in double taxation and also argued that PAYE on the backdated compensation should not have been taxed in one year but spread across the years in which the ACC entitlement arose. This would have resulted in the lump sum payments being taxed at a lower marginal rate.

### Decision

Barber DCJ held that no double taxation had occurred. The amount equal to the PAYE on the income-tested benefits, which ACC deducted, was the amount of tax due on that portion of the back-dated weekly compensation. That tax was paid on the disputant's behalf by MSD through the multi-department reimbursement process and accordingly, the disputant had not been taxed twice.

Barber DCJ also noted that the disputant's entitlement to the income-tested benefit was a net entitlement and that while PAYE was paid on behalf of the recipients of benefits, they had no entitlement to a refund of that amount.

Barber DCJ considered that because ACC treated the amounts the disputant originally received as having been paid in respect of the disputant's claim, the plain wording of section 78(2) of the Accident Rehabilitation Compensation Insurance Act 1992 deemed those amounts to have been paid as weekly compensation, and therefore part of the disputant's gross income.

Numerous cases were cited to show that it was settled law that a taxpayer derived income when it was received and it could not be spread back into earlier years to which the computation of income related. Accordingly, Barber DCJ held that the amount of the backdated weekly compensation received by the disputant from ACC in the 2004 income tax year was properly assessed as gross income under CC1(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994, in that year.

Backdated ACC compensation not double taxed
===========================================

2009 case note - Backdated lump sum compensation not characterised as an 'extra emolument' and should be adjusted by CIR - Income tested benefit, PAYE, ACC.

Case

Claire Avon Hollis v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The plaintiff received a taxable income-tested benefit and non-taxable supplementary benefits comprising disability and accommodation allowances from Work and Income New Zealand (now Ministry of Social Development and referred to below for convenience as "MSD") for a period for which she was later determined to be entitled to weekly compensation from the Accident Compensation Corporation ("ACC").

The dispute between the parties arose out of what took place when the change-over from MSD to ACC as the paying agency occurred and the effect of that for tax purposes in the 2004 income year.

### Impact of decision

The Court found that the backdated compensation paid by lump sum was not properly characterised as an "extra emolument" for tax purposes and should be adjusted by the Commissioner.

### Facts

This is an appeal from the TRA decision _Case Z9_ (2009) NZTC 141,000.

Between 1994 and 2004 the plaintiff received an income-tested benefit and non-taxable supplementary benefits comprising of disability and accommodation allowances from MSD. During that time, MSD had on behalf of the plaintiff, paid PAYE to Inland Revenue on the income-tested benefits.

In August 2001 the plaintiff made a written application to ACC for weekly compensation backdated to 1998. In 2003 her claim was accepted under the Accident Rehabilitation Compensation Insurance Act 1992 ("ARCI Act") and backdated to cover the period from November 1998 to April 2003.

During the 2004 income tax year, ACC paid the plaintiff two lump sum payments of backdated ACC weekly compensation in relation to the 1999 to 2004 income tax years as well as ongoing weekly compensation from 28 April 2003.

The plaintiff was no longer entitled to the income-tested and supplementary benefits she had previously received from MSD, therefore MSD required reimbursement of the net amounts she had received in the 1999 to 2004 income tax years.

The plaintiff claims that ACC should have deducted from her back-dated weekly compensation only the net amount of her income-tested benefit, which was refunded to MSD, and that double taxation has resulted due to ACC also deducting an amount equal to PAYE on the income-tested benefit.  

### Decision

_Whether the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") was correct to find that the amount of income tested_ _benefit and the non-taxable supplementary benefits_ _received from MSD are deemed to be weekly compensation_

The hearing before the TRA proceeded on the basis that section 78(2) of the ARCI Act applied, as this Act was in force from 1 July 1992 until 1 July 1999 covering the period for which the plaintiff's claim for weekly compensation was accepted.

However, in light of the High Court decision of _Buis v Accident Compensation Corporation_ (HC AK CIV 2007-404-004703 6 March 2009) the Court proceeded on the basis that the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 (the "IPRC Act") was the applicable Act. The plaintiff's entitlement to compensation was established in April 2003 by which time the 1998 Act had been repealed and the IPRC Act.

The Court agreed with the TRA, that the payments made by ACC were correctly made and that the treatment of the amount of the excess benefit payment as having been paid as weekly compensation arises by operation of law.

At paragraph \[19\] the Court said:

*   If Ms Hollis were correct that she did not have to pay tax on the lump sum entitlement from ACC because of the tax paid on the benefit received from MSD, she would effectively gain an advantage (ie a grossed-up payment) meant only for beneficiaries of MSD, despite not being entitled to a benefit. Additionally, she would obtain an advantage over and above that of other ACC recipients who did not first (erroneously) obtain a benefit from MSD.

_Whether the TRA was correct to find that the plaintiff was not overtaxed_ _in the 2004 income tax year_

The Court agreed with the TRA that under the IPRC Act, section CC 1(1)(bc) of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies and that the amount equivalent to the income-tested benefit and the residual weekly compensation are both part of the plaintiff's gross income for the purpose of the Act. The income-tested benefit is deemed by section 252 of the IPRC Act to be weekly compensation and the residual sum is weekly compensation from the outset.

The Court found that it is settled law that in cases involving backdated ACC payments, the taxpayer derives the income when it is received and it cannot be spread back to earlier years to which the computation of the income relates.

The Court did not accept the Commissioner's argument that the residual of the backdated weekly compensation should be taxed at the extra emolument rate. The Commissioner relied on the definition of extra emolument contained in section OB1 sub-clause (a)(ii) as a "retrospective increase in salary or wages":

*   I am not satisfied that the back-dated compensation paid by way of lump sum to Ms Hollis is properly characterised as an "extra emolument" for tax purposes. The lump sum did not amount to an increase in compensation ("wages") she was then receiving for the current period. Rather, it was a payment of the amount to which she was entitled by way of compensation for the prior years i.e. from the date of her accident until the date ACC cover was established. It could not therefore be characterised as an extra payment over and above her ordinary entitlement for the "pay period" in question. I am satisfied that a lump sum payment of back-dated compensation does not fall within the definition of "extra emolument" unless it is a payment additional to the "employee's" ordinary entitlement for the relevant "pay period". An extra emolument is usually a discretionary payment rather than one to which the "employee" has a statutory or contractual entitlement.  
    The rate of taxation payable in terms of section NC 2 ITA may still be higher than the rate payable if the lump sums had been received in the appropriate years but is likely to be less than the extra emolument rates. The rate payable will have to be assessed by the Commissioner and adjusted accordingly.

_Whether the TRA was correct to find that the plaintiff was not entitledto deduct certain expenses from her assessable income in the 2004 income tax year_

The Court agreed with the TRA that the expenses claimed by the plaintiff could not be deducted because the dispute was concerned solely with the 2004 income tax year and the expenses had not been incurred in that year.

The Court recommended that Inland Revenue Department provide a full account summary to the plaintiff in relation to her tax affairs over the period from the date of her accident in 1992 until the present time.

Baker jailed for persistent and premeditated tax evasion
========================================================

**25 November 2019**

A Waikato baker has been sent to prison for nearly five years for persistent and premeditated multi-million-dollar tax evasion over six years.

Mara Sorm was found guilty by a Hamilton jury on 52 charges of tax evasion relating to himself, his wife, and their company after failing to declare some $6,500,000.00 in cash sales. He was sentenced today in the Tauranga District court to 4 years , 9 months in prison and ordered to pay $500,000 in reparations.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Karen Whitiskie says the tax evasion related to three bakeries in Matamata, Tirau and Thames.

“Our investigation revealed each bakery on average received approximately $347,000.00 in unreported cash each year. Instead of including the income on tax returns, the money was used to buy rental properties, repay a loan, fund household living and overseas travel,” Karen Whitiskie says.

“The offending was premeditated and persistent. Sorm kept notebooks recording cash income which he could have used to file accurate tax returns.  He chose not to.

“Sorm also failed to account for income received from rental property in Australia in his personal tax returns and gave further false information when questioned by Inland Revenue about suppressed income.

”When confronted by investigators Sorm made multiple attempts to avoid further inquiries by acknowledging that his returns had accidentally understated cash income and offering to repay the tax.  

“In December 2013, search warrants were executed on the defendant’s business and residential addresses. In contrast to what Mr Sorm had admitted to investigators, notebooks were found at the business premises which showed the bakeries true daily sales.

“In this case the amount of suppressed income was more than $6.5m and resulted in Sorm evading at least $2.8 million dollars of GST and Income Tax”. 

Inland Revenue relies on the taxpayer’s reporting of their income. Deliberate offending like this involves a significant breach of trust that undermines the integrity and public perception of the tax system.

“It simply isn’t fair on those law-abiding bakery and café owners who correctly and honestly declare their cash income. It’s another example of someone delving in to the hidden economy to try to get an advantage over other honest, hard-working New Zealanders," Karen Whitiskie says.

API pūkete pēke Bank API
========================

The bank API enables the creating and deleting of the refund bank account for an identified customer’s account. It is 1 of 8 APIs that, together, make up the customer services suite.

[How customer services work](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/customer-and-account/customer-services-suite/how-customer-services-work)
 

How the bank API works
----------------------

The bank API requires the account API to be integrated.

The bank API enables the refund bank account held at the customer account level to be added and deleted. It requires the account ID for the addition or deletion of a refund bank account. The account ID is available through a call to the account API.

Note that the add function is effectively an update function if a refund bank account already exists on the customer account. It replaces the existing refund bank account with the added refund bank account in this scenario.

The bank API can only be used by:

*   the customer the data is associated to
*   a user with delegated access
*   an intermediary who’s linked to the customer
*   government agencies with a memorandum of understanding that allows them access to customer account level data.

The bank API enables the above users to update Inland Revenue’s customer account data from their native systems, and to avoid the use of manually facilitated channels.

### Gateway service capability for the bank API

The bank API provides the following capabilities through defined API operations and API paths.

| API operation | API path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /bank | This operation either:<br><br>*   adds a refund bank account to the identified customer account if there is not already a refund bank account on the customer account<br>*   replaces an existing refund bank account on the identified customer account. |
| DELETE | /bank | Deletes the refund bank account from the identified customer account. |

Bank API business use cases
---------------------------

The following are examples of how to use the bank API to achieve specific business outcomes. The sequence of operations, the order in which they should be called, is indicated in the column of each operation.

| Number | Use case | POST /bank | DELETE /bank | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Add the refund bank account to an identified customer account. | 1   |     | Customer account ID has been obtained from the account API. |
| 2   | Update the refund bank account to an identified customer account. | 1   |     | Customer account ID has been obtained from the account API. |
| 3   | Remove the existing refund bank account from an identified customer account. |     | 1   | Customer account ID has been obtained from the account API. |

Bankrupt's ability to carry forward accumulated losses
======================================================

QB (Sep 1999) considers whether a taxpayer is entitled to carry forward pre-bankruptcy losses where the loss arises from the taxpayer paying the debts owing.

### Section IE 1, Income Tax Act 1994 - Net losses may be offset against future net income

We have been asked whether a taxpayer is entitled to carry forward pre-bankruptcy losses where the loss arises from the taxpayer paying the debts owing (as opposed to  the debts being remitted).

_Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 9, No. 9 (September 1997), at page 20, included  an item under the heading _"Losses released on discharge from bankruptcy - inability to carried forward"._  The item concerned an enquiry on the ability of a bankrupt to carry forward income tax losses that had arisen as a result of debts incurred in a previous year.  The bankrupt was released from payment of these debts during the bankruptcy process, and as a result had not made any payment towards the debts that made up the losses.  She was not entitled to carry the losses forward to offset against post bankruptcy income, as she had been released from the obligation to pay the debts.   Because she had made no payment of the debts, the amount of the debts could not be taken into account in calculating the losses available to carry forward.

This item considers the situation where the bankrupt has paid the debts.

A taxpayer was made bankrupt as a result of a farming business affected by severe flooding.  Up to the time of the floods, the farming business had operated reasonably successfully and all business debts to the end of the previous income year had been **paid in full**.  However, due to large depreciation claims, accumulated income tax losses were available to be carried forward at the time the farmer was adjudged bankrupt.

At a meeting of creditors it was agreed that the Official Assignee (the "Assignee") would continue to operate the business, as there was every prospect of the farm trading successfully once it had recovered from the floods.   The farmer obtained work in a nearby town and derived salary and wages for the period of the bankruptcy.  The farmer has asked about his income tax obligations and whether he is entitled to carry forward the pre-bankruptcy accumulated losses.

In the situation described above, where the Assignee is carrying on the former business of the bankrupt, there are two "taxpayers":

*   The bankrupt, and  
    
*   The Assignee, as trustee for the benefit of the creditors, deriving income from the farming business.  
    

The income tax responsibilities of each follow.

#### The bankrupt

The bankrupt will be required to file two income tax returns for the year in which he was adjudged bankrupt.

Under section 44(1)(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the first return will cover  the period from the beginning of the income year to the date the farmer was adjudged bankrupt.  This return is an "interim" return that enables Inland Revenue to lodge a proof of debt with the Assignee for any tax owing at the date of adjudication.  From the income derived during this period, the farmer is entitled to deduct the pre-bankruptcy losses against any farming profit earned during the period to date of bankruptcy and other income (such as salary and wages) derived during that period.  See Subpart IE of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the ITA).  If there is an overpayment of income tax resulting from credits of PAYE tax deductions or provisional tax paid, the refund will pass to the Assignee. 

At the end of the income year in which the farmer is adjudged bankrupt, he must file a return of income for the **full** income year. 

This second return will include any income or (loss) already declared in the earlier return of income to the date of bankruptcy, but not any income or loss resulting from the farming business now carried on by the Assignee.  Any adjustments necessary to take account of PAYE credits already refunded to the Assignee as a result of the "interim" return of income will be made when the tax assessment for the full year is made.

Under subpart IE of the ITA, the farmer will be able to offset against that full year's income the accumulated pre-bankruptcy losses to the extent of the income derived.  Any remaining losses can be carried forward to future years.

Any of the pre-bankruptcy losses remaining after the bankruptcy is discharged can be used by the farmer to offset against future income derived.

#### The Official Assignee as trustee

Under section 42 of the Insolvency Act 1967, when a person is adjudged bankrupt all property of the bankrupt vests in the Assignee.  This property includes the farm business assets, but not the accumulated losses as these are not "property" as envisaged by that Act.  The Assignee carries on the farming business as trustee for the creditors.  As trustee, the Assignee is a new taxpayer and will be liable to income tax on any gross income derived from the business.  As section IE 1(1)(a) of the ITA only permits losses to be carried forward by _"the taxpayer",_ the Assignee, as another taxpayer, cannot utilise the farmer's pre-bankruptcy losses against any income derived as trustee of the farming business.

Under section HH 4 of the ITA the Assignee, as trustee, is required to furnish income tax returns for each income year, or part thereof, during the bankruptcy period while carrying on the former business of the bankrupt.  Income tax is payable on any trustee income derived during the period.  Any losses incurred by the trustee can be carried forward from year to year to offset against subsequent trustee income. However, any accumulated "trustee losses" remaining at the end of the bankruptcy period are not available to the farmer to offset against his post-bankruptcy income.

Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING (BEPS) – UPDATE ON THE NEW ZEALAND WORK PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Since late 2012, there has been significant global media and political concern about evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This problem is referred to as base erosion and profit shifting or “BEPS”. 2. This paper sets out for your information background to the OECD/G20 BEPS project, the related OECD/G20 initiative regarding a global Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (in short, Automatic Exchange of Information, or AEOI) and New Zealand’s response to the OECD/G20 recommendations. In particular the paper covers: a. the broad principle underpinning New Zealand’s taxation of multinationals; b. what BEPS and AEOI are; c. what the G20 and OECD propose we should do about BEPS and AEOI; d. what New Zealand has done, and plans to do, to address BEPS issues and AEOI; and e. whether implementing the initiatives in the BEPS Action Plan mean New Zealand can better tax multinationals. PRINCIPLE UNDERPINNING NEW ZEALAND’S TAXATION OF MULTINATIONALS 3. All taxable income earned in New Zealand should have tax paid in New Zealand. 4. In determining taxable income: a. all gross revenue earned in New Zealand should be identified and reported; and b. deductions from gross revenue should reflect the real economic costs of production, free of measures deliberately designed to reduce tax liability. 5. BEPS tax planning strategies can undermine this principle. What is BEPS? 6. Media attention around multinational tax avoidance has focussed particularly on technology companies, such as Apple, Google and Amazon, whose digital business model has made possible to structure their business to pay very little tax anywhere in the world. However, other multinationals with more traditional business models have also faced criticism for avoiding tax. 7. The wide range of international tax planning techniques that are used to achieve such results are collectively referred to BEPS tax planning strategies. 8. BEPS tax planning strategies exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to make profits disappear for tax purposes or to shift profits to locations where there is little or no real activity but the taxes are low, resulting in little or no overall corporate tax being paid. 9. Other BEPS tax planning strategies take advantage of current international tax rules that are still grounded in a bricks and mortar economic environment rather than today’s environment of global players which is characterised by the increasing importance of intellectual property and the digital environment. 10. For these reasons it is difficult for any single country acting alone to fully address the issue. BEPS is a global problem which requires a global solution. Co-ordination is key. What is AEOI? 11. A related, but different, issue is the ability of taxpayers to hide assets offshore to evade tax obligations in their home jurisdictions. This is facilitated by the current lack of transparency and exchange of information in the global tax system. 12. AEOI is a multilateral initiative aimed at countering this problem, recovering tax revenue lost to non-compliant taxpayers, and further strengthening transparency in tax matters. 13. The initiative would see financial institutions in participating jurisdictions gather financial information on foreign taxpayers within that jurisdiction under a “common reporting standard” (CRS). This information would be passed to the tax authority in that jurisdiction, who would exchange that information with the tax authority in the taxpayer’s ‘home’ jurisdiction. 14. International expectations are that participating jurisdictions complete first exchanges of information by 30 September 2018 at the latest. New Zealand is aiming to meet this timeframe (CAB-16-MIN-0034 refers). What do the G20 and OECD propose we do about BEPS and AEOI? 15. There is a strong political impetus to address BEPS and improve transparency of tax information. However, the G20 and OECD emphasise that this is a global problem that requires a co-ordinated global solution. 16. The concern a global approach addresses is that if it is left for individual countries to implement ad-hoc domestic legislation it could actually make the problem worse (as asymmetry between different countries’ tax laws are part of the existing problem) or potentially cripple businesses who would face double or triple taxation as governments scramble to protect their own tax bases. 17. The G20 and OECD released the final reports on a 15 point Action Plan to address BEPS concerns last October and a global standard to facilitate AEOI in 2013. These initiatives can be grouped under three broad themes: a. more robust tax laws; b. international agreements and co-operation; and c. greater transparency of tax information. 18. This is illustrated in slide 1 in the attachment to this paper. 19. Each country needs to focus on these areas to ensure the international tax system as a whole is robust and fit for purpose. The New Zealand initiatives are described below and illustrated in slide 2 in the attachment to this paper. 20. The timeline on slides 3 and 4 in the attachment to his paper shows the proposed dates for delivery of the New Zealand BEPS, AEOI and related measures. What is New Zealand doing to address BEPS and AEOI? 21. The New Zealand tax system is already quite robust by international standards, so a few of the recommendations in the Action Plan do not require New Zealand to make any changes. 22. For example, New Zealand already has controlled foreign company (CFC) rules that meet the standards recommended by the OECD in the final report on Action 3 - Designing Effective Controlled Foreign Company Rules. These are rules which prevent New Zealand residents avoiding tax on the profits of their offshore companies. Similarly, New Zealand does not have any changes it needs make to domestic tax law to address Action 5 – Harmful Tax Practices. This was confirmed by the OECD in 2012 (\[Confidential OECD report number withheld\]). 23. There are a number of initiatives New Zealand has either already implemented or will implement to address the three key BEPS themes. More robust tax laws 24. First, we need to ensure our own domestic tax laws are robust and consistent with international best practice. This is to ensure that our domestic tax settings protect our tax base and do not facilitate double non-taxation, tax avoidance or evasion. In this area, New Zealand: a. has already strengthened its CFC rules and thin capitalisation rules (by reducing the level of debt a New Zealand entity controlled by non-residents can have before interest deductions will be disallowed and widening the application of the rules to include more foreign ownership structures); b. has also introduced the bank minimum equity rules, the re-characterisation of stapled stock provision, removed the foreign dividend exemption for deductible foreign equity and eliminated the conduit regime; c. introduced a Bill in November 2015 that imposes GST on online services consumed in New Zealand – this legislation will apply to transactions from 1 October 2016; d. has recently introduced a Bill that: i. strengthens the non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy rules to ensure these taxes apply consistently across economically equivalent transactions consistent with the existing policy intent; ii. confirms that the general anti-avoidance rule overrides double tax agreements; and iii. limits the use of look-through companies as conduit vehicles by non- residents (especially to earn foreign income); e. aims to consult on hybrid mismatch rules in the second half of this year which would prevent companies structuring their business entities or financing arrangements to take advantage of differences in how countries’ tax these arrangement. Legislation could then be introduced in March 2017; f. aims to consult later this year on interest limitation rules which would prevent companies stripping excessive profits out of New Zealand by way of deductible interest payments. Legislation could then be introduced in March 2017; g. is undertaking an inquiry into foreign trust disclosure rules to ensure they are fit for purpose; h. may consider whether other measures to help address BEPS concerns (for example, officials will shortly report on the diverted profits tax adopted by the United Kingdom and Australia and possibly proposals on increased public transparency of information about the tax paid by multinationals in New Zealand); i. already has robust CFC rules; and j. does not have harmful tax practices as identified by the OECD in their last review in 2012. International agreements and co-operation 25. Second, we need to work with the OECD and treaty partners to ensure international agreements are fit for purpose. New Zealand: a. signed the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters in 2012. This became operative for New Zealand on 1 January 2015 and is also an essential element of New Zealand’s overall transparency framework; b. will sign up to the OECD’s multilateral instrument which will be open for signatures by 31 December. This instrument will amend countries’ network of tax treaties to insert a new anti-treaty abuse article, a new permanent establishment definition, anti-hybrid entity rules and dispute resolution articles; and c. will apply revised OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines to address misallocation of profits to low tax jurisdictions. Legislation could be introduced to facilitate this (if needed) in March 2017. Greater transparency of tax information 26. Third, we need to improve the transparency of tax information so that people cannot hide wealth and avoid their tax obligations. This requires Inland Revenue to collect relevant information about companies and individuals operating in New Zealand and exchange that information with other jurisdictions’ tax administrations. To this end, New Zealand: a. has introduced an International Questionnaire to monitor profit shifting activities of major foreign-owned groups of companies; b. implemented measures to comply with the United States (US) foreign account tax compliance act (FATCA) which requires the collection and exchange of information from financial institutions about investments by US citizens (from 1 April 2015); c. will introduce legislation in mid-2016 to enable automatic exchange of information (AEOI) with a wide range of countries’ tax administrations about the financial affairs of their residents (from September 2018); d. is already starting to exchange Inland Revenue’s taxpayer binding ruling information with foreign tax administrators; e. is introducing legislation to require our multinational companies to prepare country-by-country (CBC) reports (these reports basically provide a breakdown of business activities of the multinational group across the world and financial information for each country in which they operate) in line with the OECD proposal. New Zealand’s current administrative measures to address BEPS 27. While there are a number of measures New Zealand is working on in conjunction with the OECD, it is important to note that New Zealand already has strong administrative practices in terms of scrutinising the activities of multinationals operating here. 28. Inland Revenue has an extensive international compliance programme addressing profit shifting, in particular transfer pricing of goods and services and international financing arrangements. The main focus is the Significant Enterprises segment of the population, comprising 558 taxpayer groups with turnover in excess of $80m per annum and representing almost 60% of the corporate tax base. Key performance data (including tax payments, operating margins and interest expenditure) are monitored closely with expert assistance from fulltime in-house specialists on transfer pricing and financial arrangements (known as Principal Advisors). 29. The Top 50 taxpayer groups receive comprehensive coverage, being account managed on a one-to-one basis. All other Significant Enterprises are required to submit annually a basic compliance package (BCP) comprising a group structure, financial statements and tax reconciliations which are then examined closely. Depending on the risk rating from the review of the BCP, past history and other intelligence, further review or an in-depth audit may follow. Inland Revenue supplemented the BCP with International Questionnaires in 2015 and 2016 to specifically cover BEPS issues for 292 foreign-owned groups. 30. Advance pricing agreements (APAs) have proven extremely useful as a robust up-front means of dealing with profit shifting risk, especially the more complex issues that arise. APAs represent a more co-operative approach to tax compliance as opposed to adversarial audits. Multinationals that complete an APA are required to submit annual reports and supporting evidence to confirm adherence to the agreed terms and conditions. As at 31 December 2015, 139 APAs had been completed successfully by Inland Revenue. Will implementing the initiatives in the BEPS Action Plan mean New Zealand can better tax multinationals? 31. Yes – to the extent the multinationals have a “permanent establishment” (generally a physical presence in New Zealand through which they carry on business) and they are currently using profit shifting techniques to move profits out of New Zealand, such as: a. excessive interest payments to related parties; b. inflated royalty payments (or other such fees); or c. financial instruments or entities that exploit arbitrage opportunities between the New Zealand tax rules and those of other countries. 32. The BEPS Action Plan will also crack down on the use of tax treaties to facilitate tax avoidance. For example, changes to strengthen tax treaties will prevent companies artificially avoiding a permanent establishment in New Zealand (thus avoiding tax in New Zealand). Treaty changes will also crack down on treaty shopping by multinationals and allow New Zealand to deny treaty benefits to companies that are using treaties to avoid tax. 33. The initiatives in the BEPS Action Plan will also allow New Zealand to impose more tax in cases where the current lack of transparency and information exchange between countries has meant the Inland Revenue does not have any visibility of profit shifting activities by multinational companies. 34. So, to the extent a multinational with a taxable presence in New Zealand is stripping profits out of its New Zealand operations through inflated deductions the OECD’s transfer pricing, interest limitation and hybrid mismatch rules will tackle this. To the extent a multinational has been relying on its tax information being outside the reach of the New Zealand Inland Revenue, country-by-country reporting will address this. 35. The OECD work is also focusing on the threshold for determining when there is a taxable presence in a country and particularly the concept of permanent establishment. 36. Changes to GST (for example, imposing GST on cross-border services and intangibles – such as digital downloads) also means New Zealand will be able to better impose tax on the consumption of the products of multinationals by New Zealand consumers. 37. However, the BEPS Action Plan does not go so far as to abandon the current international income tax framework based around the principles of “source” and “residence”. This means that the BEPS Action Plan does not yet tackle the thorny issue of companies (such as Google or Apple) who reach their markets via the internet, while basing their physical operations in a tax haven or low tax jurisdiction. 38. The current framework has been in place since the early 20 th century. Under this framework, countries generally: a. tax their residents on their income earned all around the world (the “residence” principle); and b. tax non-residents on the income earned (or “sourced”) in their country – that is, income generated from assets located in, or activity performed in, their country. The result is that the ability of a country to tax non-residents on business income depends largely on the extent of their presence in that country. 39. A taxable presence generally requires either: a. operation through a subsidiary resident in the country; or b. operation through a physical “permanent establishment” in the country. 40. While this inability to tax business income in the absence of a taxable presence may appear to be a loophole, this rule is meant to be a pragmatic rule to keep businesses from being caught up in having to comply with local tax rules because of very limited interaction with a given country. For example, someone selling goods on Trade Me should not have to file a tax return for a country where they make one sale. 41. It could be argued that with the internet facilitating large volumes of sales without a taxable presence that this framework should be changed. However, making such a fundamental change to a century-old international tax framework would require a lot of thought and international agreement. It would fundamentally redistribute taxing rights to multinational profits and is beyond the scope of the BEPS project. 42. A few countries (particularly the BRIC 1 countries) are especially critical of the existing framework. They suggest that providing the market for sales should in and of itself be sufficient to attract a taxing right of some sort. 43. They argue that the established framework should be abandoned in favour of another framework such as the “global formulary apportionment” method, which would divide up taxing rights over a multinational’s total profit based on where the multinational makes sales or has property or activities. Under this type of approach, New Zealand may have more taxing rights over the profits of, say, Google, Apple or Facebook because they make significant sales in New Zealand, but less taxing rights over the profits of our major exporters. So it is important to keep in mind that a fundamental change to the international tax framework can cut both ways for New Zealand. 44. There is likely to be future pressure from some countries to move away from these existing principles towards, for example, global formulary apportionment, or more reliance on consumption taxes. New Zealand will continue to work with the OECD if and when these issues arise. 1 Brazil, Russia, India and China. Consultation 45. Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this Cabinet paper.

Be prepared for refund scams
============================

**21 December 2018**

Automatic tax refunds are coming in 2019 and already scammers are taking the opportunity to trick people into handing over bank account details.

Inland Revenue recently sent out e-mails informing New Zealanders about proposed changes that would see automatic tax assessments and other initiatives in the biggest change to the tax system in a generation.

Bernadette Newman, a customer segment leader at Inland Revenue, says scammers are trying to take advantage of the campaign.

“We’ve had two examples of this just this week – a convincing looking e-mail but with a couple of important details that mark it as fake.

“The e-mail asks you to complete the steps below to release money owed to you. There’s a link to fill in a form with advice to ‘just fill it in and get your returns in order now’. 

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2018/be-prepared-for-refund-scams/snipped-redacted-screenshot-resized.png?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221259&hash=AA5A5619C0D0A8A1C0ABD416BCCDAD80) 

“When you receive an e-mail like this, purporting to come from IRD, don’t click on it – but use your mouse to hover the web address and make sure it’s for a real Inland Revenue website.”

In the past few months, Inland Revenue has sent out more than two million e-mails as part of its ‘Changing for you’ campaign and more will be sent in the new year.

If the proposed changes go ahead, automatic tax refunds can be issued to eligible customers if Inland Revenue holds your up-to-date bank account information. This can be updated through myIR, the secure online portal, which is password protected.

“You will know you’re in safe hands if you’ve been directed to myIR where a valid log-in is required,” says Bernadette Newman.

“Unfortunately, scammers and phishers will try to take advantage of the volume of e-mail we’re sending and try to access bank accounts and steal people’s money. It’s important to know what a fraudulent e-mail looks like. 

“You don’t want your summer holidays ruined by a scammer so take the time to check your e-mail and delete the fakes.”

  
Inland Revenue will never:  
• email you with the amount of your refund (only within myIR) or send you an e-mail, knock on your door or phone you promising a tax refund.  
• ask you to pay money to release a tax refund.  
• send you an email with a hyperlink to a webpage that asks you to submit your personal information.  
• demand payments through NZ Post or a gift card.

Te tū hei takawaenga Becoming an intermediary
=============================================

You can become an intermediary if you carry on a professional public practice or are in a business, occupation or employment in which you act for 10 or more other persons. You, as the applicant, are not included in the number count.

If you only act for family or friends and do not charge a fee, it is unlikely you'll meet the criteria of being in business, however you can become a nominated person for each person instead.

[Nominated person](/managing-my-tax/getting-someone-to-act-on-my-behalf/nominated-person)

[Authority to act for tax agents and other intermediaries and nominated persons (Tax Technical)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2022/os-22-03)

Intermediary types
------------------

There are different types of intermediaries and requirements to become one.

*   Tax agent – you need to prepare the annual income tax returns for 10 or more other clients (non-active entities are excluded).
*   Other Intermediaries (includes bookkeepers, payroll bureaus and other representatives) – you must have signed authorities to act for 10 or more other clients in relation to their tax affairs, social policy entitlements, or both.
*   PAYE Intermediaries – you must meet all the employer obligations of your clients, including paying employees and meeting record filing requirements.

### You can register as 1 or more type of intermediary

If you meet the requirements, you can register as more than 1 type of intermediary.

For example, ABC Accounts is a registered tax agent but also meets the requirements to register as a bookkeeper. ABC Accounts have clients they only offer bookkeeping services to, who are linked to a different tax agent for some tax types. ABC Accounts registers as a bookkeeper in order to be able to link to the clients’ accounts without impacting the tax agent link.

You need authority to act on behalf of your clients
---------------------------------------------------

You’ll need a signed authority to act from each client before you register.

[Getting authority to act](/topics/intermediaries/getting-authority-to-act)

Registering to become an intermediary
-------------------------------------

To become an intermediary you must complete an online application. You’ll need to provide a list of your 10 clients and attach a copy of your authority to act template.

If you apply under your own personal IRD number, you’ll need to include a declaration in relation to your own tax affairs.

If you apply under an entity, you’ll need to upload:

*   a declaration completed on behalf of the entity
*   declarations completed by each of the key office holders.

Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) disclosure g uidance The BEPS disclosure must be completed in myIR (even if the rest of your return is filed through another channel). You can log in or register for an account through our website at ird.govt.nz How to find the BEPS disclosure in myIR 1.Go to your Income tax account. 2.Under the Periods tab, select the year you want to make the disclosure for. 3.Under the I want to... menu, select Submit BEPS disclosure. There are 3 distinct parts to the BEPS disclosure •Hybrid and Branch Mismatches. •Thin Capitalisation Group Information. •Restricted Transfer Pricing Rules. You should leave boxes blank if they do not relate to you. For example, if you have thin capitalisation information to disclose but no hybrid or branch mismatches, you should leave the hybrid disclosure sections blank and proceed to the thin capitalisation pages. To assist you in preparing for the disclosure in myIR please use the BEPS disclosure preparation IR1250 form. This is for preparation purposes only and is not sent to us. All sections mentioned in this document refer to sections of the Income Tax Act 2007. Hybrid and branch mismatches Hyb rid and branch mismatch arrangements use differences in the tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch under the laws of 2 or more countries to eliminate, defer or reduce the aggregate amount of income tax payable in those countries. The disclosure shows whether the taxpayer is affected by hybrid, branch, or both, mismatch arrangements and provides information relating to those arrangements. A summary table of the substantive hybrid and branch mismatch sections and the arrangements they relate to follows. Section(s) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Arrangements the sections relate to FH 3 and FH 4 Hybrid financial instruments, including timing mismatches. FH 5 and FH 6 Hybrid entity and branch payment mismatches. FH 7 Payments made to reverse hybrid entities or branches. FH 8 and FH 9 Double deductions arising from hybrid entities or branches. FH 10 Double deductions arising from dual resident companies. FH 11 Imported mismatch payments. FH 12 Offsetting surplus assessable income against mismatch amounts. FH 13 and FH 14 Elections to surrender a mismatch and thereby opt out of the hybrid rules. A disclosure on a group basis could be completed where there is one point of entry into New Zealand. Where a group has more than 1 entry point into New Zealand, for example 2 subsidiaries with direct offshore shareholding or a subsidiary and a branch, a separate disclosure should be made for each point of entry. If the group prefers, it can make a disclosure for each New Zealand taxpayer in the group. 1.Hybrid and branch mismatches Under the hybrid and branch mismatch section, you will be presented with 5 di fferent types of hybrid arrangements in a checkbox list for which you can make a disclosure. •Hybrid entity/branch/dual resident disclosure. •Hybrid payment disclosure. •Hybrid receipt disclosure. •Double deduction disclosure. •Imported mismatch disclosure. This part of the disclosure is included so that we can understand the types of arrangements you are disclosing. You must select at least 1 type of arrangement in order to add a new hybrid arrangement for which you can provide more specific information. You should consider the 'Guidance questions' in the Hybrids compliance and disclosure table which will assist in determining whether the hybrid and branch mismatch rules apply to your arrangements and whether you need to make a disclosure of a particular type. The last column of the table identifies which type of hybrid arrangement in the BEPS disclosure you should disclose to us if the guidance question and commentary has indicated that a particular provision applies to your affairs. This table is also located in the Special report - Base erosion and profit shifting – hybrid and branch mismatch rules (from page 90). You may find it easier to consider the guidance questions, complete your income tax return accordingly, and then complete the BEPS disclosure. Hybrids compliance and disclosure table – ird.govt.nz/beps Hybrids (Base erosion and profit shifting – hybrid and branch mismatch rules) – ird.govt.nz/2019-sr-beps-final If you have made a dividend election or opaque election (under sections FH 13 or 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) for a hybrid arrangement, you do not have to make a hybrid disclosure for that arrangement. If you have a hybrid or branch arrangement that accumulates surplus assessable income with no subpart FH counteraction, a disclosure can still be made. Where a BEPS disclosure has not been made, we may ask you for more information about your surplus assessable income and any mismatch amounts. You should keep records supporting these amounts. Some hybrid arrangements will have features that require disclosure of more than 1 arrangement type. For instance, 'Guidance Question 9' indicates a situation where you should be selecting hybrid entity/branch/dual resident disclosure and double deduction disclosure. On occasion, a payment from New Zealand to elsewhere in the group could fund a hybrid mismatch for which an i mported mismatch disclosure is required. An imported mismatch disclosure is not required for a payment that is outside the scope of the imported mismatch rule if that payment has been made to an entity in a country that has its own imported mismatch rule. N ew Hybrid or Branch Arrangement Upon selecting 1 or more types of hybrid arrangement to disclose, you must add a new hybrid arrangement. If you have more than one hybrid arrangement, you must complete this section for each arrangement. For instance, if you have a hybrid financial instrument and an imported mismatch, you should add a new hybrid arrangement for each of those arrangements and then disclose information relating to each arrangement. Name of counterparty Hybrid mismatches usually have an entity on the other side of the arrangement. For instance, a hybrid financial instrument will have a payer and a payee. If your involvement in the arrangement is as th e payer (for which you would be making a 'Hybrid payment disclosure'), the payee would be the counterparty. For an entity mismatch, the counterparty may be the hybrid entity itself or the owner of the entity depending on the nature and location of the entity. Where there is more than 1 entity that could be considered to be a relevant counterparty, you should select the entity you have the closer connection with. For instance, in a reverse hybrid payment mismatch to which section FH 7 would apply in New Zealand, the primary counterparty entity would be the reverse hybrid entity located in a foreign jurisdiction, rather than the owners of that entity. For an imported mismatch arrangement, you should select the immediate payee entity (which is not necessarily one of the entities the hybrid mismatch relates to). Dual resident mismatches and branch mismatches will not usually have a counterparty. For these mismatches the counterparty can be stated to be the taxpayer that is completing the disclosure. Counterparty tax ID You must provide the counterparty’s tax ID. This will typically be the Tax Identification Number (TIN) of the counterparty that is used under the OECD’s approach to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). If the counterparty is the taxpayer and has its own IRD number, it is sufficient to provide that number instead of an overseas tax ID. Counterparty tax residence You must select a jurisdiction that the counterparty is tax resident in from the dropdown list. It is acceptable to select ' New Zealand' if the relevant counterparty is tax resident in New Zealand (for instance, in the case of a dual resident mismatch or a branch mismatch involving a foreign branch of a New Zealand resident). Type of arrangement For this arrangement, you must indicate its type. The options in this dropdown list are the 5 types of hybrid arrangements described above. If the arrangement has 2 arrangement types that it relates to, please select both in the dropdown box. Amount of counteraction in New Zealand under subpart FH You must disclose the counteraction effect that sections FH 3-11 have had on the arrangement in the income year. This amount will be an amount of deduction denial or inclusion of income, and in many cases will equal the previous amount disclosed (the amount of payment, receipt, or deduction). Note that an amount of counteraction that is effectively reversed due to the presence of surplus assessable income (through operation of section FH 12) should still be disclosed at this point as there are separate 'mismatch amount' and 'surplus assessable income' questions later in the disclosure. Counteraction applied in another jurisdiction If applicable, you must also disclose whether another jurisdiction has applied a counteraction to the arrangement with their hybrid and branch mismatch rules. This is a 'yes or no' answer. A 'Y es ' answer should be given in situations where New Zealand’s hybrid and branch mismatch rules give priority to another jurisdiction’s rules to apply to the relevant arrangement. A 'No' answer could be given where the application of sections FH 4, FH 6 and FH 9 depend on the relevant foreign jurisdiction not having hybrid rules that apply to the particular arrangement in the income year. Name of the jurisdiction applying the counteraction (if any) If you answered 'Yes ' to the preceding question in relation to this arrangement, you must notify us of the jurisdiction that applied that counteraction. If you answered 'N o' , then you can leave this box blank. 2.Mismatch amounts and surplus assessable income amounts The next part of the hybrid and branch disclosure applies to mismatch amounts and surplus assessable income. If the arrangement you are disclosing is dealt with under sections FH 3, FH 4, FH 7 or FH 11 (which do not give rise to mismatch amounts), then all amounts in this part of the disclosure should be left blank for that arrangement. This part of the disclosure should be completed for each hybrid arrangement you have included in the previous section of the BEPS disclosure. A disclosure under this part should be made in all instances where sections FH 5, FH 6, FH 8 to FH 10 and FH 12 apply, even if the surplus assessable income amount arising under section FH 12 is greater than the mismatch amount. The design of the 2 ledgers, 1 for mismatch amounts and 1 for surplus assessable income, is intended to assist you in complying with the technical mechanics of mismatch amounts and surplus assessable income, and to keep track of those amounts over multiple years. The following tables provide guidance for what should be disclosed in each row. If a particular ledger row does not apply to your arrangement in the income year, you should disclose an amount of zero for that row. No amount disclosed for a row should be less than zero. Mismatch amounts Opening balance This is the mismatch amounts carried forward from a previous year as per section FH 12(6). For the first income year that the hybrid rules apply to an arrangement, this amount will be zero. For following years, the amount should be the closing balance amount of the prior year. ADD: Mismatch amounts arising This is the mismatch amounts that have arisen during the income year due to the application of sections FH 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 in relation to the relevant mismatch situation. LESS: Mismatch amounts set off This is the mismatch amounts that have been set off against the person’s own surplus assessable income in the income year under section FH 12(2). This amount should be equal to the amount disclosed in the ' surplus assessable income set off ' row below. Note that mismatch amounts set off against the surplus assessable income of a company in the same group are dealt with in a separate row below. LESS: Mismatch amounts eliminated This is the mismatch amounts that do not satisfy the continuity requirement for carrying forward amounts to future income years under section FH 12(8). LESS: Stranded mismatch amounts This is the mismatch amounts that satisfy the requirements of section FH 12(9), which applies to stranded losses. LESS: Grouped mismatch amounts This is the mismatch amounts that have been offset against the surplus assessable income of a company that is part of the same group, consistent with section FH 12(10). Note that the relevant group company should be separately completing this BEPS disclosure and should declare the amount under ' grouped surplus assessable income' in the row below. EQUALS: Closing balance This is the leftover mismatch amounts for an income year. These mismatch amounts should be carried forward to the following income year. For more information refer to Administration of the imported mismatch rule - section FH 11 – ird.govt.nz/os-21-02 Surplus assessable income Opening balance This is the surplus assessable income carried forward from a previous year as per section FH 12(7). For the first income year that the hybrid rules apply to an arrangement, this amount will be zero. For following years, the amount should be the closing balance amount of the prior year (and equal to the 'earlier' amount in section FH 12(4)(a)). ADD: Surplus assessable income arising This is the surplus assessable income that arises for the income year as per section FH 12(3), not including the 'earlier amount' which is incorporated into the opening balance. LESS: Surplus assessable income set off This is surplus assessable income that has been set off against the person’s own mismatch amounts in the income year under section FH 12(2). This amount should be equal to the amount disclosed in the ' mismatch amounts set off ' row above. Note that surplus assessable income set off against the mismatch amounts of a company in the same group are dealt with in a separate row below. LESS: Surplus assessable income eliminated This is surplus assessable income that does not satisfy the continuity requirement for carrying forward amounts to future income years under section FH 12(8). LESS: Surplus assessable income tax credit This is the surplus assessable income that would be carried forward to the next income year but for section FH 12(7)(a) which reduces surplus assessable income to be carried forward based on tax credits granted by a foreign jurisdiction. LESS: Grouped surplus assessable income This amount is for surplus assessable income that has been offset against the mismatch amounts of a company that is part of the same group, consistent with section FH 12(10). Note that the relevant group company should be separately completing this BEPS disclosure and should declare that grouped mismatch amount under 'grouped mismatch amounts' in the row above. EQUALS: Closing balance This amount represents the leftover balance of surplus assessable income for an income year. This amount should be carried forward to the following income year. Thin Capitalisation Group Information Debt percentages determined under the thin capitalisation rules have historically been based on an entity’s debt relative to its gross assets. The thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE now require debt percentages be based on an entity’s assets net of its 'non-debt liabilities'. Thin capitalisation calculations and the response to the following questions are required on a group basis. If you have completed this disclosure for 1 member of your group, you do not have to answer the thin capitalisation questions in the disclosure for your other members. You do not have to complete this disclosure if your group is not required to comply with the thin capitalisation requirements, or you are a member of a New Zealand Banking Group. 3. Thin capitalisation group information Has your group had an NZ group debt percentage for thin capitalisation purposes of 40% or higher at any measurement date during the year (s. FE 12) Groups that are subject to thin capitalisation can choose to measure their NZ group debt percentage on a measurement date which will be either daily, at the end of each 3-month period, or the end of each income year – refer to section FE 8. The applicable measurement date is the measurement date that is used by the company. Groups are not required to calculate their NZ group debt percentage for measurement dates that they are not using. You should tick this box if your NZ group debt percentage was 40% or higher at any of the measurement dates that apply to your group that you have relied upon for thin capitalisation purposes. For groups that calculate their NZ group debt percentage on a daily or 3-monthly basis, the legislation averages their percentage over each of these dates - whereas this question is targeted at individual measurement dates. Therefore, it would be possible for your group to be under 40% for an income year but still be over 40% at one or more measurement dates. If, for the current income year, your NZ group debt percentage was under 40% for the measurement date applicable, you do not have to answer any further questions in this section. If the total interest deduction is less than 1 of the de minimis amounts in sections FE 5(1B) or FE 6(3)(ac)(i) to FE 6(3)(ac)(iv) for the income year, a disclosure under this part of the disclosure form is not required. Group interest expense (arising from cross-border related borrowing) This is the total interest expense deductions of your group for the current year arising from borrowing that is cross-border related borrowing as defined in section GC 6(3B). As with all other thin capitalisation questions in this disclosure, this amount should not take into account any apportionment of interest under section FE 6 for a group with a NZ group debt percentage above the relevant thin capitalisation threshold. This amount should be reduced by any amounts permanently denied as a deduction under subpart FH where the payer is related to the payee. This amount should also be reduced by any amounts denied as a deduction under section GC 7 that relates to the application of sections GC 15 to GC 18. Group interest expense (other) This is the total interest expense deductions of your group for the current year arising from borrowing that is not cross-border related borrowing. This is the total deduction amount in section FE 6(3)(a) less the total from the question 'Group interest expense (arising from cross-border related borrowing)' above. This amount should be reduced by any amounts denied as a deduction under subpart FH for structured arrangements (that are not cross-border related borrowing). Group interest-bearing debt (cross-border related borrowing) For this question and the next 4 questions in this section, if you have a measurement date of daily or 3-monthly, you should use the average figure from each of your measurement dates. This will be equal to total group debt as calculated under section FE 15 where the loan is cross-border related borrowing. Where the on-lending concession i n section FE 13 applies and the NZ group only has related party debt - this amount should be reduced by the on-lending concession amount. If the group has both related party debt and non-related party debt and the on-lending concession is greater than non-related party debt, the amount here should be reduced by the amount the on-lending concession is greater than the non-related party debt. Group interest-bearing debt (other) This will be equal to total group debt as calculated under section FE 15 minus the amount in the fourth question of this section ' Group interest-bearing debt (cross-border related borrowing)'. Where the on-lending concession i n section FE 13 applies and the NZ group only has other debt, or has other debt and related party debt, this amount should be reduced by the on-lending concession amount. If the on-lending concession amount is greater than other debt, cross-border related borrowing (in the previous field) should then be reduced. Total group assets Please provide the total group assets figure as calculated under section FE 16. Where there is on-lending under section FE 13, total group assets should be reduced by the amount of the on-lending. Group 'non-debt liabilities' adjustment made to total assets for purposes of the thin capitalisation rules (s. FE 16B) Please provide the total group non-debt liabilities figure as calculated under section FE 16B. Thin capitalisation percentage of the New Zealand group Please provide the debt percentage of the New Zealand group as calculated under section FE 12(3). Do not include decimals. To assist with comparability across groups please provide this figure without adjusting for on-lending or considering the impact of your group’s worldwide debt percentage. For this reason, we recognise that the percentage for your group may be above 60% without necessarily triggering an income adjustment to be included in the question below. Thin capitalisation income adjustment calculated under s. FE 6(2) (if an excess debt ent ity) If your New Zealand group debt percentage is greater than the threshold, you should include the amount of income under section CH 9 that is calculated under the formula in section FE 6(2). 4.Restricted Transfer Pricing Rules introduced in 2019 require related-party loans between a non-resident lender and a New Zealand resident borrower to be priced using a restricted transfer pricing approach. Under these rules, specific rules and parameters are applied to certain inbound related-party loans to both: •determine the credit rating of New Zealand borrowers at a high risk of BEPS, which will typically be either 1 or 2 credit rating notches below the ultimate parent’s credit rating •remove any features not typically found in third party debt in order to calculate (in combination with the credit rating rule if applicable) the appropriate amount of interest that is deductible on the debt - this applies to all cross-border associated party debt. Separate rules apply to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. Refer to TIB Vol 31 No 3 April 2019 for more information – ird.govt.nz/tib-april-2019 At any point during the year have you had NZD $10 million or more of cross-border related borrowing? Tick yes to this box if, at any point during the year, you had NZD$10 million or more of cross-border related borrowing as defined in section GC 6(3B). This is different from the number provided in the fourth thin capitalisation question in this BEPS disclosure as that question relates to your group whereas this question is specific to each taxpayer. At this amount of cross-border related borrowing you need to consider whether the restricted transfer pricing rules apply to your group, although depending on your group’s specific circumstances these rules may not affect the amount of deductible interest. Have you incurred interest on a cross-border related borrowing where the interest rate under an existing loan agreement has been reduced from the original interest rate in order to fall within any of the following sections? •Restricted credit rating (s. GC 16(9)) •Group credit rating (s. GC 16(10)) •Optional credit rating (s. GC 16(11)) •Insuring or lending person (s. GC 17) •Loan features that may be disregarded (s. GC 18(3)) The purpose of this question is to identify whether a pricing change has been made in order to fall within the restricted transfer pricing rule thresholds and, as a result, all interest amounts are deductible. For each of the sections listed above please answer yes if, for any interest-bearing cross-border related borrowing, the interest rate on that borrowing has been reduced in order to comply with that section. This means you consider the rate of interest that your group would have paid and would have been deductible under standard transfer pricing rules for that particular arrangement (or feature of the arrangement) would have been higher if not for the existence of that section. This question is only targeted at actual arrangements outstanding for any part of the year. You do not need to answer yes to the extent you repaid a loan, chose not to enter into a loan or chose not to include a feature in order to meet the requirements of the restricted transfer pricing rules. What is the value of non-deductible interest under each of the following sections? •Restricted credit rating (s. GC 16(9)) •Group credit rating (s. GC 16(10)) •Optional credit rating (s. GC 16(11)) •Insuring or lending person (s. GC 17) •Loan Features that may be disregarded (s. GC 18(3)) The purpose of this question is to identify non-deductible amounts under the restricted transfer pricing rules. For each of the sections listed above please provide, for all interest-bearing cross-border related borrowing, the total interest that has not been deducted because of that particular section. For loans where sections GC 16(9) to (11) or GC 17 have been applied to determine an appropriate credit rating please provide the total interest that has been incurred but has not been deducted because the implied credit rating in the loan agreement is higher than that calculated under the relevant provision. For loans with a feature disregarded under section GC 18(3) please provide the total interest that has been incurred but has not been deducted because that feature has been removed from the pricing analysis. If you have a cross-border related borrowing that has non-deductible interest under both a credit rating and a loan features section, please record the total amount under the relevant credit rating section. It is not necessary to split out the individual credit rating and loan features effects. Have you relied on any of the following sections to allow a specific feature to be taken into account in pricing a cross-border related borrowing: •Term of loan adjustment (s. GC 18(8)) •Features reflecting other borrowing (s. GC 18(9)) •Borrowing required for some insuring or lending persons (GC 18(10)) Please tick yes to each of the following sections if you have 1 or more loans with a feature listed in section GC 18(3) that has been included in the pricing analysis because of 1 or more of the following. •You have third party debt with a contractual term of greater than 5 years. •You have third party debt with the same feature. •You are an insuring or lending person and the feature was included to satisfy regulatory or solvency requirements set by the Reserve Bank.

Beware during scam season
=========================

**18 July 2017**

Tax return season at Inland Revenue often coincides with scam season.

It’s the time of year when we receive the most reports about unscrupulous people trying to pass themselves off as IR employees to trick customers into handing over personal information.

Scammers use a variety of techniques. Some come knocking on your door, others will try to trick you over the phone and more often these days they will approach you on email.

Sometimes the emails can look quite genuine with similar logos and fonts but there are clues you can look out for that give the game away.

Here’s an example from a recent scam that’s been doing the rounds. It tries to entice you to collect a tax refund. What they really want is your personal information.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2017/beware-during-scam-season/scam-mail-revised.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221244&hash=3BEBB035FE4CB54C4C47704F47784F82)

Look closely and you see some instant warnings signs. The first appears in the email address at the top. This is clearly bogus since Inland Revenue web addresses never appear with that suffix. Legitimate IR addresses finish with ird.govt.nz.

Sometimes scam emails show a refund amount in the subject line of the email. That's a big giveaway of a fraud since we would never email you with the amount of your refund. This is not assessed until you confirm your Personal Tax Summary through myIR.

Here are some more clues that might help you identify a scammer.

Inland Revenue would never: 

• send you an email with a hyperlink to a webpage that asks you to submit your personal information  
• send you an email, knock on your door or phone you promising a tax refund  
• ask you to pay money in order to release a tax refund  
• ask you to pay for any tax debt using iTunes cards, or any type of gift voucher  
• threaten legal action “out of the blue” unless you immediately take some action to repay a tax debt  
• send a representative to your house without a prior appointment. If someone turns up at your house, make sure you check their identification carefully and contact IRD if you are concerned.

We advise anyone concerned that they may have been the victim of a scam to contact Inland Revenue on 0800 227 774 with their IRD number to further discuss the call or email they have received.

Beware of sophisticated email scam
==================================

**18 July 2018**

A sophisticated email scam is doing the rounds using Inland Revenue branding to trick people into giving up their credit card details.

The email usually claims the recipient is due a large tax refund and then asks them to click on a link to another website where their money can supposedly be claimed.

Inland Revenue Chief Information Security Officer Doug Hammond says the email looks very convincing but there are a couple of important details that give their game away.

“Firstly look where the email is from. If it doesn’t come from an address that ends with ird.govt.nz then be very suspicious.

“Secondly look at the link where they are trying to direct people to claim the refund. Hover over the link with your mouse and make sure the web address is for a real Inland Revenue website. Don’t click on it.

“We send out emails all the time but customers should be aware what a fraudulent one looks like.”

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2018/beware-of-sophisticated-email-scam/scamemail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221256&hash=C7ECA93A92AE243F6DBEE74C554BA84F)

An example of the scam email doing the rounds

Anyone who receives an email they’re not sure about should notify Inland Revenue at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e3938b8a908b8a8d84a38a9187cd848c9597cd8d99)
.

Mr Hammond says this particular scam has been quite prevalent lately and Inland Revenue has received around 700 notifications about it in the past week.

Bias appeal dismissed on the basis of cause of action estoppel
==============================================================

2011 case note - appeal from the High Court for judicial review of the Taxation Review Authority has been dismissed on the basis of cause of action estoppel.

Case

John George Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

N/A

### Summary

An appeal from the High Court for judicial review of the Taxation Review Authority has been dismissed on the basis of cause of action estoppel and any possible bias was cured by the appeal of the substantive case to the High Court.

### Impact of decision

The law in the area of bias by a judicial decision maker is reasonably well established since the _Saxmere_ and _Muir_ cases. The law regarding appeal by way of re-hearing is that in _Austin Nichols & Co Inc v Stichting Lodestar_ \[2007\] NZSC 103; \[2008\] 2 NZLR 141 at \[16\].

### Facts

This was an appeal from the High Court (Cooper J (2009) 24 NZTC 23,284).

The taxpayer was the designer and promoter of the "Russell template" tax avoidance scheme. Additionally his personal tax affairs were subject to reassessment for the years 1985 to 2000 on the basis there was a tax avoidance arrangement. His personal tax affairs have little relationship to the Russell template litigation. The personal assessments have been upheld by the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") (_Case Z19_ (2009) 24 NZTC 14,217) and High Court (Wylie J (2010) 24 NZTC 24,463) and are under appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Mr Russell made an application to the TRA prior to the commencement of his personal tax challenge seeking that the TRA Judge (Judge Barber) recuse himself. The Judge considered the application but declined to recuse himself (see _Case Z3_ (2009) 24 NZTC 14,027). The High Court, on two occasions, reviewed the TRA's decision and affirmed the decision, the last being that before Cooper J.

The taxpayer appealed, arguing that the Judge was actually - albeit unconsciously - biased as a consequence of many years exposure to the Russell template litigation and, if not actually biased, there was the risk of the appearance of bias such that the Judge should have recused himself.

The Commissioner argued there was no actual bias (conscious or unconscious) and no appearance of bias if the test in _Saxmere Co Ltd v Wool Board Disestablishment Co_ \[2009\] NZSC 72, \[2010\] 1 NZLR 35 (also _Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 334; \[2007\] 3 NZLR 495) was applied.

Additionally it was argued that any risk of actual bias or the appearance of bias was cured by the appellate process which saw the High Court consider the tax assessments and affirm their correctness.

It was also argued that due to the taxpayer abandoning the recusal point in his substantive appeal, he was now cause of action estopped from proceeding with it in this appeal. This operates as follows:

*   ... cause of action estoppel ... prevents a party ... from asserting or denying, as against the other party, the existence of a particular cause of action, the non-existence or existence of which has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in previous litigation between the same parties. If the cause of action was determined to exist i.e. judgment was given upon it, it is ... merged in the judgment ... If it is determined not to exist, the unsuccessful plaintiff can no longer assert that it does; he is stopped ... \[27\]

### Decision

The Court of Appeal decided that the determination of Mr Russell's tax challenge by the High Court before Wylie J cured any apparent bias in the TRA \[3\]. The appeal was dismissed.

The Court referred to the appeal of the substantive tax challenge and its hearing before Justice Wylie at the High Court concluding:

*   ... The effect of his rehearing those issues was that he formed his own opinion on them. And he did that, not upon facts which had been found by Judge Barber at the TRA, but upon agreed facts ... It follows that, even if apparent bias affected Judge Barber's decision, and Cooper J erred in holding that Judge Barber was not required to recuse himself, the situation has been cured by the judgment of Wylie J on appeal. Upon undisputed facts Wylie J decided the issues with a fresh mind, unaffected by any suggestion of apparent bias or predetermination. \[45\]

Additionally the Court thought that Mr Russell would have been cause of action estopped given the fact he did not pursue his bias allegation at the time of the substantive appeal before Wylie J as it was a ground of appeal in that matter but was abandoned by him. But the Court preferred to address the matter in a substantive way \[25\] to \[29\], \[44\].

The Court did not determine the bias issue. They considered there was an arguable case for recusal but because the appeal before Wylie J of the substantive tax challenge was by way of rehearing this cured any suggestion of bias.

Biggest transformation contract to date awarded to NZ company
=============================================================

**12 February 2016**

Inland Revenue has selected New Zealand company Revera as the preferred supplier for the design and supply of data centre services to support the country’s new tax and social policy system.

Revera, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spark Digital, is a leading provider of cloud-delivered data centre services.

Inland Revenue Deputy Commissioner Change, Greg James, said the data centres contract is one of the most significant elements of the agency’s programme to modernise New Zealand’s tax and social policy administration.

“We are delighted that the data centres contract has been awarded to a New Zealand company. At a value of $45-60 million over 10 years, it will be one of the programme’s biggest and is certainly the largest contract to date to be awarded to a New Zealand company,” Mr James said.

“It is another very important step towards a simpler, more cost-effective tax system to make paying taxes and receiving entitlements simpler, and reducing compliance costs for New Zealand businesses.”

Spark Digital CEO Tim Miles acknowledged the flexibility and commitment of Inland Revenue to achieve the best possible solutions for taxpayers from its transformation.

“Inland Revenue is working determinedly to modernise the tax system and I have no doubt that this will lead to better outcomes for government and all New Zealanders,” Mr Miles said.

“We are proud to be selected to play a part in such an innovative project and look forward to delivering on the data centre services contract.”   

The new Revera data centres will host essential services including the new tax system, which has been named START (Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology), with the first of these data centres coming online in the next month.

Mr James said START’s data requirements will be variable, and Revera’s design has built in flexibility to cater for these changing needs at any given time.

“Revera’s solution means if we need fewer servers or less storage, we can use just what we need when we need it, and not pay for capacity we’re not using.”  

Revera has completed the initial detailed design of the new data centre service.

Inland Revenue’s current FIRST system will continue to be supported by existing data centres, and during the transition to START, the two data centre systems will co-exist.

Tenderers were sought from the all-of-Government panel of infrastructure as a service providers.

If enacted, these changes would reduce the amount of tax a person would be required to pay on their personal income. Some consequential changes to other tax types that are based on personal tax rates and thresholds will not take effect until 1 April 2025. Effective date The amendments would be effective from: ▪ 1 April 2024: o formula to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) (clause 6) o composite personal income tax rates and thresholds (clause 7) ▪ 31 July 2024: o resident withholding tax (RWT) (clause 29) o certain tax codes and rates (clause 31) o reporting of income information by individuals and treatment of certain amounts (clause 32). ▪ 1 April 2025: o attribution rule for income from personal services (clause 34) o amounts of tax for PAYE income payments (clause 35) o payment of extra pay with other PAYE income payments (clause 36) o personal income tax, FBT and employer superannuation contribution tax rates and thresholds (clause 37) o basic tax rates for PAYE income payments (clause 38) o prescribed investor rate (clause 39). Date: May 2024 8 Background The Bill proposes changes to the personal income tax thresholds. The current thresholds have been unchanged since 2010, except for the introduction of the top marginal rate in 2021. The current and proposed thresholds are set out below: Existing threshold Proposed threshold Threshold rate $0 – $14,000 $0 – $15,600 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 $15,601 – $53,500 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 $53,501 – $78,100 30% $70,001 – $180,000 $78,101 – $180,000 33% $180,001+ $180,001+ (No change) 39% Key features The key features of the proposed amendments are: ▪ Composite personal income tax rates and thresholds that will take effect from 1 April 2024 to be applicable only for the 2024–25 tax year to give effect to the mid-year threshold changes. ▪ All references to current personal income tax thresholds across all Inland Revenue Acts will be replaced with corresponding proposed thresholds. ▪ Changes to the rates and thresholds of consequential tax types, which are dependent on the personal income tax rates and thresholds, ie, RWT, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax, retirement scheme contribution tax and the prescribed investor rates. ▪ A change to the formula to calculate FBT payable. Detailed analysis Composite rates The current tax thresholds will apply for the first three months and 30 days of the 2024–25 tax year, and the proposed thresholds will apply for the remaining eight months and one day of the tax year. Date: May 2024 9 To account for two sets of thresholds being applicable in a single tax year, Inland Revenue will need to use composite rates for the income amounts between the old and new thresholds. The composite tax rates are a combination of the current and proposed rates to be applied across the entire year to determine a taxpayer’s annual tax liability. The composite rates and thresholds will be used for Inland Revenue’s end-of-year “square- up” calculations, which assess a taxpayer’s income against the amount of tax paid over that income year (and may result in a tax refund or liability). The composite rates and thresholds that will take effect from 1 April 2024 to be applied for the 2024–25 tax year would be: Composite tax thresholds Composite tax rates 0 – $14,000 10.5% $14,001 – $15,600 12.82% $15,601 – $48,000 17.5% $48,001 – $53,500 21.64% $53,501 – $70,000 30% $70,001 – $78,100 30.99% $78,101 – $180,000 33% $180,001+ 39% Example 1: Annual tax liability using composite rates and thresholds Elizabeth earns $52,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Elizabeth’s tax liability for the tax year will be calculated using the composite rates and thresholds, which would mean: ▪ the first $14,000 will be taxed at 10.5% ▪ every dollar earned between $14,001 and $15,600 will be taxed at 12.82% ▪ every dollar earned between $15,601 and $48,000 will be taxed at 17.5%, and ▪ every dollar earned after $48,001 until $52,000 will be taxed at 21.64%. Date: May 2024 10 Differing application dates for consequential tax type changes While Inland Revenue can implement personal income tax changes relatively quickly, employers and payroll service providers are likely to require more time to implement changes. This is especially the case for consequential tax types. These consequential tax types use rates and thresholds that are based on personal income tax rates and thresholds. Examples of consequential tax types include RWT, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax, retirement scheme contribution tax and the prescribed investor rates. Rates and thresholds for consequential tax types are calculated using the personal income tax settings, which means calculating and implementing a mid-year change could create significant compliance challenges for employers, payroll service providers, and managed funds. The Government has therefore decided that changes to consequential tax types will take effect from 1 April 2025, except for changes to RWT and the formula to calculate FBT payable under the attribution method. The deferred application of the changes to most consequential tax types is intended to minimise compliance costs for employers. This means that only one set of rates and thresholds will apply for these consequential tax types for the whole tax year. This is further explained below. Changes to FBT calculation for the attribution method to take effect from 1 April 2024 The changes to the formula used to calculate a taxpayer’s FBT liability under the attribution method will take effect from 1 April 2024. The current formula is designed to calculate the FBT payable assuming personal income tax and FBT rates are essentially the same. Because the Bill proposes changes to personal income tax and FBT thresholds to apply from different dates, the current formula may result in an amount of FBT payable that effectively claws back the tax relief the new personal income tax thresholds provide for the 2024–25 tax year. The new formula mitigates and future proofs against this issue. The formula is: tax on all-inclusive pay − FBT on net cash pay. Where: ▪ all-inclusive pay is the sum of net cash pay and the value of taxable fringe benefits received by the employee ▪ net cash pay is the cash left in hand of the employee after tax, ie: cash pay − tax on cash pay. Date: May 2024 11 Example 2: FBT payable for the 2024–25 tax year using the new formula Joanna earns $54,000 in salary and receives a fringe benefit worth $5,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Joanna’s employer uses the FBT attribution method so the FBT liability will be calculated using composite personal income tax rates and thresholds, current FBT rates and thresholds and the new FBT formula. This means: FBT payable on (net cash pay + fringe benefit) − FBT payable on (cash pay − tax on cash pay) = FBT payable on ($45,314.68 + $5,000) − FBT payable on ($54,000 − $8,685.32) = $11,591.02 – $9,448.02 = $2,143.00. Where: ▪ $45,315.68 is the net cash pay (the in-hand pay of the employee after personal income tax is deducted using the composite personal income tax thresholds and rates) ▪ $5,000 is the cash value of the fringe benefit received by the employee ▪ $54,000 is the cash pay ▪ $8,685.32 is the personal income tax payable on the $54,000 using the composite personal income tax thresholds and rates. Changes to RWT to take effect from 31 July 2024 The changes to RWT will apply with effect from 31 July 2024 alongside the personal income tax threshold changes. Because interest and dividends are included in a taxpayer’s personal income tax calculation at the end of the year, RWT rates will not change. But people will be able to elect the 10.5% rate if they expect their total income to be less than $15,600 (currently $14,000). Some taxpayers who have elected higher RWT rates are likely to advise payers of resident withholding income that they wish to change their elected tax rates with the increases to the personal income tax thresholds. The changes to RWT are not expected to require payers of resident withholding income to make major changes. Date: May 2024 12 Changes to consequential tax types to take effect from 1 April 2025 Changes to other consequential tax types will apply from 1 April 2025 to avoid complexities arising from the need to calculate any composite rates or thresholds or to recalculate the rates applicable to employees. This will involve changes to the thresholds of: ▪ FBT ▪ employer superannuation contribution tax ▪ retirement scheme contribution tax, and ▪ prescribed investor rate. All these tax types will have references to current thresholds replaced with the proposed thresholds except for FBT and employer superannuation contribution tax. Thresholds of FBT are determined by the net in-hand income, ie, the difference between the gross income and the personal tax payable. The proposed thresholds of FBT are set out below. Range of dollar in all- inclusive pay Tax rate $0 – $13,962 11.73% $13,963 – $45,230 21.21% $45,231 – $62,450 42.86% $62,451 – $130,723 49.25% $130,724+ 63.93% The thresholds of the employer superannuation contribution tax are 20% greater than the personal income tax thresholds. The proposed thresholds are set out below. Employer superannuation contribution tax threshold amount Tax rate $0 – $18,720 10.5% $18,721 – $64,200 17.5% Date: May 2024 13 $64,201 – $93,720 30% $93,721 – $216,000 33% $216,001+ 39% Date: May 2024 14 Independent earner tax credit Clauses 4 and 26 Summary of proposed amendment The amendment proposes to lift the threshold at which the independent earner tax credit (IETC) will begin abating and a taxpayer will no longer be eligible to receive the IETC. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect from 31 July 2024. Background The Bill proposes changes to the IETC thresholds. Currently, a taxpayer is entitled to the IETC if they earn from $24,000 to $48,000 per year. However, even if they earn within the income thresholds, they become ineligible for any months in which they receive a main benefit, student allowance, New Zealand Superannuation or veteran’s pension or are eligible to receive Working for Families. Taxpayers receive the maximum IETC available when they earn between $24,000 and $44,000 per tax year, receive reduced IETC if they earn more than $44,000 per tax year, and become ineligible once they earn more than $48,000. The maximum amount receivable is $520 per year ($10 per week). The Bill proposes to increase the threshold where abatement begins and the threshold where taxpayers are no longer eligible to receive the IETC. The current and new settings are set out below. Eligibility starts Abatement starts No longer eligible Current $24,000 13 cents per dollar earned over $44,000 $48,000 Proposed $24,000 (no change) 13 cents per dollar earned over $66,000 $70,000 Key features The key features of the proposed amendments are: Date: May 2024 15 ▪ The personal income threshold at which the abatement begins changes from $44,000 to $66,000. ▪ The personal income threshold at which taxpayers will no longer be eligible to receive any amount of IETC changes from $48,000 to $70,000. ▪ The method to calculate a taxpayer’s IETC entitlement for the tax year ending 31 March 2025 will use separate calculations for the period from 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024 and for the period from 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025. This will only be applicable for the 2024–25 tax year to give effect to the mid-year setting changes. Detailed analysis Composite calculation for the 2024–25 tax year The current IETC settings will apply for the first three months and 30 days of the 2024–25 tax year, and the proposed settings will apply for the remaining seven months and a day of the tax year. Clause 4 provides a composite calculation to calculate a taxpayer’s full year entitlement to account for two sets of IETC settings being applicable in one year. For 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024, the IETC entitlement is calculated using the formula: (person’s credit – full year abatement) x credit period days ÷ 365. Where: ▪ person’s credit is either $520 if the taxpayer’s net income for the tax year is equal to or more than $24,000, but $0 if the net income is less than $24,000 or more than $48,000 ▪ full year abatement is the total of 13 cents per dollar earned over $44,000 for the tax year ▪ credit period days is the number of whole days the taxpayer is eligible for the IETC in the period 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024. For 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025, the IETC entitlement is calculated using the formula: (person’s credit − full year abatement) x credit period days ÷ 365. Where: ▪ person’s credit is either $520 if the taxpayer’s net income for the tax year is equal to or more than $24,000, but $0 if the net income is less than $24,000 or more than $70,000 Date: May 2024 16 ▪ full year abatement is the total of 13 cents per dollar earned over $66,000 for the tax year ▪ credit period days is the number of whole days the taxpayer is eligible for the IETC in the period 31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025. Therefore, the calculation for the 2024–25 tax year is: Period 1 Period 2 ((($P – X) x D/365) + (($P – Y) x D/365)) x EM/12. Where: ▪ Period 1 refers to when the current settings apply (1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024), and Period 2 refers to when the proposed settings apply (31 July 2024 to 31 March 2025) ▪ $P = either $520 if the taxpayer earns more than $24,000 but less than the maximum threshold of the applicable setting, or $0 if the taxpayer earns less than $24,000 or more than the maximum threshold of the applicable setting ▪ X = amount of abatement under the old settings ▪ Y = amount of abatement under the new settings ▪ D = number of full days the setting applies to (based on implementation date) ▪ EM = number of full months the taxpayer was not ineligible for the IETC due to receiving a main benefit, student allowance, New Zealand Superannuation or veteran’s pension or being eligible to receive Working for Families. Eligible months will continue to be determined on an annual basis. This means that the total combined IETC amount from periods 1 and 2 will then be multiplied by the number of eligible months divided by 12. Example 1: Annual IETC entitlement using composite calculation Elizabeth earns $45,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Elizabeth is entitled to IETC because she receives no main benefit or government support and earns more than $24,000 but less than the maximum thresholds of both the current and new settings – $48,000 and $70,000. Elizabeth’s $45,000 annual income is $1,000 above the beginning of the abatement zone for the period up to 30 July 2024. Date: May 2024 17 Elizabeth’s IETC entitlement for the tax year will be calculated using the composite calculation, which would mean: ((($520 - $130) x 121/365) + (($520 – 0) x 244/365)) x 12/12 = $476.90. Where: ▪ $130 is the amount of the abatement under the current settings (13 cents x $1,000) ▪ 121 is the number of days the current settings apply ▪ $0 is the amount of the abatement under the proposed settings (13 cents x $0) ▪ 244 is the number of days the proposed settings apply ▪ 12 is the number of whole months Elizabeth was eligible for IETC. Example 2: Annual IETC entitlement using composite calculation Josh earns $67,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Josh is partly entitled to IETC though he earns more than $24,000 and receives no main benefit or government support. This is because he earns more than the maximum threshold of $48,000 under the current settings but earns less than the maximum threshold of $70,000 under the new settings. Josh’s IETC entitlement for the tax year will be calculated using the composite calculation, which would mean: ((($0) x 121/365) + (($520 − 130) x 244/365)) x 12/12 = $260.71. Where: ▪ $0 represents Josh’s eligibility to receive IETC having been fully abated under the current settings ▪ 121 is the number of days the current settings apply ▪ $130 is the amount of the abatement under the proposed settings (13 cents x $1,000) ▪ 244 is the number of days the proposed settings apply ▪ 12 is the number of whole months Josh was eligible for IETC. Date: May 2024 18 Example 3: Annual IETC entitlement using composite calculation Paul earns $44,000 in the 2024–25 tax year. Paul is entitled to IETC because he earns more than $24,000 but less than the maximum thresholds of both the current and new settings – $48,000 and $70,000. However, he begins receiving Working for Families from January 2025. Paul is no longer eligible to receive IETC in the months he receives Working for Families – January, February and March 2025. Paul’s IETC entitlement for the tax year will be calculated using the composite calculation, which would mean: ((($520 − 0) x 121/365) + (($520 − 0) x 244/365)) x 9/12 = $390. Where: ▪ $0 is the amount of the abatement under the current settings (13 cents x $0) ▪ 121 is the number of days the current settings apply ▪ $0 is the amount of the abatement under the proposed settings (13 cents x $0) ▪ 244 is the number of days the proposed settings apply ▪ 9 is the number of whole months Paul was eligible for IETC. Date: May 2024 19 Working for Families Date: May 2024 21 In-work tax credit Clauses 5 and 27 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would increase the in-work tax credit (IWTC) base rate by $25 per week. Effective date The proposed amendment would apply from 31 July 2024. However, part-year amendments would apply from 1 April 2024. These allow the old rate and new rate to be used for different periods in the 2024–25 tax year. Background The IWTC is the key instrument to “make work pay” within the wider context of the Working for Families package. It supports low- to middle-income working families whose members take up and stay in employment, rather than remaining on a benefit. It achieves this by providing a boost to the family’s income once members begin working. However, there is no requirement to automatically increase the rate of the IWTC over time. The real value of the IWTC has decreased relative to wage growth, and its effectiveness as an incentive to move off a benefit and to take up and stay in employment has lessened. Alongside the family tax credit, the IWTC also contributes to supporting income adequacy and reducing child poverty by increasing the incomes of low-income working families. Recent inflation and the impact of the cost-of-living crisis has made it difficult for families to meet household costs. The diminished value of the IWTC means the payment does not provide adequate financial support to help low-income working families face the rising cost of living. Key features ▪ The IWTC base rate would increase from $3,770 per year to $5,070 per year. This represents a $25 increase in weekly income. ▪ The maximum weekly entitlement for a family of up to three children would increase from $72.50 to $97.50. Date: May 2024 22 ▪ The additional child rate remains at $15 more per week. ▪ The previous IWTC amount of $3,770 would be used to calculate IWTC entitlements until 30 July 2024. Date: May 2024 23 Minimum family tax credit Clauses 5 and 28 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment adjusts the minimum family tax credit (MFTC) threshold to $35,316 after tax. This will ensure that MFTC recipients benefit from the personal income tax changes and the increase to the IWTC. Effective date The proposed amendment would apply from 31 July 2024. However, part-year amendments would apply from 1 April 2024. These allow the old threshold and new threshold to be applied for the payment of instalments for different periods in the 2024–25 tax year. Background The MFTC is one of the Working for Families tax credits. Its purpose is to incentivise members of families with children to move off the benefit at the margin and into full-time work. The MFTC achieves this by “topping up” the incomes of working families to an amount that is more than what they could potentially receive on a benefit. The IWTC and the MFTC work together to top up a person’s income to ensure that they are financially better off in work without a main benefit. Changes made to the IWTC will automatically flow through to MFTC recipients by keeping the MFTC threshold at its current level. However, for every dollar a family earns over the MFTC threshold, their MFTC entitlement reduces by a dollar. As such, the MFTC threshold must be increased to ensure that a family’s entitlement is not reduced by reason of them gaining tax relief from the personal income tax rate changes. The proposed increase in the MFTC means that single parent families would remain better off in full-time work (defined as 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours for couples) and receiving the MFTC, rather than remaining on a benefit. Key features ▪ The MFTC threshold would increase from $35,204 per year (after tax) to $35,316 per year (after tax). This represents a $2.15 increase in weekly income. Date: May 2024 24 ▪ This change, in conjunction with the increase to the IWTC, would increase recipients’ income by approximately $27.15 per week. ▪ The previous MFTC threshold of $35,204 would be used to calculate MFTC entitlements until 30 July 2024. Date: May 2024 25 FamilyBoost Date: May 2024 26 FamilyBoost Clauses 8 to 24 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments introduce and outline the FamilyBoost tax credit, the eligibility and process requirements for claimants, and how the credit is calculated. Supporting provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) would also be amended to align FamilyBoost legislation with general tax legislation and administrative provisions for aspects of the policy relating to issues such as debt, penalties, credit offsets and payments. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 July 2024. This means that applicants will be able to claim payments related to early childhood education (ECE) costs incurred from 1 July 2024. Payments could be issued to parents and caregivers from October 2024. Background The Government has agreed to a new payment named FamilyBoost to support low- to middle- income working families with the rising cost of living by providing targeted assistance with ECE costs. The tax credit was agreed to by Cabinet in March 2024. To ensure FamilyBoost payments reflect actual ECE fees incurred and are targeted toward families who need it most, FamilyBoost will be a ‘rebate style’ payment each quarter. While externally the credit will generally be referred to as a payment or as FamilyBoost, it will be a new tax credit under Part M of the ITA. The proposals include the eligibility criteria for the tax credit, calculation basis, definitions associated with caregivers and household income, and consequential amendments to the administration and avoidance provisions in the ITA and TAA. Key features FamilyBoost recipients will be able to claim a quarterly partial refund of actual ECE fees incurred for that quarter. The amount to be reimbursed will be 25% of costs incurred. Date: May 2024 27 Entitlements will abate where the annual income of the household is between $140,000 to $180,000, with no remaining entitlement at $180,000. Because of the quarterly nature of the payment, these amounts will be calculated against quarterly equivalents, with household income for abatement being between $35,000 and $45,000 per quarter, and no remaining entitlement after the $45,000 threshold is reached for a given quarter. The key features of the proposed amendments are: ▪ Eligible households consist of a parent or caregiver and that person’s partner (that is, de facto partner or spouse). ▪ Separated parents can submit separate applications for FamilyBoost, provided they care for the child and meet some ECE costs directly. ▪ Parents and caregivers will apply in the manner to be specified by the Commissioner and provide information required for the new tax credit. ▪ The FamilyBoost payment will be 25% of ECE costs incurred, after existing support that reduces the fees payable is taken into account. ▪ The payment amount is capped at $975 for the quarter. The payment cap will reduce where household income is above $35,000 per quarter. ▪ Caregivers can apply for a previous quarter, but a four-year time bar will apply. This means caregivers must apply in the four-year period after the end of the quarter of the credit that the application relates to. ▪ Applications will include details of current family circumstances, and the payment is intended to be full and final for most applicants. ▪ Where debt is generated, FamilyBoost will use existing debt regimes for other tax products. ▪ Integrity checks will be performed. Detailed analysis Eligibility A person is entitled to a quarterly FamilyBoost tax credit if they meet the eligibility requirements for that quarter. This means they must, at some point during the quarter: ▪ have a child in their care who is enrolled with a licensed early childhood service, ▪ incur ECE fees for that child, and ▪ be a tax resident in New Zealand. Date: May 2024 28 At the end of the quarter, they will need to complete an application for FamilyBoost, declare their relationship status, and provide the required evidence of fees incurred. If the parent or caregiver (or their partner) is required to file an income tax return as part of their usual tax obligations to Inland Revenue, this will need to be filed before a FamilyBoost payment can be processed. FamilyBoost is paid per household rather than per child, meaning the income and refund caps apply regardless of the number of children in the household attending ECE. Separated parents and other caregivers FamilyBoost requires that the applicant have some day-to-day care of the child they are applying for, and that they incur ECE fees for that child. Where the parents of a child have separated and share care of a child, FamilyBoost can be claimed by both parents, provided each parent incurs at least a portion of the ECE costs directly and they provide separate invoices. Separated parents will not be able to claim more than the $975 per quarter household cap, but each parent will be treated as having a separate household. Where a grandparent or other caregiver also incurs ECE fees for a child, they can claim FamilyBoost provided they have an ongoing responsibility for the day-to-day care of the child. If a caregiver is eligible for FamilyBoost but passes away before applying for FamilyBoost their estate will be able to claim it on their behalf. Registration and application Parents and caregivers applying for the refund must complete an application in the manner specified by the Commissioner and provide the required information to support the application. It is anticipated that a person will need to register for this new product through myIR and provide the information that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue requires to set up and open their FamilyBoost account. After the initial registration is completed, it is anticipated caregivers can log on each quarter to submit invoices and confirm their family circumstances for each application. FamilyBoost payments will be paid following each quarterly application. Parents and caregivers can apply at a later date but must apply within the four-year period that begins on the day immediately following the end of the quarter they wish to apply for. Date: May 2024 29 Evidence of costs incurred It is anticipated that parents or caregivers will need to upload ECE invoices or similar evidence via myIR to support their application. The Commissioner will set out the information required on these invoices or other evidence in guidance following the Bill’s enactment. This is expected to include evidence of the amount of fees payable for the relevant period, family circumstances and licensed early childhood service details. Calculation and payments The Bill outlines how Inland Revenue will calculate a parent or caregiver’s FamilyBoost payment. The payment amount will be determined by the ECE fees incurred and the income of the caregiver and their partner. Other ECE supports The amount of the credit will be 25% of residual fees payable, after other supports such as 20 Hours ECE and Work and Income’s childcare subsidy are taken into account. This reflects the fact that the policy is designed to support parents directly with the actual costs they face for ECE. Fees also do not include any amount that is a donation. Quarterly calculation Inland Revenue will calculate the parent or caregiver’s household income on a quarterly basis using the most recent income information held by Inland Revenue. Generally, this will be either the most recent three months’ reportable income or the most recent income tax return filed. Where a person has a mix of income types, the greater amount will be used. Example 1: Single parent on salary/wage income Jacqui earns $85,000 per year and has one child aged 3 in ECE for 40 hours per week. Her child is eligible for the 20 Hours ECE, and she pays for the remaining 20 hours, which costs her $250 per week. Jacqui has earned $21,250 for the period 1 July to 30 September and has paid $3,250 in ECE fees for the same period. Because her income is under the quarterly cap of $35,000, Jacqui will receive back 25% of the fees she pays. She will be reimbursed $812.50 as her quarterly FamilyBoost refund. Where a household has two earners – one self-employed and the other earning only reportable income, a mixture of income types will be used (see example 2). Date: May 2024 30 Example 2: One parent is a salary/wage earner, the other is self-employed Dharmendra works full time for wages, earning $1,700 per week ($88,400 a year). His partner, Neisha, is self-employed, working roughly 30 hours per week for her carpentry business. Neisha’s last income tax return was filed on 7 July 2024, for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. For that period, she earned $50,000. They have two children, Samira (4) and Niam (2). The combined weekly daycare cost for both children is $531 per week at a daycare centre in Christchurch. Due to their level of income, they are not eligible for a childcare subsidy from Work and Income. Dharmendra receives wages, so Inland Revenue uses his gross wages paid between 1 July and 30 September 2024 of $22,100. Neisha’s income for this quarter will be calculated as $12,500 ($50,000 / 4). Their combined income for the quarter is $34,600. The ECE invoices are in Dharmendra’s name. In September, Dharmendra registers for FamilyBoost via myIR. In October, Dharmendra logs onto the account and submits the first claim, confirming their family’s details and including the invoices he’s been saving since July, which show they’ve spent $6,903 on daycare in the last three months. The family’s earnings for the quarter are under the quarterly threshold of $35,000, so the family receives $975 into their bank account. Abatement Households with up to $35,000 in income for a quarter will receive the full payment. Where a household’s quarterly income falls between $35,000 and $45,000, the full payment will abate by 9.75 cents per dollar of income over $35,000. Households earning over $45,000 per quarter will not be eligible. Table 1: Eligibility for different income levels Annual household income Maximum weekly rebate Amount refunded (paid quarterly) Up to $140,000 $75.00 $975.00 $150,000 $56.25 $731.25 $160,000 $37.50 $487.50 $170,000 $18.75 $243.75 Date: May 2024 31 Payment The payment can be made every three months into the applicant’s nominated bank account. Families can choose to apply less frequently if they wish. Amendments, debt and integrity Amendments, additional invoices and time-bar for applications It is proposed that in most cases, a household’s entitlement to FamilyBoost is full and final. Inland Revenue would have the power to amend applications where a change in the applicant’s circumstances has resulted in an unduly harsh outcome; guidance around the types of cases where this power may be used will likely be clarified in a later determination. Where an application has been made with at least one invoice, a calculation would be made of the caregiver’s maximum entitlement, based on their income and family circumstances. Based on this calculation, a caregiver would be able to upload further invoices to that same quarter until their maximum entitlement is reached. This would need to be done within four years of the end of the quarter of the original application. Example 3: Additional invoices Ana applies for FamilyBoost in May 2025, for the period 1 January 2025 to 30 April 2025. She uploads 11 weeks’ worth of invoices from her daycare centre, confirms her income of $20,000 for 1 January to 30 April, and submits the application. Later, she realises she missed a further two invoices she could have submitted. In October, she uploads these to myIR to add them to the May application and is refunded 25% of the fees on these two invoices. There will also be a four-year limit to applications for FamilyBoost. Parents and caregivers must apply within the four-year period that begins on the day immediately following the end of the quarter they are applying for. For example, a parent claiming for the 1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024 period has until 1 October 2028 to apply for that quarter’s FamilyBoost payment. Debt FamilyBoost is a ‘rebate’ style payment where most entitlements are full and final so the level of debt generated should be minimal. Where the Commissioner recalculates a parent or caregiver’s FamilyBoost application, for example, due to uncovering a genuine error, the Commissioner must use the original calculation unless amending this would result in a Date: May 2024 32 significant overpayment or underpayment. What constitutes a significant overpayment or underpayment will be established in a published determination made by the Commissioner. Where a debt is created, standard income tax penalty and use-of-money interest rules will apply to any outstanding amount. Where a caregiver is unable or unwilling to repay a debt, Inland Revenue will utilise standard debt collection processes and powers to negotiate a payment plan, consider a write-off, or enforce payment depending on the individual’s situation. Integrity Integrity checks will be completed as applications are made. Claims will be subject to verification both during the application process and retrospectively. Changes to information-sharing provisions Information will be shared with the Ministry of Education for the purposes of administering FamilyBoost. The Ministry of Education holds the details of children who are in ECE and details around licensed ECE providers, which will be used to verify that the child is enrolled with the ECE provider that they are providing an invoice from. Date: May 2024 33 Research and Development Tax Incentive Date: May 2024 34 R&D Tax Incentive: Filing under incorrect entity name Clauses 41, 42 and 43 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to amend an approval of a person enrolled in the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) in instances where the person has applied for approval using an incorrect entity name. Effective date The proposed amendments would apply for the 2021–22 and later income years. Background For a person to be able to claim a tax credit through the RDTI regime, they must apply for approval (either a general approval of their activities or a criteria and methodologies approval) and then submit a supplementary return containing their research and development (R&D) expenditure for the year. In a wholly-owned group situation, approval must be sought in the name of the entity undertaking the R&D. If, for example, approval was applied for and given to a parent company when its wholly-owned subsidiary company was the entity undertaking the R&D, then RDTI tax credits would not be processed for either entity if the time to vary that approval had elapsed. Key features ▪ A person can apply to the Commissioner to amend the name of an entity in an RDTI approval if they have incorrectly named another entity within the same wholly-owned group in the approval. ▪ If a person has an application to amend a name in an RDTI approval accepted, they have 30 days to subsequently file a supplementary return in the correct entity’s name. Date: May 2024 35 Student loan scheme Date: May 2024 36 Student loan scheme base interest rate Clauses 2(7) and (8), and 44 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that the student loan scheme base interest rate is increased by 1% for five years from 1 April 2025. This will mean that the interest rate charged on an overseas-based borrower’s student loan will increase by 1%, as will the late payment interest rate charged on unpaid amounts. Effective date The proposed amendments will apply for five years from 1 April 2025 to 1 April 2030. Background The base interest rate is the interest charged on overseas-based borrowers’ student loans. Late payment interest is charged on unpaid amounts and is the base interest rate plus 4%. Inland Revenue determines the base interest rate using the five-year average of the ten-year bond rate to December in the year preceding the tax year to which the rate will apply (to two decimal places) plus a margin of 0.74%. This number is then rounded to the nearest decimal place. The interest rate charged on overseas-based borrower loans was 2.9% for the 2023–24 tax year (and is 3.3% for 2024–25). Late payment interest charged on overdue student loan payments (for both New Zealand-based and overseas-based borrowers) was 6.9% for the 2023–24 tax year (and is 7.3% for 2024–25). Over the last three years inflation has overtaken the base interest rate by 9.5%. The proposed amendment would increase the student loan base interest rate by 1% for five years to partially cover the loss in value of the student loan scheme due to three years of high inflation.

==============

2007 case note - taxpayer's appeal dismissed and assessments upheld - Bill of Rights, time bar.

Case

Peter Lloyd Machirus v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, Income Tax Act 1994, GST Act 1985

### Summary

The High Court dismissed the taxpayer's appeal and upheld the assessments and found there was no breach of the Bill of Rights Act. He further upheld the Commissioner's cross-appeal and held that the Taxation Review Authority erred in finding certain assessments statute-barred.

### Facts

#### Appeal

The taxpayer derived income from legal and illegal means. His case, at least in part before the Taxation Review Authority (TRA), was that the proceeds of his criminal activities were not liable to either income tax or GST. The TRA confirmed the Commissioner's reassessments relating to the income tax liability and the November 1992 to May 1993 GST periods. However the TRA quashed the reassessments relating to the subsequent GST periods on the basis that they were time-barred.

The taxpayer appealed the TRA decision. The questions for determination in respect of his appeal for the High Court were stated by the TRA as being:

1.  Whether the TRA was wrong in holding that the income tax assessments for the 1991 to 1993 tax years were wrong;
2.  Whether the TRA was wrong in finding that the taxpayer had not proven that the relevant income had been derived from criminal activities;
3.  Whether the TRA was wrong in holding that the taxpayer had not proven that the GST outputs and inputs were monies derived from criminal activities;
4.  Whether the TRA was wrong in holding that the taxpayer had not proven that the Commissioner had breached the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 ("NZBORA")

The taxpayer did not dispute those parts of the TRA decision in respect of questions (i), (ii) and (iii) but rather claimed his main appeal point was focused on sections 27 and 21 of NZBORA regarding unreasonable search and seizure and the right to natural justice. He also argued that specifically, a $50,000 gambling debt was deductible.

#### Cross-Appeal

The Commissioner cross-appealed the TRA decision on the basis that the Authority was in error to hold that an alleged failure to serve the GST reassessments of 30 November 1993, 31 May 1994, 30 November 1994 and 31 May 1995, on Mr Machirus until 2002 meant the reassessments were time-barred. The TRA was satisfied that the Commissioner had correctly calculated the GST owing by Mr Marchirus for each of the four periods however the Authority held that failure to give notice of the reassessments until 2002 invalidated the reassessments.

### Decision

#### Taxpayer's Appeal

His Honour Justice Ronald Young noted at the outset that the taxpayer offered no evidence or arguments to challenge on appeal the correctness of the Income Tax and GST assessments. Accordingly he held that they were confirmed.

Regarding section 21 of the NZBORA His Honour held that the taxpayer's arguments had no basis. The taxpayer's argument was essentially based on the improper withholding of relevant information from him by the Commissioner until the TRA hearing and amounted to a miscarriage of justice such that justified a new trial.

His Honour found that on the evidence before him the taxpayer held sufficient business records and that the cheque butts in particular had little or no relevance to his case and in any event the information they contained could have been obtained through his bank statements. The taxpayer had a chance to produce these but did not, which illustrated that the taxpayer knew they had no relevance.

I have approached this aspect of Mr Machirus' appeal as based on the claim that there was relevant evidence in existence which Mr Machirus would have wished to present to the Authority but which was not reasonably available to him before or at the Authority hearing. Essentially the new trial test of whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. What is clear is that the cheque butts themselves have no real relevance to this case. It is also clear the information the cheque butts contained could have been obtained elsewhere either through his bank statements and cancelled cheques, or through the receipts, notebook and diary kept by him....

I am therefore satisfied that there is no ground of appeal based on s21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Acts regarding unreasonable search and seizure, nor is there any appeal ground based on a miscarriage of justice from relevant evidence coming to light after the Authority hearing.

Section 27 of the NZBORA was simply disposed of by the His Honour noting:

Firstly, I doubt the application of section 27 to decisions by the Commissioner in this case. Section 27 is concerned with the adjudicative function. The Commissioner's function in this case is in collecting the tax due. Any determination of a dispute regarding whether tax is due and the amount due will be decided in the District Court or the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court.

Secondly, without a timeline and an identification of reasons for delay it is not clear exactly what Mr Machirus complains about regarding delay. Since this case has been in the High Court much of the delay has arisen from either Mr Machirus' failure to comply with the Court timetable or his pursuit of unsuccessful pre-appeal applications.

Regarding the claimed $50,000 deduction, the High Court upheld the TRA finding that there was insufficient evidence to sustain such a claim and that the Commissioner's reassessment was correct.

#### Commissioner's Cross–Appeal

Due to the operation of section 27 of the GST Act 1985 the Commissioner's cross-appeal was allowed. The TRA had erred when it treated the failure to notify the GST reassessments as meaning that they were time-barred.

It is clear, therefore, that even assuming that no notice of the reassessment was given to Mr Machirus after 2 October 1995 until 2002, the failure to do so does not invalidate the reassessment.

It was also noted by the Court that:

Although not essential to my decision, there was in any event strong evidence that in fact Mr Machirus knew of the reassessments well before the expiry of the four-year period in 1999.

Ngā whakatau paihere 2009 ki te 2017 Binding rulings 2009 to 2017
=================================================================

This section contains data on the number of draft rulings issued that are counted under the timeliness measures and the average time to complete those draft rulings.  
  
Inland Revenue has introduced new timeliness measures from 1 July 2010. These provide a target for the delivery of 90% of draft rulings (and contrary views) within three months of receipt of an application (qualifying applications), unless the application:

*   raises more than eight legal issues
*   has not had a pre lodgement meeting and that requirement has not been waived, or
*   is an advance pricing agreement.

Applications that do not satisfy one of these three criteria are classified as non-qualifying applications and have a six month delivery timeframe from the date of receipt.  
  
The limitation to eight issues is designed to encourage applicants to focus on the most important issues on which they seek certainty rather than applying for rulings on a large number of "nice to have" matters.  
  
The data for these statistics is available for download from the links at the bottom of the page.

Graph of qualifying binding rulings from 2009 to 2017
-----------------------------------------------------

![This graph has two lines showing the number of qualifying binding rulings versus the average number of months taken to complete them for the period 2009 to 2017.](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/archived-statistics/audit-legal-issues-data/binding-rulings/qualifying-binding-rulings.png?modified=20210204222529)

This graph has two lines showing the number of qualifying binding rulings versus the average number of months taken to complete them for the period 2009 to 2017.  
  
From 2009 to 2017 the:

*   number of qualifying binding rulings cases has increased from 67 to 77 (up 15%)
*   average time taken (in months) to complete the qualifying binding rulings has decreased from 2.7 months to 1.6 months (down 42%).

Graph of non-qualifying binding rulings from 2009 to 2017
---------------------------------------------------------

![This graph has two lines showing the number of non-qualifying binding rulings versus the average number of months taken to complete them for the period 2009 to 2017.](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/archived-statistics/audit-legal-issues-data/binding-rulings/non-qualifying-binding-rulings.png?modified=20210204222059)

This graph has two lines showing the number of non-qualifying binding rulings versus the average number of months taken to complete them for the period 2009 to 2017.  
  
In 2017 there were 19 non-qualifying binding rulings cases, reverting to what it was in 2009.  
  
From 2009 to 2017 the average time taken to complete non-qualifying binding rulings has reduced by 86% (from 9.5 months to 1.3 months).

### Note: 

Average time to complete rulings refers to the time (in months) between the date of receipt of the application, and the date the draft ruling is issued. It does not include the:

*   time between when the fee estimate was sent to taxpayer and the date fee estimate was accepted by the taxpayer, or

Black hole expenditure
======================

2014 amendments relating to 'black hole' business expenditure for which taxpayers were previously not allowed immediate tax deduction or depreciation over time.

#### _Sections CG 7B, DB 19, DB 37, DB 40BA, DB 63 to DB 63C, EE 25, EE 57 and schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007_ 

Several amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to business expenditure for which taxpayers were previously allowed neither an immediate tax deduction, nor depreciation over time. Such expenditure is commonly referred to as "black hole" expenditure. The two broad areas of black hole expenditure addressed are: expenditure towards applying for resource consents, patents and plant variety rights, and various company administration costs. The changes were part of changes announced in Budget 2013.

### Background

#### _Applications for resource consents, patents and plant variety rights_

Sections DB 19 and DB 37 previously required a taxpayer to have lodged an application for the grant of a resource consent or a patent in order to obtain a deduction for capital expenditure that failed to give rise to a depreciable asset. A taxpayer who incurred capital expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of a resource consent or a patent but did not lodge the application could not receive a deduction for that expenditure. If expenditure would have been depreciable if the intangible asset had been obtained, making this expenditure deductible when it fails to give rise to a depreciable asset improves the symmetry between the tax treatment of successful and unsuccessful expenditure, and reduces distortions against investment in these assets.

Additionally, a deduction was not allowed for expenditure incurred on an application for a resource consent, if the resource consent was granted but not used before it lapsed or was surrendered. This could happen if its conditions were not met or the resource consent was not exercised. This result was inappropriate, as the situation is economically identical to that when a resource consent is refused, withdrawn or not lodged.

Similarly, a taxpayer who incurred capital expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of plant variety rights was unable to deduct that expenditure when the plant variety rights were not granted, as there was no equivalent provision to section DB 19 or DB 37 for plant variety rights. As this expenditure would have been depreciable if the plant variety rights had been obtained, making this expenditure deductible when it fails to give rise to a depreciable asset improves the symmetry between the tax treatment of successful and unsuccessful expenditure.

#### _Claw-back for subsequent applications or disposals_

After taking a deduction for expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of a resource consent, a patent or plant variety rights, a taxpayer may use or sell some or all of that application property at a later date. In the case of selling application property, the taxpayer will have conceptually derived income. A claw-back provision was therefore considered necessary to preserve a neutral tax treatment, otherwise taxpayers could receive a deduction that is larger than the loss they have suffered.

The tax treatment of expenditure on application property from an aborted or unsuccessful application that is later used in a successful application and expenditure on a first-time successful application should be neutral. In other words, expenditure on a depreciable intangible asset should be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset; that certain expenditure did not create a depreciable asset in the first instance does not change the fact that the expenditure has ultimately created depreciable intangible property. Continuing to allow an immediate deduction for such expenditure would not be a neutral tax treatment. Including a claw-back provision ensures that taxpayers do not receive a timing advantage from immediately deducting expenditure on initially unsuccessful, but ultimately successful, application property instead of spreading depreciation deductions over its estimated useful life.

#### _Company administration costs_

The dividend payment process involves authorising, allocating and paying the dividend, as well as addressing any disputes arising over its allocation. Expenditure incurred during this process is a mixture of capital and revenue. However, requiring taxpayers to separately track or apportion this expenditure into its deductible and non-deductible constituent parts could result in disproportionate compliance costs and uncertainty for taxpayers.

Listed companies incur expenditure on an annual listing fee to maintain registration on a recognised stock exchange. Allowing this expenditure to be deductible recognises that its benefit persists for one year only, and is a necessary expense for a listed company.

Annual general meetings (AGMs) are an annual, recurring cost of doing business as a company, while special shareholder meetings are often held to consider a material change in the business of the company. Allowing a deduction for AGM costs while denying a deduction for special shareholder meeting costs ensures that taxpayers are not subject to disproportionate compliance costs or uncertainty over the tax treatment of shareholder meeting costs, and reflects the capital-revenue principles.

#### _Fixed-life resource consents_

Depreciation is appropriate for resource consents if they have a fixed life after which they have no economic value. Resource consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) to do something that would otherwise contravene section 15A or 15B of the RMA have a fixed life of between five and 35 years. Adding these resource consents to schedule 14, which lists items of depreciable intangible property, brings their tax treatment into line with other fixed-life resource consents.

**Key features**

*   An amendment to section DB 19 removes the requirement for a taxpayer to have lodged an application for the grant of a resource consent before capital expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful resource consent application can be deducted. The amendment also extends deductibility to situations where a taxpayer obtains the grant of a resource consent, but does not use the resource consent before it lapses or is surrendered.
*   An amendment to section DB 37 removes the requirement for a taxpayer to have lodged an application for the grant of a patent before capital expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful patent application can be deducted.
*   New section DB 40BA allows a taxpayer a deduction for capital expenditure they have incurred for the purpose of applying for the grant of plant variety rights, if they do not obtain the plant variety rights because the application is not lodged or is withdrawn, or because the grant is refused.
*   New section CG 7B claws back as income, deductions that have been taken for an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of a resource consent, a patent or plant variety rights, if the taxpayer subsequently sells or uses the abandoned application property. In the latter case, amendments to sections EE 25 and EE 57 ensure that these costs are included as part of the cost of the new intangible asset for depreciation purposes.
*   New section DB 63 allows companies a deduction for all direct costs associated with the payment of a dividend. This does not include the amount of the dividend itself.
*   New section DB 63B allows listed companies a deduction for expenditure incurred on an annual listing fee to maintain registration on a recognised stock exchange.
*   New section DB 63C allows companies a deduction for expenditure incurred to hold an annual general meeting (AGM) of the shareholders of the company, but denies a deduction for expenditure incurred to hold a special or extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the company.
*   An amendment to item 10 in schedule 14 ensures that expenditure incurred on resource consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) to do something that would otherwise contravene section 15A (Restrictions on dumping and incineration of waste or other matter in coastal marine area) or section 15B (Discharge of harmful substances from ships or offshore installations) of the RMA is able to be depreciated over the life of the resource consent.

### Application date

The amendments apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Applications for resource consents, patents and plant variety rights_

An amendment to section DB 19 allows a taxpayer who incurs expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of a resource consent, but does not obtain the grant because the application is not lodged, a deduction for the expenditure they incurred in relation to the intended application. The deduction is allocated to the income year in which the taxpayer decides not to lodge the application.

The amendment to section DB 19 also allows a taxpayer who incurs expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of a resource consent and who obtains the grant, but does not use the resource consent before it lapses or is surrendered, a deduction for the expenditure they incurred in relation to the application. The deduction is allocated to the income year in which the resource consent lapses or is surrendered.

An amendment to section DB 37 allows a taxpayer who incurs expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of a patent, but does not obtain the grant because the application is not lodged, a deduction for the expenditure they incurred in relation to the intended application. The deduction is allocated to the income year in which the taxpayer decides not to lodge the application.

New section DB 40BA allows a taxpayer who incurs expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of plant variety rights, but does not obtain the grant because the application is not lodged or is withdrawn, or because the grant is refused, a deduction for the expenditure they incurred in relation to the application or intended application. The deduction is allocated to the income year in which the taxpayer decides not to lodge the application, withdraws the application, or is refused the grant of plant variety rights.

#### _Claw-back for subsequent applications or disposals_

New section CG 7B is a claw-back provision which applies when a taxpayer:

*   has taken a deduction under section DB 19 or DB 37 or new section DB 40BA (for expenditure on an aborted or unsuccessful resource consent, patent or plant variety rights application), and subsequently derives consideration for the disposal of property acquired as a result of the expenditure on the intended, withdrawn or unsuccessful application; or
*   has taken a deduction under section DB 19 for expenditure on:
    *   an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of a resource consent; or
    *   a resource consent that is granted but is not used before it lapses or is surrendered,

*   and subsequently uses property acquired as a result of the expenditure in obtaining the grant of a resource consent; or

*   has taken a deduction under section DB 37 for expenditure on an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of a patent, and subsequently uses property acquired as a result of the expenditure in the lodging of a patent application with a complete specification; or
*   has taken a deduction under new section DB 40BA for expenditure on an aborted or unsuccessful application for the grant of plant variety rights, and subsequently uses property acquired as a result of the expenditure in obtaining the grant of plant variety rights.

When the taxpayer derives consideration for the disposal, the amount that will be clawed back as income will generally be the lesser of the consideration derived for the disposal and the amount of the deduction that has previously been taken. The exception to this will be when the disposal of the property otherwise gives rise to income under the Income Tax Act 2007, in which case the entire amount of the consideration derived from the disposal will continue to be considered income.

When the taxpayer subsequently uses property in the lodging of a patent application with a complete specification or in obtaining the grant of a resource consent or plant variety rights, the amount that will be clawed back as income will be the total amount of deductions taken for expenditure under section DB 19 or DB 37 or new section DB 40BA (whichever applies) to the extent that the property acquired as a result of the expenditure was subsequently used in the lodging of a patent application or in obtaining the grant of a resource consent or plant variety rights.

An amount clawed back under new section CG 7B is income of the taxpayer in the income year of the disposal (in the case of a disposal for consideration), or in the income year of the lodgement or grant (in the case of subsequent applications).

In the case of subsequent applications, an amount clawed back under new section CG 7B can then be included in the cost base of the resource consent, the patent application (and subsequently the patent if it is granted) or the plant variety rights, and be depreciated over the legal life of the depreciable asset in the usual way.

An amendment to section EE 25 ensures that any expenditure clawed back as income under new section CG 7B is included in the cost of a subsequent plant variety rights application for the purpose of calculating the pro-rated deduction for the cost of a plant variety rights application that a taxpayer is allowed when they are granted plant variety rights.

An amendment to section EE 57 ensures that the "base value" used for the purpose of calculating a depreciable asset's "adjusted tax value" includes any expenditure clawed back as income under new section CG 7B.

#### _Company administration costs_

New section DB 63 allows a company a deduction for expenditure incurred in authorising, allocating, or processing, the payment of a dividend, or resolving a dispute concerning one of these matters. The dividend itself remains non-deductible.

New section DB 63B allows a listed company a deduction for expenditure incurred as periodic fees of a recognised exchange for maintaining the company's registration on the exchange.

New section DB 63C allows a company a deduction for expenditure incurred in holding an annual meeting of the shareholders of the company to consider the affairs of the company, but denies a deduction for expenditure incurred in holding a special or extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the company.

#### _Fixed-life resource consents_

An amendment to item 10 in schedule 14 includes as an item of depreciable intangible property a consent granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) to do something that would otherwise contravene section 15A (Restrictions on dumping and incineration of waste or other matter in coastal marine area) or section 15B (Discharge of harmful substances from ships or offshore installations) of the RMA, if the consent is granted in or after the 2014–15 income year.

Bloodstock write-down rates
===========================

2006 legislation amends the bloodstock write-down rates relating to stallions and broodmares.

### Sections EC 39, EC 40, EC 41, EC 42, EZ 4B and EC 4C of the Income Tax Act 2004

Write-down rates have been increased for stallions not previously used for breeding in New Zealand and for broodmares. Stallions not previously used for breeding in New Zealand will be written down over two years under the straight-line method, and the diminishing value rate will be 75%. Broodmares will be written down over varying periods depending on the age of the mare when first bought or brought into breeding, with older brood mares (aged eight or over when first used for breeding) written off in full in one year. These write-down rates will apply to bloodstock bought or brought into breeding on or after 1 August 2006.

### Background

Stallions not previously used for breeding in New Zealand were previously written down over four years under the straight-line method, or at a diminishing value rate of 37.5%. Broodmares were previously written down over varying periods depending on the age of the broodmare when first brought into breeding. The effect was to write down broodmares not previously used for breeding in New Zealand over a maximum of eight years and a minimum of three years, and for broodmares previously used for breeding in New Zealand, a maximum of nine years and a minimum of three years.

### Key features

The new write-down rates for bloodstock are in sections EC 41 and EC 42. Write-down rules for bloodstock that was bought or brought into breeding before 1 August 2006 are contained in new sections EZ 4B and EZ 4C. The effect is to transfer the old rules for bloodstock writedowns to a Terminating Provisions subpart of the Income Tax Act 2004, and to allow the new write-down rules to be used only for bloodstock brought into breeding on or after 1 August 2006.

Section EC 41 applies to bloodstock not previously used for breeding in New Zealand. Section EC 41(2) sets the annual reduction for stallions at 50% of the cost price of the stallion, unless the stallion is valued by the reducing value method. Section EC 41(3) sets the reducing value rate at 75%. The annual reduction for stallions previously used for breeding in New Zealand is set in section EC 41(1) at 20% of cost price.

The formula for broodmares not previously used for breeding in New Zealand is in section EC 41(6). The formula generates the annual amount to be used for writing down the broodmares to which it applies:

|     |
| --- |
| 1.25 x cost price of broodmare |
| 9 – age of broodmare |

The age to be used in the formula is set in section EC 41(7). It is the age of the broodmare when first used for breeding, or if the broodmare is eight years of age or older, then the "age of broodmare" is set at eight.

The effect of this formula is to write down broodmares over a maximum of six years (for broodmares who begin breeding at age two), with broodmares aged eight and older written down in full in the year they are first used for breeding.

The formula for broodmares which have previously been used for breeding in New Zealand is in section EC 42(4). The formula generates the annual amount to be used for writing down the broodmares to which it applies:

|     |
| --- |
| cost price of broodmare |
| 9 - age of broodmare |

The age to be used in the formula is set in section EC 42(5). It is the age of the broodmare when it is first used for breeding, or if the broodmare is eight years of age or older, then the "age of broodmare" is set at eight.

The effect of this formula is to write down broodmares which have previously been used for breeding in New Zealand over a maximum of seven years (for broodmares who begin breeding at age two), with broodmares aged eight and older written down in full in the year they are first used for breeding.

Sections EZ 4B and EZ 4C contain the rules for writing down bloodstock that was brought into breeding before 1 August 2006. These rules have not changed. Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 14, No. 11 (November 2002) contains an explanation of these rules.

### Application date

The new rules apply to bloodstock brought into breeding on or after 1 August 2006.

[Student Loan Scheme Act 2011](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-act-2011 "Student Loan Scheme Act 2011")

Borrower's repayment obligations
================================

2011 amendment to the Student Loan Scheme Act changes the assessment for salary and wage earners from an annual to a pay-period basis.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Important |     |
| Some of this law has subsequently changed and this is not the current position.<br><br>[Read "Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013" for the current legislative position](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-amendment-act-2013) |     |

**_Sections 30-117, 221 and schedules 2, 3, 4 and 7_**

The basis of assessment for salary and wage earners has been changed from an annual basis with an end-of-year assessment, to a pay-period basis. This means student loan deductions from salary and wages will be considered correct each pay day, unless there has been a significant over- or under-deduction.

### **Background**

Currently, the same repayment obligations apply to all New Zealand-based borrowers. That is, the repayment obligation is 10% of the borrower's annual net income if it exceeds the current repayment threshold of $19,084.

The majority of borrowers who receive salary and wages only are required to file an end-of-year personal tax summary to square-up their repayment obligations for the year. The annual basis of assessment ensures accuracy of repayments only at the end of the year. There is no incentive to encourage correct deductions to be made during the year.

Changing from an annual basis of assessment to a pay-period basis for salary and wage deductions removes the requirement for salary and wage earners to file an end-of-year return and reduces compliance costs for the majority of borrowers. It will also enable Inland Revenue to shift resources from undertaking the end-of-year assessment and collecting large debts to ensuring deductions made during the year are correct, providing higher value services to borrowers.

### **Key features**

The Act changes the way New Zealand-based borrowers repay their loans by providing different repayment obligations for different classes of New Zealand-based borrowers as follows:

*   For borrowers with salary or wages only or salary and wages and pre-taxed income, the repayment obligation on their salary and wages will be determined on a pay-period basis.
*   For borrowers with pre-taxed income (which is defined as income from interest, dividends, taxable Māori authority distributions, or salary or wages from employment as a casual agricultural employee or as an election-day worker) or salary and wages and pre-taxed income only, the repayment obligations on their pre-taxed income will be determined on an annual basis and will apply when this income exceeds $1,500.
*   For borrowers with other income (income other than from salary or wages and pre-taxed income) the repayment obligation on the borrower's taxable income (including salary and wages, pre-taxed income, and other income) will be determined on an annual basis.

The Act simplifies the loan repayment process by removing the current annual assessment for the vast majority of borrowers whose income is from salary and wages only. Repayment deductions from salary and wages will be determined on a pay-period basis. That is, deductions made on a pay-period basis will be the borrower's repayment obligation, provided the employer has not made a significant under- or over-deduction. This will provide greater certainty for borrowers about their repayment obligations.

A separate loan repayment mechanism is provided for borrowers who have pre-taxed income. These borrowers will now be required to make a declaration of their pre-taxed income rather than the annual return as previously. The new legislation sets out how and when their repayment obligation must be paid.

Borrowers with business or other income will be required to file an end-of-year return to determine their other-income repayment obligations. The new legislation sets out how and when their repayment obligation must be paid, including the requirement to make interim payments during the year.

The current interim payment rules will continue to apply to borrowers with pre-taxed income and borrowers with other income. These rules require borrowers to pay their repayment obligation for the year in instalments during the year, similar to the way provisional tax operates.

Also, the current terminal payment will be replaced with remaining repayments due on the same dates as interim payments. Remaining repayments are discussed later in this bulletin.

Overseas-based borrowers will continue to have a repayment obligation of $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000, depending on their loan balance. These borrowers will continue to be required to make repayments in two equal instalments, on 30 September and 31 March.

### **Application dates**

The provisions that deal with special assessments issued to borrowers with salary or wage income to recoup a significant under-deduction and the changes to enable six-monthly interim payments to be made when borrowers pay provisional tax six-monthly, apply from 1 April 2013.

Applications for special deduction rates for unused thresholds and declarations for full-time study exemptions and requests for borrower deductions to be made from salary and wages apply from 1 March 2012. This enables deduction rate certificates and exemptions, and borrower-requested deductions to be in place for a 1 April 2012 commencement of salary and wage deductions.

The remaining changes apply from 1 April 2012.

### **Detailed analysis**

New Zealand-based borrowers will be required to make repayments from salary and wage income, pre-taxed income, and other income.

**_Repayments from salary and wages_**

_Repayment codes_

New Zealand-based borrowers are required to have repayment deductions made from their salary and wage income. They are required to apply one of the following repayment codes to their salary or wages to enable repayment deductions to be made at the correct rate:

*   SL - this is the standard code when deductions are made at the rate of 10 cents in the dollar on income above the pay-period repayment threshold (annual repayment threshold is $19,084/number of pay days per year); or
*   STC - this code is applied if a reduced deduction is required to be made and the borrower has applied to the Commissioner for a reduced rate. Reduced rates are available to a borrower when there is an unused repayment threshold from their primary job which can be used to reduce their deductions from their secondary job, if the borrower is in hardship, or when repayment deductions are reduced to take account of a business loss.
*   SLBOR and SLCIR − these codes apply in cases where the employer is instructed to make additional deductions from a borrower's salary or wages by either the borrower or the Commissioner.

The SLCIR code is applied when the borrower is required to make additional deductions to repay a previous significant under-deduction which arose in either the current year or a prior year.

The SLBOR code is applied when the borrower wishes to make additional repayments to count towards qualifying for the 10% excess repayment bonus. The application of this tax code enables these additional payments to be identified so they are not included in the borrower's standard repayment deductions for the pay-period.

_Significant under- and over-deductions_

Standard deductions made from a borrower's salary or wages are considered correct and final unless there is a significant under-or over-deduction. The Commissioner will determine the threshold for what is a significant over-deduction or a significant under-deduction, having regard to the resources available to the Commissioner and the need to maintain the integrity of the student loan scheme. The Commissioner must inform borrowers on or before 31 March of the significant over-deduction threshold that will apply for the following tax year.

When an error is made in the collection of standard repayment deductions from salary or wages, and the amount is considered to be a significant under-deduction or over-deduction, the borrower will either receive a refund or be required to repay the under-deduction.

There are two mechanisms available to recoup a significant under-deduction, either by way of a special deduction rate (SLCIR) from future salary or wages or by the Commissioner issuing a special assessment with a due date (at least 30 days after the date of the assessment notice) for the repayment of the under-deduction.

Significant over-deductions may be refunded or the borrower can choose to leave the over-payment against their loan to be considered as an excess repayment. Excess repayments are outlined later in this commentary.

If a borrower has been over-deducted or under-deducted but the amount does not exceed the significant threshold amount, the borrower's deduction will be considered to be correct and final and the amount will not be refunded or collected.

_Unused repayment threshold_

Borrowers with two or more jobs who estimate that the income from their main job for a three-month period will be below the repayment threshold for that period, can apply to the Commissioner to have the unused repayment threshold applied against their second job. The Commissioner will calculate the special deduction rate that should apply to the borrower's secondary job and issue a special deduction-rate certificate code to the borrower for the borrower to give to their employer.

The borrower will be required to review their estimate each quarter and advise Inland Revenue if any of the information or circumstances on which the special deduction rate is based change.

_Full-time study exemption_

Borrowers who study full-time but also work and earn under the annual repayment threshold can apply for a repayment exemption. This exemption ensures students are not disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of the pay-period basis of assessment where, but for the exemption, students would be required to make repayments if their earnings are above the pay-period threshold.

To qualify for the exemption, borrowers must:

*   be engaged in a full-time study workload, being a programme of study which is 32 weeks or longer in a year and the study is at least 0.8 of equivalent full-time student units; or
*   a period of at least 12 weeks or longer in a year and the study is at least 0.3 of equivalent full-time student units.

The exemption period commences when a borrower has a loan advance and continues while the borrower is undertaking a programme of study. The exemption period will not be broken by holiday periods between semesters provided there has been at least one semester of study completed and the holiday period does not exceed 15 weeks over the Christmas holiday period or three weeks for any other holiday period.

The exemption does not apply if the borrower has other income (income other than salary or wage or pre-taxed income).

Also, generally the PAYE rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to student loan deductions, and these deductions are in addition to PAYE deductions for income tax.

**_Pre-taxed income and other income repayment obligations_**

_Repayment obligations on pre-taxed income_

Pre-taxed income is income that is not required to have student loan deductions made from it. If a borrower has income other than salary or wages and pre-taxed income, such as business income, they are an "other-income" borrower and are not required to comply with the pre-taxed repayment obligations.

For borrowers who derive solely pre-taxed income or salary and wages, and pre-taxed income, they will only have a pre-taxed income repayment obligation if the net pre-taxed income is $1,500 or more and their total income is above the annual repayment threshold.

A borrower's net pre-taxed income is their total pre-taxed income less the borrower's allowable expenses for the year. Borrowers will be required to make an annual declaration of their pre-taxed income. The declaration must be made by 7 July following the end of the tax year, or another date specified by the Commissioner where the borrower has requested an extension to file the declaration or the Commissioner considers it appropriate.

The Commissioner will determine the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation once the borrower files the declaration.

The calculation used to determine a borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation depends on whether their annual salary or wage income exceeds the annual repayment threshold.

If the borrower's annual salary and wage income is less than the annual repayment threshold, the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation is determined by the following formula:

a = b x (c − d)

where:  
**a** is the amount of the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation  
**b** is the repayment percentage (currently 10%)  
**c** is the sum of the borrower's net pre-taxed income (gross pre-taxed income less allowable expenses) and salary and wage income for the tax year  
**d** is the annual repayment threshold (currently $19,084).

If the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation is zero or negative, the borrower will have no pre-taxed repayment obligation for the year.

If the borrower's annual salary and wage income is equal to or greater than the annual repayment threshold, the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation is determined by the following formula:

a = b x c

where:  
**a** is the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation  
**b** is the repayment percentage (currently 10%)  
**c** is the borrower's net pre-taxed income (gross pre-taxed income less allowable expenses).

The Commissioner will notify the borrower of their pre-taxed repayment obligation and the requirement for the borrower to make interim payments for the following year. These rules are outlined below under "Interim payment obligations".

_Other income repayments_

Borrowers with other income (defined as income other than salary or wages and pre-taxed income) will be required to make student loan repayments based on their net income. A borrower's net income is defined as their annual gross income less annual total deductions. If a borrower's net income is less than the annual repayment threshold (currently $19,084), the borrower has no other income repayment obligation.

If the borrower's net income is above the annual repayment threshold and they have other income they will be required to file either a return at the end of the year (for New Zealand-based borrowers) or a declaration of details for New Zealand-based borrowers who are non-resident, outlining their annual gross income and their annual total deductions in order to determine the borrower's net income. Once the return or declaration is filed, the Commissioner must assess the borrower's other income repayment obligation for the year and advise them of the amount of their other income repayment obligation and the due dates on or before which the amount must be repaid.

A borrower's other income repayment obligation for a tax year is determined using the following formula:

a = (b x (c \- d)) \- e

where:  
**a** is the amount of the borrower's other income repayment obligation  
**b** is the repayment percentage (currently 10%)  
**c** is the borrower's net income for the year  
**d** is the annual repayment threshold (currently $19,084)  
**e** is the standard deduction made from the borrower's salary and wages derived during the year.

However, if the "other income" repayment obligation determined by the formula is zero or negative, the borrower will have no other income repayment obligation for the year.

_Remaining repayments_

If the borrower's interim payments made during the year do not fully satisfy the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation or the borrower's other "income repayment" obligation (as applicable) for the year, the difference is the borrower's "remaining repayments".

A borrower's remaining repayment due dates are determined as follows:

*   For borrowers whose pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation for the year is less than $1,000, the total remaining repayment is due in one instalment. The due date for the remaining repayment will be the interim payment date that immediately follows the date for filing the borrower's pre-taxed declaration, return of income, or details of annual gross income for New Zealand-based non-residents (as applicable).
*   For borrowers whose pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation is $1,000 or more but less than $16,000, and who do not estimate their repayment obligation, the remaining repayments are due on the interim payment dates for the following tax year, that occur after the date the borrower is required to file their pre-taxed declaration or return of income. For example, a borrower with other income is required to file a return for the 2012-13 year on 7 July 2013 is required to pay remaining repayments in relation to their other income repayment obligation on the three interim payment dates that occur after the date the borrower was required to file a return of income (7 July 2013), being 28 August 2013, 15 January 2014 and 7 May 2014.
*   Where the borrower's pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation is $16,000 or more, or their pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation is $1,000 or more and they estimated their pre-taxed or other income repayment obligation, the remaining repayments are due on the interim payment dates for the same tax year that the declaration or return of income relates to. The effect of this is to impose late payment interest on borrowers who pay less than their repayment obligation during the year. For example, a borrower with other income who is required to file a return for the 2012-13 year on 7 July 2013 will have remaining repayments in relation to their other income repayment obligation due on the three interim payment dates during the 2012-13 year being 28 August 2012, 15 January 2013 and 7 May 2013.

_Interim payment obligations_

Borrowers with either a pre-taxed repayment obligation or another income repayment obligation will be required to pay interim payments during the year in the same manner as provisional tax with payments due on the three standard provisional tax dates.[1](#1)
 For example, if a borrower has a March balance date, payments would be due on 28 August, 15 January and 7 May.

The following exceptions apply when a borrower has other income and they pay provisional tax:

*   On a six-monthly basis: the borrower would pay their interim payments on the three standard provisional tax dates. For a March balance date borrower, these are 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. This rule will change from 1 April 2014.
*   Using the GST ratio method, the borrower's interim payments will be due on the three standard provisional tax dates.

### **Changes from 1 April 2013**

From 1 April 2013, borrowers who account for provisional tax on a six-monthly basis will be required to pay interim payments on the same two dates as they pay provisional tax. For a March balance date borrower, this will be 28 October and 7 May.

As with provisional tax, borrowers can choose between two methods to calculate interim payments for student loan purposes: the standard method or an estimation of their liability.

**_Standard method_**

Borrowers who use the standard method to calculate their interim payments are required to uplift their prior year's pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation by 5%. If the borrower has not filed their prior year's pre-taxed declaration or other income return, their interim payments will be based on their repayment obligation for the prior year uplifted by 10%. If a borrower's uplifted pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation is less than $16,000, the amount of each interim payment is determined by the following formula:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a   | \=  | b   | x   | c   | \-  | e   |
| d   |

where:  
**a** is the amount of the borrower's interim payment  
**b** is the amount of the borrower's uplifted pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation  
**c** is the number reflecting which of the interim payments is being calculated (eg, first, second or third)  
**d** is the total number of interim payment due dates the borrower has for the tax year  
**e** is the total of interim payments that were previously due.

**Example**  
A borrower with a March balance date who has an other income repayment obligation for the 2013-14 tax year, uses the standard method to calculate their interim payments. As they have not filed their 2012-13 return of income, their other income repayment obligation for the 2011-12 tax year ($9,000) will be uplifted by 10% to determine their interim payments for the 2013-14 tax year. Their interim payments are calculated as follows:

_First interim payment_

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \=  | ($9,000 x 110%) x 1 | \-  | 0   |
| 3   |

 = $3,300 which is due on 28 August 2013 and is paid on that date

If the borrower then files their 2012-13 return of income on 17 September 2013, and their other income repayment obligation for that year is $11,428.6, the second interim payment will be calculated as follows:

_Second interim payment_

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \=  | ($11,428.6 x 105%) x 2 | \-  | $3,300 |
| 3   |

 = $4,700 which is due on 15 January 2014 and is paid on that date

This calculation is repeated for the final interim payment, giving an amount due of $4,000 on 7 May 2014.

If the borrower's interim payment is not divisible into equal amounts, the final interim payment makes up any difference.

If the borrower's uplifted pre-taxed repayment obligation or uplifted other income repayment obligation exceeds the borrower's loan balance at the beginning of the year plus any loan advances made, the uplifted repayment obligation will be reduced accordingly.

**_Estimation method (including borrowers whose uplifted repayment obligation is $16,000 or more)_**

Borrowers whose pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation is $1,000 or more, and who estimated their pre-taxed repayment obligation or other income repayment obligation or their uplifted repayment is $16,000 or more, will determine their interim payments by dividing their estimated repayment obligation (or uplifted repayment obligation) by the number of interim payment due dates for the year.

**Example**  
A borrower with a March balance date, and who is required to make three interim payments for the 2013-14 tax year estimates that their other income repayment obligation for the year will be $9,000. Their interim payments will be calculated as follows:

_Interim payment_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \=  | $9,000 |
| 3   |

 = 3,000

This amount will be payable on 28 August 2013, 15 January 2014 and 7 May 2014. If the borrower makes another estimate of their other income repayment obligation, the above calculation is performed for the remaining interim payment dates following the date of the new estimate.

**_Special deduction rate certificate for lower repayment obligation_**

If a borrower derives other income and salary and wages in a tax year, and considers that their standard deductions from salary or wages will exceed their repayment obligations for the year, they can apply to the Commissioner for a special deduction rate certificate to apply a lower deduction rate to their salary or wages.

If the Commissioner accepts the application, the Commissioner will issue the borrower with a special deduction rate certificate, specifying the lower deduction rate and the period the rate applies for. The borrower will be required to provide the certificate to their employer. The certificate will cease when either the period outlined on the certificate is exceeded or the borrower or Commissioner withdraws the certificate by advising the employer accordingly.

**_Extensions of time to file a declaration of pre-taxed income_**

With the introduction of the requirement to file a declaration of pre-taxed income, a new provision has been introduced to enable the borrower to apply (in a manner acceptable to the Commissioner) for an extension of time to file the declaration. The Commissioner also has the ability to provide borrowers with an extension of time to file a declaration without the borrower requesting such an extension.

**_Overseas-based borrowers' repayment obligations_**

The current repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers continue in this Act. That is, a borrower's repayment obligation is either $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000, depending on their loan balance. These borrowers will continue to be required to make repayments in two equal instalments, on 30 September and 31 March.

Under the new provisions, the repayment obligations of overseas-based borrowers ($1,000, $2,000 or $3,000) and repayment thresholds ($1,000, $15,000 and $30,000) can be changed by Order in Council rather than by primary legislation. This ensures consistency with the way changes can be made to the annual repayment threshold and the repayment percentage that applies to New Zealand-based borrowers.

Changes have also been made to the definitions of "consolidated loan balance" and "loan balance" to ensure overseas-based borrowers' repayment obligations reflect adjustments to the loan balance at 31 March, including any administration fee charged, but excluding the excess repayment bonus. This gives effect to the original policy intent.

* * *

1 When a borrower is in a transitional year (due to changing their balance date), the interim payment dates are the same dates as the provisional tax dates for that transitional year. The exception is when the borrower only has one payment date or when there is an odd number of payment dates.
\[UNCLASSIFIED\] RULINGS > PRODUCT TSP Finance Limited Partnership Issued: 21 December 2022 BR Prd 22/15 This Ruling applies in relation to the IFF Funding and Administration Agreement (the Agreement) entered into by the Tauranga City Council (the Council) and TSP Finance Limited Partnership (FSPV). Under the Agreement, the Council will collect a levy from local ratepayers on behalf of FSPV, as authorised by the Infrastructure Funding and Financing (Western Bay of Plenty Transport System Plan Levy) Order 2022. START DATE – END DATE 6 December 2022 – 30 June 2055 (THIS TITLE PAGE DOES NOT FORM PART OF THE RULING.) BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 1 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Product Ruling – BR Prd 22/15 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by TSP Finance Limited Partnership. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of:  the definition of “interest” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and  ss 5(7F), 9 and 60(1B) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the IFF Funding and Administration Agreement (the Agreement) entered into by the Tauranga City Council (the Council) and TSP Finance Limited Partnership (FSPV) on 30 November 2022. The Agreement provides for two matters:  FSPV providing grant funding to the Council for transport system projects located in Tauranga (the Projects); and  the Council agreeing to collect a levy from local ratepayers for FSPV to use to service the senior debt finance it raised for the purposes of the Projects. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1) The Western Bay of Plenty Transport System Plan (the System Plan) comprises a series of 72 individual transport projects. Together, those projects are designed to better connect the Western Bay of Plenty region and enable Tauranga City to become a more liveable and carbon-efficient city. 2) The Projects comprise 13 specific transport system projects located in Tauranga, each of which forms part of the broader System Plan. Each of the Projects may be partially funded and financed under the Infrastructure Funding and Financing Act 2020 (the IFFA). BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 2 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3) The Council issued a levy proposal under the IFFA in respect of the Projects. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, as recommender under the IFFA, reviewed the levy proposal and provided a recommendation report to the responsible Minister. The responsible Minister recommended authorising a levy order in respect of the Projects. 4) On 28 November 2022 the Infrastructure Funding and Financing (Western Bay of Plenty Transport System Plan Levy) Order (the Levy Order) was made by Order in Council. Under the Levy Order FSPV is the “responsible SPV” referred to in the IFFA for the purposes of the Levy. 5) FSPV is a limited partnership under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. The sole limited partner of FSPV is CIP (IFF Holdings) Limited (the Limited Partner). The general partner is TSP Finance GP Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CIP. CIP and its wholly owned subsidiaries are “public purpose Crown-controlled companies” (as defined in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). FSPV and the Limited Partner use IFRS (as defined in s YA 1) to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. 6) FSPV was incorporated to structure, procure and draw down debt and equity finance for the Projects. FSPV will service the senior debt finance it raised for the purposes of the Projects through a levy the Council collects on FSPV’s behalf. IFF Funding and Administration Agreement 7) The two main purposes of the Agreement are to:  set out the process under which FSPV will provide funding to the Council to finance the Council’s construction of the Projects; and  operate as the “levy administration agreement” contemplated by s 55 of the IFFA, describing how the Levy will be collected. Funding Agreement 8) FSPV will disburse funding for the Projects to the Council by making Drawdowns on each Quarter Date, capped in total at the Maximum Funding Amount (cl 5.1 of the Agreement). The Maximum Funding Amount is defined in cl 1.1 as the lesser of $200,000,000 and the amount set out in a specific cell of the Financial Model as at Financial Close (in each case, excluding GST). 9) Other than in relation to the first Drawdown, the Council must provide a Drawdown Request at least 10 business days prior to each Quarter Date on which it wishes to BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 3 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] receive a Drawdown. The Drawdown Request must specify the amount of the Drawdown requested and certify (cl 5.2 of the Agreement): (a) the Drawdown (when aggregated with all previous Drawdowns) does not exceed the cumulative amount specified for the First Drawdown Date or the relevant Quarter Date in Schedule 3 (Drawdown Profile) (disregarding for the purpose of clause 6.1(c) any amounts previously drawn down but repaid by Council under clause 6.1(b)); (b) the Drawdown will be applied to reimburse expenditure on Eligible Costs in respect of some or all of the Projects (including reasonable particulars of these costs and their split across Projects) where Council has not sourced and does not intend to source funding from any third party to meet such Eligible Costs; (c) where any part of the Drawdown will be applied towards Eligible Costs in relation to a Capped Funding Project, the cap on Eligible Costs for that Project, as set out in Schedule 1, has not been exceeded and will not be exceeded from the proceeds of the Drawdown; and (d) the application of the Drawdown towards the Eligible Costs for any Project will not breach the requirements of clause 5.5. 10) The Council will be solely responsible for meeting the funding required for any Project, without recourse to FSPV, to the extent that (cl 5.4(a) of the Agreement):  the relevant project is not fully funded after the Maximum Funding Amount is drawn down under the Agreement; and/or  in the case of a Capped Funding Project, Drawdowns applied towards the Eligible Costs of that Project have reached the cap specified. 11) The parties also acknowledge (cl 5.4(b) of the Agreement) that it is the Council’s decision as to which of the projects a Drawdown will fund, and that the Council is able to apply for additional sources of funding for the Projects. At least ten percent of the estimated total cost of each Project must come from external sources (cl 5.5), other than in situations where the Council has:  included the Project in its then applicable long term plan; or  passed a resolution noting the Project is in the best interests of ratepayers. 12) The Drawdowns the FSPV provides to the Council will comprise grant funding and are not repayable by the Council in any circumstances (cl 6.1(a) of the Agreement). However, the Council must apply Drawdowns solely to the Eligible Costs of the Projects (subject to any relevant caps for Capped Cost Projects). If the Council applies the Drawdowns for any other purpose they will be repayable by the Council to FSPV on BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 4 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] demand with interest (cl 6.1(b) of the Agreement). The Council and FSPV agree that a Drawdown Request issued by Council will constitute a tax invoice, or taxable supply information, as applicable, at such time that FSPV accepts the Drawdown Request in full (cl 6.2(b) of the Agreement). Levy administration and collection 13) FSPV appoints the Council as the exclusive agent of FSPV for the purpose of carrying out or undertaking the levy collection and enforcement services (cl 7.1 of the Agreement). The Council accepts that appointment and agrees that it must perform those services until the appointment expires or is terminated (cl 7.2 of the Agreement). No fee is payable by FSPV to the Council for undertaking these services (cl 7.4 of the Agreement). 14) The Levy Payments are set in accordance with the Levy Order and are based on a resolution by FSPV that sets an Annual Levy under s 45 or 50 of the IFFA. In order to assess the Levy Payments that each Levypayer will pay in each year, the Council will provide FSPV with all ratings information from its Ratings Information Database that FSPV requests (cl 8.1 of the Agreement). 15) The Council must notify the Levypayers of the assessment made either as part of the general rates assessment or, if agreed with FSPV in writing, as a separate notice of assessment. The Council must collect the Levy Payments and deposit all Levy Revenue it receives from Levypayers into the Levy Account by the required dates (cls 8.1 and 8.2 of the Agreement). 16) Clause 8.3 of the Agreement relates to GST on the Levy and states: (a) For the avoidance of doubt, Council and FSPV acknowledge that the underlying supply of the Levy to the Levypayers is a taxable supply subject to GST at the prevailing rate in accordance with section 5(7F) of the GST Act. (b) For GST purposes only, in accordance with section 60(1B) of the GST Act, Council and FSPV agree to opt out of the default GST agency rules in section 60 of the GST Act in respect of the Levy amounts that are collected by the Services: (i) FSPV agrees that it will treat the deemed supply under section 60(1B) of the GST Act from itself to Council as a taxable supply for GST purposes; and (ii) Council agrees that it will treat the deemed supply under section 60(1B) of the GST Act between itself and the Levypayers as a taxable supply for GST purposes and will invoice Levy amounts to the Levypayer on this basis. BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 5 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (c) FSPV agrees to issue a tax invoice, or taxable supply information, as applicable, to Council (or Council agrees to generate a buyer created tax invoice/buyer created taxable supply information) in respect of the taxable supply portion of the Levy Revenue. (d) To the extent that supply correction information (GST credit notes or debit notes) is required to be issued under the GST Act in respect of a supply in this Agreement, Council or FSPV as applicable agrees to do so. (e) In the event that the standard rate of tax applied to taxable supplies pursuant to section 8(1) of the GST Act is changed to a rate other than 15%, Council and FSPV agree to take action to endeavour to mitigate any positive or negative effect arising as a result of that tax rate change. (f) In addition to clause 9.2. below, FSPV and Council agree to take all reasonable steps to manage, in a mutually beneficial manner, any GST operational complexities that arise as a result of either FSPV or Council complying with their respective obligations under the GST Act. Such reasonable steps will be agreed between FSPV and Council and recorded in a separate document. (g) All words and phrases in this clause 8.3 have the same meaning as given in the GST Act unless otherwise defined in this Agreement. 17) Where a Ratepayer pays some, but not all, of an invoice for its combined Rates and Levy liability, the Council will first apply the amounts received toward the payment of Rates (cl 8.4 of the Agreement). The Council will impose penalties in addition to any Levy amount that a Levypayer has not been paid, at the same rate as penalties authorised by the Council in relation to unpaid Rates (cl 8.5 of the Agreement). The Council will take action to recover any Levy amounts that have not been paid in a manner consistent with its procedures for collecting unpaid Rates (cl 8.6 of the Agreement). In addition, FSPV may start legal proceedings against a Levypayer to recover as a debt due any Levy amount that remains unpaid for four months after the due date for payment (cl 11(a) of the Agreement). In certain situations, FSPV can write off a Levy Amount under s 79A of the IFFA, which will involve the debt being written off as bad in FSPV’s accounts. 18) The Council has no liability to FSPV to pay any Levy Amount to FSPV except to the extent the Council has received that Levy Amount from a Levypayer (cl 8.9 of the Agreement). BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 6 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Crown Support Deed 19) FSPV sought credit support from the Crown in order to provide comfort to lenders that any relevant legal or regulatory change that has the effect of reducing the Levy revenue would not impact on FSPV’s ability to collect revenue to repay the bank loans. 20) The Crown agreed to provide FSPV with credit support on the terms set out in the Crown Support Deed. FSPV and The Sovereign in right of New Zealand, acting by and through the Minister of Finance entered into the Crown Support Deed on 1 December 2022. The Crown Support Deed provides FSPV with a Crown guarantee in three situations:  a “Crown Support Event”, where a law change (including a judicial review of the Order in Council) has the effect of reducing the total Levy that FSPV would otherwise be legally entitled to impose in any Levy Year (i.e. the relevant rating period) (cl 2.1 of the Crown Support Deed);  a “Terminal Event”, where, following a Crown Support Event, the Crown fails to pay any amount under the Crown Support Deed by no later than ten business days after the last day for payment, or if the Crown elects to treat a Crown Support Event as a Terminal Event (cl 2.2 of the Crown Support Deed); and  where an “Indemnified PML Rebate Amount” arises, being an amount in respect of a refund of Levy by the Council in respect of protected Māori land (as defined in the IFFA), where relevant conditions are satisfied such that it is subject to indemnification by the Crown (cl 2.7 of the Crown Support Deed). 21) When one of these events occurs, and provided that the applicable demand procedures in cl 5 of the Crown Support Deed are followed, the Crown will be required to pay to FSPV the “Indemnified Amount”. The definition of “Indemnified Amount” in cl 1.1 of the Crown Support Deed, provides that the amount the Crown pays will be:  for a Crown Support Event that is not treated as a Terminal Event, the amount of the reduction in Levy that triggered the Crown Support Event (a Shortfall Amount); or  for a Terminal Event, the outstanding balance of the bank funding, together with certain amounts associated with early repayment of the debt and equity; and  in either case, any further costs incurred as a result of the Crown Support Event. BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 7 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Income Tax Act 2007 (a) A payment of the Levy does not include an amount of “interest” (as defined in s YA 1) for the purpose of the RWT rules. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (b) Under ss 5(7F) and 60(1B), the Levy Payments will be treated as being consideration for the following supplies: (i) a supply of goods and services from FSPV to the Council; and (ii) a supply of those goods and services from the Council to the Levypayers, treating the Council as if it was FSPV for the purposes of the supply. (c) In respect of the Levy, the “time of supply” under s 9 for each of the deemed supplies of goods and services (from FSPV to the Council and from the Council to the Levypayers) arising under s 60(1B) will be the earlier of the time that each payment becomes due and the time that the payment is received ( under s 9(3)(a)). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 6 December 2022 and ending on 30 June 2055. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21 st day of December 2022. Howard Davis Group Leader, Tax Counsel Office BR Prd 22/15 | 21 December 2022 Page 8 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] About this document Product Rulings are issued by the Tax Counsel Office and Customer and Compliance Services. Product Rulings set out the Commissioner’s view on how tax laws apply to a particular “product” – which is an arrangement that a specified taxpayer is likely to enter into with a number of people on identical terms. Taxpayers who enter into the arrangement described in a Product Ruling may apply the ruling but are not obliged to do so. Product Rulings are binding on the Commissioner. This means that if you are entitled to apply a Product Ruling and you have calculated your tax liability in accordance with the ruling, the Commissioner must accept that assessment. A Product Ruling applies only to the taxation laws and arrangement set out in the ruling, and only for the period specified in the ruling. It is important to note that a general similarity to an arrangement covered by a Product Ruling will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 04/14 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (“the College”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CB 9(d) of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of the Payments by the College to the Trainees, for the Trainees’ participation in the Course, on terms and conditions that are materially the same as those contained in the following three documents (provided to the Rulings Unit as part of the application for this Ruling): • Postgraduate Rural General Practice Education Programme Terms and Conditions: Revised October 2003. This contains the terms and conditions to be agreed between the College and all Trainees enrolled in the General Practice Educational Programme. • Letter of Appointment of Trainee. This is the letter supplied to the Trainee, by the College, as an agreement of the respective obligations of each party. • Postgraduate Rural General Practice Education Programme Handbook: Revised October 2003. This is the detailed handbook of the terms, conditions, obligations and syllabus of the Course. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The College was formed in 1974, and obtained a Royal Charter in 1979. The mission of the College is to improve the health of all New Zealanders through the provision of high-quality general practice care. 2. The main purpose of the College is to provide post graduate general practice education to qualified doctors. 3. The objects and powers of the College (as set out in clause 5.1 of the 28 September 2002 document entitled “The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners: Rules”) are: 2 (a) To promote in all ways the highest standards in general practice in New Zealand; (b) To sustain and improve the professional competence of members of the medical profession who are engaged in general practice in New Zealand; (c) To encourage, strengthen, and engage in vocational training for general practice; (d) To conduct, direct, encourage, support or provide for continuing education of general practitioners; (e) To encourage and assist in the provision of a high standard of teaching and training for all undergraduate medical students in the field of general practice in New Zealand; (f) To promote activities that encourage the care of members and their families; (g) To encourage and provide for the training of future teachers of general practice; (h) To inform the public in New Zealand about general practice and primary health care issues; (i) To conduct, direct, encourage, support or provide for research in matters relating to general practice; (j) To publish and encourage publication of journals, reports and treatises on matters relating to general practice and allied subjects; (k) To grant diplomas and other certification of proficiency in general practice or any related subject, whether upon examination, thesis, outstanding work or upon other grounds which may be considered sufficient; (l) To establish a register of members of the College and to publish and revise the same from time to time; (m) To acquire, establish, provide and maintain such land and buildings as are deemed necessary and to deal with or dispose of the same with a view to promoting the objects of the College; (n) To acquire and receive property of any kind whether by way of gift, devise, bequest or otherwise howsoever to be applied solely towards the objects of the College provided that no portion thereof shall be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of profit to members of the College, but this shall not prevent a member being reimbursed for professional services; 3 (o) To apply annual dues received from members to defray the expenses of the College, and for such other objects as may be deemed proper by the Council; and (p) To undertake all such other lawful acts and things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the foregoing objects. 4. The College runs a Postgraduate Rural General Practice Education Programme (“the PRGPEP”) created from the objectives of the College and based on the College’s commitment to maintaining and supporting standards of excellence among general practitioners. It is viewed as a significant part of a comprehensive cycle of vocational and professional education provided by the College and results in a Fellow of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners qualification. 5. The Course is a 12 week practice-based training course established by the College. The Course is one part of the house surgeon’s training programme, and is the first part of the rural general practice education pathway. 6. It is stated by the College (at page 7 of the PRGPEP Handbook: Revised October 2003) that the general aims of the Course are to enable Trainees to: • Experience and participate in rural general practice in a supportive rural general practice environment. • Acquire medical knowledge and expertise in a rural general practice context. • Enhance their interpersonal and communication skills, particularly in relation to patient consultations. • Develop an understanding of the general practitioner/hospital interface and the interface between health professionals in the rural sector. • Gain an understanding of the relevant cultural context including Maori and rural culture. • Develop collegial and peer associations and linkages. • Develop an understanding of the pathway to a career in general practice. 7. The Course involves various aspects of training that a Trainee is to complete. Essentially, a Trainee is assigned to an accredited “teaching practice” for 12 weeks. Each teaching practice, which must rank 35 or more on the Ministry of Health’s “rural ranking scale”, is a general practice medical centre for which the College has contracted with a general practitioner to be the Trainee’s teacher. The general practitioner teacher (“the Teacher”) holds vocational registration and is paid by the College under a separate contract. 4 8. The Course involves Trainees entering a planned and managed learning environment achieved through the interactions between the Trainee, the Teacher and patients, as well as interactions with other health professionals in the local area, and it includes support and guidance to ensure that learning occurs, and that a representative experience is obtained. 9. Trainees are formatively assessed during the Course, and they receive a final assessment from the Teacher. This assessment is available to the resident medical officer coordinator as part of the Trainee’s house surgeon training. Trainees completing the programme receive a letter of completion of this part of their overall training. 10. The standard week for a Trainee undertaking the Course consists almost entirely of patient contact within the teaching practice to which they are assigned. Trainees can also expect to have, on average, two hours each week of “protected teaching time” with the Teacher, sitting in on consultations, and group seminars. In addition to this, Trainees are required to complete a minimum of three “out of hours” supervised sessions. Given that Trainees are geographically distributed throughout New Zealand they attend teleconference (rather than face-to-face) seminars. 11. A Trainee does not receive any payment from the Teacher, but receives the Payments from the College allocated from the funding the College receives from the Clinical Training Agency (“CTA”). 12. The CTA has the mandate to purchase educational programmes that will ensure an adequate and stable future workforce. The CTA funds activities based on identified training requirements in respect of the future workforce, and it is expressly prohibited from funding based on current service needs. The CTA undergoes extensive health sector consultation to ensure that all the programmes it funds (including the Course) meet identified training needs. 13. The dollar value of the Payments is $12,000, being paid monthly during the period of the Course (and representing an annualised payment of $52,000). This amount is set at a level to provide for the maintenance of the Trainees’ standard of living while undertaking the Course. The Payments are at a level lower than that which a doctor with similar experience in appropriate employment would earn during the period of the Course. 14. A doctor who wishes to attend the Course as a Trainee applies to the College at the appropriate time. From the total number of applicants, the College undertakes a selection process to accept only the number of Trainees for which it has funding. 15. The criteria by which Trainees are selected are merit-based, the College taking the perspective of selecting Trainees who will benefit the community in the long term. These criteria include whether: • the applicant has a firm intention to enter general practice and continue general practice vocational education; and 5 • the applicant has completed hospital runs relevant to general practice. 16. The College initiates an agreement with each individual doctor that is to be agreed before the doctor becomes a Trainee in the Course. The obligations of Trainees are contained in the PRGPEP Terms and Conditions: Revised October 2003. 17. In exchange for undertaking the above, the Trainees receive from the College the monthly Payments which are intended to maintain the Trainees while attending the Course. 18. The College Council is responsible for setting the educational philosophy and mission statement for its PRGPEP. 19. With regard to the Course content, the College has developed a curriculum for general practice training in consultation with College Members and Fellows and with the CTA to ensure that Government health priority areas are reflected in the educational programmes. 20. The College determines, in consultation with its Trainees, the methods of delivery for its programme. The College also determines the structure of the programme. Materials for the programme are provided by the College and are purchased with funding provided by the CTA. 21. Each Trainee’s activities while undertaking the Course reflect the agreement reached between the Trainee and their Teacher as to how the Course syllabus will, in their view, be best achieved for that Trainee. Each Trainee’s activities are therefore designed to enable them to implement their agreed learning programme. A Trainee’s performance of these activities may assist the operation of their Teacher’s practice, but the activities are not designed to achieve this. As Trainees are unable to work independently without the presence of a supervisor, they are not in the position of providing services. 22. The College selects Teachers who meet a number of specific criteria. These include holding general registration with the Medical Council, being a Fellow of the College, and being assessed by the Regional Director as being competent and able to provide excellent education to a Trainee. The Teachers are employed by the College to provide teaching within the calendar year of the programme. All Teachers must undertake ongoing professional development activities while they remain a Teacher. 23. A director (employed by the College) is responsible for maintaining contact with the Teachers during the programme and resolving any difficulties that may arise. They do so primarily through meetings and practice visits with Teachers. The Regional Directors are kept informed by Teachers on the progress of Trainees. 6 Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) The Payments made to the Trainees under the Arrangement are not grants made under regulations made under section 193 of the Education Act 1964, section 303 of the Education Act 1989, or any enactment in substitution for those sections. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • The Payments made to the Trainees under the Arrangement are exempt income under section CB 9(d). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2004 until 31 December 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of November 2004.

Deliveries The Distribution Contract states that the Distributor agrees to: 11.  deliver all the Unaddressed Mail received by the Distributor from Reach Media to the letter boxes in the Distributor’s round within the timeframes (Delivery Window) communicated by Reach Media in the Delivery Instructions (exactly when each Distributor completes the deliveries within the Delivery Window is at the Distributor’s discretion);  make all deliveries in accordance with the delivery guidelines in the Operational Manual (which may be amended by Reach Media from time to time);  ensure that any other commitments do not affect the Distributor’s obligations to Reach Media; and  familiarise themselves with and fully comply with the Operational Manual (and any amendments) and applicable legislation, including that related to tax and health and safety. Payment The Distribution Contract states the following in relation to payment: 12.  The Distributor will be paid for performing the Services at the rates set out in Schedule 2 of the Distribution Contract. (Rates are determined by the volume of the Unaddressed Mail deliveries.)  These fees are the only amounts payable to the Distributor in respect of the Services and are inclusive of all taxes (except GST) and other duties or levies.  Payment will be made by direct credit into the Distributor’s bank account fortnightly on a Thursday.  Reach Media will provide a “buyer-created invoice” to Distributors within seven days of payment or before payment if an email address has been supplied by the Distributor.

Schedule 1 of the Distribution Contract requires Distributors to provide their 13. personal details, bank details and, if they are GST registered, their IRD number. Delivery equipment The Distribution Contract states that the Distributors are responsible for providing, 14. at their own expense, their own delivery equipment (such as bags, vehicles, footwear, reflective or high-visibility clothing, and wet weather gear).

Reach Media will then provide them with a buyer-created tax invoice. Distributors must not send a GST tax invoice to Reach Media.

Liability The Distribution Contract states that the Distributor will undertake the Services at 18. their own risk.

Frequency of deliveries The Distribution Contract states that Reach Media does not guarantee any 20. minimum amount of deliveries because the volume of Unaddressed Mail available for distribution will vary, depending on the time of year and the requirements of Reach Media’s clients. Operational Manual The Operational Manual provides guidance and helpful information for Reach 21. Media’s contractors on the completion of their duties under the Distribution Contract. Reach Media may amend the Operational Manual at any time, and amendments will be identified to Distributors when they receive their Delivery Instructions. The Operational Manual is divided into two sections, the first of which is applicable only to Distributors.

The Supervision Contract states the following in relation to taxation:  Supervisors will register for GST with Inland Revenue if required to do so. The Contract sets out the current registration threshold.  Supervisors are responsible for the payment of their own taxes on payments made to them by Reach Media under the Supervision Contract.  Reach Media may be required to withhold taxes from its payments to Supervisors, in which case the payments made will be reduced to the extent that tax is withheld. If Reach Media wrongly fails to withhold tax from payments made to a Supervisor, it will be entitled to recover such amounts from the Supervisor. Termination of the Supervision Contract 18. The Supervision Contract states that Reach Media or the Supervisors may terminate the Supervision Contract for any reason by giving four weeks’ notice in writing. However, if Reach Media believes the Supervisor is in serious breach of the Supervision Contract or the Operational Manual (including any amendments) then Reach Media may terminate the Supervision Contract immediately without notice. Status of contractor 19. The Supervision Contract states the following in relation to the contractor status of Supervisors:  The Supervisor is engaged by Reach Media under a contract for services, which means they are an independent contractor. The terms of the Supervision Contract or its operation do not create an employment relationship between the Supervisor and Reach Media.  The Supervisor is free to accept other engagements or work while they are engaged by Reach Media. However, the Supervisor agrees not to undertake other work that does or may conflict with the interests of Reach Media. Indemnity 20. The Supervision Contract states that the Supervisor will undertake the Services at their own risk. This means Reach Media will not be liable to the Supervisor (or any other person) for any loss resulting from the Supervisor’s deliberate actions or negligence or where they breach any terms of the Supervision Contract or the Operational Manual (including any amendments). 5 Classified in Confidence – Inland Revenue Highly Protected Delivery options 21. The Supervision Contract states the following in relation to delivery options:  It is the Supervisor’s responsibility to carry out the Services as required under the Supervision Contract.  If the Supervisor is sick or not able to personally carry out the Services, then they must arrange for someone else to do so. When they do this, the Supervisor is solely responsible for payment and all other obligations to others who assist them in this way. Frequency of deliveries 22. The Supervision Contract states that Reach Media does not guarantee any minimum amount of Unaddressed Mail for which the Supervisor will carry out the Services. The volume of Unaddressed Mail available for distribution will vary depending on the time of year and the needs of Reach Media’s clients. Operational Manual 23. The Operational Manual provides guidance and helpful information for Reach Media’s contractors on the completion of their duties under the Supervision Contract. Reach Media may amend the Operational Manual at any time and amendments will be identified to Supervisors when they receive their Delivery Instructions. The Operational Manual is divided into two sections, the first of which is applicable only to Distributors. 24. Section Two of the Operational Manual is applicable to all Reach Media contractors, including Supervisors, and provides that Supervisors and their families may be ineligible to enter competitions advertised in Unaddressed Mail delivered by Supervisors. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Supervisor by Reach Media under the Supervision Contract will not be “salary or wages” or “extra pay” or a “schedular payment” within the meaning of those terms as defined in ss RD 5, RD 7 and RD 8. b) For the purpose of s DA 2(4), any payment made to a Supervisor by Reach Media under the Supervision Contract will not be “income from employment”. c) For the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the provision of services by any Supervisor under the Supervision Contract will not be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” (as defined in s 6 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) by s 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 6 Classified in Confidence – Inland Revenue Highly Protected The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 July 2016 and ending on 30 June 2021. This Ruling is signed by me on the 1st day of December 2016. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 17/04 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Retirement Income Group Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CA 1, CD 3 to CD 20, CW 4, CX 56B and HM 47. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies 1. The Arrangement is the Lifetime Income Fund (the Fund), which is a managed investment scheme in which investors (Investors) can invest their retirement savings in return for a stream of regular payments (the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit) for the rest of their life. Investors can elect to commence receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at any time from age 60 until age 90. The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is calculated as a percentage of the Investor’s Protected Income Base. An Investor’s Protected Income Base is the Investor’s original capital sum invested in the Fund net of any applicable fees and Unplanned Withdrawals, and includes any increase in value during the Deferral Period (the period up to the time the Investor begins receiving payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit). Each Investor’s Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is paid in two phases: a) Protected Income Phase: This period commences on the date the Investor elects for the commencement of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits (the Initial Regular Payment Date) and ends when all Units held by the Investor in the Fund have been redeemed. During this period, the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is paid out of the capital invested by an Investor in the Fund and the Investor’s proportion of the Fund’s post-tax earnings accumulated as a result of investing the Investor’s original capital sum.

During this period, the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is paid from the proceeds of a group life insurance policy that the Manager of the Fund is required to take out in the name of the Supervisor of the Fund for the benefit of Investors. 2. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. (Capitalised terms and phrases in the description of the Arrangement should be taken to have the meaning attributed to that term or phrase in clause 1 of the Trust Deed or in the description of the Arrangement.) Parties to the Arrangement 3. The parties to the Arrangement are: a) Lifetime Income Fund; b) Retirement Income Group Limited; c) Lifetime Asset Management Limited; d) Lifetime Income Limited; e) Public Trust; and f) Investors in the Fund. Lifetime Income Fund 4. The Lifetime Income Fund (the Fund) is a managed investment scheme as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The Fund was established by Lifetime Asset Management Limited under the Unit Trusts Act 1960. 5. By trust deed dated 20 November 2015 (the original trust deed), Lifetime Asset Management Limited (as Manager of the Fund) and Public Trust (as Trustee of the Fund) established the terms and conditions applicable to the Fund. 6. As a consequence of the passage of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the repeal of the Unit Trusts Act 1960, Lifetime Asset Management Limited and Public Trust have agreed to amend the original trust deed by rescinding and replacing it with the clauses contained in a trust deed dated 12 May 2016 (the May 2016 trust deed). 7. Lifetime Asset Management Limited and Public Trust subsequently agreed to amend the May 2016 trust deed with effect from 17 July 2017 by rescinding and replacing it with the clauses contained in a trust deed 17 July 2017 (the Trust Deed). 8. The Fund has notified the Commissioner under s 31B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that it has elected to become a portfolio investment entity (PIE) under s HM 71 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Fund uses the exit calculation option referred to in s HM 42 to calculate its income tax liability for exiting Investors and remaining Investors. 3 9. The Fund has two portfolios: the Balanced Portfolio and the Cash Portfolio. Each portfolio has its separate assets and liabilities governed by the terms and conditions contained in the Trust Deed. The portfolios are not separate trust funds. The investments of each portfolio must all times be Authorised Investments as set out in schedule 2 of the Trust Deed. 10. The Balanced Portfolio invests through low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds. The investment mix of the Balanced Portfolio is balanced, investing equally in growth and income assets. The portfolio is actively hedged and in times of extreme volatility may reduce exposure to growth assets in favour of income assets. Target asset exposure is 25% domestic and 75% international. 11. The Cash Portfolio invests in an actively managed portfolio of bank bills, floating rate notes and short-term deposits and securities, with a weighted average duration not exceeding six months. Retirement Income Group Limited 12. Retirement Income Group Limited (RIG) is incorporated in New Zealand. It is the parent company of the Retirement Income Group and owns 100% of the shares in Lifetime Asset Management Limited and Lifetime Income Limited. RIG undertakes general management for the group, including solvency and capital management. Lifetime Asset Management Limited 13. Lifetime Asset Management Limited is incorporated in New Zealand and is a wholly owned subsidiary of RIG. Lifetime Asset Management Limited is the Manager and Issuer of the Fund for the purpose of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Lifetime Income Limited 14. Lifetime Income Limited (LIL) is incorporated in New Zealand and is a wholly owned subsidiary of RIG. LIL is a licensed life insurer under part 2 of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010. 15. Under clause 6 of the Trust Deed, the Manager is required to effect with LIL, in the name of the Supervisor and for the benefit of Investors, a Policy or Policies to provide regular payment benefits in respect of Investors during their Insured Income Phase on such terms and conditions as the Manager may approve. 16. LIL has issued Master Group Policy GVA01 (with a commencement date of 10 December 2016) to Public Trust on behalf of Investors in the Fund. The Policy was entered into in New Zealand. It was replaced with Master Group Policy GVA01 with a commencement date of 31 May 2017. The replacement Policy was also entered into in New Zealand. 17. An Investor’s insurance premium (for single life) is 1.35% per annum of an Investor’s Protected Income Base (or 1.75% per annum for joint life). It is subject to change at any time and is calculated on a daily basis. Lifetime Asset Management Limited pays the amount monthly to LIL by redeeming Units held in respect of that Investor in the Fund’s Cash Portfolio. No insurance premiums are payable during the Insured Income Phase. 4 Public Trust 18. Public Trust is the Supervisor of the Fund for the purpose of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Public Trust is also the trustee (the Trustee) of the Fund. Investors 19. Investors are members of the public who invest in the Fund. How the Arrangement operates 20. Units in a Portfolio may, subject to clause 4.2 of the Trust Deed, be issued to any Eligible Person. An Eligible Person is defined in clause 1 of the Trust Deed: Eligible Person means a person who: (a) lives or normally lives in New Zealand; (b) is a New Zealand citizen or is entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely; and (c) is under the age of 90 years. 21. The Manager may, at its discretion, register two persons in a Relationship as the holders of any Unit in which case they are deemed to hold the Unit as joint tenants with benefit of survivorship subject to the provisions of clause 4A of the Trust Deed. 22. Investors must each invest a minimum of $25,000 in the Fund. An Investor can make additional investments of at least $1,000 at any time before they start receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit. The maximum total investment per Investor is $1,000,000. 23. Investors cannot determine the allocation of their investment between the Balanced Portfolio and the Cash Portfolio. The allocation of investments between the two portfolios is different for each Investor and is determined by the Manager based on the relevant Investor’s age and when they intend to start receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit. 24. Each Investor is entitled to elect to receive a Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit. Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits commence within one month of an Investor’s Initial Regular Payment Date. The Initial Regular Payment Date for an Investor shall be any date on or after the Investor’s 60th birthday and before the Investor’s 90th birthday. 25. Each Investor has a Protected Income Base. An Investor’s Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is calculated as a percentage of their Protected Income Base. Initially, an Investor’s Protected Income Base is their total investment in the Fund. On each anniversary of their initial investment, the total value of the Investor’s investment in the Fund (their Fund Balance) is compared with the Investor’s Protected Income Base. If their Fund Balance exceeds their Protected Income Base, the Investor’s Protected Income Base is increased to their current Fund Balance. This means that an Investor’s Protected Income Base may rise if positive investment returns or additional contributions increase the value of their investment in the Fund. However, an Investor’s Protected Income Base will not fall unless the Investor makes an Unplanned Withdrawal. 5 26. The age at which an Investor starts receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit determines the rate of payment for the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit. The payment rate for an Investor that chooses to start receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at age 60 is 4.5% per annum of their Protected Income Base. For each one year increase in the age at which an Investor first starts receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit, the payment rate increases by 0.1% per annum. (For example, the payment rate for an Investor that starts receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at age 70 is 5.5%, at age 80 is 6.5% and at age 90 is 7.5% per annum.) 27. For two persons in a Relationship that are registered as joint holders of the relevant Units, the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit payment rate for the couple will be based on the age of the younger Investor of the couple. 28. Investors may choose whether Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits are paid to them fortnightly or monthly. Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits may be: a) benefits paid during the Protected Income Phase; or b) benefits paid during the Insured Income Phase. Protected Income Phase 29. The Protected Income Phase with respect to an Investor means the period commencing from the Initial Regular Payment Date elected by the Investor under clause 7.7 of the Trust Deed and ending when all Units held by the Investor in the Fund have been redeemed. During this phase Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits are paid from the redemption of Units held by the Investor in the Fund. Insured Income Phase 30. The Insured Income Phase with respect to an Investor means the period commencing from the end of the Protected Income Phase and ending on the date of death of the Investor. 31. In the policy year that the account value for an Investor is reduced to zero, LIL will make a lump sum payment to Public Trust in respect of the Investor equal to the balance of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit still payable to that Investor for that year. Beginning on the next policy anniversary date, LIL will make an annual lump sum payment to Public Trust in respect of all Investors in their Insured Income Phase. This will continue to be paid for each Investor in their Insured Income Phase until the death of that Investor. 32. Under clause 7.13 of the Trust Deed, any money received by the Fund in respect of an Investor (or Investors) under the Policy shall be treated as a subscription on behalf of that Investor (or those Investors) for Units in the Cash Portfolio. 33. Provided payments are received under the Policy in respect of an Investor, all payments to an Investor during the Insured Income Phase will be made by redeeming Units in the Cash Portfolio in accordance with clause 7.10 of the Trust Deed to the Investor until the date of death of the Investor. 6 Fees 34. Investors are charged the following regular fees for investing in the Fund: a) a management fee of 0.70% per annum of the aggregate net asset value of the Fund (across both portfolios) and administration fees; b) a supervisor fee of 0.08% per annum of the aggregate net asset value of the Fund (across both portfolios and subject to a $25,000 per annum minimum); and c) an administration management fee of 0.17% per annum of the aggregate net asset value of the Fund (across both portfolios and subject to a $35,000 per annum minimum). 35. Investors are also charged the following individual action fees: a) Buy/sell spread. When an investor invests in the Fund or makes a withdrawal from the Fund, they are charged a buy/sell spread. This is based on the amount of the investment or withdrawal from the Balanced Portfolio. The buy/sell spread is paid to the Fund and is designed to ensure, to the extent possible, that the costs of buying or selling assets in the Balanced Portfolio incurred as a result of that investment or withdrawal are borne by the relevant Investor and not by other Investors. The buy/sell spread is determined on each application or withdrawal based on the actual costs of buying or selling assets in the Balanced Portfolio. The indicative buy spread is 0.125% of investment allocated to the Balanced Portfolio. The indicative sell spread is 0.125% of the withdrawal allocated to the Balanced Portfolio. There is no buy spread in the Cash Portfolio. b) Early withdrawal fee of 1.00% of the total amount invested (that is, the initial and any additional investments) if an Investor makes a full withdrawal within three years of their initial investment. The early withdrawal fee applies in addition to the sell spread. Internal switching 36. Payment of all Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits to Investors and payment of fees and insurance premiums payable for or in respect of an Investor shall be paid by redemption of units held in respect of that Investor in the Cash Portfolio. 37. The Manager is required to ensure that at all times sufficient Units are held on behalf of an Investor in the Cash Portfolio to meet all payments that are to be made in regard to that Investor under the terms of the Trust Deed, including: a) payment of fees; b) payment of insurance premiums; and c) payment of all benefit payments due to the Investor. 38. The Manager is authorised at any time with respect to an Investor to redeem Units held by that Investor in the Balanced Portfolio and acquire Units for the Investor in the Cash Portfolio for the purpose of payment of fees, insurance premiums and benefit payments due to an Investor. The redemption of Units in 7 the Balanced Portfolio to increase the Cash Portfolio to cover these commitments is usually done on an annual basis. Unplanned Withdrawals 39. Under clause 7 of the Trust Deed, Investors can make an Unplanned Withdrawal at any time by making an Unplanned Withdrawal Request to redeem the Investor’s Units in the Fund. 40. If an Investor makes one or more Unplanned Withdrawal Request(s) that, in total, amount to no more than 20% of the application money paid by the Investor, the Manager must arrange for the redemption of the number or value of Units held by the Investor referred to in the Unplanned Withdrawal Request. 41. If an Investor makes one or more Unplanned Withdrawal Requests with respect to more than 20% of the application moneys paid by the Investor, the Manager must give one month’s notice to the Investor of its intention to cause all Units held by the Investor to be redeemed in accordance with clause 7.4.3 of the Trust Deed. The Investor may withdraw their Unplanned Withdrawal Request during this one- month notice period. Death of an Investor 42. When an Investor dies, if the Investor still holds Units, the Manager shall cause the Supervisor to redeem all Units and shall make payment of the amount payable following redemption of such Units to the personal representative of the Investor’s estate. Where an Investor does not hold Units at the time of the Investor’s death, the Manager and the Supervisor shall not be obliged to make any payment to the personal representative of the Investor’s estate. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The continued application of Private Ruling BR Prv 17/35 issued on 18 August 2017 (including any ruling issued to replace that private ruling, provided the change to the ruling does not affect the application of this product ruling). b) LIL does not have full reinsurance. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Fund will calculate and pay its income tax liability in accordance with s HM 47 on the amount of attributed PIE income or attributed PIE loss for each Investor at the relevant prescribed investor rates that the Investors notify to the Fund. b) The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit payments from the Fund to Investors will be excluded income in the hands of Investors under s CX 56B. 8 c) Any benefit to the Investor from the Fund arranging and meeting the costs of life insurance cover provided by LIL is not a dividend in the hands of the Investor under ss CD 3 to CD 20 or s CA 1. d) Payment of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit by LIL to Investors during the Insured Income Phase is exempt income in the hands of Investors under s CW 4. e) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2017 and ending on 31 March 2022. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of August 2017. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
IN CONFIDENCE PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 17/05 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the University of Melbourne. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of Part C and s CW 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and s 2 and s 8(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment by the University of Melbourne (the University), on behalf of The Atlantic Fellows Program for Social Equity Trust (the Trust) of amounts to persons (each a Participant) enrolled in the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity postgraduate education program (the Program) established and administered by the University. Details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background to the Program 1. The University has established the Program with the aim of developing up to 400 leaders with the skills and capability to lead social change for indigenous and marginalised communities in Australia, New Zealand, and the wider Asia–Pacific region. The Program will commence in 2017 and run for 20 years. Up to 20 Participants will undertake the Program each year. 2. Participants who successfully complete the Program will be awarded a postgraduate qualification from the University. That qualification will take the form of either a postgraduate certificate or, if the Proposal (as defined in paragraph 7) satisfies certain requirements (discussed below), a Master’s of Social Change Degree (which will be accredited as a Master’s Degree (Research) under the Australian Qualifications Framework). Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: Chief Tax Counsel: 04 978-1630 Taxpayer Rulings: 04 978-1628 Escalations & Advising: 04 978-1630 Disputes Review: 04 978-1630 Public Rulings: 04 978-1633 2 IN CONFIDENCE 3. Funding for the Program has been provided by a US$50 million grant from The Atlantic Philanthropies. In addition, the Australian Government will contribute funding of up to AU$40 million, and the Queensland University of Technology and the University of Auckland will each provide further financial support. 4. While the University has the ultimate responsibility for administering the Program, various partner organisations will assist the University to deliver the Program. Partner organisations may assist with Participant selection, development and delivery of the Program curriculum, and supporting Participants by providing faculty, facilities and resources. Participant selection 5. The University will have primary responsibility for selecting Participants for the Program each year. Selection criteria (to determine whether a particular applicant should be a Participant) will focus on six main factors: relevant experience and skills, the Proposal, commitment to social change, diversity, employer support, and based in Australia or New Zealand. 6. Relevant experience and skills: The University will consider all academic, employment, voluntary and leadership experience an applicant may have that is relevant to the Program and any social change activities in which the applicant has been or is involved. It is expected that most applicants will be at a mid-point in their career and will already have some of the skills and experience necessary to be social change leaders. 7. Proposal for social change: Each applicant will be required to submit an outline of a social change proposal (Proposal) they wish to develop if they are accepted as a Participant. The outline will include the Proposal’s purpose, intended outcomes and indicative budget. As part of the application process, the University will assess the general quality and innovation of each Proposal. 8. Commitment to social change: An applicant’s commitment to social change will be an important consideration relevant to their selection as a Participant. To assess this commitment, an applicant will be required to provide a personal statement outlining why they wish to be selected for the Program. They will also be required to provide referee reports from at least three referees who can speak to the applicant’s capacity to work with socially marginalised communities. 9. Diversity: The University aims to include Participants from a variety of backgrounds, sectors and disciplines. The University will focus on selecting Participants from socially disadvantaged groups and on having a mix of indigenous and non-indigenous Participants. 10. Employer support: If selected to participate in the Program, an applicant will be required to spend a significant amount of time attending the Program and developing their Proposal. Therefore, if an applicant intends to maintain an existing employment relationship throughout the Program, the applicant will be required to provide a letter from their employer to confirm that the employer will allow the applicant sufficient leave to enable the person to complete the Program. 3 IN CONFIDENCE 11. Based in Australia or New Zealand: Until 2020, applicants will be selected only from Australia or New Zealand (except in certain exceptional circumstances). After 2020, the University will reconsider whether to accept applicants from other countries into the Program (for example, from Pacific Island countries). 12. The selection criteria will not be applied in a way that favours an applicant who happens to have or to establish an employment relationship with any of the parties to the Arrangement. Program outline 13. Participants in the Program will be enrolled in a 12-month postgraduate education course, which will have two components: Modules and Development of the Proposal. Modules 14. Participants will be required to complete a series of course modules designed to expose Participants to a variety of topics, contexts and locations relevant to leadership and social change. 15. The modules will be taught in a variety of settings in New Zealand and Australia. Settings will include the University’s Melbourne campus and some of the campuses of the partner organisations. Participants will also complete fieldwork at various geographical settings across Australia and New Zealand. In some cases, Participants may also conduct fieldwork in other countries. 16. Participants will be expected to physically attend each module. 17. Modules will have different durations depending on the topics covered. The duration of the modules will range from a few days to several weeks. Attendance at the modules is a full-time commitment, so Participants will not have time to undertake any full-time work while attending the modules. 18. Participants will spend no less than 70 days attending the modules. Development of the Proposal 19. A fundamental part of the Program is the expectation that each Participant will research and develop the Proposal they submitted when they applied to participate in the Program. While attending the Program, Participants will be expected to fully develop and refine their Proposal to the necessary standard to allow a Master’s Degree to be conferred, with assistance from the University, partner organisations and certain other stakeholders and interested parties. 20. The University expects that the amount of time Participants will spend researching and developing their Proposals will vary between Proposals. The time will vary because no two Proposals will be the same and the tasks involved in completing each Proposal could be quite different. Under the Australian Qualifications Framework, a Master’s Degree (Research) qualification must be designed so that at least two-thirds of the Program is dedicated to undertaking research. The development of the Proposal will satisfy this research requirement. 4 IN CONFIDENCE 21. At the end of the Program each Participant will be invited to present a final written Proposal at an event that will feature representatives from government, business, community, academic, and philanthropic sectors. Following that presentation, the University may publish the final Proposal. 22. A specific faculty member at the University or from a partner organisation will be appointed to mentor each Participant in relation to Program requirements, including the development of Proposals. There will be no formal requirements regarding contact time, given that the circumstances of each Participant and their Proposal will be different. However, the University expects Participants to be in regular contact with mentors. 23. Each Participant will also have a personal coach who will work with the Participant on an individual basis to support their professional and personal development. Coaches will be selected to match each Participant and will be independent of the University. Qualifications 24. All Participants who successfully complete the Program will obtain a postgraduate qualification from the University. 25. The University expects each Participant to approach the Program on the basis that they are working towards a Master’s level qualification and that the amount of work that each Participant should put into the Program will reflect the intended standard of the qualification. 26. Provided that a Participant submits a final Proposal for assessment at the end of the Program, the University expects that Participants will obtain a Master’s of Social Change Degree. Where a Participant submits a Proposal that does not meet the necessary standards to allow a Master’s Degree to be conferred, the Participant will instead be awarded a postgraduate graduate certificate. Contributions to Participants 27. The University has established the Trust, from which a payment of AU$75,000 (the Contribution) will be made to each Participant. The Contribution will be paid in instalments during the Program and Participants will receive instalments on the same dates and in the same amounts. Instalment payments will be spread over the term of the Program, with instalments being paid both during the module section of the Program and after this while the Participant is working on his or her Proposal. 28. The payment of each instalment to a Participant will be dependent on the Participant’s progress in the Program. If a Participant withdraws from the Program or the University determines that a particular Participant is no longer actively participating in the Program, they will forfeit any right to instalments that they have not already received. 29. The purpose of the Contribution is to minimise a Participant’s financial barriers to undertaking the Program. The Contribution is intended to help Participants cover 5 IN CONFIDENCE their on-going living costs and costs associated with completing the Program and developing their Proposal (for example, research materials). 30. Because of the time commitment involved and the level of the qualification sought, the University expects that many Participants will be unable to undertake full-time employment while they are participating in the Program. In all cases, full-time employment will not be possible when Participants are attending the modules. 31. The funding for the Contribution will come from the Trust, which will transfer the necessary funding to a bank account controlled by the University, to be disbursed to the Participants. 32. As the Contribution will be paid in instalments as a Participant progresses through the Program, it is unlikely a Participant will be required to repay any of the instalments previously received, even if the Participant does not successfully complete the Program, except in very exceptional circumstances (e.g. in instances of fraud). However, withdrawal from the Program will mean that a Participant will cease to be entitled to any further instalments that they would have otherwise been entitled to receive if they had successfully continued in the Program. Expenses 33. In addition to providing the Contribution, the University will also agree to meet certain additional costs that might otherwise be a barrier to a Participant’s participation in the Program. These costs may include:  costs associated with travelling to attend modules;  the cost of a Participant’s accommodation during the modules; and  costs associated with a Participant’s special needs that may affect their ability to participate in the Program (for example, if a Participant has a disability, the University will cover the cost of additional resources that that Participant requires, such as a reader/writer or signer (for the hearing impaired). This is to ensure that the Participant’s disability does not impede their successful completion of the Program). (the Expenses) 34. It is anticipated that, like the Contribution, amounts used to make payments for the Expenses will generally come from the Trust (with the University making disbursements of the Expenses funding as agent for the Trust). However, it is also possible that in some circumstances the University may fund the Expenses directly itself as a part of the Program (i.e. as opposed to the Expenses funding being sourced from the Trust). 35. The University will generally pay for any Expenses by making payments to the third party suppliers of the goods and services. It is possible that in rare circumstances a Participant may pay Expenses associated with the Program personally. In those circumstances, the University will generally reimburse the Participant for the cost of the Expenses that they have incurred. 6 IN CONFIDENCE Intellectual property 36. Each Participant retains ownership of any intellectual property developed by the Participant during the course of participating in the Program (the Fellowship Intellectual Property). 37.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 18/03 This is a Product Ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Bank of New Zealand (BNZ). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: (a) ss BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, GA 1, RE 1 to RE 6, RE 10, RF 1, RF 2, RF 3 and RF 4; and (b) ss 86F and 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (SCDA). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a product (TotalMoney) that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may only be individuals, companies, or trusts. TotalMoney involves the creation of new types of accounts that must be in a group of accounts, and the facility to elect to group up to 50 of these new types of accounts into one or more groups to either “pool” or “offset” the account balances. “Pooling” involves the aggregation of account credit balances to determine the tiered interest rate that will apply to the calculation and crediting of interest to each account balance. “Offsetting” involves the aggregation of account balances to calculate the amount of interest debited to a lending facility account balance. The Arrangement is set out in the documents listed below, copies of which were received by the Taxpayer Rulings Unit, Inland Revenue, on 22 January 2018:  Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Personal and Sole Trader Customers;  Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Companies and Trusts;  Bank of New Zealand Home Loan Facility Master Agreement;  Letter of Advice – TotalMoney Home Loan;  Facility Document – TotalMoney Business Term Loan;  BNZ Business Lending Master Terms and Conditions; and  Confirmation of New Terms and Conditions (for customers converting to TotalMoney). 2 Further details of the Arrangement are set out in paragraphs 1 to 28 below. 1. TotalMoney is a package of accounts and loans that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may be only individuals, companies, or trusts. 2. Customers, in general, have a range of accounts with BNZ, including transaction accounts, savings accounts, and various loan accounts. Loan accounts may be only table, non-table, tailored, principal and interest, interest only, fixed or floating home loan accounts, or business loan accounts. 3. TotalMoney allows customers to group or aggregate these accounts for the purposes of either “pooling” or “offsetting” the account balances. Primary features of TotalMoney 4. The primary features of TotalMoney are the “pooling” and “offsetting” features. These features operate in the manner described below. Pooling (a) The pooling aspect of TotalMoney operates when several transaction accounts with credit balances exist. Interest on these credit balance accounts is calculated and paid having regard to the cumulative credit balance of all transaction accounts in the group. Interest-bearing accounts usually attract interest based on interest rate brackets that apply to the balance of each relevant individual account. (b) The cumulative credit balance is calculated so BNZ can ascertain the relevant interest rate tier applicable to the relevant accounts. The separate funds are not actually transferred to one account before the interest is calculated. BNZ calculates interest at the applicable interest rate tier that applies to the accumulated balance. Offsetting (a) With the offset feature of TotalMoney, interest on a lending facility or facilities within the group is calculated and paid by the customer on the difference between the lending facility balances and the credit balances of transaction accounts in the group. Under the terms and conditions agreed between BNZ and its customers for TotalMoney, BNZ pays no interest on the credit balances that are “offset” against the lending facility. (b) The “offsetting” is only to calculate the balance of the lending facility or facilities on which interest is payable or, where the credit balances of transaction accounts exceed the balance of the lending facility or facilities in the group in which the credit balances are "offset" against, the balance of the excess credit balances on which interest is receivable. There is no actual transfer of funds, no set- off or netting of funds together in an account, and no transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. 5. Every transaction account in a TotalMoney group is automatically either set to “pool” or “offset”. If a customer has any lending facilities within 3 their TotalMoney group, the customer's transaction accounts with credit balances are “offset” against their lending facilities. Interest is payable by the customer if the balance of their lending facilities exceeds the balance of their transaction accounts with credit balances, and interest is payable by BNZ if a customer's transaction accounts with credit balances exceeds the balance of their lending facilities. Where the customer has no loan account(s), a customer’s TotalMoney accounts will automatically “pool”. 6. TotalMoney does not provide a facility for existing accounts. TotalMoney involves the creation of a new type of account. To participate in TotalMoney, a customer must open specific TotalMoney accounts that are particular to the TotalMoney product. Customers may convert an existing non-TotalMoney transaction or savings account that they have with BNZ to a new TotalMoney account. However, the customer must agree that the existing terms and conditions that apply to those accounts cease to apply, and are replaced by the TotalMoney Terms and Conditions. 7. For new TotalMoney accounts, the account will either “offset” or “pool”, depending on whether the customer has any lending facilities within the same TotalMoney group. Pooling – further detail 8. BNZ has a contractual obligation to pay interest if either a customer's transaction accounts with credit balances exceeds their lending facilities within a TotalMoney group, or a customer only has transaction accounts with credit balances (and no lending facilities) within a TotalMoney group. The interest payable is based on the applicable interest rate tier that applies based on the total credit balance being "pooled" or "offset" against any lending facilities in the TotalMoney group. Following usual business practice, BNZ makes a separate determination for withholding tax on each interest payment made to each account. 9. The benefit of the “pooling” feature for customers is that they can earn more interest by combining smaller balances and reaching higher interest- rate tiers and still maintain their money in separate accounts for separate purposes. The customer may consider this an advantageous way to manage their money. 10. Account owners have full deposit and withdrawal access to their transaction accounts. Overdraft facilities may be available in relation to these accounts. However, any overdraft balance is ignored for “pooling” purposes. BNZ charges debit interest on the overdrawn balance of any account. The overdrawn balance does not reduce the “pooled” balance of the credit balance accounts when BNZ is calculating interest for to those accounts. Offsetting – further detail 11. Where one loan account is in the group, the interest payable on the loan account is calculated on the balance of the loan account less the credit balances of accounts in the group. This will be the case as a matter of law (in terms of TotalMoney documentation) and as a matter of practice (in terms of BNZ’s computer system). There is no actual set-off, netting, or transfer of funds, or transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. “Offsetting” occurs before debit or credit interest is calculated. 4 12. For example, in the case of a loan account that would otherwise be the same as a standard variable rate table home loan facility over 20 years with a “minimum payment”, there will be no provision for the amount of interest saved under “offsetting” to reduce the “minimum payment”. The effect of “offsetting” is the same as a decrease in the floating interest rate and a decision not to reduce the amount of the “minimum payment”. In either case, the term of the loan is reduced because the principal portion of the payment is effectively increased. In the case of a non-table loan, interest payments will be reduced by “offsetting”, principal repayments will not change, and the loan term will not reduce. In the case of interest only loans, repayments comprise solely interest, so the impact of "offsetting" will be to reduce the interest amount and therefore reduce the "minimum payment". 13. Where there is more than one loan account in the group, the loan accounts in the group are given a default priority; namely, the oldest loan account in the group will receive the highest priority. However, the customer may elect two or more of those loan accounts to be prioritised for “offsetting” purposes. The loan account with the highest priority will receive the benefit of “offsetting” first. It is only where the credit balances of transaction accounts in the group exceed the balance of that highest priority loan account that the next highest priority loan account balance is offset, and so on. 14. If the total credit balances of the transaction accounts are greater than the total debit balance of the loan accounts in a group, credit interest will be applied to the difference and paid on a prorated basis to the credit balance accounts in accordance with the balance of those accounts (essentially in line with the “pooling” feature of TotalMoney). 15. BNZ calculates interest daily. If, during a month, BNZ has both an entitlement to receive interest (that is, the balance of participating loan accounts exceeds the balance of all transaction accounts in a group) and, at another point in the month, BNZ has an obligation to pay interest (that is, the balance of transaction accounts in a group exceeds the balance of the relevant loan accounts), then the two interest payments are made and are not set-off. 16. The “offsetting” feature of TotalMoney essentially offers the same benefits to customers as offered by a revolving credit loan (such as BNZ’s “Rapid Repay” product) in terms of lower interest costs and a shorter time to repay the loan. However, this feature overcomes a primary perceived disadvantage of a revolving credit loan because it allows customers to retain separate account balances (which customers may prefer when managing their finances). 17. Where a customer has a TotalMoney loan account, this account must be grouped with at least one other TotalMoney transaction account. 18. No arrangement must exist between the customers who have grouped their accounts that provides for the loan account owner(s) to make a payment(s) to the transaction account owner(s) in consideration for the transaction account owner(s) “offseting” their accounts under TotalMoney. Business purposes 5 19. When TotalMoney was established, customers were contractually prohibited from using TotalMoney for business purposes. BNZ has now removed the prohibition on the business use of TotalMoney. BNZ extended the availability of TotalMoney to business customers to give them the same tools for managing their financial affairs as it gives to personal customers. 20. Under the terms and conditions applicable to TotalMoney, customers are able to use TotalMoney accounts for business purposes, which means that, customers are able to group business and non-business product accounts. This means that a sole trader, for example, is able to group their business and non-business accounts. Terms and Conditions for the TotalMoney home loan products 21. Each of BNZ’s home loans is explained in a collection of documents. These documents include primarily a Home Loan Facility Master Agreement (which is a standard form master document that contains generic provisions that apply to all BNZ home loan facilities), and a Letter of Advice for Home Loans (which contains particular and specific provisions for the home loan facility being made available to the customer and overrides the Loan Facility Master Agreement in case of any inconsistencies). The Letter of Advice is produced from a computer system that contains a master list of possible provisions that can apply to BNZ’s home loans. Under this system, the provisions applicable to a particular home loan are selected, collated, and produced in a document. 22. The TotalMoney product home loans are also documented in a Home Loan Facility Master Agreement and Letter of Advice for Home Loans. 23. Table loans provide for regular payments and a set date when they will be paid off. Most payments early in the loan term comprise interest, while most of the payments later in the term comprise repayments of the principal. Non-table loans have two separate repayments, one of interest and one of principal. Customers repay the same amount of principal each time and interest is charged separately. 24. The documentation for a TotalMoney standard variable rate table home loan facility over 20 years will largely be the same as that for current BNZ home loan facilities that are standard variable rate table home loans over 20 years. The only differences are; branding (the name on the Letter of Advice), the interest calculation (which provides for the effect of the “offset”), and, in relation to table loans, the provision stating that where the loan has the benefit of the “offset” to reduce the interest cost, the “minimum payment” specified for the loan will not decrease because of any interest savings but instead the loan term will reduce. Under a non- table loan, any interest saving (whether as a result of a reduction in the applicable interest rate because of a general decrease in interest rates or because of the offset feature), would result in either a reduction of the interest repayment of the loan or a reduction in the loan term (if the original repayment amount is maintained despite the interest saving). In relation to a TotalMoney product home loan that is a table home loan, a reduction is only allowed in the loan term. Under a TotalMoney product interest only loan, any interest saving (whether as a result of a reduction in the applicable interest rate because of a general decrease in interest 6 rates, or because of the offset feature) would result in a reduction of the interest repayment. Terms and conditions for TotalMoney business loan products 25. Each of BNZ’s business loans is also documented under a collection of documents. These include primarily the Business Lending Master Terms and Conditions (a standard form “Master” document which contains primarily generic provisions that apply to BNZ’s business loan facilities) and a Business Term Loan Facility Document (which contains particular and specific provisions for the loan facility that is being made available to a TotalMoney business customer). To the extent that there are any inconsistencies between the documentation, BNZ has the sole discretion to resolve the inconsistency. Groups 26. TotalMoney is based on a group of participating accounts. Groups can be comprised of only of the following categories: (a) Natural persons: (i) The accounts of an individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de facto, and civil union couples, and any of their children may be combined as part of one group of accounts. (ii) For example, the various accounts of one natural person, Jane, or, the various accounts (individual or joint) of Jane and her husband John and their child Joe. The group is not limited to residents of New Zealand, although the group may not include both residents and non-residents. (b) One company or one trust: (i) Multiple accounts of one company (including a qualifying company or look through company) or one trust may be combined as part of a group. Only one entity can be in a group at any time. (ii) Accounts of different entities (including the entity and any related individual) cannot be pooled or offset. 27. Accounts may only be included in one group. An individual may have accounts in three groups, through membership in one as an individual customer, the second as a joint customer and in the third as a sole trader. A group may not include more than one sole trader's accounts. 28. A customer may be a resident or non-resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. However, where a group of accounts consists of accounts owned by more than one legal person, BNZ will obtain representations from the owners of those accounts that they do not have different tax residence status. That is, where more than one legal person is participating in a group of accounts, either all persons must be residents of New Zealand for tax purposes or all persons must be non-residents of New Zealand for tax purposes. 7 BNZ’s objectives 29. BNZ’s objectives in providing TotalMoney are to: (a) increase its market share, particularly for home loans and transaction-type accounts; (b) increase customer satisfaction and customer retention; and (d) improve its brand awareness and be seen as a market leader. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: (a) All interest rates related to the TotalMoney product are arm’s length market interest rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Financial arrangements rules (a) When a credit balance of a transaction account and a debit balance of a loan account are “offset”, there is no amount of consideration paid or payable because of that “offset” for the calculation of income and expenditure under ss EW 15 and EW 31 of the “financial arrangements rules” (as defined in s EW 1(2)). Resident Withholding Tax (RWT), Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) and Approved Issuer Levy (AIL) (b) Under the “pooling” feature of TotalMoney: (i) RWT (as defined in s YA 1) and NRWT (as defined in s YA 1) must be deducted by BNZ from the interest credited to the participating transaction accounts in a group in accordance with the RWT rules (as defined in ss RE 1(1) and YA 1) and the NRWT rules (as defined in ss RF 1(1) and YA 1); (ii) For an account that is a “registered security” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA), “approved issuer levy” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) may be paid by an “approved issuer” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) for the interest credited to that account pursuant to s 86I of the SCDA. (c) Under the “offsetting” feature of TotalMoney: (i) There is no payment of or entitlement to “interest” (as defined in s YA 1) for the credit balances of participating transaction accounts in a group, and no obligation to deduct RWT or NRWT or pay AIL, except to the extent that the combined credit balance of those 8 accounts exceeds the combined debit balance of the lending facility accounts. (ii) To the extent that interest is credited to participating transaction accounts in a group: o RWT (as defined in s YA 1) and NRWT (as defined in s YA 1) must be deducted by BNZ from the interest credited to the participating transaction accounts in a group in accordance with the RWT rules (as defined in ss RE 1(1) and YA 1) and the NRWT rules (as defined in ss RF 1(1) and YA 1); o For an account that is a “registered security” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA), “approved issuer levy” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) may be paid by an “approved issuer” (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) for the interest credited to that account pursuant to ss 86F and 86I of the SCDA. Section CC 7 (d) No income arises under s CC 7 for BNZ or its customers in relation to the Arrangement. Section BG 1 (e) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2018 and ending on 31 March 2022. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 March 2018.

RULINGS > PRODUCT Vi tal Healthcare Property Trust Issued: 26 February 2020 BR Prd 20/01 Applicant: Vital Healthcare Property Trust This ruling concerns the proposed separation of Vital Healthcare Property Trust’s New Zealand and Australian real estate investments into separate holding vehicles. The ruling is withdrawn from 11 May 2020 due to the proposed arrangement not proceeding. START DATE - END DATE 26 February 2020 – 30 September 2021 Page 1 of 7 UNCLASSIFIED BR Prd 20/01 | 26 Feb 2020 Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Vital Healthcare Property Trust (VHPT). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s s CD 43(26), CX 56C and FL 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the proposed separation of VHPT’s New Zealand and Australian real estate investments into separate holding vehicles in the following manner:  New Zealand assets are held through a New Zealand Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) structure. VHPT will establish a New Zealand unit trust (Vital NZ) for this purpose.  Australian assets continue to be held indirectly by VHPT through underlying Australian-managed investment trusts. VHPT will migrate its tax residence to Australia and be renamed Vital Australia (Vital Aus). Vital Aus will be a managed investment scheme registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and will qualify as an Australian-managed investment trust for Australian tax purposes. Units in Vital NZ and Vital Aus will be stapled together so they cannot be traded separately. The stapled units will be dual listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Current structure 1. VHPT is a New Zealand property unit trust, specialising in investment in healthcare properties, including surgical and medical hospitals and health support and health care facilities. VHPT has been listed on the NZX since 1999. For New Zealand tax purposes, VHPT is “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1) and a PIE. VHPT elected to become a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1) effective from 1 October 2007. Page 2 of 7 UNCLASSIFIED BR Prd 20/01 | 26 Feb 2020 2. VHPT indirectly owns properties in New Zealand and Australia from which it derives rental income. VHPT’s New Zealand properties are held by Vital Healthcare Property Limited (VHPL), and its Australian properties are held through two Australian unit trusts (which are managed investment trusts for Australian tax purposes): Vital Healthcare Australian Property Trust (VHAPT) and Vital Healthcare Investment Trust (VHIT). 3. Over time, a large proportion of VHPT's investment opportunities have been located in Australia, contributing to approximately 75 percent of VHPT’s assets being based in Australia and approximately 25 percent being based in New Zealand (as at 31 December 2019). However, only a small proportion (approximately 8 percent) of VHPT’s unitholders are Australian. 4. The following diagram summarises how the structure operates. Proposed structure – steps 5. Th e seven steps to implement the proposed restructure are as follows:  Step 1: Vital NZ, after establishment as a New Zealand “unit trust” (as defined in s YA 1), will issue 100% of its units to VHPT. Vital NZ will be a managed investment scheme under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, with a licensed manager and Page 3 of 7 UNCLASSIFIED BR Prd 20/01 | 26 Feb 2020 supervisor (being the existing VHPT manager and supervisor). Vital NZ will join the VHPT tax consolidated group.  Step 2: VHPL will transfer the New Zealand properties to Vital NZ for market value consideration. The market value consideration will be satisfied by: o Vital NZ taking assignment of an existing bank loan from VHPL; and o Vital NZ issuing units to VHPL.  Step 3: VHPL will transfer the Vital NZ units to VHPT in consideration for and repayment of an intercompany debt that VHPT has with VHPL.  Step 4: VHPT will distribute all of its units in Vital NZ to unitholders on a pro-rata basis. No consideration will be payable by unitholders for the distribution. At the same time, units in Vital NZ and VHPT will be stapled together so that they must be traded together. Vital NZ units and VHPT (to be Vital Aus) units will appear as a single security, under a single ticker code, that can be traded on the NZX and on the ASX.  Step 5: VHPL and Colma (which holds one unit in VHAPT and six of 3000 units in VHIT) will migrate to Australia by transferring their place of incorporation to Australia. All directorial and managerial functions of VHPL and Colma will also move from New Zealand to Australia.  Step 6: VHPT will appoint an Australian responsible entity and become an Australian registered managed investment scheme and managed investment trust (Vital Aus). VHPT will cease being “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1) at this time.  Step 7: Vital NZ will list on the NZX and ASX. Vital Aus will remain listed on the NZX throughout the transaction and will list on the ASX. Vital NZ will then elect to be a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). Following the above steps, only Vital NZ will be a New Zealand tax resident. VHPL, Colma and VHPT (Vital Aus) will become Australian tax residents. 6. To implement the proposed structure, the VHPT trust deed will be amended to allow the transaction to take place and establish the stapled group. Broadly, the amendments fall into three categories: Page 4 of 7 UNCLASSIFIED BR Prd 20/01 | 26 Feb 2020  Distribution amendments: These amendments allow VHPT to make distributions of Vital NZ units to unitholders (the current VHPT trust deed contemplates distributions of only cash).  Stapling amendments: These amendments are the addition of clauses to provide for the stapling of Vital NZ units and Vital Aus units and to facilitate the operation of the stapled group.  Australian migration amendments: These amendments allow VHPT to migrate to Australia and become Vital Aus, and to make other changes that are consistent with it transitioning to an Australian managed investment scheme registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). For clarity, Vital NZ will be a New Zealand managed investment scheme registered with the Financial Markets Authority under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (as VHPT is currently). 7. The proposed restructure does not involve changing:  VHPT's underlying property assets, which will be split between Vital NZ and Vital Aus; or  a unitholder’s proportionate beneficial interests in those underlying assets. 8. For example, a unitholder who owns 1 percent of all VHPT units on issue has a corresponding 1 percent proportionate beneficial interest in VHPT's assets. Following the Arrangement, the unitholder would have 1 percent of the Vital NZ units and 1 percent of the Vital Aus units, giving them a 1 percent proportionate beneficial interest in the assets of Vital NZ and Vital Aus, being the same assets owned by VHPT before the Arrangement. 9. The following diagram summarises how the structure will operate after implementation of the Arrangement: Page 5 of 7 UNCLASSIFIED BR Prd 20/01 | 26 Feb 2020 Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) VHPT is a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). It will maintain “listed PIE” status at the time of distributing the units in Vital NZ and until the time it loses that status by reason of migrating its tax residence ( as per step 6 at \[5\] ). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The amount derived by each VHPT unitholder when VHPT distributes all its units in Vital NZ (as per step 4 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if the unitholder:  is “resident in New Zealand” (as defined in s YA 1);  is a natural person or a trustee; and  does not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. Page 6 of 7 UNCLASSIFIED BR Prd 20/01 | 26 Feb 2020 b) If any one (or more) of the three criteria listed in a) does not apply to the unitholder, the amount derived by the unitholder when VHPT distributes all its units in Vital NZ (as per step 4 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(2) to the extent to which the amount is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). c) The distribution in money each VHPT unitholder is treated as being paid under s FL 2 on migration of VHPT’s tax residence (as per step 6 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if the unitholder:  is “resident in New Zealand” (as defined in s YA 1);  is a natural person or a trustee; and  does not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. d) If any one (or more) of the three criteria listed in c) does not apply to the unitholder, the distribution in money the VHPT unitholder is treated as being paid under s FL 2 on migration of VHPT’s tax residence (as per step 6 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(2) to the extent to which it is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 26 February 2020 and ending on 30 September 2021. This Ruling is signed by me on the 26th day of February 2020.

1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PROJECTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS PROGRAMME—INCOME TAX TREATMENT The Projects to Reduce Emissions programme was established by the New Zealand Government in 2003 in order to assist New Zealand to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. A total of 41 agreements in the form described in this ruling were entered into under the programme before the Government’s climate change policies were reviewed and changed in 2005. This ruling applies only to agreements in the form described in this ruling and entered into under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme. PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 08/03 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 3, CB 1, DA 1, EW 3, and EW 32. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of emission units under a project agreement between the Crown and a participant under the Crown’s Projects to Reduce Emissions programme, and the sale to a third party of emission units received by a participant under such an agreement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. •E mission units derived by a participant under a project agreement are income of the participant under section CB 1. •E mission units will be derived in each year of the term of a project agreement when the Crown accepts the annual report or if the Crown does not accept the annual report, the dispute as to the amount of emission reductions resulting from the project is resolved. •If in a subsequent year the participant becomes entitled to receive additional emission units in respect of emission reductions achieved in a prior year, the additional emission units will be derived in the year in which it is determined that the participant is entitled to additional emission units. 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • If in a subsequent year it is determined that the participant is required to refund emission units to the Crown (or to pay a cash equivalent), provided a participant continues to carry on the business involving the generation of energy for sale or for use in the supply of goods or services for sale, a deduction is allowed for the emission units refunded or the cash repaid in the year in which the refund is made. • Amounts derived by a participant from the sale of emission units are income of the participant under section CB 1. • If the participant continues to carry on the business involving the generation of energy for sale or for use in the supply of goods or services for sale (in connection with which the project agreement was entered into), a deduction is allowable under section DA 1 in the year in which emission units are sold by the participant for an amount equal to the value of emission units at the time of their transfer to the participant. • A project agreement is a financial arrangement. • The consideration provided by and payable to the participant under the Arrangement is an amount equal to the value of the emission units transferred to the participant. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 April 2008 to 31 December 2013. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7 th day of November 2008. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 08/ 03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 08/03 (“the Ruling”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Background 1. The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that was signed in 1997 and came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol was entered into in pursuit of the ultimate object of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“the Convention”), the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The aim of the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions to 5 percent below their level in 1990 during the first Commitment Period (2008–12). 2. Only countries that ratify the Kyoto Protocol are bound by it. New Zealand ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 19 December 2002. 3. The Kyoto Protocol recognises that countries have different economic circumstances and that their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions differs. Therefore, different countries have different emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. New Zealand’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol for the first Commitment Period is to reduce New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 level, or to accept responsibility for the excess emissions. New Zealand has an initial quantity of emission units based on its emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol. Additional emission units can be derived: • from New Zealand’s forest sink credits, which are given in respect of forests planted since 1990 on land that did not previously contain forests (known as “Kyoto forests”) in recognition of the ability of growing forests to absorb carbon dioxide; • by purchasing emission units on the international market; or • by participating in projects recognised under the Kyoto Protocol. What are emission units? 4. The term “emission units” in relation to Projects to Reduce Emissions is defined by the Ministry for the Environment in the key terms section of its website (http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/projects/key-terms.html) as follows: 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Emission units Means all of the unit types specified in the Kyoto Protocol, namely, assigned amount units (AAUs), certified emission reduction units (CERs), emission reduction units (ERUs), and removal units (RMUs). For the purposes of the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme and the Model Project Agreement, the Emission Units being offered by the Crown are AAUs (or ERUs if these are requested by the project participant). 5. Assigned amount units (AAUs) are issued out of a country’s assigned amount under the Kyoto Protocol (which in New Zealand’s case is an amount equal to its 1990 greenhouse gas emissions multiplied by five). Certified emission reduction units (CERs) are issued in relation to Clean Development Mechanism projects (between an Annex I party to the Convention and non-Annex I countries and which are implemented in a non-Annex I country). The purpose of Clean Development Mechanism projects is to assist non-Annex I countries to achieve sustainable development, to contribute to the ultimate objective of the Convention, and to assist Annex I parties to achieve compliance with their commitments to limit and reduce emissions: Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. Emission reduction units (ERUs) are derived from a Joint Implementation project under Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol (which allows the acquisition and transfer of ERUs resulting from projects to reduce emissions undertaken between two Annex I countries). Removal units (RMUs) result from a country’s sink activities that result in a net removal of greenhouse gases. The term “sink” is defined by the Ministry for the Environment in the key terms section of its website: Any natural or man-made system that absorbs and stores greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. To be considered a sink, a system must be absorbing more carbon dioxide than it is releasing, so that the permanent store of carbon is expanding. 6. There is an agreed international standard for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions, so that the position of each country is calculated in the same manner. One emission unit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide (or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases) that would otherwise have been emitted into the atmosphere). 7. Emission units are tradable allowances for greenhouse gas emissions. The ultimate users of emission units are national governments, which will be required to retire (that is, set aside) emission units in order to meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. If a country’s initial assigned amount, plus any additional sink and project credits earned over the Commitment Period, is less than its total emissions for that period, it must be a net purchaser of units over the Commitment Period, or it will be required to make up any shortfall by purchases at the end of the Commitment Period. Emission units can be used only once to offset emissions equal to the equivalent greenhouse gas value. Emissions trading 8. Emission units are tradable between nations and, where nations provide for private ownership of emission units, they can also be traded by private entities. The cost of emission units on the international market is expected to reflect the cost of achieving 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] emission reductions throughout the market. The aim of emissions trading is to lower the overall cost of achieving emission reductions. Because it is likely to be more difficult and expensive for some parties to the Kyoto Protocol to achieve emission reductions than for other parties, some parties may purchase emission units on the international market in order to comply with their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. 9. The Kyoto Protocol allows governments to devolve responsibility for emissions to private entities. This means private entities would be required to report their emissions and hold a matching number of emission units. To the extent that some states have devolved, or are expected to devolve, national obligations to reduce emissions to individual emitters, private entities may be required to purchase emission units. 10. The New Zealand Government has announced a “cap and trade” emissions trading scheme under which participants in the system are allocated, or purchase, New Zealand units (NZUs), which they can trade with others. NZUs are a type of emission unit and will be the primary domestic unit of trade. It is intended that during the first Commitment Period the New Zealand emissions trading scheme will be linked to the international market for emission units issued under the Kyoto Protocol (Kyoto units), and that, subject to certain restrictions, NZUs will be interchangeable with Kyoto units, so that participants in the New Zealand emissions trading scheme will be able to surrender both NZUs and Kyoto units for New Zealand emissions trading scheme compliance purposes. See The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (Ministry for the Environment and The Treasury, September 2007). 11. At present, there is no formal or organised market for emissions trading, and trading is being conducted through brokers. 12. Annex I parties to the Convention are required to establish and maintain a national registry system in order to keep track of transfers and acquisitions of emission units, the setting aside of units for the purpose of compliance with Kyoto Protocol commitments (retirement), and the cancellation of units. New Zealand is an Annex I party under the Convention. A New Zealand registry system for emission units will be established under the Climate Change Response Act 2002. 13. Unique serial numbers must be allocated to each AAU when the initial assigned amount is recorded and to each ERU when it is issued: section 15 of the Climate Change Response Act 2002. 14. An international transaction registry will verify the issue of units, transfers and acquisitions between registries, the retirement and cancellation of units, and the carry- over to any subsequent commitment period, and a clean development registry will issue Clean Development Mechanism units: United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change website (http://unfccc.int/2860.php). 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Projects to Reduce Emissions programme 15. One of the measures the New Zealand Government has adopted to enable New Zealand to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol is the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme. Under this programme, individuals, companies, or organisations were invited to submit proposals for projects that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand, and to tender for emission units. The Crown awarded emission units in respect of projects undertaken under the programme. The use of a competitive tender process was intended to create pressure on participants to bid down to the minimum number of units they required to allow them to proceed with the project. 16. Initially, it was proposed that subject to Budget allocations being made and a decision of the Government to implement the round in each year, the opportunity to make tenders under the programme would be made available annually. Fifteen projects received emission units in the first tender round in 2003 and a further 26 projects received emission units in the second tender round in 2004. No more Projects to Reduce Emission agreements will be entered into as the New Zealand Government has reviewed and changed its climate change policies. Projects entered into include projects for wind farms, hydro-electricity generation, geothermal-electricity generation, and bio-energy and landfill gas projects. (The first tender round took place before the Kyoto Protocol came into force and successful bidders took the risk that it might not come into force.) 17. A tender under the Project to Reduce Emissions programme had to be for a single definable project. To be eligible to receive emission units under the programme, a project had to: • take place in New Zealand; • result in measurable emission reductions additional to reductions that would otherwise occur; • achieve a minimum annual reduction in emissions of 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in the first Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol; and • be a project that would not have proceeded if emission units had not been awarded in respect of the project. 18. The selection criteria for projects are explained on the Ministry for the Environment’s website (http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/projects/eligibility- selection.html) as follows: In the second tender round, eligible projects were ranked and selected on the following basis: • The ratio of the number of emission units requested by the tenderer divided by the tonnes of CO 2 - equivalent emissions expected to be reduced by the project during the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012). • Risk assessment of the project. 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Subject to the assessed risk of a project, projects offering the most reduction in emissions in exchange for the least number of emission units requested were ranked highest. Projects were selected in order of their ranking until the 6 million emission units available in the second tender round had been allocated. 19. If a project delivers emission reductions, the Crown’s requirement to retire emission units to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol will reduce and these units will become available to the Crown to deliver to the participant instead. To the extent that the project results in greater emission reductions than the emission units to be provided by the Crown, the Crown will have improved its compliance position. 20. Project agreements have been entered into between the Crown acting through the Minister of Finance and the Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues and a successful bidder under the programme (the participant). Participants under a project agreement are either in the business of supplying energy or in the business of supplying goods or services requiring the large-scale use of energy. Project agreements apply for a term beginning on the date of the agreement and ending on 31 December 2013 (unless they are terminated earlier): clause 3. (All references to clauses are clauses in the project agreement.) 21. Project agreements in relation to projects under the programme contain standard terms and conditions and information specific to the project (such as implementation milestones and verification processes). Examples of milestones include the lodging of applications for resource consents, the granting of resource consents, entry into a contract for the supply of major equipment, starting construction, and milestones in the construction process from site preparation to equipment delivery to completion of the commissioning of equipment and commencement of operation. 22. Under a project agreement the participant agrees to two things. • The participant agrees to implement the project in accordance with agreed specifications and milestone dates specified in the project agreement and to complete the project by the final milestone date. The participant will achieve completion of the final milestone when: (a) the Participant has carried out all work necessary to complete the final Milestone; and (b) the Crown has accepted, in accordance with clause 7, the Milestone Report in respect of such Milestone or it has been resolved, in accordance with clause 7, that the Participant has carried out all work necessary to complete the final Milestone. • The participant agrees to operate the project so as to ensure the project results in the specified emission reductions before and during the Commitment Period (1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012). The definition of “emission reductions” in clause 4.4 reads as follows: In this Agreement, “Emission Reductions” means greenhouse gas emission reductions where: (a) the Participant has achieved completion of the final Milestone in accordance with clause 4.1; 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) the Greenhouse Gas emission reductions have been determined in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 2, including the measurement methodology set out in that Schedule; and (c) either the Crown has accepted, in accordance with clause 7, the Annual Report in which such Greenhouse Gas emission reductions are reported or, in the case of non-acceptance by the Crown, the Dispute has been resolved in accordance with clause 16 (including resolution of the Greenhouse Gas emission reductions achieved). 23. The project agreement provides for a monitoring process to enable the Crown to establish that the participant has complied with its obligation to implement the project and to establish the emission reductions achieved by the project. The participant must deliver to the Crown two things. • The participant must deliver to the Crown a milestone report containing the information specified in Schedule 3 of the project agreement within 20 business days of completion of each milestone: clause 7.2(a). If a milestone is not completed by the relevant milestone date, the participant, within 20 business days of that date, must deliver an interim milestone report outlining progress towards completion of the milestone, the reasons for the delay in completion, and the date by which the participant expects to complete the milestone: c lause 7.2(c). • The participant must deliver to the Crown an annual report containing the information specified in Schedule 4 of the project agreement for each year from the first year in which the participant has promised in its tender that it will deliver emission reductions to 2012 (inclusive) by 31 January of the following year: clause 7.2(b). 24. The Crown may request any further information necessary to enable it to verify the information in any report, inspect the project, interview the participant’s staff, and arrange for any annual report to be audited by an independent person: clauses 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. The Crown must notify the participant that it accepts a report or, if it does not accept a report, the Crown must notify the participant specifying the reasons for such non-acceptance: clause 7.3(b). If the Crown fails to notify the participant within the time-frame specified in clause 7.3(b), it is not deemed to have accepted the report: clause 7.3. If the participant disagrees with the Crown’s position, the dispute is to be resolved in accordance with the disputes resolution procedure in clause 16: clause 7.3(c). 25. The maximum number of emission units the Crown is required to transfer is specified in the project agreement: clause 5.2. Emission units are to be transferred to the participant annually during the Commitment Period. The number of emission units transferred in respect of each year is to be determined by reference to the reduction of emissions achieved by the project during the relevant year and calculated in accordance with the following formula: A = B x C Where: A is the number of Emission Units to be transferred 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] B is the Emission Reductions, stated in (tCO 2 -e), resulting from the Project during the relevant year of the Commitment Period; and C is a number not more than one that reflects the ratio of emission units to emission reductions requested by the participant in its tender. (The term “tCO 2 -e” means tonnes of carbon dioxide or, for greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide specified in Schedule 2 (if any), their equivalent in tonnes of carbon dioxide calculated in accordance with their respective global warming potential conversion rates specified in Schedule 2.) 26. The Ministry for the Environment administers the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme, and the Ministry of Economic Development manages the emission unit registry. If the Ministry for the Environment is satisfied a project has achieved emission reductions (so that the participant is entitled to emission units under a project agreement), the ministry will recommend to the Ministers that a specific number of emission units be transferred to the participant. This transfer will be made through the registry. 27. Under clause 5.1 the emission units are to be transferred to the participant on or before the transfer date. The term “Transfer Date” is defined in the project agreement as follows: “Transfer Date” means 5 Business Days after: (a) acceptance by the Crown of a Commitment Period Annual Report in accordance with clause 7.3; or (b) in the case of non-acceptance by the Crown, resolution of the Dispute (including resolution of the Emission Reductions achieved) in accordance with clause 16. 28. Under clause 5.3 if the participant gives notice by 31 January in any year that the participant wishes the Crown to transfer the emission units resulting from the project during the previous year to a nominated person or persons, the Crown must transfer the emission units to the nominated person or persons unless: • the Crown is unable to do so for any reason; or • in the Crown’s reasonable opinion, it is impracticable to do so. 29. Either AAUs or ERUs may be transferred under project agreements. The participant may elect to receive ERUs if the project meets the eligibility requirements for a project under Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol, provided the participant bears any costs the Crown incurs as a result of the participant requiring the transfer of ERUs. (Usually AAUs (being units issued out of New Zealand’s assigned amount under the Kyoto Protocol) will be transferred. There may be price differences between different types of units. Therefore, the value of the emission units transferred under a project agreement could differ depending on whether ERUs or AAUs are transferred.) 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 30. If it is established that the amount of emission units that have been transferred to the participant is incorrect, the participant must refund the excess amount of emission units to the Crown. This could occur when it is ascertained after the transfer of emission units that the level of emission reductions resulting from the project differs from that previously accepted in respect of a particular year. If either the Crown or the participant determines that the amount of emission reductions resulting from the project in any year varies from the amount accepted in respect of that year, they may give written notice to the other party setting out the amount of and the reason for the variation and the revised amount of emission units that should have been transferred to the participant: clause 9.1. If the party receiving the notice does not trigger the disputes resolution provision in the project agreement (clause 16), the notice is deemed to have been accepted and, if the number of emission units transferred to the participant is : • more than the number specified in the notice, the participant must transfer the number of emission units equal to the difference ( clause 9.3(a)); • less than the number specified in the notice, the Crown must transfer to the participant the number of emission units equal to the difference ( clause 9.3(b)) (but the total number of emission units that would be transferred over the term of the project agreement will not exceed the maximum specified in the project agreement). 31. The participant may (with the Crown’s consent) assign all (but not less than all) its rights under the project agreement: clause 21.1. Such consent must not be unreasonably withheld. A direct or an indirect change in the effective control of the participant is deemed to be an assignment, unless the participant is a listed company or the change in the effective control of the participant is due to a change in the control of any other listed company: clause 21.3. 32. The Crown may terminate the agreement if the: • participant fails to meet a significant milestone in the project’s implementation; • project fails to result in more than 10 percent of the emissions reductions required under the agreement in any year (except where such failure is the direct result of the participant failing to achieve a milestone within 12 months after the relevant milestone date); • participant fails to provide any report within 30 business days of the due date; • participant provides inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information; or • participant becomes insolvent ( clause 18.2). 33. The agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party committed a material breach that is incapable of being remedied or the other party has failed to remedy a material breach that is capable of being remedied within 20 business days of notice of the breach: clause 18.3. 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 34. Clauses 6.1 and 6.2 provide: 6.1 Lowest price clause: The parties acknowledge that: (a) they are independent parties dealing at arm’s length with each other in relation to the matters contemplated by this agreement; and (b) for the purposes of Division 2 of Part EH of the Income Tax Act 1994, neither the consideration provided by the Participant under clause 4 nor the consideration provided by the Crown under clause 5 includes any interest component, and in each case such consideration is the lowest price the parties would have agreed, on the Effective Date, if the obligations imposed on the parties under those respective clauses were required to be paid or discharged in full on the Effective Date. 6.2 GST: (a) On the date on which the Crown transfers Emission Units to the Participant or a Nominated Person or Persons in accordance with clause 5, the Crown shall issue a Tax Invoice to the Participant for that supply of Emission Units. At that time, the Crown shall also issue to the Participant a Buyer-Created Invoice in respect of the supply of services by the Participant under clause 4 that corresponds to the Emission Units being transferred under that Tax Invoice. The amount to be recorded on both the Tax Invoice, and the Buyer-Created Invoice which corresponds to that Tax Invoice, as: (i) the value of the supply, shall equate with the value of the Emission Units being transferred under that Tax Invoice; (ii) the tax charged in relation to the supply, shall be the value mentioned in (i) multiplied by the applicable rate of GST as determined under Part II of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. For the avoidance of doubt: (iii) each such invoice shall also record the GST-inclusive amount in relation to the supply, which amount shall equate with the sum of (i) and (ii); (iv) the date on which the Tax Invoice is issued is the time of supply of both supplies\[the supply of Emission Units by the Crown and the supply by the participant\] for\] for GST purposes. (b) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the GST chargeable in respect of a supply of Emission Units to the Participant, as recorded in a Tax Invoice, and the equivalent amount of GST chargeable in respect of the supply of services by the Participant under clause 4 that corresponds to the Emission Units being transferred under that Tax Invoice (which amount will be recorded in the Buyer-Created Invoice that corresponds to that Tax Invoice) can, be set off against each other. 35. If a formal, organised market for emission units does not develop, it is intended that the value of emission units would be determined on the basis of the information and methodology used by The Treasury for calculating the Crown’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol (that is, the price that the Crown would be required to pay to purchase emission units if New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions over the first Commitment Period exceed the target under the Kyoto Protocol). New Zealand’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol was recognised for the first time in the Government’s accounts for the period ended 31 May 2005. The Treasury re-estimates 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the liability annually using World Bank published reports and having regard to European Union allowance prices and information from Point Carbon (a provider of news, analysis, and consulting services for European and global power, gas, and carbon markets). The methodology used and price calculated by The Treasury is peer reviewed. Legislation 36. Section BD 3 provides: Application (1) Every amount of income must be allocated to an income year under this section. General rule (2) An amount of income is allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived, unless a provision in any of Parts C or E to I provides for allocation on another basis. Interpretation of derive (3) When the time of derivation of an amount of income is being determined, regard must be had to case law, which— (a) requires some people to recognise income on an accrual basis; and (b) requires other people to recognise income on a cash basis; and (c) more generally, defines the concept of derivation. Income credited in account (4) Despite subsection (3), income that has not previously been derived by a person is treated as being derived when it is credited in their account or, in some other way, dealt with in their interest or on their behalf. (5) Part E (Timing and quantifying rules) contains a number of provisions that— (a) specifically modify the allocation of income or have the effect of modifying the allocation of income; or (b) allocate income as part of the process of quantifying it. Sngle allocation (6) An amount of income may be allocated only once. 37. Section CB1 provides: Income (1) An amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person. Exclusion 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that is of a capital nature. 38. Section DA 1(1) provides: Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation loss) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. 39. Section EW 3 provides: Meaning (1) Financial arrangement means an arrangement described in any of subsections (2) to (4). Money received for money provided (2) A financial arrangement is an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for that person, or another person, providing money to any person— (a) at a future time; or (b) on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, whether or not the event occurs because notice is given or not given. Examples of money received for money provided (3) Without limiting subsection (2), each of the following is a financial arrangement: (a) a debt, including a debt that arises by law: (b) a debt instrument: (c) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for an absolute assignment of some or all of a person’s rights under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement: (d) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for a legal defeasance releasing a person from some or all of their obligations under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement. 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Excepted financial arrangement ceasing to be excepted (4) For sections EW 7 and EW 8,— (a) an excepted financial arrangement that ceases to be an excepted financial arrangement through the operation of section EW 7 is a financial arrangement: (b) an excepted financial arrangement that ceases to be an excepted financial arrangement for a party through the operation of section EW 8 is a financial arrangement for the party. 40. Section EW 32 provides; When this section applies (1) This section applies when an original party to an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services, a hire purchase agreement, a specified option, or a finance lease pays or is paid consideration that includes property or services. Value of property or services (2) The value of the property or services is determined by applying subsections (3) to (6) in numerical order until a subsection applies. Lowest price (3) The value of the property or services is the lowest price the parties would have agreed on for the property or services, on the date the agreement, option, or lease was entered into, if payment had been required in full at the time the first right in the property was transferred or the services provided. Two qualifications are— (a) this subsection does not apply to an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services that is part of another financial arrangement: (b) section EW 34 applies if the consideration is in a foreign currency. Cash price (4) The value of the property or services is the cash price of the property or services to which the agreement, option, or lease relates, as determined by section 5 of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003, if that Act applies to the agreement, option, or lease. Future or discounted value (5) The value of the property or services is the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of both the future and discounted values, of the amounts paid or payable on the date on which the first right in the property is transferred or the services are provided, as determined by the Commissioner under a determination under section 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Determined by Commissioner (6) The value of the property or services is the amount determined by the Commissioner when either party to the arrangement applies to the Commissioner for a specific determination. Both parties must use this amount. Exclusion 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (7) This section does not apply if the agreement, option, or lease has lapsed or does not proceed. Application of the legislation Whether emission units are business income 41. An amount derived from a business is income: section CB 1. An amount would be derived from a business if: • the amount was derived from a transaction in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business (that is, the amount arises from a transaction that is of a type normally undertaken in carrying on the taxpayer’s business); or • although the amount was not derived from the taxpayer’s main activity, the amount is derived from a transaction that is an ordinary incident of the taxpayer’s business (that is, the transaction was part of the income earning process); or • although the transaction is unusual or a one-off transaction, it was entered into by the taxpayer for the purpose of making a profit. See AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383; CIR v Rangatira Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,182; Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981; CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991. 42. Participants are either in the business of supplying energy or in the business of supplying goods or services for which energy is used. To be entitled to the transfer of emission units, a participant must implement and operate the project so as to result in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The participant is required to provide the information specified in the project agreement in order to enable the Crown to verify the amount of emission reductions that has been achieved from the project. The Crown may terminate the agreement if in any year the project fails to achieve more than 10 percent of the emission reductions required in respect of that year: clause 18.2. Emission units are the product of services rendered by the participant (being the undertaking of an activity that results in emission reductions). The consideration provided for emission units is the achievement of emission reductions as defined in clause 4.4. 43. The participant’s obligations under a project to reduce emissions are carried out on an ongoing basis over the term of the project agreement. The participant does not sell or give up any capital asset in return for the emission units and the provision of emission reduction services involves participants carrying on their existing business in a different manner. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the activities of participants under a project agreement constitute an extension of their business. See Rolls-Royce Ltd v Jeffrey \[1962\] 1 All ER 801. 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Grant or subsidy for capital asset? 44. Emission units are provided by the Crown under the Projects to Reduce Emission programme to support projects that would not be economic without the award of emission units. 45. A subsidy provided as assistance in relation to the carrying on of a business or for the reimbursement of expenditure of a revenue nature is income under ordinary concepts: Brisbane Amateur Turf Club v FCT 118 CLR 300; Lincolnshire Sugar Co Ltd v Smart \[1937\] AC 697; Reckitt & Colman Pty Ltd v FCT 74 ATC 4185. However, when a payment is made as a contribution towards the acquisition or reinstatement of a capital asset, the amount will not be income: Seaham Harbour Dock Co v Crook 16 TC 333; Watson v Samson Bros 38 TC 346. 46. Projects under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme will usually involve the acquisition or construction of plant or equipment. Emission reductions will be achieved in one of the following methods (or a combination of these methods). • The substitution of other sources of energy (such as wind, water, or bio-energy) for fossil fuels. • The displacement of greenhouse gases that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere by establishing a plant or system that uses gases resulting from other activities (such as landfill or waste gases) to provide energy. 47. The expenditure relating to the acquisition or construction of such plant or equipment is likely to be expenditure of a capital nature (being expenditure incurred in order to acquire a capital asset for use in producing energy for sale or for use by the participant’s business). A participant must put in place plant and equipment in accordance with the agreed specifications by the agreed date in order to achieve emission reductions during the first Commitment Period. However, to be entitled to receive emission units, it is not sufficient that plant or equipment be acquired or constructed. The Crown is not obliged to transfer emission units to the participant unless it is established that the project has achieved a certain level of emission reductions. Therefore, the emission units do not constitute a subsidy for the purpose of acquiring an asset (plant and equipment) of a capital nature. The Crown provides the emission units for services (the achievement of emission reductions). 48. The Commissioner considers that emission units do not constitute and are not a capital receipt. Emission units are not a subsidy for the purpose of acquiring an asset of a capital nature. Emission units are transferred periodically for services (the achievement of emission reductions) provided by the participant. Section CX 47 49. The Commissioner has also considered section CX 47, which applies to payments in the nature of a grant or subsidy made by a public authority. If section CX 47 applies, 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the emission units would be excluded income. The Commissioner considers that section CX 47 does not apply, because emission units are not transferred to participants “in relation to” expenditure incurred by them in implementing or operating projects, as required by section CX 47(1)(d). Emission units would not be transferred to a participant merely because the participant incurs expenditure in implementing and operating a project. The entitlement of participants to the transfer of emission units is directly linked to the achievement of emission reductions and the level of emission reductions achieved determines the number of emission units transferred. The number of emission units transferred has no relationship with the amount of expenditure incurred by participants. Emission units are provided in relation to the achievement of emission reductions. Convertibility 50. For the emission units to be income, they must be convertible into money: Tennant v Smith (1892) AC 150; FCT v Cooke & Sherden 80 ATC 4140. 51. There is no prohibition on the transfer of the emission units in the project agreement. The project agreement contemplates that emission units may be sold by the participant. Clause 5.5 limits any liability on the part of the Crown as a consequence of the inability of the participant or the participant’s nominee to transfer or trade the emission units. Clause 5.5 provides: Tradeability: The Crown has no obligation or liability to the participant or any nominated person in respect of the ability or inability to transfer or trade Emission Units following transfer of Emission Units to the Participant or a Nominated Person, except where the Participant is, during the term of this agreement, unable to transfer Emission Units from the Registry to an overseas registry for the sole reason that New Zealand is not in compliance with the inventory and registry eligibility requirements for transferring and acquiring Emission Units of \[sic\] under Article 17 of the Protocol or established thereunder. Because emission units can be sold, they are convertible into money, and because an international market exists for emission units, their value is able to be ascertained. 52. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the emission units are income derived from a business carried on by a participant being transferred to participants for services (the achievement of emission reductions) provided by participants on an ongoing basis as part of their business. Whether amounts derived from the sale of emission units are income 53. Generally, when a taxpayer receives an asset in satisfaction of a business debt and merely sells the asset, the amount derived from the sale is not income from the business. In Case D6 72 ATC 28, a timber and hardware retailer had received land from a customer who was unable to pay their debt. After acquiring the land, the taxpayer subdivided and sold the land. The Board of Review considered that the land was a capital asset (being acquired in discharge of a trade debt rather than for the 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] purpose of sale for profit) and that the transaction was an isolated one that was unconnected with the company’s business. Therefore, the Board of Review considered that the amount derived from the sale of the land was not income from the taxpayer’s business. 54. The Commissioner considers that Case D6 is distinguishable. In Case D6 an asset was received to satisfy an existing debt and the sale of the asset was not connected with the activity giving rise to the debt or with any other activity related to the business. The taxpayer had no choice but to accept the land in order to recover its debt. In this case, participants will receive periodic transfers of emission units in return for the ongoing provision of services in the course of their business. The business of participants includes the supply of services for emission units. Emission units are a product of services provided by the participant in the course of carrying on a business. 55. The Commissioner considers that on that basis amounts derived from the sale of emission units are income from the participant’s business. Therefore, the participant will derive income in the form of the emission units and income from the sale of the emission units. If a deduction is not allowable in respect of the emission units, the participant will be subject to tax both on the value of the emission units and on the proceeds of sale, although the participant receives one gain in the form of money’s worth that is converted into cash. Whether a deduction is allowable in respect of the emission units 56. For expenditure to be deductible under section DA 1(1) there must be a sufficient relationship between the expenditure (and the advantage provided or sought to be provided from the expenditure) and the income-earning process: CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236. The Commissioner accepts that there is a sufficient relationship between any expenditure incurred by a participant in acquiring emission units and assessable income derived from the sale of emission units, because the participant would be unable to derive income from the sale of emission units unless the participant had acquired emission units. However, a deduction under section DA 1 is not allowable when the taxpayer has not incurred expenditure. What is the expenditure for emission units? 57. Expenditure means something that passes from the person incurring the expenditure in money or in money’s worth that has the effect of diminishing the taxpayer’s assets: Oram v Johnson \[1980\] 2 All ER 1; Case S75 (1996) 17 NZTC 7469; Case T16 (1997) 18 NZTC 8095. In Oram v Johnson the court accepted that expenditure could be in the form of money’s worth that diminishes the total assets of a person and considered that when expenditure is in the form of money’s worth, a valuation exercise is necessary to determine the amount of the expenditure incurred by the taxpayer. However, the taxpayer’s own services do not constitute expenditure. 19 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 58. In this case, services are provided in order to acquire the emission units rather than the giving up of an asset. The only expenditure incurred by a participant is the expenditure incurred in constructing and operating the plant or equipment required to generate energy. No additional cost above the cost of carrying out the project is incurred by a participant in order to obtain the emission units. When shares are acquired in order to acquire the assets of a company, the cost of acquiring the asset is the cost of the shares: Tasman Forestry Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147; John v FCT 89 ATC 4101; Steinberg v FCT 75 ATC 4221. A possible argument is that by analogy the cost of the emission units is the expenditure incurred in carrying out the project. However, expenditure incurred in carrying out a project is incurred primarily in order to acquire and operate plant or equipment to produce energy for sale, or for the participant’s own use in carrying on a business, rather than in order to acquire emission units. Essentially, the emission units represent an additional return from the project. The Commissioner considers that expenditure incurred in implementing and operating a project cannot be regarded as the cost of the emission units. 59. In any event, expenditure in operating a project is likely to be deductible on the basis that it is incurred in deriving income from the generation and sale of electricity or from another income-earning activity involving the use of the project, and expenditure in constructing a project is likely to be deductible as a “depreciation loss” being depreciation on an asset used in deriving income. A deduction is not allowed twice for the same expenditure: section BD 4(5). 60. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that expenditure is not incurred in acquiring the emission units. However, it may be appropriate to attribute a cost to the emission units. Can a cost be attributed to the emission units? 61. Sharkey v Wernher \[1956\] AC 58 (HL) concerned a taxpayer who carried on a stud farm (a “taxable activity”) and a recreational activity of horse racing and who had transferred horses from the stud farm to the racing activity. The House of Lords held that the horses should be treated as having been transferred from the stud farm activity to the racing activity at their market value. Lord Radcliffe said (at pages 84–86; emphasis added): When a horse is transferred from the stud farm to the owner's personal account, there is a disposition of trading stock. ... In a situation where everything is to some extent fictitious, I think that we should prefer the third alternative of entering as a receipt a figure equivalent to the current realizable value of the stock item transferred. In other words, I think that the case of Watson Brothers v. Hornby was rightly decided and that its principle is applicable to all those cases in which the income tax system requires that part of a taxpayer's activities should be isolated and treated as a self-contained trade. The realizable value figure is neither more nor less “real” than the cost figure, and in my opinion it is to be preferred, for two reasons. First, it gives a fairer measure of assessable trading profit as between one taxpayer and another, for it eliminates variations which are due to no other cause than any one taxpayer's decision as to what proportion of his total product he will supply to himself. A formula which achieves this makes for a more equitable distribution of the burden of tax, and is to be preferred on that account. Secondly, it seems to me better economics to credit the trading owner with the current realizable value of any stock which he has chosen to dispose of without commercial disposal than to credit him with an 20 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] amount equivalent to the accumulated expenses in respect of that stock. In that sense, the trader's choice is itself the receipt, in that he appropriates value to himself or his donee direct instead of adopting the alternative method of a commercial sale and subsequent appropriation of the proceeds. 62. The principle in Sharkey v Wernher constitutes an exception to the general principle that a person cannot trade with himself or herself. Viscount Simonds and Lord Radcliffe noted that the exception applied in all cases where the legislation requires that part of a taxpayer’s activities must be isolated and treated as a self-contained activity. In such cases, it is necessary to attribute a cost to assets brought into or transferred out of the activity in order to determine the true profit arising from that activity. 63. The same principle applies to the reverse situation to that considered in Sharkey v Wernher. Therefore, when assets acquired otherwise than in the ordinary course of business (such as when assets are acquired by way of gift) are brought into a business or capital assets are appropriated to a business or income-earning activity, a cost can be attributed to the assets. See the judgment of Viscount Simonds in Sharkey v Wernher; JB Macdonald & Sons Ltd v MNR \[1970\] CTC 17; Case A27 (1974) 1 NZTC 60,245; Bath and West Counties Property Trust Ltd v Thomas (Inspector of Taxes) \[1977\] 1 WLR 1423; Rank Xerox (NZ) Ltd v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,501; Halliwell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8197; Rangatira Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,727. 64. As emission units are received as business income and it is always intended that they will be sold, it is difficult to argue that their character changes at any point. However, Tasman Forestry Ltd v CIR left open the possibility that an analogy could be drawn with Sharkey v Wernher in different fact situations. See also the judgment of Viscount Simonds in Sharkey v Wernher and Halliwell v CIR. 65. The rationale for the principle in Sharkey v Wernher and the other cases is that it is necessary to attribute a cost to an asset acquired outside a trading activity and appropriated to the trading activity in order to determine the true profit arising from the trading activity. In the main judgment in John v FCT it was said (at page 4111; emphasis added): It must be accepted that in some situations there is a cost involved in the appropriation of bonus shares to trading stock in the same way as there is a cost involved in the appropriation of a gift to trading stock, and that a value must be ascribed on appropriation if the taxpayer's accounts are to reveal a “substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer's true income”: see C. of T. (S.A.) v. Executor Trustee and Agency Co. of South Australia Ltd. (1938) 63 C.L.R. 108 at pp. 154-156. An obvious example of such a situation is where the original shares were not trading stock but the bonus shares are appropriated to trading stock. It is not here necessary to identify all situations in which it will be necessary to ascribe a value to bonus shares appropriated to trading stock. It is necessary only to consider the circumstances relevant to the present case. Therefore, this approach is consistent with the principle recognised in case law that accounting principles and commercial practice are relevant in calculating business income, and that the accounting method that should be preferred is that which is “calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income”: Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd 48 CLR 26 (Carden’s case); CIR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200. 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 66. The above approach is also consistent with the presumption against double taxation in interpreting revenue legislation. Double taxation means a situation where the same person pays tax twice on the same income: Levin v Commissioner of Taxes (1912) 31 NZLR 717; Canadian Eagle Oil Co Ltd v R \[1946\] AC 119; Commissioner of Taxes v Luttrell 4 ATD 67. In Carden’s case, Dixon J commented that an interpretation that results in double taxation would be adopted only where it was absolutely clear that that result was intended (at page 44): No interpretation of a taxing Act should be adopted which results in the imposition of double taxation unless the intention to do so is clear beyond any doubt. 67. The arrangement involves income derived under two transactions, but only one gain to participants. The second transaction (the sale of emission units) involves the realisation of a non-cash receipt derived in the first transaction (the project agreement). If a cost is not attributed to the emission units, participants would be taxed twice on the same gain (on receipt of the emission units and on the conversion of the emission units into cash). 68. Therefore: • the participant derives income in the form of emission units; • a deduction of an amount equal to the market value of the emission units at the time of receipt is allowable in the year of their sale by the participant; and • the amount derived from the sale of the emission units is income. Whether a project agreement is a financial arrangement 69. If the project agreement is a financial arrangement, the accrual rules apply to the allocation of income or deductions under the project agreement: sections BD 4(3) and BD 4(4). For a project agreement to be a financial arrangement, it must be: • an arrangement; • under which the Crown or the participant receives money or money’s worth; • in consideration for the Crown or the participant providing money or money’s worth; • at a future time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event. 70. The definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1 includes a contract. Project agreements are arrangements being contracts under which the Crown receives services (emission reduction services) in consideration for the Crown providing emission units. 71. The definition of “money” in section OB 1 includes “money’s worth, whether or not convertible into money”, but to be “money” for the purpose of the definition of 22 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “financial arrangement”, it must be possible to value the benefit: McElwee v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,288. Emission units are convertible into money and it will be possible to determine the monetary value of emission units as they are tradable on the international emissions market. The monetary value of emission reduction services can be determined by reference to the value of emission units. 72. Services (an activity that results in emission reductions) provided under p roject agreements are provided over the term of the agreements. At the end of each year of the Commitment Period, the participant must provide such documentation as the Crown requires to verify that emission reductions up to the required level have been achieved under the project during the year. The verification process determines the number of emission units that are to be transferred to the participant in respect of the year. Payment is to be made on or before five business days after completion of the verification and agreement as to the emission reductions achieved during the year. There will, therefore, be a delay between the emission reduction services being provided and emission units being transferred. 73. The Commissioner considers that a project a greement is a financial arrangement being an arrangement under which the Crown receives money (emission reduction services) in consideration for the Crown providing money (emission units) to the participant at a future time (on acceptance by the Crown of the level of emission reductions achieved in the previous year). Therefore, the accrual rules apply to project agreements. What is the consideration under a project agreement? 74. The value of the consideration under a project agreement is to be determined under section EW 32, which applies when an original party to an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services pays or is paid consideration that includes property or services: section EW 32(1). The value of the property or services is to be determined by applying subsections (3) to (6) of section EW 32 in numerical order until a subsection applies. If the lowest price method applies, it is not necessary to consider the other methods of valuation specified in section EW 32. 75. The lowest price method does not apply to an agreement for sale and purchase of property or services that is part of another financial arrangement. A project agreement is both an agreement for the sale and purchase of services (emission reduction services) for which the consideration is property (emission units) and an agreement for the sale and purchase of property (emission units) for which the consideration is services (emission reduction services). There is one arrangement under which the consideration for services is provided in the form of the transfer of property and the consideration for the property is in the form of the provision of services. Therefore, the lowest price method applies. 76. Under section EW 32(3) the value of property or services is the lowest price that the parties would have agreed on the date that the agreement was entered into, if payment would have been required in full at the time the first right in the contracted property was transferred or the services provided. In Lyttelton Port Company Ltd v CIR (1996) 23 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 17 NZTC 12,556, Hansen J considered that it was not necessary that the parties had actually agreed on the lowest price or that the parties had actually considered the issue. The question was what was the lowest price that the parties would have agreed to, having regard to the surrounding circumstances. 77. Under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme participants are invited to submit tenders for projects. The tender document must specify the number of emission units requested by the tenderer, and the tenderer must provide information to enable the Crown to determine the reduction in emissions that is likely to result from the project. The consideration provided by each of the parties under a project agreement is determined under a competitive tender system under which applicants compete for the award of emission units and the Crown seeks to achieve the maximum emission reductions for the least number of emission units. 78. Emission reduction services are provided over the term of the arrangement. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is achieved by generating energy from non- fossil fuels or by displacing greenhouse gases over the period of the arrangement. The project agreement specifies the maximum number of emission units that the Crown is required to transfer under the agreement. The actual number transferred on each transfer date depends on the amount of emission reductions achieved under the project in the previous year. The formula in clause 5.1 for calculating the number of emission units to be transferred does not take into account any interest element for a delay in the transfer of emission units. 79. The Commissioner considers that the lowest price that the parties would have agreed on the date of the agreement would be determined by reference to the ratio of emission units to emission reductions (as defined in the project agreement) specified in the project agreement. The value of the emission reduction services provided by participants is an amount equal to the value of the emission units transferred to participants. Therefore, the participant will not derive income or expenditure under the accrual rules in respect of the project agreement. When are emission units derived? 80. The general rule is that income must be allocated to the year in which it is derived unless Part C or Parts E to I provide for allocation on another basis: section BD 3(2). When income is derived is to be determined having regard to case law under which some people are required to recognise income on an accrual basis and others are required to recognise income on a cash basis, and on the concept of derivation generally: section BD 3(3). 81. Generally, income from a business must be recognised on an accruals or earnings basis: Fincon (Construction) Ltd v CIR \[ 1970\] NZLR 462; CIR v National Bank of New Zealand Ltd (1976) 2 NZTC 61,150; CIR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd; Whitworth Park Coal Co Ltd v IR Commrs \[1959\] 3 All ER 703. The following principles can be drawn from the case law on recognition of income on an accruals basis. 24 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • For an amount received to be income derived, the amount must be received beneficially and the recipient’s entitlement to the payment must not be received subject to any contingencies. It is necessary to consider whether the income- earning process is complete and whether, as a consequence of the provision of goods or services, a debt has been created, or whether the taxpayer is required to take further steps before becoming entitled to payment: Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT 14 ATD 98; Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685; FCT v Australian Gas Light Co Ltd 83 ATC 4800. • To the extent permitted by the legislation, accounting principles and practice are relevant to (but not determinative of) when income has been derived: Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT; Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR. • It is not relevant that the due date for payment has not arrived: Henderson v FCT 70 ATC 4016; Gasparin v FCT 94 ATC 4280. • When the taxpayer has an absolute entitlement to amounts received, the possibility that an obligation may arise in the future to refund all or part of the amount does not mean that the amounts are not income derived by the taxpayer: CIR v Mitsubishi Motors Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,107; Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062. 82. Accounting principles are relevant (although not determinative) in establishing when income is derived. In Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR the High Court noted that accounting principles required income to be recognised when: (a) the income earning process is complete; (b) the amount of income can be reasonably calculated; (c) there is a reasonable expectation that the supplier will be paid for the goods or services provided. 83. The earning process is complete when all events that determine the right to receive income have occurred: Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR. Emission units are earned under a project agreement by achieving a verified amount of emission reductions. Under clause 4.1, the participant must implement the project in accordance with the agreed specifications and the milestone dates specified in the agreement, including achieving completion of the final milestone by the specified date, and must operate the project so as to ensure that the project results in at least the emissions reductions specified in the project agreement during each year before the Commitment Period (and during the first Commitment Period): clauses 4.2 and 4.3. Participants are not entitled to receive a transfer of emission units unless it is verified that emission reductions have been achieved from the project. The participant must provide milestone and annual reports to enable the Crown to verify that the participant has complied with its obligations under the project agreement to implement the project and to operate the project so that it results in emission reductions: clause 7.2. The participant obtains a right to have the emission units transferred once the verification process is completed. 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 84. The project agreement specifies the method for determining the amount of emission reductions resulting from the project: clause 4.4. The method is tailored to each project. The Crown’s acceptance of the annual report in which emission reductions reported (or, if the Crown does not accept the annual report, the resolution of the amount of emission reductions achieved) establishes the amount of emission reductions resulting from the project in a particular year. This determines the number of emission units that the participant is entitled to receive in respect of the particular year. The number of emission units is calculated in accordance with the formula in the project agreement. Therefore, once the verification process has been completed, it is possible to determine the number of emission units to which the participant is entitled. 85. Clause 9 contemplates that it may be determined subsequently that the level of emission reductions resulting from a project and, therefore, the number of emission units that the participant was entitled to, varies from the amount accepted or resolved. However, the possibility that it may later be established that the number of emission units to which the participant is entitled varies from the number previously accepted or resolved, does not mean that the amount of income could not be determined. Income under a project agreement is determined in accordance with the method for determining the amount of emission reductions and the formula for calculating the number of emission units set out in the project agreement. 86. Given that the Crown is the other party to a project agreement and the Crown’s credit rating, it can also be reasonably expected that the participant will receive the emission units. 87. Therefore, income under a project agreement will be derived when the participant becomes entitled to receive emission units in each year of the term of the project agreement (that is, once the verification process has been completed and the amount of emission reductions achieved in a particular year has been determined). At that point, the Crown has an obligation to transfer to the participant the number of emission units calculated in accordance with the formula in clause 5.1. The possibility that an obligation may arise in the future to reimburse the Crown if it is subsequently ascertained that the level of emission reductions accepted by the Crown is incorrect, would not mean that the emission units would not be derived. Additional emission units 88. A participant is not entitled to additional emission units in respect of emission reductions achieved in any previous year, unless the Crown accepts that the participant is entitled to the additional emission units or it is resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions in the project agreement that the participant is entitled to the additional emission units. At the end of the year in which the participant provided emission reduction services, the participant is entitled to receive only the emission units then agreed in respect of that year. At that stage there is no “debt” owing to the participant in respect of additional emission units. See FCT v Squatting Investment Ltd 10 ATD 136; Ritchie v Trustees Executors and Agency Company Ltd 84 CLR 553; Bass Billiton Petroleum (Bass Strait) Pty Ltd v FCT 2002 ATC 5169. A participant becomes 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] entitled to receive additional emission units, if it is established that emission reductions above the previously accepted level were achieved in a previous year. The Commissioner considers that any additional emission units that a participant becomes entitled to receive will be derived in the year in which it is agreed or resolved that the participant is entitled to receive the additional emission units. At that point, the earning process will be complete and all conditions precedent to the participant’s entitlement to payment will be satisfied. 89. Therefore, any additional emission units that a participant becomes entitled to receive would be derived in the year in which it is established that the participant is entitled to receive the additional emission units. Refund of emission units 90. Participants who have received emission units and are subsequently required to transfer emission units back to the Crown or pay an amount of money to the Crown will incur expenditure. “Expenditure” need not be in the form of money: Oram v Johnson. It is possible to value the emission units for the purpose of determining the amount of the expenditure when emission units are refunded. 91. For expenditure to be deductible under section DA 1(1) there must be a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the income-earning process: CIR v Banks. In FCT v Smith 81 ATC 4144, the High Court of Australia made the following comments in respect of the equivalent of section DA 1 in the Australian legislation (at page 4117): The section does not require that the purpose of the expenditure shall be the gaining of the income of that year, so long as it was made in the given year and is incidental and relevant to the operations or activities regularly carried on for the production of income. What is incidental and relevant in the sense mentioned falls to be determined not by reference to the certainty or likelihood of the outgoing resulting in the generation of income but to its nature and character and generally to its connection with the operations which more directly gain or produce the assessable income. 92. To determine whether expenditure is deductible it is necessary to consider the scope of the business or other income-earning activity and the relationship between the expenditure and the business or income-earning activity. To earn emission units a participant must carry on an activity that results in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This requires the participant to change the way in which they carry on business (for example, by constructing and operating a wind farm or geothermal or bio- fuel projects (rather than using fossil fuels) or by using landfill gas to generate energy for sale or for use in the production of goods or services for sale). The provision of emission reduction services is part of the business carried on by participants. When the participant continues to carry on that business, the obligation to repay emission units arises out of and is closely related to the business carried on by the participant. In such circumstances the Commissioner considers that the repayment of emission units (or their cash equivalent) is incidental and relevant to the business carried on by participants. 27 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 93. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a deduction is allowable in respect of emission units repaid by a participant to the Crown. A deduction would be allowable in the year in which emission units are repaid or an equivalent amount in cash is paid to the Crown. Conclusion 94. Emission units are income from the participant’s business. Emission units are provided to the participant in return for their undertaking an ongoing activity resulting in reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The activities of participants under a project agreement are part of the business carried on by participants. The emission units are convertible into money, because participants can transfer the emission units and their value can be determined. Emission units are not a capital receipt. Emission units are not excluded income under section CX 47, because they are not transferred to participants in relation to expenditure incurred by the participant under a project agreement. 95. Amounts derived from the sale of emission units are income from the participant’s business, which includes the supply of services in return for emission units. 96. It is appropriate to attribute a cost equal to the market value of the emission units at the time of receipt in order to correctly calculate the income of participants. A deduction is allowable for an amount equal to the value of the emission units in the year in which the participant sells emission units received under the project agreement. 97. A project agreement is a financial arrangement. The consideration for services provided by a participant under a project agreement is an amount equal to the value of the emission units transferred by the Crown. As the values of the consideration provided and received by the participant under the project agreement are equal, the participant will not derive income or expenditure under the accrual rules. 98. Income under a project agreement is derived in each year of the term of the project agreement when the verification process has been completed and the amount of emission reductions resulting from the project is determined. Any additional emission units to which a participant becomes entitled in a subsequent year will be derived in the year in which it is determined that the participant is entitled to additional emission units. 99. If it is determined in a subsequent year that the participant is required to refund emission units to the Crown (or to pay a cash equivalent) and the participant continues to carry on a business involving the generation of energy for sale or for use in the production of goods or services for sale, in connection with which the project agreement was entered into, the participant is entitled to a deduction in respect of the emission units refunded (or the cash repaid) in the year in which the refund is made. Proposed amendments 28 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 100. The Climate Change Response Act 2002 has been amended to include emissions trading rules under which: • businesses in certain sectors will be required to calculate the emissions from their activities and to surrender one emission unit for each tonne of those emissions; and • the government may allocate “free” emission units to businesses in certain sectors. Amendments are proposed to the Income Tax Act to provide for the income tax treatment of emissions trading units. Such amendments are not intended to alter the existing income tax treatment of arrangements entered into outside the emissions trading scheme between the Crown and industry. Period of Ruling 101. Given the terms of section 91C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it is not possible to issue a ruling in respect of the Income Tax Act 2004 for the period before 1 April 2008. However, the Commissioner is of the view that the same principles and conclusions as set out in this ruling apply in respect of any income derived or expenditure incurred under a project agreement before 1 April 2008.
